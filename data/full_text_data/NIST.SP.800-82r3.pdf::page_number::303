NIST SP 800-82r3                                              Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

Rationale for adding SC-7 (18) to MOD baseline: The ability to choose the failure mode for the
physical part of the OT differentiates the OT from other IT systems. This choice may be a
significant influence in mitigating the impact of a failure.
Rationale for adding SC-7 (28) to LOW, MOD, and HIGH baselines: Access to OT should be
restricted to the individuals required for operation. A connection made from the OT directly to a
public network has limited applicability in OT environments but significant potential risk.
Rationale for adding SC-7 (29) to LOW, MOD, and HIGH baselines: In OT environments,
subnets and zoning are common practices for isolating functions.

No OT Discussion for this control.
Control Enhancement: (1) OT Discussion: When transmitting across untrusted network
segments, the organization explores all possible cryptographic integrity mechanisms (e.g., digital
signature, hash function) to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the information. Example
compensating controls include physical protections, such as a secure conduit (e.g., point-to-point
link) between two system components.

No OT Discussion for this control.
Rationale for removing SC-10 from MOD and HIGH baselines: The intent of this control is
effectively covered by AC-17 (9) for OT systems.
