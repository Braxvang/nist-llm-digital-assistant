organization’s installed operating systems and applications to assign a higher priority to log entries that
are related to these vulnerabilities.

5.2.3    Comparing System-Level and Infrastructure-Level Analysis

Analysis is typically very similar for system-level and infrastructure administrators. The main difference
is that for infrastructure administrators, log analysis is often a primary responsibility, whereas for system-
level administrators it is often a secondary responsibility, particularly if the infrastructure administrators
are reviewing the most important log entries from systems. In such an arrangement, infrastructure
administrators typically perform log analysis on an ongoing basis each day, and system-level
administrators perform periodic reviews (e.g., daily, weekly) commensurate with the criticality of each
system and its information. Also, infrastructure administrators might have access to more sophisticated
tools than system-level administrators do because it is cost-prohibitive to have them available for all
systems.

Regardless of how much analysis is performed at the infrastructure level, system-level administrators
usually need to perform analysis for the following types of entries:

      Entries that are of interest or importance at the system level but are not forwarded to the
       infrastructure because of their relative priority
      Entries for log sources that cannot automatically participate in the infrastructure (e.g., unusual
       proprietary formats, standalone systems, legacy systems, appliances)
      Entries that cannot be understood without context that is only available at the system level.
System-level administrators can usually perform their reviews and analysis using a variety of tools and
techniques. On some systems, particularly those with many log sources, it is effective to establish a local
log infrastructure and store the data from all of the system’s log sources there. On other systems,
especially for proprietary log formats, administrators might perform separate analysis of each log source
using format-specific log viewers, reduction tools, and other utilities. Another possibility is to export log
data to a database and perform queries on the database. Database queries can be an excellent way to filter
log data for analysis purposes.60 If most of the analysis process can be automated, it might be feasible to
create an analysis report each day and present it to the administrator for review. The administrator can
perform further investigation as needed of significant events identified by the report.

To perform effective reviews and analysis, system-level and infrastructure administrators should have
solid understanding of each of the following from training or hands-on experience:

      The organization’s policies regarding acceptable use, so that administrators can recognize
       violations of the policies
      The security software used by their hosts, including the types of security-related events that each
       program can detect and the general detection profile of each program (e.g., known false positives)
      The operating systems and major applications (e.g., e-mail, Web) used by their hosts, particularly
       each OS’s and major application’s security and logging capabilities and characteristics

     There can be serious performance problems with database queries, particularly if the database contains a large number of
     events, has a poorly-designed schema, or is not maintained well. The complexity of the query also has a major effect on the
     amount of time needed to execute a query. On some databases of log events, a single query could take many hours to run.
