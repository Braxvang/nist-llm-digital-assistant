                                GUIDE TO PROTECTING THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION (PII)



     assistants (PDA), which are generally higher-risk than non-portable devices (e.g., desktop computers
     at the organization‘s facilities).
 Providing Transmission Confidentiality. Organizations can protect the confidentiality of
  transmitted PII. This is most often accomplished by encrypting the communications or by encrypting
  the information before it is transmitted.
 Auditing Events. Organizations can monitor events that affect the confidentiality of PII, such as
  inappropriate access to PII.

Organizations should develop an incident response plan to handle breaches involving PII.
Breaches involving PII are hazardous to both individuals and organizations. Harm to individuals and
organizations can be contained and minimized through the development of effective incident response
plans for breaches involving PII. Organizations should develop plans12 that include elements such as
determining when and how individuals should be notified, how a breach should be reported, and whether
to provide remedial services, such as credit monitoring, to affected individuals.

Organizations should encourage close coordination among their chief privacy officers, senior
agency officials for privacy, chief information officers, chief information security officers, and legal
counsel13 when addressing issues related to PII.
Protecting the confidentiality of PII requires knowledge of information systems, information security,
privacy, and legal requirements. Decisions regarding the applicability of a particular law, regulation, or
other mandate should be made in consultation with an organization‘s legal counsel and privacy officer
because relevant laws, regulations, and other mandates are often complex and change over time.
Additionally, new policies often require the implementation of technical security controls to enforce the
policies. Close coordination of the relevant experts helps to prevent incidents that could result in the
compromise and misuse of PII by ensuring proper interpretation and implementation of requirements.
