CHAPTER THREE

THE PROCESS
Defining an ISCM Strategy and Implementing an ISCM Program




T      his chapter describes the process for developing an ISCM strategy and implementing an
       ISCM program including activities at the organization, mission/business process, and
       information systems tiers. A well-designed ISCM strategy encompasses security control
assessment, security status monitoring, and security status reporting in support of timely risk-
based decision making throughout the organization. It also incorporates processes to assure that
response actions are taken. An organization’s strategy for action based on the data collected is as
important (if not more important) than collecting the data. The process for developing an ISCM
strategy and implementing an ISCM program is as follows:

•   Define an ISCM strategy based on risk tolerance that maintains clear visibility into assets,
    awareness of vulnerabilities, up-to-date threat information, and mission/business impacts.
•   Establish an ISCM program determining metrics, status monitoring frequencies, control
    assessment frequencies, and an ISCM technical architecture.
•   Implement an ISCM program and collect the security-related information required for
    metrics, assessments, and reporting. Automate collection, analysis, and reporting of data
    where possible.
•   Analyze the data collected and Report findings, determining the appropriate response. It may
    be necessary to collect additional information to clarify or supplement existing monitoring
    data.
•   Respond to findings with technical, management, and operational mitigating activities or
    acceptance, transference/sharing, or avoidance/rejection.
•   Review and Update the monitoring program, adjusting the ISCM strategy and maturing
    measurement capabilities to increase visibility into assets and awareness of vulnerabilities,
    further enable data-driven control of the security of an organization’s information
    infrastructure, and increase organizational resilience.
This process is depicted below in Figure 3- 1.
