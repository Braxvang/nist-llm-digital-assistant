      NIST SP 800-63B-4 ipd                                             Digital Identity Guidelines
      December 2022                                      Authentication and Lifecycle Management


558   applications, and online services that these guidelines are used to protect. The CSP
559    SHALL ensure that the minimum assurance-related controls for the appropriate systems,
560   or equivalent, are satisfied.

561   4.2.5. Records Retention Policy
562   The CSP SHALL comply with its respective records retention policies in accordance
563   with applicable laws, regulations, and policies, including any NARA records retention
564   schedules that may apply. If the CSP opts to retain records in the absence of any
565   mandatory requirements, the CSP SHALL conduct a risk management process, including
566   assessments of privacy and security risks to determine how long records should be
567   retained and SHALL inform the subscriber of that retention policy.

568   4.3. Authentication Assurance Level 3
569   AAL3 provides very high confidence that the claimant controls authenticators bound
570   to the subscriber account. Authentication at AAL3 is based on proof of possession of
571   a key through a cryptographic protocol. AAL3 authentication SHALL use a hardware-
572   based authenticator and an authenticator that provides phishing resistance — the same
573   device MAY fulfill both these requirements. In order to authenticate at AAL3, claimants
574    SHALL prove possession and control of two distinct authentication factors through
575   secure authentication protocols. Approved cryptographic techniques are required.

576   4.3.1. Permitted Authenticator Types
577   AAL3 authentication SHALL occur by the use of one of a combination of authenticators
578   satisfying the requirements in Sec. 4.3. Possible combinations are:
579       • Multi-Factor Cryptographic Device (Sec. 5.1.9)
580       • Single-Factor Cryptographic Device (Sec. 5.1.7) used in conjunction with a
581         Memorized Secret (Sec. 5.1.1)
582       • Multi-Factor OTP device (software or hardware) (Sec. 5.1.5) used in conjunction
583         with a Single-Factor Cryptographic Device (Sec. 5.1.7)
584       • Multi-Factor OTP device (hardware only) (Sec. 5.1.5) used in conjunction with a
585         Single-Factor Cryptographic Software (Sec. 5.1.6)
586       • Single-Factor OTP device (hardware only) (Sec. 5.1.4) used in conjunction with a
587         Multi-Factor Cryptographic Software Authenticator (Sec. 5.1.8)

588   4.3.2. Authenticator and Veriﬁer Requirements
589   Communication between the claimant and verifier SHALL be via an authenticated
590   protected channel to provide confidentiality of the authenticator output and resistance
591   to AitM attacks. At least one cryptographic authenticator used at AAL3 SHALL
592   be phishing resistant as described in Sec. 5.2.5 and SHALL be replay resistant as
