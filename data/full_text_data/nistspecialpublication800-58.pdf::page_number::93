        Automated patch handling can assist in reducing the window of opportunity for
        intruders to exploit a known software vulnerability.

Account Lockout Vulnerability

       An attacker will be able to provide several incorrect login attempts at the telnet
       prompt until the account becomes locked out. (This problem is common to most
       password-protected systems, because it prevents attackers from repeating login
       attempts until the correct password is found by trying all possible combinations.)

        The account is unable to connect to the machine for the set lockout time. If
        remote access is not available, this problem can be solved with physical access
        control.
