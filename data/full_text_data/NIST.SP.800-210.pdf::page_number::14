                                                                                             The five essential characteristics that challenge AC system design are summarized as follows [2]:

                                                                                                1. Broad network access: Cloud services are available over the network and accessible

                                                                                                   platforms (e.g., mobile phones, tablets, laptops, workstations). This raises security
                                                                                                   concerns with regard to network access. For example, denial of service (DoS) attacks can
                                                                                                   be launched against a cloud system, rendering its resources unavailable to legitimate users.
                                                                                                   Thus, AC for network access should be managed.

                                                                                                   resource allocated to a consumer can be accessed by another co-located consumer or if the
                                                                                                   allocated resource, such as memory, is not wiped before being reallocated to another
