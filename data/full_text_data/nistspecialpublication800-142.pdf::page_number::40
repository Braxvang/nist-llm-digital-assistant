7 COMBINATORIAL AND RANDOM TESTING

     For testing to be most efficient and effective, we need an understanding of when a
particular test method is most appropriate. That is, what characteristics of a problem lead
us to use one form of testing over another, and what are the tradeoffs with respect to cost
and effectiveness? Some studies have compared the effectiveness of combinatorial and
random approaches to testing, but have reached conflicting results [3, 4, 56, 58]. This
chapter presents an analysis [37, 38] of these two methods and discusses how random
testing may complement combinatorial methods.

7.1   Coverage of Random Tests
    Because a significant percentage of failures can only be triggered by the interaction of
two or more variables, one consideration in comparing random and combinatorial testing is
the degree to which random testing covers particular t-way combinations. Table 10 gives
the percentage of t-way combinations covered by a randomly generated test set of the same
size as a t-way covering array, for various combinations of k = number of variables and v =
number of values per variable. Note that the coverage could vary with different
realizations of randomly generated test sets. That is, a different random number generator,
or even multiple runs of the same generator, may produce slightly different coverage
(perhaps a few tests out of thousands, depending on the problem). Figure 20 through
Figure 24 summarize the coverage for arrays with variables of 2 to 10 values. As seen in
the figures, the coverage provided by a random test suite versus a covering array of the
same size varies considerably with different configurations.

    Now consider the size of a random test set required to provide 100% combination
coverage. With the most efficient covering array algorithms, the difficulty of finding tests
with high coverage increases as tests are generated. Thus even if a randomly generated test
set provides better than 99% of the coverage of an equal sized covering array, it should not
be concluded that only a few more tests are needed for the random set to provide 100%
coverage. Table 11 gives the sizes of randomly generated test sets required for 100%
combinatorial coverage at various configurations, and the ratio of these sizes to covering
arrays computed with ACTS.            Although there is considerable variation among
configurations, note that the ratio of random to combinatorial test set size for 100%
coverage exceeds 3 in most cases, with average ratios of 3.9, 3.8, and 3.2 at t = 2, 3, and 4
respectively. Thus, combinatorial testing retains a significant advantage over random
testing if the goal is 100% combination coverage for a given value of t.
