Encryption often presents challenges for analysts. Users might encrypt individual files, folders, volumes,
or partitions so that others cannot access their contents without a decryption key or passphrase.51 The
encryption might be performed by the OS or a third-party program. Although it is relatively easy to
identify an encrypted file, it is usually not so easy to decrypt it. The analyst might be able to identify the
encryption method by examining the file header, identifying encryption programs installed on the system,
or finding encryption keys (which are often stored on other media). Once the encryption method is
known, the analyst can better determine the feasibility of decrypting the file. In many cases, it is not
possible to decrypt files because the encryption method is strong and the authentication (e.g., passphrase)
used to perform decryption is unavailable.

Although an analyst can detect the presence of encrypted data rather easily, the use of steganography is
more difficult to detect. Steganography, also known as steg, is the embedding of data within other data.
Digital watermarks and the hiding of words and information within images are examples of
steganography. Some techniques an analyst can use to locate stegged data include looking for multiple
versions of the same image, identifying the presence of grayscale images, searching metadata and
registries, using histograms, and using hash sets to search for known steganography software. Once
certain that stegged data exists, analysts might be able to extract the embedded data by determining what
software created the data and then finding the stego key, or by using brute force and cryptographic attacks
to determine a password.52 However, such efforts are often unsuccessful and can be extremely time-
consuming, particularly if the analyst does not find the presence of known steganography software on the
media being reviewed. In addition, some software programs can analyze files and estimate the
probability that the files were altered with steganography.

Analysts may also need to access non-stegged files that are protected by passwords. Passwords are often
stored on the same system as the files they protect, but in an encoded or encrypted format. Various
utilities are available that can crack passwords placed on individual files, as well as OS passwords. 53
Most cracking utilities can attempt to guess passwords, as well as performing brute force attempts that try
every possible password. The time needed for a brute force attack on an encoded or encrypted password
can vary greatly, depending on the type of encryption used and the sophistication of the password itself.
Another approach is to bypass a password. For example, an analyst could boot a system and disable its
screensaver password, or bypass a Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) password by pulling the BIOS

     Although volumes and partitions can be encrypted on some operating systems, this is not common due to corruption and
     other functional problems that may result in a complete loss of data if only a sector of data is corrupted. Encryption of
     individual files and folders is far more common, and is supported by many newer operating systems.

     Further discussion regarding steganography is outside the scope of this document. For more information, see the article An
     Overview of Steganography for the Computer Forensics Examiner by Gary Kessler, available at

     An example of an open source password cracking utility is John the Ripper, which supports multiple OSs and file types.
     Additional password cracking utilities are listed on several Web sites listed in Appendix F, including Computer Forensics
     Tools (http://www.forensix.org/tools/) and The Ultimate Collection of Forensic Software (TUCOFS)
