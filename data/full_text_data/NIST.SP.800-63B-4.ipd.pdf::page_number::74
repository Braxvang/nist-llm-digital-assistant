2090   implementation. It is important to conduct evaluations with representative users, realistic
2091   goals and tasks, and appropriate contexts of use.
2092   Guidelines and considerations are described from the users’ perspective.
2093   Accessibility differs from usability and is out of scope for this document. Section 508
2094   [Section508] was enacted to eliminate barriers in information technology and require
2095   federal government agencies to make their online public content accessible to people with
2096   disabilities. Refer to Section 508 law and standards for accessibility guidance.

2097   10.1. Usability Considerations Common to Authenticators
2098   When selecting and implementing an authentication system, consider usability across the
2099   entire lifecycle of the selected authenticators (e.g., typical use and intermittent events),
2100   while being mindful of the combination of users, their goals, and context of use.
2101   A single authenticator type usually does not suffice for the entire user population.
2102   Therefore, whenever possible — based on AAL requirements — CSPs should support
2103   alternative authenticator types and allow users to choose based on their needs. Task
2104   immediacy, perceived cost benefit tradeoffs, and unfamiliarity with certain authenticators
2105   often impact choice. Users tend to choose options that incur the least burden or cost at
2106   that moment. For example, if a task requires immediate access to an information system,
2107   a user may prefer to create a new subscriber account and password rather than select an
2108   authenticator requiring more steps. Alternatively, users may choose a federated identity
2109   option — approved at the appropriate AAL — if they already have a subscriber account
2110   with an identity provider. Users may understand some authenticators better than others,
2111   and have different levels of trust based on their understanding and experience.
2112   Positive user authentication experiences are integral to the success of an organization
2113   achieving desired business outcomes. Therefore, they should strive to consider
2114   authenticators from the users’ perspective. The overarching authentication usability goal
2115   is to minimize user burden and authentication friction (e.g., the number of times a user
2116   has to authenticate, the steps involved, and the amount of information they have to track).
2117   Single sign-on exemplifies one such minimization strategy.
2118   Usability considerations applicable to most authenticators are described below.
2119   Subsequent sections describe usability considerations specific to a particular
2120   authenticator.
2121   Usability considerations for typical usage of all authenticators include:
2122       • Provide information on the use and maintenance of the authenticator, e.g., what to
2123         do if the authenticator is lost or stolen, and instructions for use — especially if there
2124         are different requirements for first-time use or initialization.
