NIST SP 800-85A-4                                             PIV CARD APPLICATION & MIDDLEWARE
                                                                       INTERFACE TEST GUIDELINES

Administration Key are application security status indicators for the PIV Card Application,
whereas the security status indicator associated with the Global PIN is a global security status
indicator.

Required Vendor Information

VE01.16A-R4.01: The vendor shall specify in its documentation that the security status indicators
associated with the PIV Card Application PIN, the PIN Unblocking Key (PUK), OCC, pairing code,
and the PIV Card Application Administration Key are application security status indicators for the
PIV Card Application, whereas the security status indicator associated with the Global PIN is a
global security status indicator.

Required Test Procedures

TE01.16A-R4.01: The tester shall review the vendor’s documentation and validate that it contains
the requirement stated in VE01.16A-R4.01.

A.1.3.3     Authentication of an Individual

AS01.17: The pairing code shall be exactly 8 bytes in length and the PIV Card Application
PIN shall be between 6 and 8 bytes in length.

Note: This assertion is tested as part of AS05.22A.

AS01.18: If the actual length of PIV Card Application PIN is less than 8 bytes it shall be
padded to 8 bytes with 'FF' when presented to the card command interface. The 'FF' padding
bytes shall be appended to the actual value of the PIN.

Note: This assertion is tested as part of AS05.22A.

AS01.18A-R4: The bytes comprising the PIV Card Application PIN and pairing code shall be
limited to values 0x30 – 0x39, the ASCII values for the decimal digits '0' – '9'.

Note: This assertion is tested as part of AS05.22A.

AS01.18B-R4: The PIV Card Application shall enforce the minimum length requirement of
six bytes for the PIV Card Application PIN (i.e., shall verify that at least the first six bytes of
the value presented to the card command interface are in the range 0x30 – 0x39) as well as the
other formatting requirements specified in Section 2.4.3 of Part 2 of SP 800-73-4.

Note: This assertion is tested as part of AS05.22A.

AS01.18C-R4: The PUK shall be 8 bytes in length, and may be any 8-byte binary value. That
is, the bytes comprising the PUK may have any value 0x00 – 0xFF.

Note: This assertion is tested as part of AS05.22A.
