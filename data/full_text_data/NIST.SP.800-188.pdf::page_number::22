of de-identifying government data. While this document assumes a high-level understand-
ing of information system security technologies, it is intended to be accessible to a wide
audience.

1.3.   Organization
The remainder of this publication is organized as follows:
    • Section 2, “Organization,” presents a background on the science and terminology
      of de-identifcation.
    • Section 3, “Terminology,” provides guidance to agencies on the establishment of or
      improvement to a program that makes privacy-sensitive data available to researchers
      and the public.
    • Section 4, “Physical Enclaves,” provides specifc technical guidance for performing
      de-identifcation using a variety of mathematical approaches.
    • Section 5, “Re-Identifcation Studies,” provides a recommended set of features that
      should be in de-identifcation tools, which may be useful for potential purchasers or
      developers of such software. This section also provides information for evaluating
      both de-identifcation tools and de-identifed datasets.
    • Section 6, “Evaluating Data Accuracy,” presents the conclusion.
       Following the conclusion is a list of all publications referenced in this document, as
       well as an appendix that includes standards, related NIST publications, other selected
       publications by the U.S. and other governments, reports, books, and articles of inter-
       est. A second appendix provides a list of symbols, abbreviations, and acronyms. The
       third appendix contains a glossary.
