NIST SP 800-90A Rev. 1                                            Recommendation for Random Number
                                                                   Generation Using Deterministic RBGs


security “cushion”. This may be useful if the assessment of the entropy provided in the entropy
input is incorrect. Having more entropy than the assessed amount is acceptable; having less entropy
than the assessed amount could be fatal to security. The presence of more entropy than is required,
especially during the instantiation, will provide a higher level of assurance than the minimum
required entropy.
8.6.4      Seed Length

The minimum length of the seed depends on the DRBG mechanism and the security strength
required by the consuming application, but shall be at least the number of bits of entropy
required. See the tables in Section 10.

8.6.5      Randomness Source

A DRBG mechanism requires an approved randomness source during instantiation and
reseeding, including whenever prediction resistance is requested (see Section 8.8). This input is
requested using the Get_entropy_input function introduced in Section 9 and is specified in
more detail in [SP 800-90C].
An approved randomness source is an entropy source that conforms to [SP 800-90B], or an
RBG that conforms to [SP 800-90C] − either a DRBG or an NRBG.
8.6.6      Entropy Input and Seed Privacy

The entropy input and the resulting seed shall be handled in a manner that is consistent with the
security required for the data protected by the consuming application. For example, if the DRBG
is used to generate keys, then the entropy inputs and seeds used to generate the keys shall (at a
minimum) be protected at the same security strength as the keys.
The security of the DRBG depends on the secrecy of the entropy input. For this reason, the
entropy input shall be treated as a critical security parameter (CSP) during cryptographic module
validation. The entropy input for the DRBG function requiring the entropy input shall be
obtained either from within the cryptographic module containing that function or from another
cryptographic module and transported to the DRBG function's cryptographic module via a secure
channel.

8.6.7      Nonce

A nonce may be required in the construction of a seed during instantiation in order to provide a
security cushion to block certain attacks. The nonce shall be either:
   a. A value with at least (security_strength/2) bits of entropy, or
   b. A value that is expected to repeat no more often than a (security_strength/2)-bit random
      string would be expected to repeat.
Each nonce shall be unique to the cryptographic module in which instantiation is performed, but
need not be secret. When used, the nonce shall be considered to be a critical security parameter.
A nonce may be composed of one (or more) of the following components (other components
may also be appropriate):
