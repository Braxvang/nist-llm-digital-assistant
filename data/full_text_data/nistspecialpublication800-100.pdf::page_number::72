7.4 Metrics Program Implementation
   Information security metrics should be used for monitoring information security
control performance and initiating performance improvement actions. This iterative
process consists of six phases, depicted in Figure 7-2.




        Figure 7-2. Information Security Metrics Program Implementation Process

7.4.1   Prepare for Data Collection
    Phase 1 of the process, Prepare for Data Collection, involves activities that are
key for establishing a comprehensive information security metrics program. These
activities include the information security metrics identification, definition,
development, and selection activities, and developing a metrics program
implementation plan.
    After the metrics have been identified, specific implementation steps should be
defined on how to collect, analyze, and report the metrics. These steps should be
documented in the metrics program implementation plan. The following items may
be included in the plan:
   • Metrics roles and responsibilities, including responsibilities for data collection
     (both soliciting and submitting), analysis, and reporting;
   • An audience for the plan;
   • Process of metrics collection, analysis, and reporting that is tailored to the
     specific organizational structure, processes, policies, and procedures;
   • Details of coordination with the chief information officer (CIO), such as with risk
     assessment, security certification and accreditation, and FISMA reporting
     activities;
   • Details of coordination between the CIO and other functions within the agency,
     external to the CIO (e.g., Information Assurance (IA), if separate from the CIO;
     physical security; personnel security; and critical infrastructure protection
     [CIP]) to ensure that the metrics data collection is streamlined and
     nonintrusive;
   • Creation or selection of data collection and tracking tools;
