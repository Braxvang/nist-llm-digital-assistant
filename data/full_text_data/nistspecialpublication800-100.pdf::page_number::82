CHAPTER 8                                                         Security Planning


8.4.4 Compensating Controls
    Compensating security controls are the management, operational, or technical
controls used by an agency in lieu of prescribed controls in the low, moderate, or
high security control baselines, which provide equivalent or comparable protection
for an information system. Compensating security controls for an information system
will be used by an agency only under the following conditions: (1) the agency selects
the compensating controls from the security control catalog in NIST SP 800-53, (2)
the agency provides a complete and convincing rationale and justification for how the
compensating controls provide an equivalent security capability or level of protection
for the information system, and (3) the agency assesses and formally accepts the
risk associated with using the compensating controls in the information system. The
use of compensating security controls must be reviewed, documented in the system
security plan, and approved by the authorizing official for the information system.

8.4.5 Common Security Controls
    An agency-wide view of the information security program facilitates the
identification of common security controls that can be applied to one or more agency
information systems. Common security controls can apply to (1) all agency
information systems; (2) a group of information systems at a specific site
(sometimes associated with the term site certification/accreditation); or (3) common
information systems, subsystems, or applications (i.e., common hardware, software,
and/or firmware) deployed at multiple operational sites (sometimes associated with
the term type certification/accreditation). Common security controls—typically
identified during a collaborative agency-wide process that involves the CIO, SAISO,
authorizing officials, information system owners, and ISSOs (and by developmental
program managers in the case of common security controls for common hardware,
software, and/or firmware)—have the following properties:
   • The development, implementation, and assessment of common security
     controls can be assigned to responsible agency officials or organizational
     elements (other than the information system owners whose systems will
     implement or use those common security controls).
   • The results from the assessment of the common security controls can be used
     to support the security certification and accreditation processes of agency
     information systems where those controls have been applied.
   For efficiency in developing system security plans, common security controls
should be documented once and then inserted or imported into each system security
plan for the information systems within the agency. Effectively maximizing the
application of common controls in the system security planning process depends on
the following factors:

   • The agency has developed, documented, and communicated its specific
     guidance on identifying common security controls.
   • The agency has assigned the responsibility for coordinating common security
     control identification and review and obtaining consensus on the common
     control designations with a management official, such as the CIO or SAISO,
     with security program responsibilities.
   • System owners have been briefed on the system security planning process,
     including use of common controls.
