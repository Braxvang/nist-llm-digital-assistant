                                                                          Guideline for Identifying an Information
                                                                          System as a National Security System




3.2 National Security System Identification Checklist

The National Security System Identification Checklist provided in Appendix A includes
six questions. An affirmative answer to one or more of the six questions should result in
the system being designated as a national security system. The six questions included in
the checklist is only the minimum set of questions on which a national security
designation may be based. 3 Individual departments and agencies may choose to include
additional questions so long as the decision regarding designation of a system as a
national security system is based exclusively on the definition provided in Section 2.0 of
this guideline.

3.3 Dispute Resolution
In some cases, a system owner may disagree with a determination by an organization
supported by the system regarding whether the system is critical to the direct fulfillment
of military or intelligence missions. If the agency that owns and/or operates a system
disputes identification of the system as a national security system, either the agency or
the mission manager may submit the issue to both the CNSS and the appropriate office at
the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). OMB will coordinate with other
cognizant offices of the Executive Office of the President as required.

If there is a dispute regarding security classification of information processed by a
system, the dispute must be submitted to the appropriate internal challenge program4 for
resolution. If the dispute cannot be resolved under the internal challenge program, or if a
dispute involves more than one agency, the issue may be sub mitted to the Information
Security Oversight Office (ISOO) for resolution. The ISOO may be contacted at
Information Security Oversight Office, National Archives and Records Administration,
700 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Room 500, Washington, DC 20408. 5 Any remaining
issues may be submitted to the National Security Council.
