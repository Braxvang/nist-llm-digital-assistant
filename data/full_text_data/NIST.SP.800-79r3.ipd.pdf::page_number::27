      NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                 Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
      December 2023                                                        and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

803   assessment, SHOULD understand their roles in the process, and SHALL be made available in
804   accordance with the planned assessment schedule.
805   The EIMO SHALL ensure that all relevant documentation has been completed and organized
806   before the assessment begins. This documentation includes policies, procedures, organizational
807   structure, information system architecture, product and vendor details, and specifics regarding
808   the implementation of all of the requirements in [FIPS201] and related publications. If the issuer
809   has outsourced functions to an external service provider, all necessary documentation SHALL be
810   obtained from the provider regarding the outsourced operations. The EIMO SHALL review any
811   documentation to make certain that it is complete, current, and approved before providing it to
812   the assessment team.
813   Another significant activity during the assessment involves the assessment team observing the
814   actual processes performed by the issuer staff. In order for the assessment team to confirm that
815   processes are implemented in accordance with the operations plan, the issuer organization
816   SHALL ensure that assessment team members have access to facilities and are able to observe
817   PIV processes in real time. This could include scheduling activities to observe identity proofing,
818   adjudication, card/token production, activation/issuance, and maintenance processes.
819   Appendix C includes an issuer readiness review checklist to aid the issuer’s planning and
820   preparation for the assessment. Satisfying the list of items before the assessment commences will
821   facilitate efficient utilization of the assessment team’s time and contribute toward the overall
822   effectiveness of the assessment activity.

823   2.9.2. Assessment Team Duties
824   The independence of the assessment team is important for assessing the credibility of the
825   assessment results. In order to ensure that the results of the assessment are impartial and
826   unbiased, the members of the assessment team SHALL NOT be involved in the development,
827   day-to-day maintenance, or operations of the issuer or in the removal, correction, or remediation
828   of deficiencies.
829   The assessment team may obtain information during an assessment that the organization may not
830   want to publicly disclose. The assessment team is obligated to store and protect the
831   confidentiality of all security assessment-related records and information, including limiting
832   access to individuals who need to know the information. When using, storing, and transmitting
833   information related to the assessment, the assessment team shall follow any established
834   guidelines as agreed upon under the rules of engagement in addition to all relevant laws,
835   regulations, and standards regarding the need, protection, and privacy of information.

836           Authorization Decision
837   An authorization decision is a judgment made by the DAO to authorize the operation of an issuer
838   and its facilities. The DAO reviews the results of the assessment, considers the impacts of any
839   identified deficiencies on the organization, and decides whether to authorize the operation of the
840   issuer and its facilities. In doing so, the DAO agrees to accept the security and privacy risks (if
841   any) of issuing and maintaining PIV Cards or derived PIV credentials.
