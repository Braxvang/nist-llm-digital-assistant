Special Publication 800-79-2                             Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card Issuers
                                                                          and Derived PIV Credential Issuers



                 deficiencies that could lead to an eventual DATO may be identified and
                 remediated as soon as possible.

                 Subtask 3.3: Verify that the operations plan is acceptable.
                 Responsibility: DAO
                 Guidance: If the operations plan is deemed acceptable, the DAO should
                 authorize the authorization processes to advance to the next phase. Acceptance of
                 the operations plan signifies that the resources required to initiate and complete
                 the authorization activities may be deployed.

5.2 Assessment Phase

The Assessment Phase consists of two tasks— (i) issuer control assessment; and (ii) assessment
documentation. The purpose of this phase is to determine the extent to which the requirements of
FIPS 201-2 are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired
outcomes. This phase also specifies actions to be taken to correct all identified deficiencies. An
analysis of the impact of identified deficiencies that cannot be corrected or mitigated efficiently
on the reliable operation of the issuer should be conducted and documented. Successful
completion of this phase should provide the DAO with the information needed to make an
appropriate authorization decision.

        Task 4: Issuer Control Assessment
The objectives of this task are to— (i) initiate and conduct an assessment of the issuer controls;
and (ii) document the results of the assessment. The Assessor shall first verify the acceptability
of all documentation, including the operations plan and previous assessments, along with all
relevant Federal laws, regulations, standards, and directives. Issuer control assessment should
then commence. The Assessor should schedule interviews, schedule real-time observations of
issuance processes, and initiate all needed testing of the PIV Card, Derived PIV Credential and
relevant information system components. Once the Assessor has gathered the results of the
assessment procedures, descriptions of all discovered deficiencies shall be prepared, along with
recommendations for removing these deficiencies.

                 Subtask 4.1: Review the suggested and selected assessment methods for each
                 issuer control in preparation for the assessment.
                 Responsibility: Assessor
                 Guidance: Based on the authorization boundary, the scope of the assessment
                 should be established. The Assessor should review the selected assessment
                 procedures (based on the scope of the assessment) in order to plan and coordinate
                 activities for the assessment. For instance, if a particular issuer control requires
                 the observation of a particular process, the Assessor will need to schedule this
                 activity in a timely fashion after coordinating it with the issuing facility
                 management. The Assessor, as directed by the DAO, may supplement the
                 assessment methods and procedures recommended in these guidelines.
                 Assessment methods and procedures may be created or tailored for a particular
                 issuer.
