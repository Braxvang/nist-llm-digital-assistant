NIST SP 800-90A Rev. 1                                           Recommendation for Random Number
                                                                  Generation Using Deterministic RBGs


The following process or its equivalent shall be used as the reseed algorithm for this DRBG
mechanism (see reseed process step 6 of Section 9.2):
   CTR_DRBG_Reseed_algorithm (working_state, entropy_input, additional_input)
       1. working_state: The current values for V, Key and reseed_counter (see Section
          10.2.1.1).
       2. entropy_input: The string of bits obtained from the randomness source.
       3. additional_input: The additional input string received from the consuming
          application. Note that the length of the additional_input string may be zero.
   Output:
       1. new_working_state: The new values for V, Key, and reseed_counter.
   CTR_DRBG Reseed Process:
       1. seed_material = entropy_input || additional_input.
                                             Comment: Ensure that the length of the
                                             seed_material is exactly seedlen bits.
       2. seed_material = df (seed_material, seedlen).
       3. (Key, V) = CTR_DRBG_Update (seed_material, Key, V).
       4. reseed_counter = 1.
       5. Return (V, Key, reseed_counter).

10.2.1.5     Generating Pseudorandom Bits Using CTR_DRBG

Notes for the generate function specified in Section 9.3:
   The generation of pseudorandom bits using a CTR_DRBG instantiation requires a call to the
   Generate_function specified in Section 9.3. Process step 8 of that function calls the generate
   algorithm specified in this section. The values for max_number_of_bits_per_request and
   max_additional_input_length, and blocklen are provided in Table 3 of Section 10.2.1. If the
   derivation function is not used, then the maximum allowed length of additional_input =
   seedlen.
   For this DRBG mechanism, there are two cases for the processing. For each case, let
   CTR_DRBG_Update be the function specified in Section 10.2.1.2, and let Block_Encrypt
   be the function specified in Section 10.3.3. The seed length (seedlen) and the value of
   reseed_interval are provided in Table 3 of Section 10.2.1. The value of ctr_len is known by
   an implementation.

10.2.1.5.1     Generating Pseudorandom Bits When a Derivation Function is Not Used

This method of generating bits is used when a derivation function is not used by an
implementation.
The following process or its equivalent shall be used as the generate algorithm for this DRBG
mechanism (see step 8 of the generate process in Section 9.3.3):
