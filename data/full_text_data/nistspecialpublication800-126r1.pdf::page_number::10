                   The Technical Specification for the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.1



1.3     Audience

This document is intended for three primary audiences:

 Content authors and editors seeking guidance to ensure that the SCAP content they produce operates
  correctly, consistently, and reliably in SCAP products.
 Software developers and system integrators seeking to create, use, or exchange SCAP content in their
  products or service offerings.
 Product developers preparing for SCAP validation at an accredited independent testing laboratory.
This document assumes that readers already have general knowledge of SCAP and reasonable familiarity
with the SCAP component specifications that their content, products, or services use. Individuals without
this level of knowledge who would like to learn more about SCAP should consult NIST Special
Publication (SP) 800-117, Guide to Adopting and Using the Security Content Automation Protocol.7

1.4     Document Structure

The remainder of this document is organized into the following major sections and appendices:

 Section 2 provides the high-level requirements for claiming conformance with the SCAP 1.1
  specification.
 Section 3 details the requirements and recommendations for SCAP content syntax, structures, and
  development.
 Section 4 defines SCAP content processing requirements and recommendations.
 Section 5 provides additional requirements for selected common types of SCAP content.
 Appendix A contains an acronym and abbreviation list.
 Appendix B lists references and other resources related to SCAP 1.1.

1.5     Document Conventions

Some of the requirements and conventions used in this document reference eXtensible Markup Language
(XML) content. These references come in two forms, inline and indented. An example of an inline
reference is
A <cpe_dict:cpe-item> may contain <cpe_dict:check> elements that reference OVAL
Definitions.
In this example the notation <cpe_dict:cpe-item> can be replaced by the more verbose equivalent
―the XML element whose qualified name is cpe_dict:cpe-item‖. An even more verbose equivalent
is ―the XML element in the namespace ‗http://cpe.mitre.org/dictionary/2.0‘ whose local name is cpe-
item‖.
