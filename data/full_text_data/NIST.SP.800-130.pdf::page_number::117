                        A physical or logical entity that receives and transmits data
                        packets or establishes logical connections among a diverse set of
Router
                        communicating entities (usually supports both hardwired and
                        wireless communication devices simultaneously).
                        The ability of a system to handle a growing amount of work in a
Scalability             capable manner or its ability to be enlarged to accommodate that
                        growth.
                        An unambiguous specification of a set of transformations that is
                        capable of providing a (cryptographic) service when properly
Scheme                  implemented and maintained. A scheme is a higher-level
                        construct than a primitive and a lower level construct than a
                        protocol.
                        A group of organizations (e.g., Federal agencies, private
Sector                  organizations, international consortia) that have common goals,
                        standards, and requirements for a product, system, or service.
                        A collection of entities, including their CKMS, in which each
Security Domain         CKMS operates under the same security policy âˆ’ known as the
                        Domain Security Policy.
                        The rules and requirements established by an organization that
                        governs the acceptable use of its information and services, and
Security Policy
                        the level and means for protecting the confidentiality, integrity,
                        and availability of its information.
                        A number associated with the amount of work (that is, the base 2
Security Strength       logarithm of the minimum number of operations) that is required
                        to cryptanalyze a cryptographic algorithm or system.
Semantics               The intended meaning of acceptable sentences of a language.
                        Something established by authority, custom, or general consent
Standard
                        as a model or example.
Store                   To move a key and/or metadata into a medium from which the
(key and/or metadata)   key and/or metadata may be recovered.
                        The key lifecycle state used to temporarily remove a previously
Suspended State         active key from that status, but making provisions for later
                        returning the key to active status, if appropriate.
Syntax                  The rules for constructing acceptable sentences of a language.
                        A characteristic of an entity that indicates its ability to perform
Trust                   certain functions or services correctly, fairly, and impartially,
                        along with assurance that the entity and its identifier are genuine.
