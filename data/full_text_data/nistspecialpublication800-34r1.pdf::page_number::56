                                                           CONTINGENCY PLANNING GUIDE FOR FEDERAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS



           Offsite Data Storage. 35 If offsite data storage is used, procedures should be documented for
            returning retrieved backup or installation media to its offsite data storage location.

           Data Backup. As soon as reasonable following reconstitution, the system should be fully backed
            up and a new copy of the current operational system stored for future recovery efforts. This full
            backup should be stored with other system backups and comply with applicable security controls.

           Event Documentation. All recovery and reconstitution events should be well documented,
            including actions taken and problems encountered during the recovery and reconstitution efforts.
            An after-action report with lessons learned should be documented and included for updating the
            ISCP.

Once all activities and steps have been completed and documentation has been updated, the ISCP can be
formally deactivated. An announcement with the declaration should be sent to all business and technical
contacts.

4.5          Plan Appendices

Contingency plan appendices provide key details not contained in the main body of the plan. Common
contingency plan appendices include the following:

           Contact information for contingency planning team personnel;
           Vendor contact information, including offsite storage and alternate site POCs;
           BIA;
           Detailed recovery procedures and checklists;
           Detailed validation testing procedures and checklists;
           Equipment and system requirements lists of the hardware, software, firmware, and other
            resources required to support system operations. Details should be provided for each entry,
            including model or version number, specifications, and quantity;
           Alternate mission/business processing procedures that may occur while recovery efforts are being
            done to the system;
           ISCP testing and maintenance procedures;
           System interconnections (systems that directly interconnect or exchange information); and
           Vendor SLAs, reciprocal agreements with other organizations, and other vital records.

     According to NIST SP 800-53 Contingency Plan security controls, a low-impact system is not required to have offsite data
     storage capabilities.
