NIST SP 800-58                                             Voice Over IP Security
    _________________________________________________________________________

       traffic over a single network causes congestion and sending this traffic over the
       Internet can cause a significant delay in the delivery of speech. Also, bandwidth
       usage is related to digitization of voice by codecs, circuits or software processes
       that code and decode data for transmission. That is, producing greater bandwidth
       savings may slow down encoding and transmission processes. Speed and voice
       quality improvements are being made as VOIP networks and phones are deployed
       in greater numbers, and many organizations that have recently switched to a
       VOIP scheme have noticed no significant degradation in speed or quality.

 2.5   Privacy and Legal Issues with VOIP

       Although legal issues regarding VOIP are beyond the scope of this document,
       readers should be aware that laws and rulings governing interception or
       monitoring of VOIP lines may be different from those for conventional telephone
       systems. Privacy issues, including the security of call detail records (CDR) are
       addressed primarily by the Privacy Act of 1974. In addition, agencies may need
       to consider the Office of Management and Budget's "Guidance on the Privacy Act
       Implications of Call Detail Programs to Manage Employees' Use of the
       Government's Telecommunication System" (See FEDERAL REGISTER, 52 FR
       12990, April 20, 1987). Because of these guidelines, many federal agencies have
       Privacy Act System of Record notices for the telephone CDR or usage records.
       CDR data may be used to reconcile the billing of services and for possible
       detection of waste, fraud, and abuse of government resources. In addition, NARA
       General Records Schedule 12, requires a 36-month retention of telephone CDR
       records (see http://www.archives.gov/records_management/ardor/grs12.html).
       VOIP systems may produce different types (and a higher volume) of CDR data
       than conventional telephone systems, so agencies must determine retention
       requirements for these records. Agencies should review any questions regarding
       privacy and statutory concerns with their legal advisors.


 2.6   VOIP Security Issues

       With the introduction of VOIP, the need for security is compounded because now
       we must protect two invaluable assets, our data and our voice. Federal
       government agencies are required by law to protect a great deal of information,
       even if it is unclassified. Both privacy-sensitive and financial data must be
       protected, as well as other government information that is categorized as sensitive
       but unclassified. Protecting the security of conversations is thus required. In a
       conventional office telephone system, security is a more valid assumption.
       Intercepting conversations requires physical access to telephone lines or
       compromise of the office private branch exchange (PBX). Only particularly
       security-sensitive organizations bother to encrypt voice traffic over traditional
       telephone lines. The same cannot be said for Internet-based connections. For
       example, when ordering merchandise over the phone, most people will read their
       credit card number to the person on the other end. The numbers are transmitted
       without encryption to the seller. In contrast, the risk of sending unencrypted data


                                                                                        17
