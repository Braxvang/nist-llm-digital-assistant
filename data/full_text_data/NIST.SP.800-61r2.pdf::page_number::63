organization has already incurred widespread infections before antivirus signatures become available
several hours after the worm started to spread.
The following are additional questions for this scenario:
    1. How would the incident response team identify all infected hosts?
    2. How would the organization attempt to prevent the worm from entering the organization before
       antivirus signatures were released?
    3. How would the organization attempt to prevent the worm from being spread by infected hosts
       before antivirus signatures were released?
    4. Would the organization attempt to patch all vulnerable machines? If so, how would this be done?
    5. How would the handling of this incident change if infected hosts that had received the DDoS
       agent had been configured to attack another organization’s website the next morning?
    6. How would the handling of this incident change if one or more of the infected hosts contained
       sensitive personally identifiable information regarding the organization’s employees?
    7. How would the incident response team keep the organization’s users informed about the status of
       the incident?
    8. What additional measures would the team perform for hosts that are not currently connected to
       the network (e.g., staff members on vacation, offsite employees who connect occasionally)?

Scenario 3: Stolen Documents
On a Monday morning, the organization’s legal department receives a call from the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) regarding some suspicious activity involving the organization’s systems. Later that
day, an FBI agent meets with members of management and the legal department to discuss the activity.
The FBI has been investigating activity involving public posting of sensitive government documents, and
some of the documents reportedly belong to the organization. The agent asks for the organization’s
assistance, and management asks for the incident response team’s assistance in acquiring the necessary
evidence to determine if these documents are legitimate or not and how they might have been leaked.
The following are additional questions for this scenario:
    1. From what sources might the incident response team gather evidence?
    2. What would the team do to keep the investigation confidential?
    3. How would the handling of this incident change if the team identified an internal host responsible
       for the leaks?
    4. How would the handling of this incident change if the team found a rootkit installed on the
       internal host responsible for the leaks?

Scenario 4: Compromised Database Server
On a Tuesday night, a database administrator performs some off-hours maintenance on several production
database servers. The administrator notices some unfamiliar and unusual directory names on one of the
servers. After reviewing the directory listings and viewing some of the files, the administrator concludes
that the server has been attacked and calls the incident response team for assistance. The team’s
investigation determines that the attacker successfully gained root access to the server six weeks ago.
The following are additional questions for this scenario:
    1. What sources might the team use to determine when the compromise had occurred?
