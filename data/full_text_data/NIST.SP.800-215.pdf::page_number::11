   Introduction
The enterprise network landscape has undergone a significant transformation in the last decade.
The drivers for this transformation are (a) enterprise access to multiple cloud services, (b) the
geographic spread of enterprise-owned (on-premises) IT resources (e.g., in headquarters,
multiple branch offices, and data centers), and (c) changes to application architecture from being
monolithic to a set of loosely coupled microservices – often with a dedicated infrastructure
(called the service mesh) that provides all application services, including security. The high-level
impacts of these drivers on the security of the current enterprise network landscape are (a) the
disappearance of the concept of a perimeter associated with the enterprise network; (b) an
increase in attack surface due to the sheer multiplicity of IT resource components associated with
computing, storage, and network appliances; and (c) the escalation of attacks across several
network boundaries leveraging connectivity features. Before providing guidance for secure
operations in this new network landscape, this document will consider the structural and security
implications of the drivers to enhance understanding of its components and data flows.

       Structural Implications of Drivers on the Enterprise Network Landscape
In order to have a good structural view of the current enterprise network landscape, it is
necessary to look at the current enterprise IT environment in general. The IT environment now
consists of:
   •   Subscription to multiple cloud services, such as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) for
       computing, Software as a Service (SaaS) for applications, Platform as a Service (PaaS)
       for an application development platform, and other cloud services (e.g., identity as a
       service [IDaaS] for authentication)
   •   Enterprise IT applications (on-premises) that are located at corporate headquarters and
       geographically distributed branch offices and data centers
   •   IT applications that range from being monolithic to being made up of loosely coupled
       microservices, each hosted on heterogeneous platforms
   •   Presence of edge computing devices, including the Internet of Things (IoT), in some
       environments
The above scenarios call for widespread connectivity between IT systems that now defines the
current enterprise network landscape. Connectivity, in turn, involves:
   •   Connectivity between IT resources (e.g., servers for computing and storage) in data
       centers (network fabric)
   •   Connectivity between IT resources within a corporate office or branch office (e.g.,
       Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi), Local Area Network - LAN, and Virtual Local Area Network -
       VLAN)
   •   Connectivity for users to remotely access IT resources from home, travel locations,
       branch offices, and corporate offices using wide area networks (WANs), which use
       multiple networks such as the internet, Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), and – in
       some instances – cellular networks (e.g., 4G/LTE, 5G).
