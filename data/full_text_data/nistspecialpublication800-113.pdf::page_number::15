    protect connections with multiple links, such as establishing a VPN over the Internet. An Internet-
    based connection is typically composed of several physical links chained together; protecting such a
    connection with data link layer controls would require deploying a separate control to each link,
    which is not feasible. Data link layer protocols have been used for many years primarily to provide
    additional protection for specific physical links that should not be trusted.
Because they can provide protection for many applications at once without modifying them, network
layer security controls have been used frequently for securing communications, particularly over shared
networks such as the Internet. Network layer security controls provide a single solution for protecting
data from all applications, as well as protecting IP information. Nevertheless, in many cases, controls at
another layer are better suited to providing protection than network layer controls. For example, if only
one or two applications need protection, a network layer control may be excessive. Transport layer
protocols such as SSL are most commonly used to provide security for communications with individual
HTTP-based applications, although they are also used to provide protection for communication sessions
of other types of applications such as SMTP, Point of Presence (POP), Internet Message Access Protocol
(IMAP), and File Transfer Protocol (FTP). Because all major Web browsers include support for TLS,
users who wish to use Web-based applications that are protected by TLS normally do not need to install
any client software or reconfigure their systems. Newer applications of transport layer security protocols
protect both HTTP and non-HTTP application communications, including client/server applications and
other network traffic. Controls at each layer offer advantages and features that controls at other layers do
not. Section 3 contains detailed information on transport layer security controls. Information on data
link, network, and application layer alternatives to transport layer controls is provided in Section 6.

IPsec 4 has emerged as the most commonly used network layer security control for protecting
communications, while SSL is the most commonly used transport layer security control. Depending on
how IPsec and SSL are implemented and configured, both can provide any combination of the following
types of protection:

 Confidentiality. IPsec and SSL can ensure that data cannot be read by unauthorized parties. This is
  accomplished by encrypting data using a cryptographic algorithm and a secret key—a value known
  only to the two parties exchanging data. The data can only be decrypted by someone who has the
  secret key.
 Integrity. IPsec and SSL can determine if data has been changed (intentionally or unintentionally)
  during transit. The integrity of data can be assured by generating a message authentication code
  (MAC) value, which is a keyed cryptographic checksum of the data. If the data is altered and the
  MAC is recalculated, the old and new MACs will differ.
 Peer Authentication. Each IPsec endpoint confirms the identity of the other IPsec endpoint with
  which it wishes to communicate, ensuring that the network traffic and data is being sent from the
  expected host. SSL authentication is typically performed one-way, authenticating the server to the
  client; however, SSL VPNs require authentication for both endpoints.
 Replay Protection. The same data is not delivered multiple times, and data is not delivered grossly
  out of order.
 Traffic Analysis Protection. A person monitoring network traffic cannot determine the contents of
  the network traffic or how much data is being exchanged. IPsec can also conceal which parties are
  communicating, whereas SSL leaves this information exposed. Frequency of communication may
