of authentication strength for each of the use cases is often
based on: (a) the total number of three common orthogonal
authentication factors – What You Know, What You Have and
What You are, and (b) the entropy associated with each factor
chosen. The objective of this paper is to analyze the limitation
of this approach and present a methodology for assigning
authentication strengths based on the strength of pair wise
bindings between the five entities involved in smart card
based authentications – the card (token), the token secret,
the card holder, the card issuer, and the person identifier
stored in the card. The rationale for the methodology is based
on the following three observations: (a) The form factor of
the smart identity token introduces some threats of misuse;
(b) the common set of credentials objects provisioned to a
smart card embody bindings to address those threats and (c)
the strength of an authentication use case should therefore
be based on the number and type of binding verifications
that are performed in the constituent authentication
mechanisms. The use of the methodology for developing
an authentication assurance level taxonomy for two real
world smart identity token deployments is also illustrated.
