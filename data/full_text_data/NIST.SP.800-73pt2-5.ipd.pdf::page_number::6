 84   Call for Patent Claims
 85   This public review includes a call for information on essential patent claims (claims whose use
 86   would be required for compliance with the guidance or requirements in this Information
 87   Technology Laboratory (ITL) draft publication). Such guidance and/or requirements may be
 88   directly stated in this ITL Publication or by reference to another publication. This call also
 89   includes disclosure, where known, of the existence of pending U.S. or foreign patent applications
 90   relating to this ITL draft publication and of any relevant unexpired U.S. or foreign patents.
 91   ITL may require from the patent holder, or a party authorized to make assurances on its behalf,
 92   in written or electronic form, either:
 93       a) assurance in the form of a general disclaimer to the effect that such party does not hold
 94          and does not currently intend holding any essential patent claim(s); or
 95       b) assurance that a license to such essential patent claim(s) will be made available to
 96          applicants desiring to utilize the license for the purpose of complying with the guidance
 97          or requirements in this ITL draft publication either:
 98              i.    under reasonable terms and conditions that are demonstrably free of any unfair
 99                    discrimination; or
100             ii.    without compensation and under reasonable terms and conditions that are
101                    demonstrably free of any unfair discrimination.
102   Such assurance shall indicate that the patent holder (or third party authorized to make assurances
103   on its behalf) will include in any documents transferring ownership of patents subject to the
104   assurance, provisions sufficient to ensure that the commitments in the assurance are binding on
105   the transferee, and that the transferee will similarly include appropriate provisions in the event of
106   future transfers with the goal of binding each successor-in-interest.
107   The assurance shall also indicate that it is intended to be binding on successors-in-interest
108   regardless of whether such provisions are included in the relevant transfer documents.
109   Such statements should be addressed to: piv_comments@nist.gov
