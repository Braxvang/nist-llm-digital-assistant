compromise involves the virtualization software itself. Another benefit is that every time an image is
restarted, it can be reloaded from the known-good image, ensuring that any compromises occurring within
the image are eradicated.

An alternative strategy, more usable but less secure, is to use a guest OS for more risky behavior (such as
general web browsing) and the host OS for corporate applications. This helps to isolate the riskier
activities from the other activities on the host. The host OS can be restricted to only whitelisted
applications (see Section 3.4.5) to prevent unauthorized applications from being run within it.
