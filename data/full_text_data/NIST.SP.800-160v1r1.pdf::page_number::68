configuration item
Item or aggregation of hardware, software, or both that is designated for configuration management and treated as a
single entity in the configuration management process. [4]

consequence
Effect (change or non-change), usually associated with an event or condition or with the system and usually allowed,
facilitated, caused, prevented, changed, or contributed to by the event, condition, or system. [61]

constraints
Limitation on the system, its design, its implementation, or the process used to develop or modify a system.
Limitation that restricts the design solution, implementation, or execution of the system. [31]
         Note: A constraint is a factor that is imposed on the solution by force or compulsion and may limit or
         modify the design.

control
Purposeful action on or within a process to meet specified objectives.
The mechanism that achieves the action.

criticality
Degree of impact that a requirement, module, error, fault, failure, or other item has on the development or operation
of a system.

customer
Organization or person that receives a product. [78]

cyber-physical system
A system integrating computation with physical processes whose behavior is deÔ¨Åned by both the computational
(digital and other forms) and the physical parts of the system. [27]

data
Representation of facts, concepts, or instructions in a manner suitable for communication, interpretation, or
processing by humans or by automatic means.
Collection of values assigned to base measures, derived measures, and/or indicators. [79]

derived requirement
A requirement deduced or inferred from the collection and organization of requirements into a particular system
configuration and solution. [31]
         Note 1: The next higher-level requirement is referred to as a parent requirement, while the derived
         requirement from this parent is called a child requirement.
         Note 2: A derived requirement is typically identified during the elicitation of stakeholder requirements,
         requirements analysis, trade studies or validation.

design
Process to define the architecture, system elements, interfaces, and other characteristics of a system or system
element. [24]
Result of the process to be consistent with the selected architecture, system elements, interfaces, and other
characteristics of a system or system element. [4]
         Note 1: Information, including the specification of system elements and their relationships, which is
         sufficiently complete to support a compliant implementation of the architecture.
         Note 2: Design provides the detailed implementation-level physical structure, behavior, temporal
         relationships, and other attributes of system elements.
