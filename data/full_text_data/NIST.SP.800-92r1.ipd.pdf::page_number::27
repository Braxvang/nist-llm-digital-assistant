      NIST SP 800-92r1 ipd                                                    Cybersecurity Log Management
      October 2023                                                                           Planning Guide

697      PMG, Develop a Plan to Mitigate the Gaps
698   [Tasks]                                                                [Previous Play] [Next Play]
699   Summary: Develop a plan for addressing the root causes of the identified gaps in order to reach
700   the target state. The project plan takes the relative importance of each gap, the resources needed
701   to address each root cause, and the dependencies among items (e.g., expanding centralized log
702   storage capacity before significantly increasing the volume of logs being sent to that storage) into
703   account. The desired outcome is a project plan that, when executed, has addressed the root
704   causes and filled the identified gaps.
705   Tasks to perform include the following (with the first two not necessarily in order):
706      1. PMG-1, Draft the Plan
707      2. PMG-2, Revise Affected Policies
708      3. PMG-3, Address Feedback on Draft Plan and Policies

709             PMG-1, Draft the Plan
710   [Tasks]                                                                [Previous Play] [Next Play]
711   Summary: Draft the plan for addressing the root causes of identified gaps. The desired outcome
712   is a project plan draft that is ready for stakeholder review and feedback.
713   Tasks to perform include the following (not necessarily in order):
714      1. PMG-1.1: Identify any changes to logging-related inventories (e.g., log source types,
715         infrastructure, use cases, requirements, and work roles).
716      2. PMG-1.2: Develop cost estimates for the resources needed to address the gaps for
717         people, processes, and technology, including both one-time and ongoing costs. This may
718         include adding tools and technologies to automate aspects of log management, adjusting
719         technical configuration baselines and guidance, updating affected procedures and
720         processes, retraining staff with log management-related responsibilities, and establishing
721         a logging test environment.
722      3. PMG-1.3: Include provisions in the plan for creating a plan of action and milestones and
723         using compensating controls until gaps are remediated.
724      4. PMG-1.4: Incorporate the timing of other projects that may affect logging (e.g., the
725         pending replacement of a major enterprise application).
726      5. PMG-1.5: Include information on how often the plan itself will be reviewed and updated,
727         such as a scheduled annual review, audit results that indicate a significant problem, the
728         announcement of new legal or regulatory requirements, and feedback from logging
729         infrastructure and system administrators on logging requirements.
730      6. PMG-1.6: Ensure that all elements of the plan are harmonized.
