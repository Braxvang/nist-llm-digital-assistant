                                    ESTABLISHING WIRELESS ROBUST SECURITY NETWORKS: A GUIDE TO IEEE 802.11I



9.3.2   Phase 2: Acquisition/Development

Based on the IT service contractor’s initial analysis, the Associate CIO awarded a task to design the
WLAN solution, which focuses on the development portion of the acquisition/development phase of the
information system development life cycle. The initial planning had indicated that RSN technology could
be useful in the commission offices and the administrative law courts, but was unnecessary in the Public
Information Resources Center. The design would need to provide different levels of access to the
commission’s employees, who for the most part needed full access, and the external parties participating
in court proceedings, who needed only limited access.

While the solution could accommodate this differentiation using identity management and authorization
software only, the architects felt additional network controls would be required to provide a high level of
assurance that the system would not be used improperly. Data traffic in the hearing rooms would be
segregated from the main office network using a separate ESS with the SSIDs GRC-COURT and GRC-
OFFICE. GRC-COURT would support non-employees with GRC business, such as the attorneys
participating in GRC hearings. GRC-OFFICE would support employees and have access to both the
office network and the hearing room information resources. The APs in the commission offices would
support GRC-OFFICE only. The APs in the hearing rooms would support both GRC-COURT and GRC-
OFFICE. Both GRC-COURT and GRC-OFFICE would use the same backend cluster of AAA servers
for authentication. The system would be designed to work with any WPA2-certified client, but the
hearing room would also have a spare open Ethernet connection for the occasional visitor that still
encountered interoperability issues.

The commission already had an enterprise PKI. The badges that both employees and non-employees
carried to enter the building could hold PKI certificates that could be used for authentication. Certificate
readers were already provided to all employees and could be provided to hearing room visitors on an as-
needed basis. With a robust PKI already in place, EAP-TLS authentication was a good choice. Using the
PKI to support the WLAN required some changes to the commission’s certificate policy and certification
practice statement, but these were relatively minor (primarily involving adding WLAN components to the
list of acceptable users of the PKI) and were implemented quickly.

The ESS supporting the Public Information Resource Center would have the SSID GRC-PUBLIC. Its
APs would be on a VLAN outside of GRC’s firewall, which would block all inbound access except
requests to its electronic docket and library holdings database. The design also called for limiting the
network throughput on each WLAN connection to 256 kilobits per second, which would allow
individuals to perform external research but prevent them from dominating the Internet connection so that
others would not be able to use it. This requirement was met using a proprietary quality of service feature
available on the enterprise APs that the bureau procured for this project. The ability to support this
limitation was added to the AP procurement requirements list to ensure that it could be implemented in
the final solution.

Figure 9-5 illustrates the design for the GRC WLAN infrastructure.
