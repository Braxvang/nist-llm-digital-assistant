3.5.3.1 SAML Assertions

The SAML specification defines a framework for creating and exchanging generic assertions with given
validity periods, signatures, encrypted elements and unique identifiers (among other attributes).
Assertions are associated with a given subject (a named entity). When using SAML, there are two
parties: the relying party and the asserting party. The asserting party asserts information about a
particular subject, such as whether or not a user has been authenticated or has a particular attribute. The
relying party uses the information supplied by the asserting party to make decisions, including, but not
limited to, whether or not to trust the asserting party's assertion. By trusting the asserting partyâ€™s
information, the relying party can provide services without requiring the principal to authenticate again.

SAML assertions contain a number of required elements (except where otherwise noted):

 ID. Uniquely identifies this assertion
 IssueInstant. Timestamp indicating when the SAML assertion was created
 Issuer. Information about the entity that created the assertion
 Signature. Digital signature of the SAML assertion (optional)
 Subject. Information about the entity to which this assertion applies (optional)
 Conditions. Information used to determine the validity of the assertion, such as a validity period
  (optional)
 Advice. Information that may be useful in processing the assertion (optional)
 Statements. SAML statements can provide information about subject authentication, authorization
  decision or attributes. Additional types of statements can be defined by an extension. (optional)
Figure 3-8 shows a SAML assertion containing a single authentication statement. This assertion indicates
that John Doe was authenticated on January 15, 2007 at 14:15:07 UTC via X.509 certificate and that this
assertion is valid for one hour from the initial time of authentication.
