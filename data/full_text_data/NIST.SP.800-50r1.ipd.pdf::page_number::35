      NIST SP 800-50r1 ipd                                                        Building a Cybersecurity and
      August 2023                                                                   Privacy Learning Program

932   When the average person thinks of a CPLP, they likely think of the annual training event
933   delivered to All Users. These might be informal department programs, an all-hands presentation
934   delivered in an auditorium, or an online course. Other learning program elements are targeted for
935   those with significant cybersecurity responsibilities, including privileged account holders. A
936   CPLP program will consist of the mandatory elements (required by policy and learning
937   objectives for all CPLP learning participants) and the many other activities implemented
938   throughout the life cycle to reinforce these messages.
939
940   The learning goals for these events are to ensure that personnel are aware of their roles and
941   responsibilities for protecting assets and are able to take appropriate action against a variety of
942   cybersecurity and privacy risks.

943   2.7.1. Awareness Activities
944   Cybersecurity and privacy awareness learning activities are implemented throughout the year to
945   remind users about a wide variety of risks. Awareness activities should be conducted on an
946   ongoing basis to ensure that employees are aware of their roles within the organization and the
947   appropriate steps they must take for the protection of information, assets and individuals’
948   privacy. Activities can be campaign-oriented or ad hoc based on the subject matter, threats, or
949   vulnerabilities or during seasonal events.
950   Examples of awareness activities that are appropriate for All Users include:
951      •   Learning program messages on logon screens, organization screen savers, and email
952          signature blocks
953      •   Employee newsletters with cybersecurity and privacy articles
954      •   Posters (physical or digital) with cybersecurity and privacy tips
955      •   A Cybersecurity Awareness Month or Privacy Week activity fair
956      •   Cybersecurity and privacy reminders and tips on employee materials (e.g., pens,
957          notepads, etc.)
958      •   Periodic or as-needed email messages that provide timely tips, or that are sent in response
959          to a cybersecurity or privacy event or issue.
960   Consider that each October is designated as “Cybersecurity Awareness Month” and is, therefore,
961   a popular month for scheduling various learning activities. Each January, there is a “Data Privacy
962   Awareness Week,” and it is also a popular time to schedule privacy protection learning events.
963   Leveraging annual themes and available resources can enhance these special events.

964   2.7.2. Practical Exercises
965   Practical exercises or experiential learning activities are specific learning scenarios that simulate
966   events and incidents. The practical exercises can include phishing exercises and other social
967   engineering campaigns, learning games, quizzes on identifying and processing PII, tabletop
968   exercises, hands-on virtual lab exercises, contingency plan and disaster recovery scenarios, and
969   attack or defend scenarios conducted in cyber ranges.
