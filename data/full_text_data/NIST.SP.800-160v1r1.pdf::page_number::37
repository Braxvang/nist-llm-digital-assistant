â€¢   Objective 2: Satisfy asset protection needs
    -   Cause of Loss: The events, conditions, or circumstances that describe what has happened
        before and what can happen in the future that constitute the potential for loss to occur
    -   Addressing Loss: The various actions taken to exercise control over loss to the extent
        practicable. The control objectives are to prevent loss from occurring and to limit the
        extent and duration for those losses that do occur. Limiting loss includes recovery from
        loss to the extent practicable.




                              Fig. 6. Reasoning about Asset Protection

The asset of interest is the asset class, asset type, or individual asset being addressed. Reasoning
about loss is based on the asset of interest. Distinguishing the asset of interest from all other
assets provides clarity in the interpretation of loss for the asset of interest and the associated
judgments of the suitability and effectiveness of protections employed. A focus on a specific
asset class, type, or discrete element also enables precise traceability to requirements that support
the analysis needed to determine the protection-relevant impact of changes to requirements.

The context of loss establishes the boundary, scope, and time frame for the reasoning, analyses,
assessments, and conclusions about the asset of interest. The context of loss also provides a basis
to relate and trace asset dependencies and interactions and to group assets for protection. The
