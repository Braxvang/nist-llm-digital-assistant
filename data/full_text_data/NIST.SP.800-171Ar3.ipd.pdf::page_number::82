2649   3.14.2. Malicious Code Protection
2650             REQUIREMENT: 03.14.02

2651             ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE
2652             Determine if:
2653             A.03.14.02.ODP[01]: the frequency at which malicious code protection mechanisms
2654             perform scans is defined.
2655             A.03.14.02.a[01]: malicious code protection mechanisms are implemented at designated
2656             locations within the system to detect malicious code.
2657             A.03.14.02.a[02]: malicious code protection mechanisms are implemented at designated
2658             locations within the system to eradicate malicious code.
2659             A.03.14.02.b: malicious code protection mechanisms are updated as new releases are
2660             available in accordance with configuration management policy and procedures.
2661             A.03.14.02.c.01[01]: malicious code protection mechanisms are configured to perform scans of
2662             the system <A.03.14.02.ODP[01]: the frequency>.
2663             A.03.14.02.c.01[02]: malicious code protection mechanisms are configured to perform real-time
2664             scans of files from external sources at endpoints or network entry and exit points as the files are
2665             downloaded, opened, or executed.
2666             A.03.14.02.c.02: malicious code protection mechanisms are configured to block malicious code,
2667             quarantine malicious code, or take other actions in response to malicious code detection.

2668             ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS
2669             Examine
2670             [SELECT FROM: system and information integrity policy and procedures; configuration
2671             management policy and procedures; procedures for malicious code protection; records of
2672             malicious code protection updates; system design documentation; system configuration
2673             settings; scan results from malicious code protection mechanisms; record of actions initiated by
2674             malicious code protection mechanisms in response to malicious code detection; system audit
2675             records; system security plan; other relevant documents or records]
