                                   4. From Step 6, the Derived PIV Credential Issuer’s (content
                                      signing) key pair is generated using an allowed curve.

9.3.4.3 Public Key Size 23

 Test Assertion                    TA-09.03.04.03
 Purpose                           Verifies that size of the subject public key in the Derived PIV
                                   Credential Issuer’s (content signing) certificate conforms to Table
                                   3-2 of [SP800-78].
 DTR(s)                            • DTR-07.03.04.10
 Issuer Documentation              None.

 Precondition(s)                   •   A token with the Derived PIV Application is inserted into an
                                       appropriate token reader.
                                   •   Suitable drivers have been loaded between the test system and
                                       an instance of the reader.
                                   •   A Security Object is present within the Derived PIV
                                       Application.
 Test Scenario                     1. Send the SELECT command with
                                         • AID == 'A0 00 00 03 08 00 00 20 00 01 00'
                                   2. Send the GET DATA command with
                                         • Data field of the command containing the tag
                                            ('5FC106') of the Security Object
                                   3. Extract and parse the certificates field contents
                                      from the Security Object.
                                   4. Extract subjectPublicKeyInfo->algorithm->algorithm
                                      field value.
                                   5. Extract the subjectPublicKeyInfo->subjectPublicKey
                                      from the certificate
                                   6. Match the key size to Table 3-2 of [SP800-78].
 Expected Result(s)                1. From Step 1, the command returns the application property
                                      template with the status word '90 00'.
                                   2. From Step 2, the command returns the requested data object
                                      along with the status word '90 00'.
                                   3. From Step 6, the key size is in accordance with Table 3-2 of
                                      [SP800-78].

9.3.4.4 Key Usage Extension

 Test Assertion                    TA-09.03.04.04
 Purpose                           Verifies the Derived PIV Credential Issuer’s (content signing)
                                   certificate asserts the appropriate purpose for the key.

  Note that the Security Object for a Derived PIV Application is signed using a private key whose corresponding
public key is contained in a Derived PIV Credential Issuer’s (content signing) certificate.
