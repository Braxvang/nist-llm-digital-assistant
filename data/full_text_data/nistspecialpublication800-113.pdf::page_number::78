                                                                                          GUIDE TO SSL VPNS



     A host that is not organization-managed or is personally owned can only access Web applications
      via proxy. The SSL VPN session is established in a virtual storage space and all data stored or
      downloaded during the session is erased after logout.

     All hosts must run one or more specific versions of Windows, with each specific version using
      the most current set of updates. Critical security updates are also required to be installed. The
      host must run an antivirus software program certified by the organization that is active and uses a
      virus signature database that has been updated in the past month. The host must also run a
      firewall program.

7.2.3   Authentication Scheme

The organization has an existing RADIUS authentication infrastructure for multiple resources such as
databases and email servers. The SSL VPN appliances use the same RADIUS servers to authenticate
users as they login to the SSL VPN portal. The groups that are defined by the access control policy are
configured in RADIUS. So most users belong to one large RADIUS group, and the external users
granted access to the HR applications are put into another smaller RADIUS group.

The SSL VPN appliances determine this group information from RADIUS so they can dynamically map
users into the correct group. For example, a user who is a member of the HR Users’ RADIUS group is
only given access to the HR applications.

Users authenticate themselves via two-factor authentication. Each user must type in a password and use a
physical token to enter a one-time password generated by the token. Table 7-2 shows the authentication
method for each internal resource.

 Web applications           Users       Any host running a recent version of          RADIUS (password and
                                        Windows with critical updates installed and   token)
                                        updated antivirus and firewall software
 HR applications (only)     HR Users    Organization-managed host                     RADIUS (password and
                                                                                      token)



For server authentication, the organization purchases an SSL server certificate from a CA whose root
certificate is already installed in most common browsers and installs the SSL server certificate on the SSL
VPN appliance.

7.2.4   Architecture Design

The organization designs an architecture incorporating the SSL VPN appliances within its existing
network infrastructure. It performs configuration of the appliances and devises a management policy.

7.2.5   Selection of Hardware Configuration

The organization chooses an appliance solution developed by a commercial vendor. Hardware appliances
are the most common type of SSL VPN hardware on the market today, and they possess the advantages of
