                                                                                             included in the software.

                                                                                             Consider the following policy:
                                                                                                                   emp & age > 18; & (fa | emt | med)

                                                                                             The relational expression age > 18; within the policy can be viewed as a Boolean expression;
                                                                                             age has values that will evaluate to true (values greater than 18), and those which will evaluate to
                                                                                             false (values less than or equal to 18). The software takes the input policy and replaces the
                                                                                             relational expressions with temporary Boolean variables. After the replacement, the software
                                                                                             processes the input policy normally. Then the software will solve each relational problem to find
                                                                                             values that pass and fail, and updates the results with those values as shown in Figure 32.
