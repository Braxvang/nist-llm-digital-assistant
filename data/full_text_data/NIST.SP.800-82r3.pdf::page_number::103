NIST SP 800-82r3                                          Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security

In Fig. 18, the assumption is that the organization has already addressed Layer 1 and Layer 2.
For Layer 3, the organization should consider incorporating the following capabilities into the
security architecture:
   •   Separate networks into different levels or zones. In this example, the devices are split into
       different levels based on function. The field level includes devices that are typically
       found in the Purdue model levels 0, 1, and 2. The operations management level includes
       devices for monitoring and managing the field level devices and the Purdue level 3
       components. The DMZ includes devices that support bridging the operations
       management and enterprise tiers. Organizations should also consider whether additional
       network segments are required for safety or security systems (e.g., physical monitoring
       and access controls, doors, gates, cameras, Voice over Internet Protocol [VoIP], access
       card readers). Network segmentation is an important step in applying a defense-in-depth
       strategy.
   •   Boundary devices (e.g., firewalls) are added to control and monitor communications
       between different levels. Industrial-class firewalls are sometimes used between the field
       and operations management levels to provide additional support for OT-specific
       protocols or to allow devices to operate in harsh environments. Rules for both inbound
       and outbound communication should be defined so that only authorized communication
       passes between adjacent levels.
   •   Implement a DMZ to separate the OT environment from the enterprise network. Any
       communications between the enterprise level and the operations management level are
       required to go through services within the DMZ. Since the DMZ connects to outside
       environments, the services within the DMZ must be monitored and protected to avoid
       compromises that allow attackers to pivot to the OT environment without detection.
   •   The security architecture diagram shows an IT authentication server in the enterprise
       network to authenticate users and a separate OT authentication server in the operations
       management network for OT users. Organizations may want to consider this approach if
       it supports their risk-based security objectives.
For Layer 4 and Layer 5, organizations should consider applying the principle of least
functionality on all field, operations management, and DMZ devices to support application and
device hardening. Organizations should identify and disable any non-essential capability,
software, or ports on the devices. For example, a web server or SSH server may be available in
some newer PLCs or HMIs. If these services are not used, they should be disabled, and the
associated TCP/UDP ports should be disabled as well. Only enable the functionality when
required.

5.4.2. DCS- and PLC-Based OT with IIoT
Building on the guidance for DCS- and PLC-based OT environments in Section 5.4.1, Fig. 19
shows a simplified example security architecture implementation for the DCS system with
additional IIoT devices configured to utilize a local IIoT platform for providing computing
capabilities. Due to the different communication and architectural components that support IIoT,
the example shows separate network segments for supporting the additional IIoT components.
Communication from the IIoT platform tier is routed through the DMZ border firewall to allow
