664   3.3.4. Response to Audit Logging Process Failures
665           REQUIREMENT: 03.03.04
666           a. Alert organizational personnel or roles within [Assignment: organization-defined time period]
667              in the event of an audit logging process failure.
668           b. Take the following additional actions: [Assignment: organization-defined additional actions].

669           DISCUSSION
670           Audit logging process failures include software and hardware errors, failures in audit log
671           capturing mechanisms, and reaching or exceeding audit log storage capacity. Response actions
672           include overwriting the oldest audit records, shutting down the system, and stopping the
673           generation of audit records. Organizations may choose to define additional actions for audit
674           logging process failures based on the type of failure, the location of the failure, the severity of the
675           failure, or a combination of such factors. When the audit logging process failure is related to
676           storage, the response is carried out for the audit log storage repository (i.e., the distinct system
677           component where the audit logs are stored), the system on which the audit logs reside, the total
678           audit log storage capacity of the organization (i.e., all audit log storage repositories combined), or
679           all three. Organizations may decide to take no additional actions after alerting designated roles or
680           personnel.

684   3.3.5. Audit Record Review, Analysis, and Reporting
685           REQUIREMENT: 03.03.05
686           a. Review and analyze system audit records periodically for indications and potential impact of
687              inappropriate or unusual activity.
688           b. Report findings to organizational personnel or roles.
689           c.   Analyze and correlate audit records across different repositories to gain organization-wide
690                situational awareness.

691           DISCUSSION
692           Audit record review, analysis, and reporting cover information security logging performed by
693           organizations and can include logging that results from the monitoring of account usage, remote
694           access, wireless connectivity, configuration settings, the use of maintenance tools and nonlocal
695           maintenance, system component inventory, mobile device connection, equipment delivery and
696           removal, physical access, temperature and humidity, communications at system interfaces, and
697           the use of mobile code. Findings can be reported to organizational entities, such as the incident
698           response team, help desk, and security or privacy offices. If organizations are prohibited from
699           reviewing and analyzing audit records or unable to conduct such activities, the review or analysis
700           may be carried out by other organizations granted such authority. The scope, frequency, and/or
701           depth of the audit record review, analysis, and reporting may be adjusted to meet organizational
702           needs based on new information received. Correlating audit record review, analysis, and reporting
703           processes helps to ensure that they collectively create a more complete view of events. The
704           requirement to assess a given system is agnostic as to whether this correlation is applied at the
705           system level or at the organization level across all systems.
