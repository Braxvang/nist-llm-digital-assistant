Note: Protective failure, a generalization of the concepts of fail secure and fail safe, is the aspect of
continuous protection that ensures that a protection capability is not interrupted during a failure and that
the effect of the failure is constrained. Two aspects of protective failure must be satisfied to achieve the
intended effect:
-   Avoid Single Points of Failure: The failure of a single system element should not lead to unacceptable
    loss. Unacceptable loss should only occur in the case of multiple independent malfunctions – a safety
    principle known as single failure criterion. The principle of Defense in Depth can help achieve this
    aspect of protective failure.
-   Avoid Propagation of New Failure: If unmitigated, failures in the system can result in propagating,
    cascading, or rippling effects on the system. These effects can be addressed if the remaining
    protections remain effective to prevent the originating failure from causing additional failures.
Protective failure applies to discrete system elements, aggregates of system elements, and systems
abstraction. Protective failure seeks to limit a failure’s effect to the extent practicable and, in doing so,
minimize introducing new loss possibilities. Protective failure can limit the extent to which a failure is
able to advance loss scenarios associated with the failure, including cascading losses; trigger a different
loss scenario; or create a new loss scenario. Efforts to avoid or limit failures may themselves degrade
system performance, which is a form of failure. Thus, system designers may need to consider trade spaces
between possible adverse effects and system performance.

E.24. Protective Recovery
Principle: The recovery of a system element does not result in nor lead to unacceptable loss.
Note: Protective recovery is an aspect of Continuous Protection that ensures that a protection capability is
not interrupted during recovery from actual or impending failure. Protective recovery is applied to
discrete system elements, aggregates of system elements, and the system. To the extent practicable, any
recovery from impending or actual failure to resume normal, degraded, contingency or alternative
operation, or the recovery of other asset losses should not (1) advance the loss scenario that is the target of
the recovery, (2) trigger other loss scenarios, or (3) create new loss scenarios. The practicable aspect of
this principle recognizes that for some recovery efforts to be successful, they may degrade system
performance, which is a form of loss. Protective recovery is an aspect of the response strategy for the
system. Thus, graduated and ungraduated considerations of Commensurate Response apply to best suit
expediency in the need for a protective recovery.

E.25. Reduced Complexity
Principle: The system design is as simple as practicable.
Note: Engineered systems are often complex. Some degree of complexity in the system design is inherent,
unavoidable, and must be accepted. The objective of this principle is to ensure that the design reflects the
extent to which complexity can be reasonably minimized (i.e., avoid unnecessary complexity).
Complexity can be found in the system structure, interfaces, dependencies, data and control flows, and the
interaction of the system with its operational environment. Complexity derives from how the system is
decomposed into its individual and aggregates of constituent elements (e.g., subsystems, assemblies), and
from how those elements compose through their behaviors and interactions to comprise the functional
system.
