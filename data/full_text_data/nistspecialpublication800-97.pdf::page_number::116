                                                      passwords on APs should be hard to guess. In addition,
              Ensure that all APs have strong,
      37                                              organizations should not use a common password for                          AP
              unique administrative passwords.
                                                      multiple APs. Otherwise, a compromised password on one
                                                      AP could have much wider consequences.

      38      APs, and configure remaining                                                                                        AP
                                                      SNMPv2. If SNMPv3 is used, configure it for least privilege

                                                      If WEP remains enabled, then STAs might be able to

                                                      remains enabled, then STAs might negotiate TKIP instead of

          IEEE 802.11i allows for RSNs based on data confidentiality and integrity protocols other than TKIP and CCMP, including vendor proprietary algorithms, as long as they use
          the 4-Way Handshake for authentication and key distribution. These vendor proprietary solutions could have easily exploitable vulnerabilities, which heightens the need to
          disable unused protocols.
