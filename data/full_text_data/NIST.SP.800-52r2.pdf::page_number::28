NIST SP 800-52 REV. 2                                         GUIDELINES FOR TLS IMPLEMENTATIONS


use of ephemeral key cipher suites is encouraged and preferred over the use of the cipher suites
listed in this section.

TLS 1.2 servers that are configured with ECDSA-signed ECDH certificates may be configured
to support the following cipher suites:

   •   TLS_ECDH_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 (0xC0, 0x2D)
   •   TLS_ECDH_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 (0xC0, 0x2E)
   •   TLS_ECDH_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256 (0xC0, 0x25)
   •   TLS_ECDH_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384 (0xC0, 0x26)

TLS servers may be configured to support the following cipher suites when ECDSA-signed
ECDH certificates are used with TLS versions 1.2, 1.1, or 1.0:

   •   TLS_ECDH_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA (0xC0, 0x04)
   •   TLS_ECDH_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA (0xC0, 0x05)

TLS 1.2 servers that are configured with RSA-signed ECDH certificates may be configured to
support the following cipher suites:

   •   TLS_ECDH_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 (0xC0, 0x31)
   •   TLS_ECDH_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 (0xC0, 0x32)
   •   TLS_ECDH_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256 (0xC0, 0x29)
   •   TLS_ECDH_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384 (0xC0, 0x2A)

TLS servers may be configured to support the following cipher suites when RSA-signed ECDH
certificates are used with TLS versions 1.2, 1.1, or 1.0:

   •   TLS_ECDH_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA (0xC0, 0x0E)
   •   TLS_ECDH_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA (0xC0, 0x0F)

3.3.1.2 Cipher Suites for TLS 1.3

TLS 1.3 servers may be configured to support the following cipher suites:

   •   TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 (0x13, 0x01)
   •   TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 (0x13, 0x02)
   •   TLS_AES_128_CCM_SHA256 (0x13, 0x04)
   •   TLS_AES_128_CCM_8_SHA256 (0x13, 0x05)

These cipher suites may be used with either RSA or ECDSA server certificates; DSA and DH
certificates are not supported by TLS 1.3. These cipher suites may also be used with pre-shared
keys, as specified in Appendix C.
