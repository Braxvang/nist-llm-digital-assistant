GUIDE TO COMPUTER SECURITY LOG MANAGEMENT



organizational policies, such as data retention policies. The goals should be based on balancing the
organization’s reduction of risk with the time and resources needed to perform log management functions.
The requirements and goals should then be used as the basis for establishing an organization-wide log
management capability and prioritizing log management appropriately throughout the enterprise.

Organizations should develop policies that clearly define mandatory requirements and suggested
recommendations for several aspects of log management, including the following:41

      Log generation

         –    Which types of hosts must or should perform logging

         –    Which host components must or should perform logging (e.g., OS, service, application)

         –    Which types of events each component must or should log (e.g., security events, network
              connections, authentication attempts)

         –    Which data characteristics must or should be logged for each type of event (e.g., username
              and source IP address for authentication attempts)

         –    How frequently each type of event must or should be logged (e.g., every occurrence, once for
              all instances in x minutes, once for every x instances, every instance after x instances)42
      Log transmission

         –    Which types of hosts must or should transfer logs to a log management infrastructure

         –    Which types of entries and data characteristics must or should be transferred from individual
              hosts to a log management infrastructure

         –    How log data must or should be transferred (e.g., which protocols are permissible), including
              out-of-band methods where appropriate (e.g., for standalone systems)

         –    How frequently log data should be transferred from individual hosts to a log management
              infrastructure (e.g., real-time, every 5 minutes, every hour)

         –    How the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of each type of log data must or should be
              protected while in transit, including whether a separate logging network should be used
      Log storage and disposal43

         –    How often logs should be rotated

         –    How the confidentiality, integrity, and availability44 of each type of log data must or should
              be protected while in storage (at both the system level and the infrastructure level) 45


41
     For organizations with complex, multi-tiered log management infrastructures, separate requirements might be needed for
     each tier.
42
     For many log sources, this is not configurable; events are logged each time they occur. Some log sources do not record each
     individual event; for example, an operating system might log an unauthorized access attempt only after three consecutive
     failed logins occur. Another example is an intrusion detection system that does not generate an alert until it sees 10 hosts
     scanned within a minute.

     A source of information on log retention requirements is the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA)
     General Records Schedule (GRS) 20, which is available at http://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/ardor/grs20 html.
