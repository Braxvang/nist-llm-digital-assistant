                                            ESTABLISHING WIRELESS ROBUST SECURITY NETWORKS: A GUIDE TO IEEE 802.11I



5.      Robust Security Networks Principles of Operation

This section describes the general principles of operation for IEEE 802.11 RSNs. Section 5.1 begins by
describing the flow of frames in establishing an association. The rest of Section 5.1 discusses the types of
IEEE 802.11 frames used within an RSN, including the structure of data frames. Section 5.2 provides a
high-level overview of the five phases of RSN operation, while Sections 5.3 through 5.7 provide detailed
descriptions of each phase. Readers who are looking for only an overview of IEEE 802.11 RSN
operation without extensive technical details should read the beginning of Section 5.1 and all of Section
5.2, skim the rest of Section 5, and read the summary in Section 5.8.

5.1     General Principles of IEEE 802.11 Operation

The IEEE 802.11 media access control (MAC) protocol supplies the functionality in WLANs that is
required to provide reliable delivery of user data over the potentially noisy, unreliable wireless media.
The IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol implements a frame exchange protocol in which the STA receiving a
frame either returns an acknowledgement to the frame’s source that the frame was received correctly, or
notifies the source of an error. The frame exchange protocol is executed by each STA in the WLAN;
every STA receives, decodes, and responds to information in the MAC header for every frame that it
receives, with the exception of certain broadcast, multicast, and beacon frames.

Figure 5-1 depicts a typical two-frame flow for IEEE 802.11 WLAN communication that illustrates an
Association Request and Response. First, the STA sends an Association Request frame to the AP, which
is a request to connect to the WLAN with a Service Set Identifier (SSID) of “NotSecure”. The SSID is a
text name assigned to the WLAN. The AP with the matching SSID then responds to the STA with either
success or failure. If the response indicates success, the result is an association (not yet an RSNA)
between the AP and STA. Association is a record-keeping procedure that allows the DS to keep track of
STA location, so that frames from the DS are forwarded to the correct STAs.

                  with the WLAN with the SSID =

5.1.1     IEEE 802.11 Frame Types

The IEEE 802.11 frame exchange protocol involves three types of frames, as follows:

       Data Frame. Data frames encapsulate packets from upper layer protocols, such as IP, which in
        turn might contain application data (e.g., e-mail, Web pages). Data frames allow for the delivery
