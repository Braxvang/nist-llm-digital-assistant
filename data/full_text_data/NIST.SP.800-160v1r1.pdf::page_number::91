•   Incorporate engineered features or devices to control the potential for loss
    If preventing, limiting, or reducing the potential for loss through design alteration and
    material selection is not feasible or adequate, employ engineered features and devices to
    control loss associated with susceptibility, hazard, and vulnerability. In general, engineered
    features actively disrupt the loss scenario sequence and interactions, and devices reduce the
    potential, severity, and extent of loss.
    Two general types of engineered features and devices employed to address the potential for
    loss associated with the system function of interest are:
    -   Mandatory security features and devices: Mandatory security features and devices apply
        foundational security principles to the interfaces. For example, each interface must have
        mediated access to control access to and use of the capability and data provided by the
        interface.
    -   Function-specific features and devices: Function-specific security features and devices
        protect against a loss associated with the design’s ability to meet functional requirements
        and performance parameters. Engineered features such as redundant data and control
        flows and redundant system elements can supplement the design selection to achieve the
        required protection. The system may also have engineered features that enable external
        entities to intervene in the system to address the potential, severity, or extent of loss.
•   Provide visibility and feedback to external entities
    If design alteration, material selection, and engineered features and devices are not feasible
    or do not adequately lower the frequency, potential, severity, or extent of loss caused by the
    susceptibility, hazard, or vulnerability, employ engineered detection and feedback systems
    and warning devices to alert external entities to the presence of a susceptible, hazardous, or
    vulnerable condition; the occurrence of an event that will lead to a loss; or an actual loss
    event. External entities include operational personnel, monitoring systems, or other systems
    capable of responding.
    -   Example: Anomaly detection features can be used to provide situational awareness data
        and warnings to system users.
    -   Note: The visibility and feedback provided is not of value if the external entities are not
        able to respond appropriately. For example, the visibility and feedback must be provided
        in a timely manner and be in a form that can be interpreted correctly.
•   Incorporate signage, procedures, training, and proper equipment
    Incorporate procedures, training, signage, and proper equipment where design alternatives,
    design changes, and engineered features and devices are not feasible and warning devices
    cannot adequately lessen the potential, severity, or extent of loss caused by the hazard,
    susceptibility, or vulnerability. Procedures and training include proper warnings and cautions
    and may prescribe the use of equipment. The use of signage, procedures, training, and
    equipment as the only means to reduce the potential, severity, or extent of loss should be
    avoided.
