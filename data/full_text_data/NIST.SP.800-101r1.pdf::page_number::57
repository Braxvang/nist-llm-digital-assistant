                                                       Guidelines on Mobile Device Forensics

Cloud computing environments are complex in their design and frequently geographically
disperse. Often, storage locations for cloud computing are chosen due to lowest cost and data
redundancy requirements. One issue may be identification of the location of the data. This is
an emerging field.

Cloud storage opens numerous possibilities for mobile device application developers beyond
mobile device memory limitations. As mobile applications evolve data retrieval becomes
seamless to the user and not apparent if data is stored on the cloud or the internal memory of
the mobile device.

There are several factors within cloud computing environments that challenge forensics
examiners requiring a hybrid approach to include both live and “dead box” forensic
techniques. Additionally, recovery of user data stored in the cloud may become more
problematic based on laws and regulations. Retrieval and analysis of cloud based data should
follow agency specific guidelines on cloud forensics.

The mobile device forensics examiner should not discount cloud based data left behind (e.g.,
browser cache or other forensics artifacts) that may be present on tangential equipment
enabling an examiner to piece together what has occurred on a device.
