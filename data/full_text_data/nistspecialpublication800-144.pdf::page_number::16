Some have argued that the distinction between IaaS and PaaS service models is fuzzy, and in
many commercial offerings, the two are more alike than different [Arm10]. Nevertheless, these
terms do serve a purpose, distinguishing between very basic support environments and
environments having greater levels of support, and accordingly different allocations of control
and responsibility between the cloud consumer and the cloud provider.

2.3   Outsourcing and Accountability
While cloud computing can be implemented exclusively for an organization as an internal
private cloud, its main thrust has been to provide a vehicle for outsourcing parts of the
organizational computing environment to an outside party via a public cloud. As with any
outsourcing of information technology services, concerns exist about the implications for
computer security and privacy. The main issue centers on the risks associated with moving
important applications or data from within the confines of the organizationâ€™s computing center to
that of another organization (i.e., a public cloud), which is readily available for use by the
general public.

Three broad classes of public clouds exist. The first class entails those with services that are
provided at no cost to the consumer and are instead supported through advertisements. Search
and electronic mail services are well-known examples. Such services may be limited to
personal, non-commercial use. Information collected at registration and during use of the service
may be combined with information obtained from other sources and used to deliver personalized
advertisements to the consumer. Protection measures such as encrypted communications with
the service may also be missing. The second class entails public clouds whose services are fee-
based and free of advertisements. Services in this class can be similar to those of the first, but
able to be offered at low cost to the consumer, because the terms of service delivery are non-
negotiable and able to be modified unilaterally at the discretion of the cloud provider. Protection
mechanisms that are beyond those of the first class and configurable by the consumer are
typically provided. The third class entails public clouds whose services are fee-based and whose
terms of service are negotiated between the organization and the cloud provider. While services
are able to be tailored to the needs of the organization, the costs are generally dependent on the
degree of deviation from the corresponding non-negotiable, fee-based services offered by the
cloud provider.

Reducing cost and increasing efficiency are primary motivations for moving towards a public
cloud, but relinquishing responsibility for security should not be. Ultimately, the organization is
accountable for the choice of public cloud and the security and privacy of the outsourced service.
Monitoring and addressing security issues that arise remain in the purview of the organization, as
does oversight over other important issues such as performance and data privacy. Because cloud
computing brings with it new security challenges, it is essential for an organization to oversee
and manage how the cloud provider secures and maintains the computing environment and
ensures data is kept secure.
