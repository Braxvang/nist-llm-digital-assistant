                                                CONTINGENCY PLANNING GUIDE FOR FEDERAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS



5.1.3   Protection of Resources

Part of a successful contingency planning policy is making a system resilient to environmental and
component-level failures that would otherwise cause system disruptions. There are several methods for
making valuable hardware and software resilient. Determination of the appropriate methods should be
based on risk-informed decisions. Depending on results of the risk management process, these methods
may or may not be applicable for a particular system.

The system and its data can become corrupt as a result of a power failure. Critical hardware, such as
servers, can be configured with dual power supplies to prevent corruption. The two power supplies
should be used simultaneously so that if the main power supply becomes overheated or unusable, the
second unit will become the main power source, resulting in no system disruption.

The second power supply will protect against hardware failure, but not power failure. However, a UPS
can protect the system if power is lost. A UPS usually provides 30 to 60 minutes of temporary backup
power to permit a graceful shutdown. A UPS can also protect against power fluctuations by filtering
incoming power and providing a steady power source. If high availability is required, a gas- or diesel-
powered generator may be needed. The generator can be wired directly into the site’s power system and
configured to start automatically when a power interruption is detected. A combination UPS/generator
system can provide clean, secure power for a system as long as fuel is available for the generator. Fuel
availability should be considered for those who opt for a UPS/generator to support their system
environment.

In addition to backing up data, organizations should also back up system software and drivers.
Organizations should store software and software licenses in an alternate location. This includes original
installation media, license terms and conditions, and license keys, if required. Image loads for client
systems (such as desktops and portable systems) should also be backed up and stored at an alternate
location, along with complete documentation of the software included in the image load, any
configuration information for the type of computer for which the image is intended, and installation
instructions.

Organizations may use third-party vendors to recover data from failed storage devices. Organizations
should consider the security risk of having their data handled by an outside company and ensure that
proper security vetting of the service provider is conducted before turning over equipment. The service
provider and employees should sign non disclosure agreements, be properly bonded, and adhere to
organization-specific security policies.

5.1.4   Adherence to Security Controls

The security controls established in NIST SP 800-53 provide a solid foundation for establishing
information system security, integrity, and contingency policies. Adherence to these controls for
contingency planning purposes helps protect an information system against threats that can disrupt
operations.

5.1.5   Identification of Alternate Storage and Processing Facilities

Backup media should be stored offsite in a secure, environmentally controlled location. When selecting
the offsite location, hours of the location, ease of accessibility to backup media, physical storage
limitations, and the contract terms should be taken into account. The ISCP Coordinator should reference
the organization’s resilience policy and the BIA to assist in determining how often backup media should
be tested. Each backup tape, cartridge, or disk should be uniquely labeled to ensure that the required data
