     (FIPS) 140-3,1 Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules.
     One thing has remained constant over the past decade: our commitment to cultivating
     trust in information and the technology that drives the development and handling
     of that information. This annual report focuses on some of NISTâ€™s most noteworthy
     cybersecurity achievements in 2018 and offers insights into our current priorities
     and strategies. For a more complete review of our work, check out our primary
     cybersecurity website.2
     NIST welcomes all suggestions for how we can improve our cybersecurity work to
     better serve the public and private sectors. And, by all means, please join us as we pick
     up the pace.
