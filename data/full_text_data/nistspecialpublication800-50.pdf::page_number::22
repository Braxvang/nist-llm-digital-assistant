3.      Designing an Awareness and Training Program

There are three major steps in the development of an IT security awareness and training program –
designing the program (including the development of the IT security awareness and training program
plan), developing the awareness and training material, and implementing the program. Even a small
amount of IT security awareness and training can go a long way toward improving the IT security posture
of, and vigilance within, an organization. This section describes the first step in the development of an
awareness and training program: designing the program.

Awareness and training programs must be designed with the organization mission in mind. It is important
that the awareness and training program supports the business needs of the organization and be relevant to
the organization’s culture and IT architecture. The most successful programs are those that users feel are
relevant to the subject matter and issues presented.

Designing an IT security awareness and training program answers the question “What is our plan for
developing and implementing awareness and training opportunities that are compliant with existing
directives?”8 In the design step of the program, the agency’s awareness and training needs are identified,
an effective agency wide awareness and training plan is developed, organizational buy-in is sought and
secured, and priorities9 are established.

This section describes:

     How to structure the awareness and training activity;
     How to (and why) conduct a needs assessment;
     How to develop an awareness and training plan;
     How to establish priorities;
     How to “set the bar” (i.e., the level of complexity of the subject matter) properly; and
     How to fund the awareness and training program.
3.1     Structuring an Agency Awareness and Training Program

An awareness and training program may be designed, developed, and implemented in many different
ways. Three common approaches or models are described below:

     Model 1: Centralized policy, strategy, and implementation;
     Model 2: Centralized policy and strategy, distributed implementation; and
     Model 3: Centralized policy, distributed strategy and implementation.
The model that is embraced and established to oversee the awareness and training program activity
depends on:

     The size and geographic dispersion of the organization;

8
      The awareness and training plan should reflect the organization’s strategy for meeting its awareness and training program
      responsibilities.
9
      Priorities include what awareness or training material will be developed first and who will be the first to receive the
      material.
