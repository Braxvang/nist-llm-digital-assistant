PE-1      PHYSICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION POLICY AND PROCEDURES

          Control: The organization develops, disseminates, and periodically reviews/updates: (i) a formal,
          documented, physical and environmental protection policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles,
          responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and
          compliance; and (ii) formal, documented procedures to facilitate the implementation of the
          physical and environmental protection policy and associated physical and environmental
          protection controls.
          Supplemental Guidance: The physical and environmental protection policy and procedures are
          consistent with applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and
          guidance. The physical and environmental protection policy can be included as part of the general
          information security policy for the organization. Physical and environmental protection
          procedures can be developed for the security program in general, and for a particular information
          system, when required. NIST Special Publication 800-12 provides guidance on security policies
          and procedures.
          Control Enhancements: None.

PE-2      PHYSICAL ACCESS AUTHORIZATIONS

          Control: The organization develops and keeps current a list of personnel with authorized access to
          the facility where the information system resides (except for those areas within the facility
          officially designated as publicly accessible) and issues appropriate authorization credentials.
          Designated officials within the organization review and approve the access list and authorization
          credentials [Assignment: organization-defined frequency, at least annually].
          Supplemental Guidance: Appropriate authorization credentials include, for example, badges,
          identification cards, and smart cards. The organization promptly removes from the access list
          personnel no longer requiring access to the facility where the information system resides.
          Control Enhancements: None.
