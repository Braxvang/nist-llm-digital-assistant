GUIDE TO COMPUTER SECURITY LOG MANAGEMENT



the logging host, but also on other log management infrastructure components—for example, excessive
logging can cause significantly more usage of network bandwidth and centralized log storage.

For log source configurations with which administrators are not completely familiar, administrators might
choose to test them in a non-production environment before deploying them to any production systems.
This is particularly recommended for the most common log sources, log sources on critical hosts, and the
most important log sources. Software vendors and other parties may also have information available on
the logging capabilities and typical effects of various logging settings, which can be very helpful in
determining an initial configuration.55

5.1.2    Log Storage and Disposal

System-level administrators need to determine how each log source should store its data. This should be
driven primarily by organizational policies regarding log storage, particularly requirements to forward
entries to a log management infrastructure. Once such requirements have been met, administrators
typically have significant flexibility regarding other log storage settings. The storage options for log
entries are as follows:

      Not stored. Entries that are determined to be of little or no value to the organization, such as
       debugging messages that can only be understood by the software vendor, or error messages that
       do not log any details of the activity, generally do not need to be stored.
      System level only. Entries that might be of some value or interest to the system-level
       administrator, but are not sufficiently important to be sent to the log management infrastructure,
       should be stored on the system. For example, if an incident occurs, additional system-level log
       entries might provide more information on the series of events related to the incident. System-
       level administrators might also find it helpful to review these entries to develop baselines of
       typical activity and identify long-term trends.
      Both system level and infrastructure level. Entries deemed to be of particular interest should
       be retained on the system and also transmitted to the log management infrastructure. Reasons for
       having the logs in both locations include the following:

         –    If either the system or infrastructure logging should fail, the other should still have the log
              data. For example, if a log server fails or a network failure prevents logging hosts from
              contacting it, logging to the system helps to ensure that the log data is not lost.

         –    During an incident on a system, the system’s logs might be altered or destroyed by attackers;
              however, usually the attacker will not have any access to the infrastructure logs. Incident
              response staff can use the data from the infrastructure logs; also, they can compare the
              infrastructure and system logs to determine what data was changed or removed, which may
              indicate what the attacker wanted to conceal.
