 Risk Assessment                      The process of identifying risks to organizational
                                      operations (including mission, functions, image,
                                      reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other
                                      organizations, and the Nation, resulting from the
                                      operation of an information system.
                                      Part of risk management, incorporates threat and
                                      vulnerability analyses, and considers mitigations
                                      provided by security controls planned or in place.
                                      Synonymous with risk analysis.
 Risk Executive (Function)            An individual or group within an organization that helps
 [CNSSI 4009]                         to ensure that: (i) security risk-related considerations for
                                      individual information systems, to include the
                                      authorization decisions for those systems, are viewed
                                      from an organization-wide perspective with regard to the
                                      overall strategic goals and objectives of the organization
                                      in carrying out its missions and business functions; and
                                      (ii) managing risk from individual information systems is
                                      consistent across the organization, reflects organizational
                                      risk tolerance, and is considered along with other
                                      organizational risks affecting mission/business success.
 Risk Management                      The program and supporting processes to manage
 [CNSSI 4009, adapted]                information security risk to organizational operations
                                      (including mission, functions, image, reputation),
                                      organizational assets, individuals, other organizations,
                                      and the Nation, and includes: (i) establishing the context
                                      for risk-related activities; (ii) assessing risk; (iii)
                                      responding to risk once determined; and (iv) monitoring
                                      risk over time.
 Risk Mitigation                      Prioritizing, evaluating, and implementing the
 [CNSSI 4009]                         appropriate risk-reducing controls/countermeasures
                                      recommended from the risk management process.
 Risk Monitoring                      Maintaining ongoing awareness of an organizationâ€™s risk
                                      environment, risk management program, and associated
                                      activities to support risk decisions.
 Risk Response                        Accepting, avoiding, mitigating, sharing, or transferring
                                      risk to organizational operations (i.e., mission, functions,
                                      image, or reputation), organizational assets, individuals,
                                      other organizations, or the Nation.
 Risk Response Measure                A specific action taken to respond to an identified risk.
 Root Cause Analysis                  A principle-based, systems approach for the identification
                                      of underlying causes associated with a particular set of
                                      risks.
