3.3   Security Recommendations for Configuring Network Path Redundancy

The following recommendations seek to improve the fault tolerance (redundancy) already provided by
NIC teaming. Each recommendation has a unique identifier of format VM-NPR-Rx, where VM stands for
virtual machine, NPR for network path redundancy, and Rx for the recommendation sequence.

VM-NPR-R1: It is preferable to use pNICs that use different drivers in the NIC team. The failure of one
driver will only affect one member of the NIC team, and traffic will keep flowing through the other
members.

VM-NPR-R2: If multiple PCI buses are available in the virtualized host, each pNIC in the NIC team
should be placed on a separate PCI bus. This provides fault tolerance against PCI bus failure in the
virtualized host.

VM-NPR-R3: The network path redundancy created within the virtual network of the virtualized host
should also be extended to the immediate physical network links emanating from the virtualized host.
This can be achieved by having the individual members of the NIC team (i.e., the two or more pNICs)
connected to different physical switches.
