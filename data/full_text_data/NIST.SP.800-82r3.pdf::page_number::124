            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Many OT systems do not offer password recovery mechanisms, so the
            secure and reliable handling of passwords is critical to maintaining
            continuous operation. Organizations are encouraged to change the
            default password on OT equipment to make it more difficult for an
            adversary to guess the password. Once changed, the password needs to
            be made available to those who need to know. Organizations may want
            to consider using a password management tool that is secure and
            accessible by those who need to know.
            Some OT OSs make setting secure passwords difficult if the password
            size is smaller than current password standards and the system allows
            only group passwords at each level of access rather than individual
            passwords. Some industrial (and internet) protocols transmit passwords
            in plaintext, making them susceptible to interception. In cases where this
            practice cannot be avoided, it is important that users have different (and
            unrelated) passwords for use with encrypted and non-encrypted
            protocols.
            Additionally, special considerations may be required when applying
            policies based on login password authentication within the OT
            environment. Without an exclusion list based on machine identification
            (ID), non-operator login can result in policies such as auto-logoff
            timeout and administrator password replacement being pushed down,
            which can be detrimental to the operation of the OT system.
            The following are general recommendations and considerations with
            regard to the use of passwords:
                   •   Change all default passwords in OT components.
                   •   Passwords should have appropriate length, strength, and
                       complexity balanced with security and operational ease of access
                       within the capabilities of the software and underlying OS.
                   •   Passwords should not be able to be found in a dictionary or
                       contain predictable sequences of numbers or letters.
                   •   Passwords should be used with care on specialized OT devices,
                       such as control consoles on critical processes. Using passwords
                       on these consoles could introduce potential safety issues if
                       operators are locked out or access is delayed during critical
                       events. Organizations should consider physical or network
                       isolation for devices where password protection is not
                       recommended.
                   •   Copies of shared or administrator passwords must be stored in a
                       secure location with limited access that can also be accessed in an
                       emergency. Organizations may also need to consider procedures
                       to periodically change passwords when a password is
