Appendix D: Error Properties

A bit error is the substitution of a ‘0’ bit for a ‘1’ bit, or vice versa. This appendix contains a
discussion of the effects of bit errors in ciphertext blocks (or segments), counter blocks, and IVs
on the modes in this recommendation. Insertion or deletion of bits into ciphertext blocks (or
segments) is also discussed.

For any confidentiality mode, if there are any bit errors in a single ciphertext block (or segment),
then the decryption of that ciphertext block (or segment) will be incorrect, i.e., it will differ from
the original plaintext block (or segment). In the CFB, OFB, and CTR modes, the bit error(s) in
the decrypted ciphertext block (or segment) occur in the same bit position(s) as in the ciphertext
block (or segment); the other bit positions are not affected. In the ECB and CBC modes, a bit
error may occur, independently, in any bit position of the decrypted ciphertext block, with an
expected error rate of fifty percent, depending on the strength of the underlying block cipher.

For the ECB, OFB, and CTR modes, bit errors within a ciphertext block do not affect the
decryption of any other blocks. In the CBC mode, any bit positions that contain bit errors in a
ciphertext block will also contain bit errors in the decryption of the succeeding ciphertext block;
the other bit positions are not affected. In the CFB mode, bit errors in a ciphertext segment affect
the decryption of the next b/s (rounded up to the nearest integer) ciphertext segments. A bit error
may occur, independently, in any bit position in these decrypted segments, with an expected
error rate of fifty percent.

Similarly, for the CTR mode, if there is a bit error in a counter block, then a bit error may occur,
independently, in any bit position of the decryption of the corresponding ciphertext, with an
expected error rate of fifty percent.

Bit errors in IVs also affect the decryption process. In the OFB mode, bit errors in the IV affect
the decryption of every ciphertext block. In the CFB mode, bit errors in the IV affect, at a
minimum, the decryption of the first ciphertext segment, and possibly successive ciphertext
segments, depending on the bit position of the rightmost bit error in the IV. (In general, a bit
error in the ith most significant bit position affects the decryptions of the first i/s (rounding up)
ciphertext segments.) For both the OFB and CFB modes, a bit error may occur, independently,
in any bit position of the affected ciphertext blocks (or segments), with an expected error rate of
fifty percent. In the CBC mode, if bit errors occur in the IV, then the first ciphertext block will
be decrypted incorrectly, and bit errors will occur in exactly the same bit positions as in the IV;
the decryptions of the other ciphertext blocks are not affected.

Consequently, for the CBC mode, the decryption of the first ciphertext block is vulnerable to the
(deliberate) introduction of bit errors in specific bit positions of the IV if the integrity of the IV is
not protected. Similarly, for the OFB and CTR modes, the decryption of any ciphertext block is
vulnerable to the introduction of specific bit errors into that ciphertext block if its integrity is not
protected. The same property also holds for the ciphertext segments in the CFB mode; however,
for every ciphertext segment except the last one, the existence of such bit errors may be detected
by their randomizing effect on the decryption of the succeeding ciphertext segment.
