                                                                           Guidelines on PDA Forensics


               Who took possession of it? (i.e., individual in charge of seizing evidence)

               How was it stored and protected in storage? (i.e., evidence-custodian procedures)

               Who took it out of storage and why? (i.e., on-going documentation of individual’s
               name and purpose for checking-out evidence)

       Documentation to all of the above questions must be maintained and filed in a secure location
       for current and future reference.

5.4   Collection

       Where PDAs are concerned, the collection process normally involves dynamic and volatile
       information that may be lost unless precautions are taken at the scene of the incident or crime.
       The “Good Practice Guide for Computer Based Electronic Evidence” [ACPO] suggests the
       following procedures when dealing with PDAs:

               On seizure, the PDA should not be switched on, if already off.

               The PDA should be placed in an envelope then sealed before being put into an
               evidence bag, to restrict physical access while it is still sealed in the evidence bag.

               Where the PDA is fitted with only a single rechargeable battery, the appropriate
               power adaptor should be connected to the device with the cable passing through the
               evidence bag so that it can be kept on charge.

               If the PDA is switched on when found, the device should be kept in an active running
               mode (e.g., by tapping on a blank section of the screen) and supplied with power until
               an expert can examine it, to avoid the consequences of activating security mechanisms
               such as user authentication and content encryption. If sufficient power cannot be
               supplied, consideration should be given to switching off the PDA to preserve battery
               life, documenting the current device state and noting the time and date of the
               shutdown.

               A search should be conducted for associated memory devices, such as SD, MMC, or
               CF semiconductor cards, microdrives, and USB tokens.

               Any power leads, cables, or cradles relating to the PDA should also be seized, as well
               as manuals.

               Anyone handling PDAs before their examination should treat them in such a manner
               that gives the best opportunity for any recovered data to be admissible as evidence in
               any later proceedings.

       PDAs maintain user data in a volatile state powered by either an alkaline or lithium ion battery
       source. The device design determines the type of battery source provided; batteries may be
       rechargeable or replaceable. If devices lose power for too long a time, the chance of
       recovering all data from the seized device is unlikely. Before a technician can bag and tag a
       PDA, the present power state must be considered. For example, the device may be receiving
       power from a cradle plugged into an outlet and fully charged, the batteries may have recently
