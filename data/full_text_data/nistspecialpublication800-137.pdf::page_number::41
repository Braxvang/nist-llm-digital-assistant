to ensure that the new or revised controls are effective in their implementations. 42 Going forward,
new or revised controls are included in the overall continuous monitoring strategy.

Primary Roles: System Owner, Common Control Provider, System Security Officer

Supporting Roles: Authorizing Official, Senior Information Security Officer, Information
Owner/Steward

Expected Input: Reports on security status, reports on assessment results (e.g., Security
Assessment Reports), organizational- and system-level risk assessments, Security Assessment
Plans, System Security Plans, organizational procedures and templates

Expected Output: Decisions on risk responses, updated system security information (e.g.,
System Security Plans, POA&Ms, Security Assessment Reports), updated security status reports

3.6     REVIEW AND UPDATE THE MONITORING PROGRAM AND STRATEGY
ISCM strategies and programs are not static. Security control assessments, security status metrics,
and monitoring and assessment frequencies change in accordance with the needs of the
organization. The continuous monitoring strategy is reviewed to ensure that it sufficiently
supports the organization in operating within acceptable risk tolerance levels, that metrics remain
relevant, and that data is current and complete. The strategy review also identifies ways to
improve organizational insight into security posture, effectively supports informed risk
management decision making/ongoing authorizations, and improves the organization’s ability to
respond to known and emerging threats.

The organization establishes a procedure for reviewing and modifying all aspects of the ISCM
strategy, including relevance of the overall strategy, accuracy in reflecting organizational risk
tolerance, accuracy/correctness of measurements, and applicability of metrics, reporting
requirements, and monitoring and assessment frequencies. If any of the data collected is not
required for reporting purposes or found to be not useful in maintaining or improving the
organization’s security posture, then the organization considers saving resources by discontinuing
that particular collection. Factors precipitating changes in the monitoring strategy may include,
but are not limited to:

•    Changes to core missions or business processes;

•    Significant changes in the enterprise architecture (including addition or removal of systems);

•    Changes in organizational risk tolerance;

•    Changes in threat information;
•    Changes in vulnerability information;

•    Changes within information systems (including changes in categorization/impact level);
•    Increase/decrease in POA&Ms related to specific controls;

     Changes to security controls are made after being fully tested, vetted, and reviewed in a test environment.
