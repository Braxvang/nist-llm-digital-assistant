                                                                GUIDELINES FOR THE SECURE DEPLOYMENT OF IPV6


The constraints of IPv4 addressing were major considerations when IPv6 addressing was designed. The
IPv6 addressing architecture is different not only in terms of address length, but also in terms of address
types, address notation, and address aggregation. As discussed in Section 2, as well as later in Sections 3
and 4, each of these differences enables new features in IPv6.

In both IPv4 and IPv6, Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) and the Domain Name System
(DNS) can be used to assign, monitor, administer, and change IP addresses. IPv6 also includes an
autoconfiguration capability for assigning IP addresses to hosts. Due to the smaller amount of address
space available with IPv4, address management was often not complex, with some organizations
manually tracking address assignments. The longer, more complex IPv6 addresses, as well as the much
larger amount of address space, will most likely require the use of address management tools to avoid
errors. In IPv4, it is customary to allocate addresses sequentially, whether they are allocated manually or
using DHCP. In IPv6, with an address space large enough to defeat attackers’ scanning attempts,
addresses should be allocated non-sequentially (e.g., randomly), to preserve that advantage.

3.2 IPv6 Address Allocations

IPv6 addresses have a flexible structure for address assignments. This enables registries, ISPs, network
designers, and others to assign address ranges to organizations and networks based on different criteria,
such as size of networks and estimated growth rate. Often, an initial assignment does not scale well if a
small network becomes larger than expected and hence needs more addresses. The assignment authority
may not be able to allocate contiguous addresses if they were already assigned to another network.

Section 3.2.1 describes address assignments using leftmost, rightmost, and centermost strategies. With
these methods, organizations have the flexibility to aggregate their IPv6 address allocations efficiently.
Section 3.2.2 explains how organizations can obtain IPv6 addresses allocations globally through several
regional registry services.

  3.2.1   IPv6 Address Assignments

IPv6 network prefix assignment is the first step in network deployment. Understanding several methods
such as leftmost, rightmost, and centermost helps provide for flexibility and efficient aggregation of an
assigned IPv6 block, as described in RFC 3531, A Flexible Method for Managing the Assignment of Bits
of an IPv6 Address Block. If done without foresight, boundaries between sub-allocations become difficult
to move, and future increases in the use of address space cannot be kept contiguous.

The easiest but least flexible solution is to make block address assignment in order from the beginning of
the organization’s allocated IPv6 block. For example, if an organization is assigned the prefix
2001:0db8:9095::/48, prefixes can be distributed in simple sequential order:

2001:0db8:9095:0001::/64
2001:0db8:9095:0002::/64
2001:0db8:9095:0003::/64

This is the simplest way to distribute address assignments, but it lacks consideration for future needs and
does not take into account grouping networks by site for clean routing aggregation. Additionally, this
method makes it impossible to make an existing network assignment larger and keep its address space
contiguous.
