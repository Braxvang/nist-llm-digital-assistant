                                                                                     Guidelines on PDA Forensics


       password during a HotSync can be intercepted [Kin01]. Third party products exist that give
       users the ability to encrypt sensitive data and enhance overall security [Pmd02].

       Palm OS devices include an RS232-based “Palm Debugger” providing source and assembly
       level debugging, entered by issuing a keystroke combination. Two interfaces exist that
       monitor the serial port for communication. “Console Mode” interacts with a high-level
       debugger and is used mostly for manipulation of databases. “Debug Mode” is typically used
       for assembly and register-level debugging [Kin01].

2.3   Pocket PC

       Pocket PC grew out of the success of the Palm PDA and the growing demand for similar
       devices that had more processing power and networking capabilities. Microsoft entered the
       handheld device market with the Windows CE (WinCE) operating system, which was later
       augmented with additional functionality to produce Pocket PC (PPC).8 Windows CE supports
       a multitasking, multithreaded environment, which is inherited by Pocket PC. Applications
       running under Windows CE are protected from interfering with each other through memory
       management [Ket00]. Windows CE and PPC have evolved in tandem from versions WinCE
       2.0/PPC 2000 to WinCE 3.0/PPC 2002 to WinCE 4.2/PPC 2003 (PPC 2003 was rebranded as
       Windows Mobile 2003), through a number of feature upgrades. For example, early versions
       of ActiveSync were susceptible to brute force password attacks and denial of service attacks
       when synchronizing over a network [Meu02] and subsequently corrected. Vulnerabilities
       present on earlier devices may provide a means of bypassing security mechanisms, allowing
       forensic investigators access to data.

       Pocket PC runs on a number of processors, but primarily appears on devices having Xscale,
       ARM, or SHx processors. Various Pocket PC devices have ROM ranging from 32 to 64MB
       and RAM ranging from 32 to 128MB. PIM and other user data normally reside in RAM,
       while the operating system and support applications reside in ROM. An additional filestore
       can be allocated in unused ROM and made available for backing up files from RAM. One or
       more card slots, such as a Compact Flash (CF) or Secure Digital (SD) card slot, are typically
       supported. Additionally, some manufactures provide expansion capabilities, such as extension
       sleeves or modules that allow other technologies to be incorporated. Most Pocket PC devices
       use a lithium-ion battery. To prevent data loss when battery power is low, the lithium-ion
       battery must be recharged via the cradle, a power cable, or removed and replaced with a
       charged battery.

       The architecture for Windows CE devices consists of four layers: Application, Operating
       System, Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), and Hardware. A simplified diagram of
       the architecture of Windows CE is shown in Figure 3 below. Services are organized into
       modules, which can be included or excluded when building an image for a specific target
       system [Ges03]. Because most of the Windows CE operating system is written in the C
       language, the kernel and other modules can be ported to different processors by recompiling
       the code for a specific hardware architecture (e.g., StrongArm, XScale, etc.).

       The Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) Layer is the layer between the Operating
       System Layer and the Hardware Layer. It contains the OEM Adaptation Layer (OAL), which
