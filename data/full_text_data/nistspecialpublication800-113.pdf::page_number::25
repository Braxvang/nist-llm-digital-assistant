                                                                                          GUIDE TO SSL VPNS



When digital certificates are used for client authentication, each endpoint has its own digital certificate
that contains a public key. An endpoint uses the corresponding private key to digitally sign data before
sending it to the other endpoint, which verifies the signature using the peer’s public key. The digital
signature algorithm choices are RSA and the Digital Signature Standard (DSS). In addition to
authentication with certificates, the SSL VPN should also support certificate revocation list (CRL)
checking. The SSL VPN should be able to generate certificate-signing requests for its own digital
certificates. Note that most SSL VPNs that allow digital certificates for client authentication do so using
proprietary mechanisms; this is because client digital certificate authentication often does not work well
in typical Web browsers, which provide a difficult user interface for users who have many client
certificates issued for different purposes.

In addition to the authentication methods already mentioned, SSL VPNs also support integration with
external authentication servers such as RADIUS, Active Directory, and Lightweight Directory Access
Protocol (LDAP), allowing the VPNs to leverage existing authentication databases. SSL VPNs need
access to group information on the authentication servers since security and access control are often
expressed in terms of groups. Some SSL VPN products also use the information contained in
authentication servers to make additional access control decisions, such as restricting the number of bad
password attempts. Windows Active Directory (AD) is a common type of authentication server that can
be accessed directly or by using LDAP. Some SSL VPN products do not support direct AD
authentication. To access AD via LDAP, the administrator must have strong knowledge of the underlying
structure of the directory. In this case, it is easier and less time consuming to use an SSL VPN with the
capability to communicate directly with AD.

SSL VPN authentication methods may be applied on an individual or group basis. One class of users may
use a specific form of authentication and another class may use a different form of authentication. For
example, employees may authenticate via username and password, and business partners may
authenticate via digital certificates. Some SSL VPN products have the capability to combine various
forms of authentication methods, such as using a digital certificate in addition to a username and
password. Because integration with authentication servers is an area where SSL VPN products vary
greatly, potential products should be evaluated with an organization’s authentication servers to verify
interoperability.

3.3.5   Encryption and Integrity Protection

SSL VPNs use the underlying SSL protocol to protect the confidentiality of data using encryption and to
provide data integrity (ensuring that the data has not been modified). SSL VPN’s encryption and data
integrity come from SSL itself, not from any feature added by the SSL VPN product. SSL ensures the
encryption and data integrity between the user’s computer and the VPN gateway. Many SSL VPNs also
support using SSL between the gateway and Web hosts on the protected network for applications that
require encryption and integrity protection even within the protected network.

3.3.6   Access Control

SSL VPN products vary greatly in their access control features. Some products have an allow policy for
the entire system by default, which allows authenticated users complete unrestricted access to the
protected network. This may be adequate for a wide open network, but in most SSL VPN
implementations, the organization will be providing different services to different types of users and will
want controlled access. Granular access control supports one of the fundamental goals of SSL VPNs: to
provide access to a variety of groups and users such as mobile employees, branch offices, business
partners, and customers. Some SSL VPN products allow highly granular access control, which can
include the particular application or file being accessed, day and time, type of browser, authentication
