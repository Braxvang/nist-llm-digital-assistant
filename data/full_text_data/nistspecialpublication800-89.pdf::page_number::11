4 Assurance of Domain Parameter Validity
DSA and ECDSA depend on the arithmetic validity of the domain parameters. All parties
associated with the digital signature process shall have assurance of their validity prior to
using them. Intended signatories shall obtain this assurance prior to generating their keys
or using keys provided for their use by a TTP. A TTP that generates keys for an intended
signatory shall obtain assurance of domain parameter validity prior to generating keys. A
Certification Authority (CA) that issues certificates for intended signatories shall obtain
this assurance prior to issuing digital signature certificates. Verifiers shall obtain this
assurance prior to the verification of a digital signature. Users of the domain parameters
must have assurance that the domain parameters are valid for the lifetime of any keys that
are associated with the domain parameters.
Each entity shall obtain assurance that the domain parameters are valid using at least one
of the following methods:
     1. The entity itself generates the domain parameters according to the specified
        requirements (see FIPS 186-3 for DSA, and American National Standard (ANS)
        X9.62 for ECDSA).
