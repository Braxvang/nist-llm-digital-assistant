Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
direct transfers to individuals is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to direct transfers to individuals
information. Federal disbursement processes are generally tolerant of delay. In most cases,
disruption of access to information regarding direct transfers to individuals can be expected to
have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Disruption of disbursements to large
populations can do serious harm to public confidence in the agency and have a harmful impact
on the nationâ€™s economy (e.g., affect consumer confidents and retail sales for a month or
quarter). In such cases, the availability impact would be moderate.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
direct transfers to individuals is low.

D.23.3 Subsidies Information Type

Subsidies involve Federal Government financial transfers that reduce costs and/or increase
revenues of producers. Subsidies include the payment of funds from the government to affect the
production or prices of various goods to benefit the public. The recommended provisional
security categorization for the subsidies information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of subsidies information
on the ability of responsible agencies to pay government funds to affect the production or prices
of various goods to benefit the public benefit. In many cases, unauthorized disclosure of
subsidies information will have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or
individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Some information associated with
applications for subsidies includes information covered by the provisions of the Privacy Act of
1974. (The Privacy Act Information provisional impact levels are documented in the Personal
Identity and Authentication information type.) Unauthorized disclosure of large volumes of
information protected under the Privacy Act can be expected to have a serious effect on public
confidence in the agency. Also, premature unauthorized disclosure of planned subsidies policies
can affect financial/commodities markets, with associated potential adverse effects on the U.S.
economy and serious adverse effects on public confidence in the agency. This can result in
assignment of a moderate impact level to such information.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for most subsidies information is low.
