Foreword
                   With each day bringing new cybersecurity and privacy challenges and
                   advances, it is little wonder that many leaders feel as if they have been cast
                   in the role of the Red Queen in Lewis Carroll’s “Through the Looking-Glass.” In
                   that classic, the Queen tells Alice: "Now, here, you see, it takes all the running
                   you can do to keep in the same place. If you want to get somewhere else, you
                   must run at least twice as fast as that!"
                   It is true that leaders need to be nimble and move quickly to avoid the
                   consequences of cybersecurity and privacy attacks that threaten
                   their enterprises. That need extends to government agencies, like NIST,
                   that are trying to help meet those urgent challenges.
 At NIST, we know that – in addition to current needs – we also have a responsibility to keep an
 eye on the horizon, anticipating technology changes, threat environments, and cultural shifts
 that could affect the ability of organizations to manage cybersecurity and privacy risks.
 We've successfully carried out our work for nearly 50 years precisely because we not only
 address near-term challenges but also spend time thinking, exploring, listening, and speaking
 with others about the really big issues in store for all of us. We tackle current issues, but we
 also play the long game – the infinite game, if you will. We are mindful of the reality that
 cybersecurity and privacy challenges are evolving. At NIST, we make it our business to help
 others be prepared by anticipating needs and creating opportunities. We anchor our decisions
 with our feet firmly planted in both the present and the future. As you read this report about our
 efforts and accomplishments in 2020, you will understand how we have been addressing both
 short-term and long-term needs.
 For example, in the cryptographic arena, we are not only providing and improving practical
 tools and services for today, we also are rapidly moving forward to ensure that Post-Quantum
 Cryptography standards are ready when quantum computing becomes a real threat to
 the protective algorithms that we all take for granted. We have been integrating privacy
 considerations into the basic control suites that so many organizations rely on now, and we are
 widening our privacy focus to encompass the broader privacy concerns that arise as mobile
 computing, e-commerce, and the Internet of Things advance. The intentional addition of the
 word “privacy” in this report’s title reflects changing technological capabilities and society’s
 expectations.
 This year’s annual report is grouped into nine priority areas for NIST, with most – but not all
 – of the work being conducted by our Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) and in close
 collaboration with the private and public sectors. While these represent areas that NIST believes
 merit the bulk of our attention for the foreseeable future, the report also includes other specific
 projects of importance that do not fit neatly into these buckets.
 All of this work adds up to cultivating trust in information, systems, and technologies. That’s
 our charge. That’s our reason for being. I encourage you to review our recent progress and to
 help us look well beyond the here-and-now of technology, cybersecurity, and privacy; this will
 enable all of us to meet the future with confidence that we can manage the emerging risks and
 change the world for the better for the next 50 years.
