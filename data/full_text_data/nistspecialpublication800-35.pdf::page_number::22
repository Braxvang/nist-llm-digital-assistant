                                                                                  NIST Special Publication 800-35



A broad range of possible service arrangements exists. An organization may select its internal employees
and teams to provide the service required, or it may choose to fully export the service to an external
service provider. This external service provider could be any organization because this term does not
intend to refer to only an external commercial service provider. For example, an organization may choose
to employ an external group from a subsidiary organization, a business unit, or a commercial service
provider.

3.3   Overview Of IT Security Services Management Tools

Because of the potential harm that can result from poor security, IT security managers and decision
makers need to use effective management tools to increase the likelihood of success. Two important tools
are metrics and service agreements.

Overview of Metrics

Metrics are a management tool that facilitates decision-making and accountability through practical and
relevant data collection, data analysis, and performance data reporting. The importance of a metrics
program is discussed in NIST SP 800-55, Security Metrics Guide for Information Technology Systems. A
full and complete discussion of computer security metrics is beyond the scope of this document; however,
IT security service managers should understand what metrics are and when they should be used.

For example, a metric for a management service, such as a training and awareness program, might be the
percentage of new employees who receive IT security training within their first 30 days on the job.
Gathering this data repeatedly, over time, will allow managers to assess how well the current training
service provider performs its task today, to set targets for the service provider in the future, and then to
assess how well it met the desired target. The metrics process is discussed in the next chapter.

Overview of Service Agreements

A service agreement serves as the agreement between the service provider and the organization requesting
the service. As service arrangements become more complex and employ commercial service providers,
the formality of the agreement should increase. A fully externalized service arrangement with a
commercial entity, for example, will require a formal contract so that managers can hold service providers
accountable for their actions. A fully internal service arrangement may require a less formal agreement,
perhaps an agreed-on reporting process or an MOA. Regardless of the arrangement, all parties should be
aware of their roles and responsibilities. Section 4.4.1 discusses the importance of service agreements.

3.4   Overview of IT Security Services Issues

Implementing a security service and service arrangement can be complex. Each security service has its
own costs and risks associated with it, as does each service arrangement. Making a decision based on one
issue can have major implications for the organization in other areas. The decision makers will have to
balance near-term cost/value with potential long-term risks associated with new vulnerabilities, attrition,
potential loss of employee productivity/morale and internal functional skills, and other impacts. The
degree of completeness of the list of factors and issues considered will vary by organization; however, the
factors and issues can be grouped into six categories as identified in Table 3-2.
