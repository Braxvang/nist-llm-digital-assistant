530   Each DRBG instantiation is initialized with input from some randomness source that establishes
531   the security strengths that can be supported by the DRBG. During this process, an optional but
532   recommended personalization string may also be used to differentiate between instantiations in
533   addition to the output of the randomness source. The personalization string could, for example,
534   include information particular to the instantiation or contain entropy collected during system
535   activity (e.g., from a non-validated entropy source). An implementation should allow the use of a
536   personalization string. More information on personalization strings is provided in [SP800-90A].
537   A DRBG may be implemented to accept further input during operation from the randomness
538   source (e.g., to reseed the DRBG) and/or additional input from inside or outside of the
539   cryptographic module that contains the DRBG. This additional input could, for example, include
540   information particular to a request for generation or reseeding or could contain entropy collected
541   during system activity (e.g., from a validated or non-validated entropy source). 3

542   2.4.2. DRBG Reseeding, Prediction Resistance, and Recovery from Compromise
543   Under some circumstances, the internal state of an RBG (containing the RBG’s secret information)
544   could be leaked to an adversary. This would typically happen as the result of a side-channel attack
545   or tampering with a hardware device, and it may not be detectable by the RBG or any consuming
546   application.
547   All DRBGs in [SP800-90A] are designed with backtracking resistance − that is, learning the
548   DRBG’s current internal state does not provide knowledge of previous outputs. Since all RBGs in
549   SP 800-90C are based on the use of SP 800-90A DRBGs, they also inherit this property. However,

        Entropy provided in additional input does not affect the instantiated security strength of the DRBG instantiation. However, it is good practice to
      include any additional entropy when available to provide more security.
