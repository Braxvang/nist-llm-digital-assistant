Appendix A—Incident Handling Scenarios

Incident handling scenarios provide an inexpensive and effective way to build incident response skills and
identify potential issues with incident response processes. The incident response team or team members
are presented with a scenario and a list of related questions. The team then discusses each question and
determines the most likely answer. The goal is to determine what the team would really do and to
compare that with policies, procedures, and generally recommended practices to identify discrepancies or
deficiencies. For example, the answer to one question may indicate that the response would be delayed
because the team lacks a piece of software or because another team does not provide off-hours support.
The questions listed below are applicable to almost any scenario. Each question is followed by a reference
to the related section(s) of the document. After the questions are scenarios, each of which is followed by
additional incident-specific questions. Organizations are strongly encouraged to adapt these questions and
scenarios for use in their own incident response exercises.48

A.1 Scenario Questions
Preparation:
     1. Would the organization consider this activity to be an incident? If so, which of the organization’s
        policies does this activity violate? (Section 2.1)
     2. What measures are in place to attempt to prevent this type of incident from occurring or to limit
        its impact? (Section 3.1.2)
Detection and Analysis:
     1. What precursors of the incident, if any, might the organization detect? Would any precursors
        cause the organization to take action before the incident occurred? (Sections 3.2.2, 3.2.3)
     2. What indicators of the incident might the organization detect? Which indicators would cause
        someone to think that an incident might have occurred? (Sections 3.2.2, 3.2.3)
     3. What additional tools might be needed to detect this particular incident? (Section 3.2.3)
     4. How would the incident response team analyze and validate this incident? What personnel would
        be involved in the analysis and validation process? (Section 3.2.4)
     5. To which people and groups within the organization would the team report the incident? (Section
        3.2.7)
     6. How would the team prioritize the handling of this incident? (Section 3.2.6)
Containment, Eradication, and Recovery:
     1. What strategy should the organization take to contain the incident? Why is this strategy preferable
        to others? (Section 3.3.1)
     2. What could happen if the incident were not contained? (Section 3.3.1)
     3. What additional tools might be needed to respond to this particular incident? (Sections 3.3.1,
        3.3.4)
     4. Which personnel would be involved in the containment, eradication, and/or recovery processes?
        (Sections 3.3.1, 3.3.4)
