D.3.3. CISA ICS Alerts, Advisories, and Reports
CISA Alert is intended to provide timely notification to critical infrastructure owners and
operators concerning threats or activities with the potential to impact critical infrastructure
computing networks.
Advisories provide timely information about current security issues, vulnerabilities, and exploits.
CISA maintains a list of ICS-related Technical Information Papers (TIPs), Annual Reports (Year
in Review), and third-party products that it considers to be of interest to persons engaged in
protecting ICS.

D.3.5. MITRE ATT&CK for ICS
MITRE ATT&CK for ICS is a curated knowledge base for cyber adversary behavior in the ICS
technology domain. It reflects the various phases of an adversaryâ€™s attack life cycle and the
assets and systems they are known to target. ATT&CK for ICS originated from MITRE internal
research focused on applying the ATT&CK methodology to the ICS technology domain.

D.3.6. NIST Cybersecurity Framework
Recognizing that the national and economic security of the United States depends on the reliable
functioning of critical infrastructure, the President issued Executive Order 13636, Improving
Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity, in February 2013 [EO13636]. It directed NIST to work
with stakeholders to develop a voluntary framework for reducing cyber risks to critical
infrastructure based on existing standards, guidelines, and practices.
NIST released the first version of the Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure
Cybersecurity on February 12, 2014. The Framework was created through collaboration between
