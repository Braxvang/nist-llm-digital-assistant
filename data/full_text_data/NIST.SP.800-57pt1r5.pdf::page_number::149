                                                                                                 When the key-recovery operation is requested by the key’s owner, the following actions shall be

                                                                                                       then the key may be recovered and used as discussed in Section 9.4.2.
                                                                                                 The following subsections provide discussions to assist an organization in determining whether or

                                                                                                 The private key of a signature key pair (the private signature key) is used by the owner of the key
                                                                                                 pair to apply digital signatures to information. The corresponding public key (the public signature-

                                                                                                 B.3.1.1    Private Signature Keys
                                                                                                 In general, private signature keys shall not be archived (see Table 9 in Section 8.3.1). Key backup
                                                                                                 is not usually desirable for the private key of a signing key pair since support for the non-

                                                                                                 replacing the private signature key and having its corresponding public signature-verification key
                                                                                                 distributed (in accordance with Section 8.1.5.1) in a timely manner may not be possible under

                                                                                                 This may be the case, for example, for the private signature key of a CA.
