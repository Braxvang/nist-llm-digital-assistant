                                                                GUIDELINES FOR THE SECURE DEPLOYMENT OF IPV6


RFC 5375, IPv6 Unicast Address Assignment Considerations, specifies best practices to follow when
creating a numbering plan. Site allocations are normally provided as a /48, /56 or /64.

 IPv6 Unicast Address Assignment Considerations addresses exceptions to this rule. It provides the
following factors as considerations when designing a number plan:

        Prefix aggregation
        Network growth
        ULA (Unique Local Address) usage in large networks
        Sparse subnet numbering.
These design considerations are mostly operational concerns. A good numbering plan will streamline
security operations by simplifying access control lists and firewall rule sets, identifying ownership of
sites, links, and interfaces, and allowing for the rapid location of interfaces. IPv6 Unicast Address
Assignment Considerations states that the lack of a numbering plan could slow down the deployment of
IPv6.

  6.2.2   Hierarchical Addressing to Support Security Segmentation

Network provisioning is different in IPv6 than in IPv4. With IPv4, the administrator is concerned with
creating subnets that can support enough available IP addresses for current and future requirements. The
more subnets created, the greater the number of lost addresses due to broadcast and subnet addresses.
With IPv6, the addresses are so large that a subnet can support current and future addressing
requirements. Because address space availability is not an issue with IPv6, the administrator can
concentrate on creating a hierarchical address-numbering plan and not on address availability. A
numbering plan should support network segmentation. Most networks are composed of different
communities with differing requirements for access and protection. By segmenting a network,
administrators can meet these various groups’ requirements with access control rules to protect sensitive
sites, links, and hosts.

IPv6 distinguishes itself from IPv4 by identifying not just a host by an address but also by identifying the
regional provider based on the global hierarchy enforced by the RIRs. The network prefix of an address
identifies an RIR and an ISP providing the address. IPv6 allows 16 subnet bits (/48) for the Site-Level
Aggregation Identifier (SLA). Organizations can use these 16 bits to create a site hierarchy. Some
suggested methods of subnetting include:

        Sequentially numbering subnets
        VLAN (Virtual LAN) number
        AS number
        IPv4 subnet number
        Physical location (building, city, county, etc.)
        Functional unit (Human Resources [HR], Operations, Finance, etc.).
The goal of address hierarchy design is to give an organization the ability to group assets logically and to
simplify administration and security. Government agencies should be aware that switching from an
environment in which NAT (Network Address Translation) provides IP addresses to unique global IPv6
