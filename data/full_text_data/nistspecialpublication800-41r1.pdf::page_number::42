                                                                            GUIDELINES ON FIREWALLS AND FIREWALL POLICY


Be aware that firewall rulesets can become increasingly complicated with age. For example, a new
firewall ruleset might contain entries to accommodate only outbound user traffic and inbound email
traffic (along with allowing the return inbound connections required by TCP/IP)—but will likely contain
far more rules by the time the firewall system reaches the end of its first year in production. While new
user or business requirements typically drive these changes, they can also reflect other influences within
an organization. It is important to review the firewall policy often. Such a review can uncover rules that
are no longer needed as well as new policy requirements that need to be added to the firewall.

It is best to review the firewall policy at regular intervals so that such reviews do not only happen during
policy or security audits (or, worse, only during emergencies). Each review should include a detailed
examination of all changes since the last regular review, particularly who made the changes and under
what circumstances. It is also useful to occasionally perform overall ruleset audits by people who are not
part of the normal policy review team to get an outside view of how the policy matches the organization’s
goals. Some firewalls have tools that can do automated reviews of policies, looking for such things as
redundant rules or missing rules that are widely recommended. If such tools are available for an
organization’s firewall, they should be used periodically, probably as part of the regular policy review.

Organizations may want to consider conducting penetration testing to assess the overall security of their
network environment. This testing can be used to verify that a firewall ruleset is performing as intended
by generating network traffic and monitoring how it is handled by the firewall in comparison with its
expected response. Penetration testing should be employed in addition to, rather than instead of, a
conventional audit program. 22
