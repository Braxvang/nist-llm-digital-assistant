4.1.1   Coordination Relationships

An incident response team within an organization may participate in different types of coordination
arrangements, depending on the type of organization with which it is coordinating. For example, the team
members responsible for the technical details of incident response may coordinate with operational
colleagues at partner organizations to share strategies for mitigating an attack spanning multiple
organizations. Alternatively, during the same incident, the incident response team manager may
coordinate with ISACs to satisfy necessary reporting requirements and seek advice and additional
resources for successfully responding to the incident. Table 4-1 provides some examples of coordination
relationships that may exist when collaborating with outside organizations.
