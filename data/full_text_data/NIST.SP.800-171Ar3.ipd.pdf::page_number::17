      NIST SP 800-171Ar3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                                 Assessing CUI Security Requirements
      November 2023

310       The Fundamentals
311   The process used by organizations and assessors to assess the security requirements in NIST SP
312   800-171 includes (1) preparing for the assessment, (2) developing a security assessment plan, (3)
313   conducting the assessment, and (4) documenting, analyzing, and reporting the assessment
314   results. 2 The remainder of this section describes the structure and content of the procedures used
315   to assess the security requirements and the importance of assurance cases in providing the
316   evidence necessary to determine compliance with the requirements.

317          Assessment Procedures
318   The security requirements in NIST SP 800-171 are organized into 17 families, as illustrated in
319   Table 1. The assessment procedures in Section 3 are grouped by similar family designations to
320   ensure the completeness and consistency of assessments. The procedures have been derived from
321   the assessment procedures in NIST SP 800-53A [5].

324   An assessment procedure consists of an assessment objective and a set of potential assessment
325   methods and objects that can be used to conduct the assessment. Each potential assessment
326   objective includes a determination statement related to the security requirement. If there is an
327   organization-defined parameter (ODP) in the security requirement, then the assessment objective
328   begins with a determination statement related to the definition of the ODP. The determination
329   statements are linked to the content of the security requirements to help ensure traceability of the
330   assessment results to the requirements.

331   Assessment objects identify the specific items being assessed and can include specifications,
332   mechanisms, activities, and individuals. Specifications are the documented artifacts 3 (e.g., plans,
333   policies, procedures, requirements, functional and assurance specifications, architectures, and
334   design documentation) associated with a system. Mechanisms are the hardware, software, and
335   firmware safeguards implemented within a system. Activities are the protection-related actions
336   supporting a system that involve people (e.g., conducting system backup operations, exercising
337   an incident response plan, and monitoring network traffic). Individuals are the people applying
338   the specifications, mechanisms, or activities described above.

       NIST SP 800-53A [5] provides additional information on the assessment process and the individuals steps listed above.

       Artifacts may be in formats other than documents (e.g., databases, Governance, Risk, and Compliance [GRC] tools, or Open Security Controls
      Assessment Language [OSCAL])
