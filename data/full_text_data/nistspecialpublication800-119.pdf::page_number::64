                                                               GUIDELINES FOR THE SECURE DEPLOYMENT OF IPV6


4.    IPv6 Advanced Topics

This chapter provides specific details about the status, requirements, capabilities, and security impacts of
more advanced IPv6 topics such as multihoming, multicast, quality of service, mobile IPv6, jumbograms,
address selection, DHCPv6, and IPv6 renumbering. As of the writing of this guide, some of these topics
have not yet been fully specified or implemented and are not ready to deploy. In these cases, this is noted
and interim methods are recommended where appropriate.

4.1   Multihoming

Multihoming means having the ability to utilize more than one connection to the Internet. A host, for
example, may have more than one network connection (e.g., 100baseT and WiFi); a connection to a LAN
with more than one router to the Internet on it; or a connection to a single router that has more than one
Internet connection. Frequently, one refers to multihoming for an entire site, which may be a home, small
office, or campus location within a large enterprise.

Multihoming is extremely useful but has a potentially large impact on the global Internet architecture.
This section describes the motivations for multihoming, the problems it creates, the requirements for a
good solution, potential solutions, and their security implications.

Users have several strong motivations for multihoming. First and foremost, having more than one
Internet connection provides greater reliability and resiliency should one link fail or one ISP have a
prolonged outage. Other reasons for multihoming include better performance (load balancing or QoS
differentiation) and policy enforcement (including security policy).

While multihoming offers obvious advantages, it is complicated by another issue: the use of Internet
addresses for two purposes. On the one hand, addresses are used for forwarding packets to the right
location. On the other hand, they are used for identifying an endpoint, e.g., a transport protocol (TCP or
UDP addresses plus port numbers) or IPsec security association (destination address plus security
parameters index). For multihoming to work, either the entire Internet has to know multiple paths to a
multihomed site, or the nodes at a site have to be able to use multiple addresses seamlessly and
transparently. The former implies enormous growth in the Internet’s core forwarding tables. The latter
implies that nodes have to cope with TCP connections, UDP responses, IPsec security associations, and
other upper layer protocols (ULPs) tied to addresses.

Multihoming solutions also need to satisfy other requirements. They need to avoid causing problems
with fragmentation, renumbering, and domain names. They need to scale to the size of the global Internet
and not affect performance too greatly. They also need to work with firewalls and ingress filtering.

  4.1.1   Differences between IPv4 and IPv6 Multihoming

Any multihoming solution must satisfy two main goals. The first is to make multihoming transparent to
upper layer protocols. Otherwise, multihoming is no better than changing service providers and
renumbering one’s network manually. The second is to avoid causing explosive growth in the global
routing and forwarding tables. Dealing with this growth is the number one challenge Internet engineers
face today, with IPv4 or IPv6, with or without multihoming.

Compared with IPv6, IPv4 interfaces are normally limited to a single address, the entire supply of IPv4
network prefixes is much more limited, and the addresses themselves are four times shorter, all of which
constrains the problem somewhat. IPv4 users with provider independent (PI) addresses can achieve fully
transparent multihoming with resiliency and load balancing at the expense of global router table growth.
