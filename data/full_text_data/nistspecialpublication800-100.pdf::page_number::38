CHAPTER 4                                                    Awareness and Training


        plan is needed to identify stakeholders, types of information that is to be
        disseminated, channels for disseminating information, and the frequency of
        information exchanges. The plan also identifies whether the communications
        are one-way or two-way. Activities that support communication include:
        – Assessment (as is/to be models);
        – Strategic plan; and
        – Program implementation.
   • Outreach. Outreach is critical for leveraging best practices within the federal
     sector. It has two elements for intra- and interagency awareness. The intra-
     agency element promotes internal awareness of information security. A Web
     portal that provides a one-stop-shop for security information can be an
     effective outreach tool. Policy, frequently asked questions (FAQs), security e-
     newsletters, links to resources, and other useful information are easily
     accessible to all employees. This tool promotes a consistent and standard
     message. The interagency element promotes sharing among agencies and is
     used to leverage awareness and training resources.

4.2.2    Training
    Information security training strives to produce relevant and needed security
knowledge and skills within the workforce. Training supports competency
development and helps personnel understand and learn how to perform their security
role. The most important difference between training and awareness is that training
seeks to teach skills that allow a person to perform a specific function, while
awareness seeks to focus an individual’s attention on an issue or a set of issues.
   Role-based training provides security courses that are tailored to the specific
needs of each group of people who have been identified as having significant
responsibilities for information security in their organization. NIST SP 800-16
provides guidance for establishing role- and performance-based security training
programs.

4.2.3    Education
    Education integrates all of the security skills and competencies of the various
functional specialties into a common body of knowledge and adds a multidisciplinary
study of concepts, issues, and principles (technological and social). Information
security education strives to produce information security specialists and
professionals who are capable of vision and proactive response. Several colleges and
universities provide academic programs to support the information security needs of
the public and private sectors. Many of these schools partner with the federal sector
to accomplish research and development tasks to improve information security.

4.2.4    Certification
     In response to the growing demand for information security personnel within
federal agencies, there has been a movement toward increased professional
standards for federal and contracted security personnel. This “professionalization”
integrates training, education, and experience with an assessment mechanism to
validate knowledge and skills, resulting in the “certification” of a predefined level of
competence. The relationship among these professional development elements is
illustrated in Figure 4-2.
