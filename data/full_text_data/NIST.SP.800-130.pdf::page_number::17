2.4 Framework Topics and Requirements
This Framework contains a list of Framework Topics (FTs) (corresponding to the section
headings) and, for each topic, a set of Framework Requirements (FRs) that need to be
satisfied when designing a CKMS (see Figure 2 below). These requirements are placed
on the CKMS design.

                  Figure 2: Framework of Topics and Requirements

This Framework does not impose any specific policies, procedures, security
requirements, or system design constraints on the CKMS; it simply requires that they be
documented in a structured manner so that CKMS designs can be understood and
compared.

This Framework is not oriented to a particular CKMS or class of CKMS for a sector
(such as the U.S. Federal Government, Aerospace, Health Care, etc.). This Framework is
intended to be applicable to all CKMS.

FR:2.3 A compliant CKMS design shall describe design selections and provide
documentation as required by the requirements of this Framework.

2.5 CKMS Design
The purpose of a CKMS design is to describe how a system can be built to provide
cryptographic keys to the entities that will use those keys to protect sensitive data. The
high-level description of the CKMS should indicate the uses of each key type, where and
