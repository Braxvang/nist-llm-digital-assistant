CHAPTER 2                                                      Information Security Governance


    Agencies in the process of establishing or changing their information security
governance structure should consider the following key factors to determine the
optimal extent of the centralization or decentralization:
      • Agency size;
      • Agency mission and its level of diversification or homogeneity;
      • Existing agency IT infrastructure;
      • Existing federal and internal governance requirements;
      • Size of agency budget;
      • Agency information security capabilities;
      • Number of, and distance between, physical locations; and
      • Decision-making practices and desired rate of change in information security
        practices.
    To the degree that these factors are limited or varied, an organization’s hybrid
information security governance structure will fall somewhere between the extremes
of a completely centralized or decentralized structure, as depicted in Figure 2-3. An
organization’s placement on this continuum may also shift over time in response to
changing internal factors or external requirements.
    Since information security governance structure is highly dependent on the
overall organizational structure, organizations are often limited in their choices about
how to organize their information security governance activities. Agencies should be
cognizant of the characteristics and challenges that a centralized or decentralized
structure presents and work within their respective organizations to ensure the best
use of information security resources within the boundaries of their own structure.

2.2.3 Key Governance Roles and Responsibilities 7
    There are several governance stakeholders common to most organizations that
span the organization. These stakeholders include senior leadership, a CIO,
information security personnel, and a chief financial officer (CFO), among others. The
specific requirements of each role may differ with the degree of information security
governance centralization or in response to the specific missions and needs of an
organization.
