1095   Note that the optional MSCUID data element was deprecated in a previous version and
1096   eliminated in this version of SP 800-73. However, historic retired key management certificates
1097   MAY still include the MSCUID element, so it is retained as an optional data element above. This
1098   applies to all of the retired key management key objects represented in Table 21 - Table 40.

          This is the recommended length. The certificate size can exceed the indicated length value.
       24
          The numeric values indicated in keysWithOnCardCerts and keysWithOffCardCerts are represented as unsigned binary integers.
       25
          The offCardCertURL data element shall be present if keysWithOffCardCerts is greater than zero and shall be absent if both
       keysWithOnCardCerts and keysWithOffCardCerts are zero. The offCardCertURL may be present if keyWithOffCardCerts is zero but
       keysWithOnCardCerts is greater than zero.
