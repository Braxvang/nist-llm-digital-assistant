657   5.   Authenticator and Veriﬁer Requirements
658   This section is normative.
659   This section provides the detailed requirements specific to each type of authenticator.
660   With the exception of reauthentication requirements specified in Sec. 4 and the
661   requirement for phishing resistance at AAL3 described in Sec. 5.2.5, the technical
662   requirements for each of the authenticator types are the same regardless of the AAL at
663   which the authenticator is used.

664   5.1. Requirements by Authenticator Type
665   5.1.1. Memorized Secrets
666   A Memorized Secret authenticator — commonly referred to as a password or, if numeric,
667   a PIN — is a secret value intended to be chosen and memorized by the user. Memorized
668   secrets need to be of sufficient complexity and secrecy that it would be impractical for
669   an attacker to guess or otherwise discover the correct secret value. A memorized secret is
670   something you know.
671   The requirements in this section apply to centrally verified memorized secrets that
672   are used as an independent authentication factor, sent over an authenticated protected
673   channel to the verifier of a CSP. Memorized secrets that are used locally by a multi-factor
674   authenticator are referred to as activation secrets and discussed in Sec. 5.2.11.

675   5.1.1.1. Memorized Secret Authenticators
676   Memorized secrets SHALL be at least 8 characters in length. Memorized secrets SHALL
677   be either chosen by the subscriber or assigned randomly by the CSP.
678   If the CSP disallows a chosen memorized secret because it is on a blocklist of commonly
679   used, expected, or compromised values (see Sec. 5.1.1.2), the subscriber SHALL be
680   required to choose a different memorized secret. No other complexity requirements for
681   memorized secrets SHALL be imposed. A rationale for this is presented in Appendix A
682   Strength of Memorized Secrets.

683   5.1.1.2. Memorized Secret Veriﬁers
684   Verifiers SHALL require memorized secrets to be at least 8 characters in length. Verifiers
685    SHOULD permit memorized secrets to be at least 64 characters in length. All printing
686   ASCII [RFC20] characters as well as the space character SHOULD be acceptable in
687   memorized secrets. Unicode [ISO/ISC 10646] characters SHOULD be accepted as well.
688   Verifiers MAY make allowances for likely mistyping, such as removing leading and
689   trailing whitespace characters prior to verification or allowing verification of memorized
690   secrets with differing case for the leading character, provided memorized secrets remain
691   at least 8 characters in length after such processing.
