GUIDE TO INTRUSION DETECTION AND PREVENTION SYSTEMS (IDPS)



Incident: A violation or imminent threat of violation of computer security policies, acceptable use
policies, or standard security practices.

Inline Sensor: A sensor deployed so that the network traffic it is monitoring must pass through it.

Intrusion Detection: The process of monitoring the events occurring in a computer system or network
and analyzing them for signs of possible incidents.

Intrusion Detection and Prevention: The process of monitoring the events occurring in a computer
system or network, analyzing them for signs of possible incidents, and attempting to stop detected
possible incidents. See also “intrusion prevention”.

Intrusion Detection System Load Balancer: A device that aggregates and directs network traffic to
monitoring systems, such as intrusion detection and prevention sensors.

Intrusion Detection System: Software that automates the intrusion detection process.

Intrusion Prevention: The process of monitoring the events occurring in a computer system or network,
analyzing them for signs of possible incidents, and attempting to stop detected possible incidents. See
also “intrusion detection and prevention”.

Intrusion Prevention System: Software that has all the capabilities of an intrusion detection system and
can also attempt to stop possible incidents. Also called an intrusion detection and prevention system.

Jamming: Emitting electromagnetic energy on a wireless network’s frequencies to make them unusable
by the network.

Malware: A program that is inserted into a system, usually covertly, with the intent of compromising the
confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the victim’s data, applications, or operating system or of
otherwise annoying or disrupting the victim.

Management Network: A separate network strictly designed for security software management.

Management Server: A centralized device that receives information from sensors or agents and
manages them.

Network-Based Intrusion Detection and Prevention System: An intrusion detection and prevention
system that monitors network traffic for particular network segments or devices and analyzes the network
and application protocol activity to identify and stop suspicious activity.

Network Behavior Analysis System: An intrusion detection and prevention system that examines
network traffic to identify and stop threats that generate unusual traffic flows.

Network Tap: A direct connection between a sensor and the physical network media itself, such as a
fiber optic cable.

Passive Fingerprinting: Analyzing packet headers for certain unusual characteristics or combinations of
characteristics that are exhibited by particular operating systems or applications.

Passive Sensor: A sensor that is deployed so that it monitors a copy of the actual network traffic.
