information is actually being protected. Additionally, the systems and geographic region that
enterprise information is sent to are important to understand. Additional information for secure
VPN implementation can be found in NIST SP 800-77 Rev. 1, Guide to IPsec VPNs [44], and
NIST SP 800-113, Guide to SSL VPNs [45].
Risk from the use of untrusted networks can be reduced by using strong encryption technologies
such as a VPN to protect the confidentiality and integrity of communications, as well as using
mutual authentication mechanisms to verify the identities of both endpoints before transmitting
data. The use of a trusted VPN requires an organization to do its due diligence regarding the
security of the VPN service provider and infrastructure. Another possible mitigation is to
prohibit the use of unsecured WiFi networks, such as those running known vulnerable protocols.
VPNs can also assist in ensuring that all enterprise-approved applications on the device rely on
TLS by default and are unable to be downgraded to HTTP. In addition, configuring DNS to
leverage TLS can help protect the confidentiality of DNS requests.
Access to enterprise resources has evolved beyond the establishment of perimeters that define a
safe zone and free range to access resources when you are located “within” the enterprise.
Organizations should consider other technologies besides VPNs to implement zero trust
architectures that provide more secure connections to resources. NIST SP 800-207, Zero Trust
Architecture, describes the principles to take into consideration when allowing users, devices,
and services access to enterprise resources [51].

4.3.6. Rapid Adoption of Software Updates
Developers are constantly improving their technology not only to provide better functionality and
to fix software bugs and other errors. These technological improvements and security fixes are a
key reason to upgrade a device’s software and firmware. It is important that a mobile device
receives these updates or else it will remain in a vulnerable state. These updates are not typically
performed automatically unless a device is configured to do so. Software updates are often
developed and provided for the user to manually download and install on their device. Updates
should be rapidly deployed, as the longer a mobile device is vulnerable to exploits, the longer
enterprise information and all other information is vulnerable to compromise.
EMMs can notify the user when OS and app updates are available. If the user does not make the
appropriate updates, the administrator can enforce compliance actions. These actions include
blocking or restricting access to enterprise information or the complete removal of enterprise
information on the mobile device. If app management is enabled, EMMs can manually update
apps and send them to mobile devices.
When patching or updating the OS or an app, enterprise administrators should consider many of
the same issues that arise in standard IT environments: the urgency of the update, the likelihood
that an update will “break” mission-critical functionality for users, and the ability of the user, the
mobile device, and affected systems to roll back failed patches. The urgency of an update is
affected by the severity of the potential impact of a vulnerability’s exploitation (e.g., critical,
important, moderate, low). For example, the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
[19] [20] is a numerical scoring system used to communicate the severity of vulnerabilities.
NIST uses the CVSS to score the vulnerabilities found in the NVD. Updates to mobile apps may
