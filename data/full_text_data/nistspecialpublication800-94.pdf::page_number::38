GUIDE TO INTRUSION DETECTION AND PREVENTION SYSTEMS (IDPS)



    Appliances often use a customized, hardened operating system (OS) that administrators are not
    intended to access directly.
 Software Only. Some vendors sell sensor software without an appliance. Administrators can install
  the software onto hosts that meet certain specifications. The sensor software might include a
  customized OS, or it might be installed onto a standard OS just as any other application would.
4.2.2   Network Architectures and Sensor Locations

Organizations should consider using management networks for their network-based IDPS deployments
whenever feasible. If an IDPS is deployed without a separate management network, organizations should
consider whether or not a VLAN is needed to protect the IDPS communications.

In addition to choosing the appropriate network for the components, administrators also need to decide
where the IDPS sensors should be located. Sensors can be deployed in one of two modes:

 Inline. An inline sensor is deployed so that the network traffic it is monitoring must pass through it,
  much like the traffic flow associated with a firewall. In fact, some inline sensors are hybrid
  firewall/IDPS devices, while others are simply IDPSs. The primary motivation for deploying IDPS
  sensors inline is to enable them to stop attacks by blocking network traffic. Inline sensors are
  typically placed where network firewalls and other network security devices would be placedâ€”at the
  divisions between networks, such as connections with external networks and borders between
  different internal networks that should be segregated. Inline sensors that are not hybrid firewall/IDPS
  devices are often deployed on the more secure side of a network division so that they have less traffic
  to process. Figure 4-2 shows such a deployment. Sensors can also be placed on the less secure side
  of a network division to provide protection for and reduce the load on the dividing device, such as a
  firewall.
