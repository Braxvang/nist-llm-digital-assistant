In 2009, a different padding scheme was specified in RFC 5649 [4], referencing elements of the
specification in [11]. The resulting algorithm, called AES Key Wrap With Padding, is essentially
equivalent to KWP as specified in this Recommendation.

The differences between KW, KWP, and TKW as specified in this Recommendation and their
earlier specifications are described in Appendix B.1.

4     Definitions and Notation

4.1     Definitions
approved                 FIPS-approved or NIST-recommended: an algorithm or
                         technique that is either 1) specified in a FIPS or a NIST
                         Recommendation, or 2) adopted in a FIPS or a NIST
                         Recommendation.

authenticated-           A function that encrypts plaintext into ciphertext and provides
encryption function      a means for the associated authenticated-decryption function to
                         verify the authenticity and, therefore, the integrity of the data.

authenticated-           A function that decrypts purported ciphertext into
decryption function      corresponding plaintext and verifies the authenticity and,
                         therefore, the integrity of the data. The output is either the
                         plaintext or an indication that the plaintext is not authentic.

authenticity             The property that data originated from its purported source. In
                         the context of a key-wrap algorithm, the source of authentic
                         data is an entity with access to an implementation of the
                         authenticated-encryption function with the KEK.

bit                      A binary digit: 0 or 1.

bit string               A finite, ordered sequence of bits.

block                    For a given block cipher, a bit string whose length is the block
                         size of the block cipher.

block cipher             A parameterized family of permutations on bit strings of a
                         fixed length; the parameter that determines the permutation is a
                         bit string called the key.

block cipher mode of     An algorithm for the cryptographic transformation of data that
operation                is based on a block cipher.
