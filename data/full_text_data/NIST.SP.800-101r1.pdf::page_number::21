TDMA is also used to refer specifically to the standard covered by IS-136. Using the term
TDMA to refer to a general technique or a specific type of cellular network can be a source of
confusion. For example, although GSM uses a TDMA air interface (i.e., the general
technique), as does iDEN, neither of those systems is compatible with TDMA cellular
networks that follow IS-136. Many mobile forensic tools refer to these devices as
iDEN/TDMA phones. Mobile devices operating over the iDEN network often utilize a Push-
To-Talk (PTT) function provide subscribers with the ability to communicate with one another
over a cellular network in a “walkie-talkie” fashion.

Integrated Digital Enhanced Network (iDEN), a mobile telecommunications technology
developed by Motorola provided the benefits of a two-way radio system and a cellular
telephone. The iDEN project originally began as MIRS (Motorola Integrated Radio System) in
early 1991 and was phased out the summer of 2013 for the US markets although coverage still
exists in Mexico and Canada.

Digital AMPS (D-AMPS), IS-54 and IS-136 are 2G mobile phone systems once prevalent
within the United States and Canada in the 1990s. Existing networks were mostly replaced by
GSM/GPRS or CDMA2000 technologies.

Mobile devices work with certain subsets of the network types mentioned, typically those
associated with a service provider from whom the phone was obtained and with whom a
service agreement was entered. Mobile devices may also be acquired without service from any
manufacturer, vendor, or other source and subsequently have their service set up separately
with a service provider or network operator. Mobile devices that are permitted to be
provisioned to more than one specific carrier are commonly referred to as “unlocked” as they
may be used on a variety of carriers by switching UICC’s for GSM mobile devices.

Mobile devices do exist that provide the user with both GSM and CDMA capabilities. Such
devices are sometimes referred to as hybrid phones or global phones. These types of mobile
devices contain two types of cellular radios for voice and data, providing the ability to operate
over either the GSM or CDMA network.

As the name implies, cellular networks provide coverage based on dividing up a large
geographical service area into smaller areas of coverage called cells. Cells play an important
role in reuse of radio frequencies in the limited radio spectrum available to allow more calls to
occur than otherwise would be possible. As a mobile device moves from one cell to another, a
cellular arrangement requires active connections to be monitored and effectively passed along
between cells to maintain the connection. To administer the cellular network system, provide
subscribed services, and accurately bill or debit subscriber accounts, data about the service
contract and associated service activities is captured and maintained by the network system.

Despite their differences in technology, cellular networks are organized similarly to one
another, in a manner illustrated in Figure 4 [Gib02]. The main components are the radio
transceiver equipment that communicates with mobile devices, the controller that manages the
transceiver equipment and performs channel assignment, and the switching system for the
cellular network. The technical names for these components are respectively Node B,
representing a Base Transceiver Station (BTS), the Radio Network Controller (RNC), and the
Mobile Switching Center (MSC). The RNCs and the Node B units controlled are sometimes
collectively referred to as a Radio Access Network (RAN).
