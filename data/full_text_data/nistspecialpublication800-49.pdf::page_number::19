                                 Federal S/MIME V3 Client Profile


3 Support for Enhanced Security Services for S/MIME (RFC 2634)
      The IETF has defined a set of Enhanced Security Services (ESS) for S/MIME in
      [RFC2634]. The services defined include signed receipts, security labels, secure mailing
      lists, and an extended method of identifying the signer’s certificate(s). This profile does not
      require conformance to [RFC2634] with the exception that signed receipt requesting,
      processing, and generation is required as specified in Clause 3.1 of this profile. However,
      mail agents that include support for any of these ESS services may optionally claim support
      for any or all of these services, either in origination of messages, receipt of messages, or
      both. Note that some optional services defined in [RFC2634] are out of scope for this
      profile as specified below, and thus claims to conformance will not be tested.

3.1    Signed Receipts
      Support for signed receipts is one of the four optional security services defined in
      [RFC2634]. For the purposes of this Profile, e-mail agents MUST be able to request,
      generate, and process signed receipts as described in [RFC2634].
         • S/MIME agents that originate messages MUST be able to generate signed receipt
            requests for signed messages as defined in [RFC2634]. (See Clause 2.2.1 above.)
         • S/MIME agents that receive messages MUST be able to generate signed receipts for
            signed messages that they receive containing signed receipt requests as defined in
            [RFC2634]. (See Clause 2.3.2 above.)
         • S/MIME agents that receive messages MUST be able to process signed receipts
            (including signature verification) as defined in [RFC2634]. (See Clause 2.3.5 above.)
         • Mail list agent processing is beyond the scope of this profile. However, S/MIME
            agents MUST be able to process mlExpansionHistory attributes as defined in Section
            2 of [RFC2634].

3.2    Security Labels
      Support for security labels is one of the four optional security services defined in
      [RFC2634]. If an S/MIME implementation claims to conform to the security label service
      defined in Clause 3 of [RFC2634], then the following requirements are imposed on the
      implementation:
         • S/MIME agents that originate messages MUST be able to generate security labels as
            defined in [RFC2634].
         • S/MIME agents MUST be able to display security labels in received messages as
            defined in [RFC2634]. S/MIME agents MUST be able to examine the security label
            on a received message and determine whether the recipient is allowed to see the
            contents of the message. If the recipient is not allowed to see the message contents
            then the agent MUST not display the message contents.
         • The generation and processing of Equivalent Security Labels is beyond the scope of
            this profile, but may be added to a future profile. However, as stated in [RFC2634],
            “[a]ll receiving agents SHOULD recognize equivalentLabels attributes even if they
            do not process them.”
