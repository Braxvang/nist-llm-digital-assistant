                                      ESTABLISHING WIRELESS ROBUST SECURITY NETWORKS: A GUIDE TO IEEE 802.11I



protected using the data confidentiality and integrity algorithms chosen during the discovery phase. IEEE
802.11i supports three methods of data transfer: unicast, multicast, and broadcast.

For RSNs, unicast (also called “directed”) is the type of data transfer used most often during the protected
data exchange phase. Unicast data transfer can occur when a unique association exists between the AP
and the STA and a pairwise transient key is used for the protection of the traffic. Protections afforded
unicast frames include encryption, integrity protection, and replay protection. Additionally, because data
forgery is a major security concern in WLANs, unicast frames are equipped with a data origin
authentication mechanism that prevents masquerading attacks. The mechanism allows a STA to confirm
whether or not a received data frame originated from the claimed STA.

The broadcast and multicast data transfer mechanisms (also called “group”) allow for common data to be
transferred to multiple devices efficiently. Communication between the AP and the STAs is protected
using CCMP. Unique Group Key Handshakes with each STA insert the GTK used with CCMP to protect
the data exchanges. Because all STAs share the same GTK, a single breach of the GTK affects all STAs.

5.7     Connection Termination

The fifth and final phase in the operation of an RSNA is the connection termination phase. During this
phase, the association between the STA and the AP is deleted, and the wireless connection is terminated.
This phase provides the elegant teardown of a connection and a restoration to an initialized state.

During the connection termination phase, the following events occur:

       The AP deauthenticates the STA.
       The security associations, used internally by the AP to keep track of associations between STAs
        and APs, are deleted.
       The temporal keys used for encrypting and protecting the integrity of data traffic are deleted.
       The IEEE 802.1X controlled port returns to a blocked state so that user traffic cannot pass.
The connection termination phase may be entered in several ways, including the following:

       Radio communication between the STA and AP is lost (e.g., STA moves out of range).
       The 4-Way Handshake or Group Key Handshake times out during execution.
       The RSNIE check during the 4-Way Handshake fails.
       The user powers down the STA or disables the NIC.
       The security policy indicates a termination of the connection (implementation-specific).
This phase restores the AP and STA to an initialized state. If further communication is subsequently
required, then these devices begin anew at the discovery phase with the re-discovery of the available
resources and capabilities.

5.8     Summary

IEEE 802.11 defines how frames are exchanged between STAs and APs. There are three types of IEEE
802.11 frames, as follows:
