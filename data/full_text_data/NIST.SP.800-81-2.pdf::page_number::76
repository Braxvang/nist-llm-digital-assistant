SECURE DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM (DNS) DEPLOYMENT GUIDE



Accordingly, the KSK (KSK-private) is used to sign the key set (i.e., DNSKEY RRSet) and is the key
type (public component – KSK-public) that is sent to the parent to be used for authenticated delegation.
This is done by generating a DS RR, using the hash of the child’s KSK-public key and generating a
corresponding signature (RRSIG RR) using the parent’s own ZSK. The KSK (KSK-public) may also be
used as a trust anchor (sometimes called the SEP keys) in validating resolvers to establish trust chains for
verification of signatures.

The ZSK (ZSK-private) is to be used for signing the entire zone file (all RRsets). The public portion of
this key (ZSK-public) will not be sent to the parent and will always remain in the zone.

The decision parameters involved in KSK and ZSK key pair generation are as follows:

    •   Choice of digital signature algorithm

    •   Choice of key sizes

    •   Choice of crypto period (duration for which the key will be used).
The choice of digital signature algorithm will be based on recommended algorithms in well-known
standards. NIST’s Digital Signature Standard (DSS) [FIPS186] provides three algorithm choices:

    •   Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA)

    •   RSA

    •   Elliptic Curve DSA (ECDSA).
Of these three algorithms, RSA and DSA are more widely available and hence are considered candidates
of choice for DNSSEC. In terms of performance, both RSA and DSA have comparable signature
generation speeds, but DSA is much slower for signature verification. Hence, RSA is the recommended
algorithm as far as this guideline is concerned. RSA with SHA-1 is currently the only cryptographic
algorithm mandated to be implemented with DNSSEC although other algorithm suites (i.e. RSA/SHA-
256, ECDSA) are also specified. It can be expected that name servers and clients will be able to use the
RSA algorithm at the minimum. It is suggested that at least one ZSK for a zone use the RSA algorithm.

NIST’s Secure Hash Standard (SHS) (FIPS 180-3) specifies SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and
SHA-512 as approved hash algorithms to be used as part of the algorithm suite for generating digital
signatures using the digital signature algorithms in the NIST’s DSS[FIPS186]. It is expected that there
will be support for Elliptic Curve Cryptography in the DNSSEC. The migration path for USG DNSSEC
operation will be to ECDSA (or similar) from RSA/SHA-1 and RSA/SHA-256 before September 30th,
2015.

The choice of key size is a tradeoff between the risk of key compromise and performance. The
performance variables are signature generation and verification times. The size of the DNS response
packet also is a factor because DNSKEY RRs may be sent in the additional section of the DNS response.
Because the KSK is used only for signing the key set (DNSKEY RRSet), performance is not much of an
issue. Compromise of a KSK could have a great impact, however, because the KSK is the entry point key
for a zone. Rollover of a KSK in the event of a compromise involves potential update of trust anchors in
many validating resolvers.
