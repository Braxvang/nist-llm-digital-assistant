                                                                                          GUIDE TO GENERAL SERVER SECURITY



4.      Securing the Server Operating System

Most commonly available servers operate on a general-purpose OS. Many security issues can be avoided
if the OSs underlying the servers are configured appropriately. Because manufacturers are unaware of
each organization’s security needs, server administrators need to configure new servers to reflect their
organizations’ security requirements and reconfigure them as those requirements change. The practices
recommended here are designed to help server administrators with server security configuration. Server
administrators managing existing servers should confirm that their servers address the issues discussed.

The techniques for securing different OSs vary greatly; therefore, this section includes the generic
procedures common in securing most OSs. Security configuration guides and checklists for many OSs
are publicly available; these documents typically contain recommendations for settings stronger than the
default level of security, and they may also contain step-by-step instructions for securing servers. 13 In
addition, many organizations maintain their own guidelines specific to their requirements. Some
automated tools also exist for securing OSs, and their use is recommended.

After planning the installation and deployment of the OS, as described in Section 3, and installing the OS,
the following basic steps are necessary to secure the OS:

 Patch and update the OS

 Harden and configure the OS to address security adequately

 Install and configure additional security controls, if needed

 Test the security of the OS to ensure that the previous steps adequately addressed all security issues.

The combined result of these steps should be a reasonable level of protection for the server’s OS.

4.1     Patch and Upgrade Operating System

Once an OS is installed, applying needed patches or upgrades to correct for known vulnerabilities is
essential. Any known vulnerabilities an OS has should be corrected before using it to host a server or
otherwise exposing it to untrusted users. To adequately detect and correct these vulnerabilities, server
administrators should do the following:

 Create, document, and implement a patching process. 14

 Identify vulnerabilities and applicable patches. 15

 Mitigate vulnerabilities temporarily if needed and if feasible (until patches are available, tested, and
  installed).

 Install permanent fixes (patches, upgrades, etc.)

      Checklists and implementation guides for various operating systems and applications are available from NIST at
      http://checklists.nist.gov/. Also, see NIST SP 800-70, Security Configuration Checklists Program for IT Products, available
      at the same Web site, for general information about NIST’s checklists program.

      For more information, see NIST SP 800-40 Version 2.0, Creating a Patch and Vulnerability Management Program, which
      is available at http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html. A single patch management process can be put into place for
      both operating systems and applications (including server software).
