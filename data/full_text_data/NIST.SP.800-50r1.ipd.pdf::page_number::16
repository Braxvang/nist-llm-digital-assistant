334   These phases can occur in sequence or simultaneously. At any time during the life cycle, the
335   Learning Program Manager and team can develop curriculum, evaluate instructor feedback, send
336   out practical exercise email quizzes, design posters for awareness, or develop a presentation for
337   senior leadership. Consider this diagram a reminder of the breadth of work.
338   In a broad sense, the CPLP is a valued element of the organization’s learning culture. To be
339   effective, the CPLP must be linked to organizational goals and viewed as adaptive, continuous,
340   and evolving. In a learning organization, personnel can expand and enhance their current
341   capabilities to understand and meet new mission requirements. Personnel are respected for their
342   ability to create and inspire others and are active in creating life-long learning achievements. If
343   an organization offers other learning programs (e.g., career development, leadership, and
344   executive development), the CPLP needs to be similarly integrated into the enterprise-wide
345   learning structure.

346          Developing a Cybersecurity and Privacy Culture
347   Establishing a cybersecurity and privacy culture is an important component of establishing a
348   successful CPLP. The culture of the organization should emphasize, reinforce, and drive its
349   desired behaviors toward cybersecurity and privacy. When a CPLP is valued in the
350   organization’s culture, the ability to address risks is increased. The organization’s leaders are
351   strategically valuable in establishing the CPLP as a significant component of managing risk.
352   Leaders create a learning culture by supporting and championing learning activities, from
353   awareness campaigns to role-based training. They help to set the tone for the entire organization.
