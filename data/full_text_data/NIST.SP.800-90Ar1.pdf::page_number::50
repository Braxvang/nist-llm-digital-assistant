                                                                  Generation Using Deterministic RBGs


       3. additional_input: The additional input string received from the consuming
          application. Note that the length of the additional_input string may be zero.
   Output:
       1. new_working_state: The new values for V, C, and reseed counter.


   Hash_DRBG Reseed Process:
       1. seed_material = 0x01 || V || entropy_input || additional_input.
       2. seed = Hash_df (seed_material, seedlen).
       3. V = seed.
       4. C = Hash_df ((0x00 || V), seedlen).        Comment: Preceed with a byte of all zeros.
       5. reseed_counter = 1.
       6. Return (V, C, and reseed_counter).

10.1.1.4     Generating Pseudorandom Bits Using Hash_DRBG

Notes for the generate function specified in Section 9.3:
   The generation of pseudorandom bits using a Hash_DRBG instantiation requires a call to the
   generate function specified in Section 9.3. Process step 8 of that function calls the generate
   algorithm specified in this section. The values for max_number_of_bits_per_request and
   outlen are provided in Table 2 of Section 10.1.
The generate algorithm:
   Let Hash be the selected hash function. The seed length (seedlen) and the maximum interval
   between reseeding (reseed_interval) are provided in Table 2 of Section 10.1. Note that for
   this DRBG mechanism, the reseed counter is used to update the value of V, as well as to
   count the number of generation requests.
   The following process or its equivalent shall be used as the generate algorithm for this
   DRBG mechanism (see step 8 of the generate process in Section 9.3):
   Hash_DRBG_Generate_algorithm (working_state, requested_number_of_bits,
      additional_input):
       1. working_state: The current values for V, C, and reseed_counter (see Section
          10.1.1.1).
       2. requested_number_of_bits: The number of pseudorandom bits to be returned to the
          generate function.
       3. additional_input: The additional input string received from the consuming
          application. Note that the length of the additional_input string may be zero.
   Output:
