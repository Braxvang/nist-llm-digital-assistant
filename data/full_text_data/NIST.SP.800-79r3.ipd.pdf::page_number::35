1076   Unlike for a PIV Card issuer, not all issuer controls are applicable to a derived PIV credential
1077   issuer. Certain issuer controls are applicable to only Authentication Assurance Level 2 (AAL2)
1078   or AAL3 derived PIV credentials and must therefore be implemented by the issuer only if they
1079   are issuing a derived PIV credential at that level of authentication assurance. This is represented
1080   via the “applicability” column in the tables in Appendix G.2. Table 3 shows the “Maintenance
1081   Process” authorization focus area under the “Processes” IAT. The “applicability” column
1082   identifies whether the issuer control needs to be met by a PKI-based AAL2 or AAL3 derived
1083   PIV credential issuer or a non-PKI-based AAL2 or AAL3 derived PIV credential issuer. If the
1084   “applicability” column states “DPCI,” then the issuer control is applicable to all derived
1085   credential issuers, regardless of what type of derived PIV credential is issued by the issuer.

            MP(DC)-17       If the derived PIV authentication private key was created       PKI-AAL2,     [SP800-157], Sec. 2.4.1 –
                            and stored on a hardware cryptographic token that               PKI-AAL3      PKI-Based Derived PIV
                            permits export of the private key, then the derived PIV                       Credential Invalidation
                            authentication certificate is revoked upon termination,
                            even if the token is collected and either zeroized or
                            destroyed.

1087   All issuer controls apply, regardless of an individual system’s FIPS 199, Standards for Security
1088   Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems [FIPS199], impact level.
1089   Furthermore, nothing precludes an issuer from implementing additional controls to ensure a
1090   higher level of confidence in mitigating risks associated with issuing PIV Cards or derived PIV
1091   credentials.

1092           Implementing Issuer Controls
1093   Each issuer control SHALL be properly implemented, managed, and monitored in order for the
1094   issuer to be authorized. Depending on how an organization decides to implement its [HSPD-12]
1095   program, certain functions might be outsourced to external service providers. However, it is still
1096   the responsibility of the organization’s management to ensure that the issuer controls are being
1097   implemented, enforced, and maintained by the issuer, its service providers (if any), and all
1098   issuing facilities that are within scope of the authorization boundary.
