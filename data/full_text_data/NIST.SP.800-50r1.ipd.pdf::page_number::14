          Key Considerations for Cybersecurity and Privacy Learning Programs 4
             • Develop, maintain, and implement mandatory organization-wide cybersecurity and privacy
                learning programs for all members of the workforce that support enterprise cybersecurity
                and privacy goals and objectives.
             • Ensure that the CPLP aligns with established rules of behavior and is consistent with
                applicable policies, standards, and guidelines.
             • Apprise the workforce of available cybersecurity and privacy resources, such as products,
                techniques, or expertise.
             • Provide foundational as well as more advanced levels of cybersecurity and privacy training
                to the workforce and ensure that measures are in place to assess the knowledge and skill of
                participants.
             • Identify who needs specialized cybersecurity and privacy training based on assigned
                cybersecurity and privacy roles and responsibilities.
