of the organizational risk management strategy need not be repeated in each individual risk assessment. By making
assumptions and constraints explicit, there is greater clarity in the risk model selected for the risk assessment, increased
reproducibility/repeatability of assessment results, and an increased opportunity for reciprocity among organizations.
Organizations identify assumptions in key areas relevant to the risk assessment including, for example: (i) threat
sources; (ii) threat events; (iii) vulnerabilities and predisposing conditions; (iv) potential impacts; (v) assessment and
analysis approaches; and (vi) which missions/business functions are primary. Organizations also identify constraints in
key areas relevant to the risk assessment including, for example: (i) resources available for the assessment; (ii) skills
and expertise required for the assessment; and (iii) operational considerations related to mission/business activities. For
example, organizational assumptions about how threats and impacts should be assessed can range from using worst-
case projections to using best-case projections or anything in between those endpoints. Finally, organizations consider
the uncertainty with regard to assumptions made or other information used in the risk assessment. Uncertainty in
assumptions can affect organizational risk tolerance. For example, assumptions based on a lack of specific or credible
information may reduce an organizationâ€™s risk tolerance because of the uncertainty influencing the assumptions. The
following sections provide some representative examples of areas where assumptions/constraints for risk assessments
may be identified.
Threat Sources
Organizations determine which types of threat sources are to be considered during risk assessments. Organizations
make explicit the process used to identify threats and any assumptions related to the threat identification process. If
such information is identified during the risk framing step and included as part of the organizational risk management
strategy, the information need not be repeated in each individual risk assessment. Risk assessments can address all
types of threat sources, a single broad threat source (e.g., adversarial), or a specific threat source (e.g., trusted insider).
Table D-2 provides a sample taxonomy of threat sources that can be considered by organizations in identifying
assumptions for risk assessments. Organizational assumptions about threat sources to consider inform Task 2-1.
Threat Events
Organizations determine which type of threat events are to be considered during risk assessments and the level of detail
needed to describe such events. Descriptions of threat events can be expressed in highly general terms (e.g., phishing,
distributed denial-of-service), in more descriptive terms using tactics, techniques, and procedures, or in highly specific
terms (e.g., the names of specific information systems, technologies, organizations, roles, or locations). In addition,
organizations consider: (i) what representative set of threat events can serve as a starting point for the identification of
the specific threat events in the risk assessment; and (ii) what degree of confirmation is needed for threat events to be
considered relevant for purposes of the risk assessment. For example, organizations may consider only those threat
events that have been observed (either internally or by organizations that are peers/partners) or all possible threat
events. Table E-2 and Table E-3 provide representative examples of adversarial and non-adversarial threat events at a
level of detail that can be used for risk assessments at all tiers. Greater detail can be found in multiple sources (e.g.,
Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification [CAPEC]). Organizational assumptions about threat events to
consider and level of detail, inform Task 2-2.
Vulnerabilities and Predisposing Conditions
Organizations determine the types of vulnerabilities that are to be considered during risk assessments and the level of
detail provided in the vulnerability descriptions. Organizations make explicit the process used to identify vulnerabilities
and any assumptions related to the vulnerability identification process. If such information is identified during the risk
framing step and included as part of the organizational risk management strategy, the information need not be repeated
in each individual risk assessment. Vulnerabilities can be associated with organizational information systems (e.g.,
hardware, software, firmware, internal controls, and security procedures) or the environments in which those systems
operate (e.g., organizational governance, external relationships, mission/business processes, enterprise architectures,
information security architectures). Organizations also determine the types of predisposing conditions that are to be
considered during risk assessments including, for example, architectures and technologies employed, environments of
operation, and personnel. Table F-4 provides representative examples of such predisposing conditions. Organizational
assumptions about vulnerabilities and predisposing conditions to consider and level of detail, inform Task 2-3.
Likelihood
Organizations make explicit the process used to conduct likelihood determinations and any assumptions related to the
likelihood determination process. If such information is identified during the risk framing step and included as part of
the organizational risk management strategy, the information need not be repeated in each individual risk assessment.
Organizational assumptions about how to determine likelihood inform Task 2-4.
Impacts
Organizations determine potential adverse impacts in terms of organizational operations (i.e., missions, functions,
image, and reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. Organizations make
explicit the process used to conduct impact determinations and any assumptions related to the impact determination
process. If such information is identified during the risk framing step and included as part of the organizational risk
