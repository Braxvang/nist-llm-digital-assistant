with a revision of the privacy controls in NIST SP 800-53.                           Management (SCRM)
The program will continue to collaborate with other NIST
programs as they seek to address privacy challenges and will                              Information and Communications Technology (ICT)
work with stakeholders to promote privacy engineering and                            relies on a complex, globally distributed, and interconnected
risk management practices. The PEP team will also continue                           supply chain ecosystem to provide highly refined, cost-
to seek leadership opportunities in public and private-                              effective, and reusable solutions. This ecosystem is composed
sector organizations to position NIST on the leading edge                            of various entities with multiple tiers of outsourcing, diverse
of privacy research. Finally, The PEP will explore new areas                         distribution routes, assorted technologies, laws, policies,
for privacy research that have broad-based application and                           procedures, and practices, all of which interact to design,
support federal agency mission-critical needs in managing                            manufacture, distribute, deploy, use, maintain, and manage
privacy risk.                                                                        ICT products and services.
