SECURE DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM (DNS) DEPLOYMENT GUIDE



DNS zones that allow dynamic update open themselves to a host of malicious attacks. The full list of
potential attacks is detailed in Section 6.3. The proposed solution to limit or prevent these attacks is given
in sections 8.1.4, 8.2.7, 8.2.8 and 8.2.9.

4.4   DNS NOTIFY

Whenever changes occur in the zone file of the primary (master) DNS server, the secondary (slave) DNS
servers that are supposed to carry identical data as the primary DNS server must be notified of the
changes. This notification is accomplished through the DNS NOTIFY message, which signals a secondary
DNS server to initiate a zone transfer (see Section 4.2). The DNS NOTIFY message is a much more
efficient and faster way of keeping secondary servers in sync with the primary server than the alternative
approach of secondary servers polling the primary server for changes via the SOA Refresh value timeout.

Sending the DNS NOTIFY message, called a notify operation, is a default operation in BIND 9.x. The
next question that arises is: How does the DNS name server software know to which servers the DNS
NOTIFY message must be sent? The default in BIND 9.x is to notify servers that are defined in the NS
RRs for the zone. If there are any additional servers to which the zone administrator wants the DNS
NOTIFY message to be sent (e.g., stealth slave server), the DNS administrator can add the IP addresses of
the other entities in the BIND configuration file. There are configuration options to stop the server from
sending DNS NOTIFY messages to a particular zone or to all zones served by this name server.

Once a secondary server receives a DNS NOTIFY message, it resets the relevant zoneâ€™s refresh value to
zero, prompting a zone transfer attempt. As in any zone refresh, if the zone serial number in the SOA RR
has not increased (see Section 10.1), the zone transfer does not take place. This procedure allows changes
to the zone to propagate to all name servers more quickly.

Since a DNS NOTIFY message triggers zone transfer, spurious DNS NOTIFY messages could result in
unnecessary zone transfers and hence potential denial of service. The proposed solution for minimizing
these spurious notifications is given in Section 8.1.5 and 8.1.6.
