2.3.5 Decision Rule (at the 1% Level)
If the computed P-value is < 0.01, then conclude that the sequence is non-random. Otherwise, conclude
that the sequence is random.

2.3.6 Conclusion and Interpretation of Results
Since the P-value obtained in step 4 of Section 2.3.4 is ≥ 0.01 (i.e., P-value = 0.147232), the conclusion is
that the sequence is random.

Note that a large value for Vn(obs) would have indicated an oscillation in the string which is too fast; a
small value would have indicated that the oscillation is too slow. (An oscillation is considered to be a
change from a one to a zero or vice versa.) A fast oscillation occurs when there are a lot of changes, e.g.,
010101010 oscillates with every bit. A stream with a slow oscillation has fewer runs than would be
expected in a random sequence, e.g., a sequence containing 100 ones, followed by 73 zeroes, followed by
127 ones (a total of 300 bits) would have only three runs, whereas 150 runs would be expected.

2.3.7 Input Size Recommendation
It is recommended that each sequence to be tested consist of a minimum of 100 bits (i.e., n ≥ 100).

2.3.8 Example
(input)    ε = 11001001000011111101101010100010001000010110100011
               00001000110100110001001100011001100010100010111000

(input)             n = 100

(input)             τ = 0.02

(processing)        π = 0.42

(processing)        Vn(obs) = 52

(output)            P-value = 0.500798

(conclusion)        Since P-value ≥ 0.01, accept the sequence as random.


2.4   Test for the Longest Run of Ones in a Block

2.4.1 Test Purpose
The focus of the test is the longest run of ones within M-bit blocks. The purpose of this test is to
determine whether the length of the longest run of ones within the tested sequence is consistent with the
length of the longest run of ones that would be expected in a random sequence. Note that an irregularity in
the expected length of the longest run of ones implies that there is also an irregularity in the expected
length of the longest run of zeroes. Therefore, only a test for ones is necessary. See Section 4.4.
