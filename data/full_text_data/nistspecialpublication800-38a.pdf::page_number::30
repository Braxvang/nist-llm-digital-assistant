Appendix E: Modes of Triple DES

FIPS Pub 46-3 [FIPS 46-3] specifies the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm and
approves its three-fold, compound operation that is specified in ANSI X9.52 [1]: the Triple Data
Encryption Algorithm (TDEA). Essentially, the TDEA consists of the application of the forward
DES algorithm, i.e, DES encryption, under one key, followed by the application of the inverse
DES algorithm, i.e., DES decryption, under a second key, followed by the application of the
forward DES algorithm under a third key. The TDEA is often called Triple DES.

FIPS Pub 46-3 also approves the seven modes of operation of Triple DES that are specified in
ANSI X9.52. Four of those modes are equivalent to modes in this recommendation with the
TDEA as the underlying block cipher. In particular, the TECB, TCBC, and TOFB modes in
ANSI X9.52 are equivalent to the ECB, CBC, and OFB modes in this recommendation, with the
TDEA as the underlying block cipher; the TCFB mode in ANSI X9.52 is equivalent to the CFB
mode in this recommendation, with the TDEA as the underlying block cipher, provided that the
possible choices of the parameter s (the segment size) are restricted to three values: 1, 8, and 64.
The remaining three modes in ANSI X9.52 are TCBC-I, TCFB-P, and TOFB-I; they are mode
variants that allow for interleaving or pipelining; this recommendation does not provide
analogues of these three modes.

The Triple DES modes in ANSI X9.52 should not be used as the underlying block cipher
algorithm for the modes in this recommendation. However, the Triple DES algorithm, i.e.,
TDEA, as described above, may be used as the underlying block cipher algorithm for the six
modes in this recommendation. One of the resulting modes of Triple DES is new, i.e., not
specified in ANSI X9.52: the CTR mode of the TDEA.
