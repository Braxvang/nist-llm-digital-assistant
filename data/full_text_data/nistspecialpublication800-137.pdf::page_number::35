                                                 Federal Information Systems and Organizations




Organization and Mission/Business Processes Tiers.

At the mission/business processes tier, the organization establishes the minimum frequency with
which each security control or metric is to be assessed or monitored. Frequencies are established
across all organizational systems and common controls based on the criteria described above in
this section. Common, hybrid, and system-specific security controls are addressed by
organization and mission/business processes tier policy and procedures. Common controls are
often inherited by a large number of organizational systems. The aggregate criticality of such
controls may require more frequent assessments than would similar controls responsible for
protecting a single system. Additionally, determining the frequency for assessing common
controls includes the organizationâ€™s determination of the trustworthiness of the common control
provider. Common controls that are process-related (e.g., procedures/templates, PM controls) do
not tend to be volatile and typically do not lend themselves well to automation. Still, the
organization considers the volatility of such controls as well as related threat information when
establishing assessment frequencies.
Primary Roles: Chief Information Officer, Senior Information Security Officer

Supporting Roles: Risk Executive (Function), Authorizing Officials, Common Control Provider,
Information System Owner

Expected Input: Organizational risk assessment, organizational risk tolerance, current threat
information, reporting requirements, current vulnerability information, output from monitoring
strategy reviews

Expected Output: Organization-wide policies and procedures, recommended frequencies with
which each security control and metric is assessed or monitored

Information Systems Tier.

At the information systems tier, system owners review the minimum monitoring/assessment
frequencies established by organization and/or mission/business processes tier policy and
determine if the minimum frequencies are adequate for a given information system. For some
information systems, it may be necessary to assess specific controls or metrics with greater
frequency than prescribed by the organization, again based on the criteria described above in this
section. System owners also consider identification of specific system components that may
require more frequent monitoring than other system components (e.g., public-facing servers,
boundary protection devices, components deemed critical in the Business Impact Analysis).
Primary Roles: Information System Owner, Information System Security Officer

Supporting Roles: Authorizing Official, Senior Information Security Officer, Information
Owner/Steward

Expected Input: Organizational strategy and procedures with minimum frequencies, current
threat information, reporting requirements, current vulnerability information, output from
monitoring strategy reviews, security assessment plans

Expected Output: Security assessment plans updated to reflect the frequency with which each
system-specific security control is assessed and metrics are monitored
