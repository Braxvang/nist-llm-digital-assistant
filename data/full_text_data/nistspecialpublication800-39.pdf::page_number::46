RISK TOLERANCE
TASK 1-3: Identify the level of risk tolerance for the organization.
Supplemental Guidance: Risk tolerance is the level of risk that organizations are willing to accept in pursuit of strategic
goals and objectives. Organizations define information security-related risk tolerance organization-wide considering all
missions/business functions. Organizations can use a variety of techniques for identifying information security risk
tolerance (e.g., by establishing zones in a likelihood-impact trade space or by using a set of representative scenarios).
Organizations also define tolerance for other types of organizational and operational risks (e.g., financial, risk, safety
risk, compliance risk, or reputation risk). At Tier 2, mission/business owners may have different risk tolerances from
the organization as a whole. The risk executive (function) provides organizations with ways to resolve such differences
in risk tolerances at Tier 2. The level of residual risk accepted by authorizing officials for information systems or
inherited common controls is within the organizational risk tolerance, and not the individual risk tolerances of those
authorizing officials. In addition, organizations provide to Tier 2 and Tier 3, guidance on evaluating risk for specific
mission/business processes or information systems and a focus on near-term mission/business effectiveness with the
longer-term, strategic focus of the organizational risk tolerance. See Section 2.3.3 for additional information on risk
tolerance.

PRIORITIES AND TRADE-OFFS
TASK 1-4: Identify priorities and trade-offs considered by the organization in managing risk.
Supplemental Guidance: Risk is experienced at different levels, in different forms, and in different time frames. At Tier
1, organizations make trade-offs among and establish priorities for responding to such risks. Organizations tend to have
multiple priorities that at times conflict, which generates potential risk. Approaches employed by organizations for
managing portfolios of risks reflect organizational culture, risk tolerance, as well as risk-related assumptions and
constraints. These approaches are typically embodied in the strategic plans, policies, and roadmaps of organizations
which may indicate preferences for different forms of risk response. For example, organizations may be willing to
accept short-term risk of slightly degraded operations to achieve long-term reduction in information security risk.
However, this trade-off could be unacceptable for one particularly critical mission/business function (e.g., real-time
requirements in many industrial/process control systems). For that high-priority area, a different approach to improving
security may be required including the application of compensating security controls.

Outputs and Post Conditions
The output of the risk framing step is the risk management strategy that identifies how organizations intend to assess,
respond to, and monitor risk over time. The framing step also produces a set of organizational policies, procedures,
standards, guidance, and resources covering the following topics: (i) scope of the organizational risk management
process (e.g., organizational entities covered; mission/business functions affected; how risk management activities are
applied within the risk management tiers); (ii) risk assessment guidance including, for example, the characterization of
threat sources, sources of threat information, representative threat events (in particular, adversary tactics, techniques,
and procedures), when to consider and how to evaluate threats, sources of vulnerability information, risk assessment
methodologies to be used, and risk assumptions; (iii) risk response guidance including, for example, risk tolerances,
risk response concepts to be employed, opportunity costs, trade-offs, consequences of responses, hierarchy of
authorities, and priorities; (iv) risk monitoring guidance, including, for example, guidance on analysis of monitored risk
factors to determine changes in risk, and monitoring frequency, methods, and reporting; (v) other and risk constraints
on executing risk management activities; and (vi) organizational priorities and trade-offs. Outputs from the risk framing
step serve as inputs to the risk assessment, risk response, and risk monitoring steps.


3.2 ASSESSING RISK
Risk assessment identifies, prioritizes, and estimates risk to organizational operations (i.e.,
mission, functions, image, and reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations,
and the Nation, resulting from the operation and use of information systems.62 Risk assessments
use the results of threat and vulnerability assessments to identify and evaluate risk in terms of
likelihood of occurrence and potential adverse impact (i.e., magnitude of harm) to organizations,
assets, and individuals. Risk assessments can be conducted at any of the risk management tiers

62
   Draft NIST Special Publication 800-30, Revision 1, provides guidance on conducting risk assessments (including
incremental or differential risk assessments) across all three tiers in the multitiered risk management approach.
