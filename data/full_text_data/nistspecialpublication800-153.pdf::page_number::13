                                             GUIDELINES FOR SECURING W IRELESS LOCAL AREA NETWORKS (WLANS)


        o   If feasible, configure the devices to disable bridging (passing traffic between the networks).
            This is precautionary in case an unauthorized dual connection occurs.

       For all their WLAN client devices authorized for dual connections:

        o   Implement the appropriate technical security controls (discussed below the bullets) so that the
            authorized dual connected configurations are only active when necessary and that all other
            dual connected configurations are prohibited.

        o   Configure the devices to disable bridging (passing traffic between the networks) unless
            absolutely necessary.

There are several options for implementing WLAN client device dual connection policies, such as
prohibiting unauthorized configurations from being used and disabling authorized dual connections when
not needed. To enforce such restrictions, organizations should rely on automated technical controls
whenever feasible. Non-technical controls are usually not effective enough; for example, it is generally
not feasible to rely on users to remember to always promptly disable WLAN interfaces every time they
are no longer needed. Each organization should evaluate the possible controls for implementing dual
connection policies on their WLAN client devices and then choose the combinations of controls that are
most appropriate, providing sufficient security while also permitting necessary functionality.

Some of the possible controls are preventative (implementing and enforcing a configuration), while others
are detective (monitoring a configuration, monitoring network activity, alerting when a problem is
detected, etc.) Preventative controls are generally preferable to detective controls, but it is even stronger
to use both preventative and detective controls together. See Section 3 for more information on
monitoring (detective) controls.

Preventative controls may need to enforce granular policies. For example, an organization might permit
only wired network usage while at their headquarters, but might permit wired or wireless access to
external networks. Preventative controls may also need to provide flexibility; organizations often need to
allow users to attach the organization’s mobile client devices to new external WLANs, and thus the users
need some ability to manage their devices’ WLAN configuration.

Examples of preventative controls include the following:

       Configure the device’s BIOS so that WLAN connections are automatically terminated when a
        wired connection is detected. The BIOS setting for this is often called LAN/WLAN switching.

       Enable specialized software-based controls that permit either WLAN or wired network access,
        but not both simultaneously. These controls could be built into the operating system (OS),
        provided as part of the WLAN driver or management software, provided by the device
        manufacturer (e.g., laptop vendor), or acquired from third parties. These controls typically favor
        wired connections over WLAN because of their relative reliability, performance, and security.

       Configure host-based network security tools (e.g., host-based firewalls, host-based intrusion
        detection and prevention systems) to prevent multiple network interfaces from being used at one
        time.

       Specify and enforce authorized network profiles and/or unauthorized profiles through OS/domain
        controls, third party policy-based software, etc.
