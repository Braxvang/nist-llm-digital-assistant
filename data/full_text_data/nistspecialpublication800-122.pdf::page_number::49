Appendix D—Fair Information Practices

The Fair Information Practices, also known as Privacy Principles, are the framework for most modern
privacy laws around the world. Several versions of the Fair Information Practices have been developed
through government studies, Federal agencies, and international organizations. These different versions
share common elements, but the elements are divided and expressed differently. The most commonly
used versions are discussed in this appendix. 92

In 1973, the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) (now the Department of Health
and Human Services) issued a report entitled Records, Computers, and the Rights of Citizens (commonly
referred to as the HEW Report). The report was the culmination of an extensive study into data
processing in the public and private sectors. The HEW Report recommended that Congress enact
legislation adopting a ―Code of Fair Information Practices‖ for automated personal data systems. The
recommended Fair Information Practices became the foundation for the Privacy Act of 1974. The HEW
Report Fair Information Practices included the following:

 There must be no personal data record-keeping systems whose very existence is secret.
 There must be a way for an individual to find out what information is in his or her file and how the
  information is being used.
 There must be a way for an individual to correct information in his or her records.
 Any organization creating, maintaining, using, or disseminating records of personally identifiable
  information must assure the reliability of the data for its intended use and must take precautions to
  prevent misuse.
 There must be a way for an individual to prevent personal information obtained for one purpose from
  being used for another purpose without his or her consent.
In 1980, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) 93 adopted Guidelines on
the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data, which provide a framework for
privacy that has been referenced in U.S. Federal guidance and internationally. The OECD Guidelines,
along with the Council of Europe Convention, 94 became the foundation for the European Union‘s Data
Protection Directive. 95 The OECD Guidelines include the following Privacy Principles:

 Collection Limitation—There should be limits to the collection of personal data and any such data
  should be obtained by lawful and fair means and, where appropriate, with the knowledge or consent
  of the data subject.
 Data Quality—Personal data should be relevant to the purposes for which they are to be used, and, to
  the extent necessary for those purposes, should be accurate, complete and kept up-to-date.

     In 1981, the Council of Europe enacted the Convention for the Protection of Individuals with Regard to Automatic
     Processing of Personal Data, which also recognized the Fair Information Practices.
95
     In 1995, the European Union enacted the Data Protection Directive, Directive 95/46/EC, which required member states to
     harmonize their national legislation with the terms of the Directive, including the Fair Information Practices. For additional
