      NIST SP 800-73pt2-5 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                       Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification: Part 2
      September 2023                                                                          PIV Card Application Card Command Interface

620   If the authentication data in the command data field does not match the current value of the
621   reference data, but both the authentication data and the new reference data in the command data
622   field of the command satisfy the criteria in Section 2.4.3, the PIV Card Application SHALL
623   return status word '63 CX'. If status word '6A 80' is returned, the security status and retry counter
624   associated with the key reference SHALL remain unchanged. 9 If status word '63 CX' is returned,
625   the security status of the key reference SHALL be set to FALSE, and the retry counter associated
626   with the key reference SHALL be decremented by one.
627   If the card command succeeds, then the security status of the key reference SHALL be set to
628   TRUE, and the retry counter associated with the key reference SHALL be set to the reset retry
629   value associated with the key reference.
630   The initial value of the retry counter and the reset retry value associated with the key reference
631   (i.e., the number of successive failures/retries before the retry counter associated with the key
632   reference reaches zero) are issuer-dependent.

636   3.2.3. RESET RETRY COUNTER Card Command
637   The RESET RETRY COUNTER card command resets the retry counter of the PIN to its initial
638   value and changes the reference data. The command enables recovery of the PIV Card
639   Application PIN if the cardholder forgets it.
640   The only key reference allowed in the P2 parameter of the RESET RETRY COUNTER
641   command is '80', the PIV Card Application PIN. The PIV Card Application MAY allow the
642   reference data associated with other key references to be changed by the PIV Card Application
643   RESET RETRY but only if the requirements specified in Section 2.9.2 of FIPS 201-2 are

      9
          It is recommended that in this case the authentication data not be compared to the on-card reference data.
