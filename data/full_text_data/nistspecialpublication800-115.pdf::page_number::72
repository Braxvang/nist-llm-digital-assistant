Appendix D—Remote Access Testing

Remote access testing assesses remote access methods for vulnerabilities, and covers technologies such as
terminal servers, VPNs, secure shell (SSH) tunnels, remote desktop applications, and dial-up modems.
This testing is intended to discover alternative methods of entry into the network that circumvent
perimeter defenses. Remote access testing is often conducted as part of penetration testing, but can also
be performed separately to better focus on remote access implementations. Testing techniques vary
according to the type of remote access being tested and the specific goals of the test. Examples of
commonly used techniques include:

      Discovering unauthorized remote access services. Port scanning may be used to locate open
       ports that are often associated with remote access services. Systems may be manually checked
       for remote access services by viewing running processes and installed applications.
      Reviewing rulesets to find unintended remote access paths. Remote access rulesets, such as
       those on VPN gateways, should be reviewed for holes or misconfigurations that could permit
       unwanted access.
      Testing remote access authentication mechanisms. Since remote access methods normally
       require authentication, testers should first verify that they are required to authenticate before they
       attempt to gain access. Testers can try default accounts and passwords (e.g., guest accounts,
       maintenance accounts) and brute-force attacks—and social engineering can also be used to
       attempt to get a password reset or to gain access without an authentication token (e.g., by
       claiming the token is lost). Testers can also attempt to gain access through self-service
       authentication programs that allow passwords to be reset by answering user-specific questions—
       this also may involve social engineering.
      Monitoring remote access communications. Testers can monitor remote access
       communications with a network sniffer. If communications are not protected, testers may be able
       to use them as sources for remote access authentication information and other data sent and
       received by remote access users.
Active or intrusive remote access testing should be performed during times of low demand to limit
potential disruption to employees and the remote access systems.

Another aspect of remote access testing is assessing an organization’s phone systems for vulnerabilities
that permit unauthorized or unsecured access. NIST SP 800-24, PBX Vulnerability Analysis 46 , provides
information on elements and approaches to private branch exchange (PBX) security testing. In the area of
remote access, the primary target of phone system testing is modems—and although their use has
decreased due to the wide availability of wired and wireless network access, successful attacks continue
to be launched through unauthorized modems. For example, there are users who still use modems on
their work computers for remote access, and some organizations use older technologies—such as building
operations controllers and switches—that have maintenance modems enabled. A single compromise via a
modem could allow an attacker direct, undetected access to a network that avoids perimeter security.

Several available software packages allow network administrators—and attackers—to dial large blocks of
telephone numbers to search for available modems. This process is called war dialing. A computer with
four modems can dial 10,000 numbers in a matter of days. War dialers provide reports on numbers with
modems, and some dialers have the capacity to attempt limited automatic attacks when a modem is
discovered. Organizations should conduct war dialing at least once per year to identify their unauthorized
