10. Ensure that CAs support at least one of the following algorithms for digitally signing
    certificates and CRLs: RSA with PKCS#1 v1.5 padding; RSA with PSS Padding
    [RFC 3447], DSA or ECDSA. To maximize flexibility, CAs should support RSA and
    ECDSA.12

11. Ensure that CAs include backup and archive capabilities to support reconstitution of
    the CA in the event that the root key is corrupted, destroyed or lost, and it is
    necessary to rebuild the CA using a backup root key, rather than simply recovering
    the lost state of the CA. CAs should include backup and archive capabilities in order
    to establish when certificates were issued and revoked, and under whose authority.

12. Ensure that CA/RA components are shipped or delivered via controlled methods that
    provide a continuous chain of accountability, from the purchase location to the CA’s
    or RA's physical location.

2.3.2 OCSP Responders:
1. Ensure that OCSP responders conform to RFC 6960, Online Certificate Status
   Protocol [RFC 6960].

2. Ensure that OCSP responders are capable of processing both signed and unsigned
   requests and are capable of processing requests that either include or omit the name of
   the relying party making the request. However, OCSP responders may ignore
   signatures and requester names, if present.

3. Ensure that OCSP responders are capable of processing certificate status requests and
   generating responses for non-error conditions as specified in [RFC 5019].

4. Where supported, the OCSP responder should sign the OCSP response with the
   algorithm and key size used to sign the certificate. Ensure that OCSP responders
   support at least one of the following algorithms for digitally signing response
   messages: RSA with PKCS#1 v1.5 padding; RSA with PSS Padding, DSA or
   ECDSA. The supported algorithms should include the algorithm(s) used by the
   corresponding CA when signing the certificate whose status is in question. To support
   future algorithm transitions by the CA, OCSP responders should support RSA and
   ECDSA.13

  The algorithm used to sign certificates and CRLs in an operational CA is dependent upon both the
cryptographic module in use and the CA’s software. The selected algorithm must appear in both sets of
supported algorithms.

  As with CAs, the algorithm used to sign responses in an operational OCSP responder is dependent upon
both the cryptographic module in use and the OCSP responder’s software. The selected algorithm must
appear in both sets of supported algorithms.
