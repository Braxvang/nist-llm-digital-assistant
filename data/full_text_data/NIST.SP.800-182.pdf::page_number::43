    Small business owners face a broad range of informa-
tion security issues. A computer failure or system breach
could jeopardize the company’s reputation and may result
in significant damage and recovery cost, or going out
of business. The small business owner who recognizes
the threat of computer crime and takes steps to deter
inappropriate activities is less likely to become a victim.
     The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) reports
that over 27 million U.S. companies - more than 99 percent of
all U.S. businesses - are SMBs of 500 employees or fewer (see
http://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/allprofiles12.pdf).
While the threats to individual SMBs may not be significantly
different from those facing larger organizations, an SMB
frequently has fewer resources available to protect systems,
detect attacks, or respond to security issues. A vulnerability
common to a large percentage of SMBs could pose a threat
to the nation’s information infrastructure and economic
base.
     To help address information security risk, these busi-
nesses require assistance with the identification of security
mechanisms and with practical, cost-effective training.
Training helps SMB’s use their limited resources most
effectively to address relevant and serious threats. In
response to this need, NIST, the SBA, and the Federal Bureau
of Investigation (FBI) InfraGard program co-sponsor a series
of cybersecurity training workshops for small businesses.
These workshops provide an overview of cybersecurity
