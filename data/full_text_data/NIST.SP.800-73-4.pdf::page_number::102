  4.1.5     Card Verifiable Certificates

Table 15 specifies the format for the secure messaging CVC, C ICC , and Table 16 specifies the format for
the optional Intermediate CVC.

C ICC is used to authenticate the PIV Card Application. The specific data object tags and specified order
must be used for both CVCs to allow the CVC processing within authentication protocols. The specific
data object tags for C ICC and the optional Intermediate CVC are provided in Tables 15 and 16,
respectively.

The signature of the secure messaging CVC (DigitalSignature object) is calculated over the concatenation
of the TLV encoded Credential Profile Identifier, Issuer Identification Number, Subject Identifier,
CardHolderPublicKey Data Object, and Role Identifier, i.e., { '5F29' '01' '80' } || { '42' '08' IIN } || { '5F20'
'10' GUID } || { '7F49' L1 { { '06' L2 OID } { '86' L3 '04' X Y } } } { '5F4C' '01' '00' }. Before signing the
CVC the signer shall perform partial public-key validation [SP800-56A, Section 5.6.2.3.2] for the public
key that will be placed in the Public Key object and shall verify that the PIV Card is in possession of the
corresponding private key (see [SP800-56A, Section 5.6.2.2.3.2] and [SP800-57, Section 8.1.5.1.1.2] for
discussions of methods to obtain assurance of private-key possession).
