2.3.3     Proprietary Mail Transports

As mentioned previously, some messaging systems use MTAs that do not support either SMTP or
ESMTP. These types of MTAs are designed to work within a closed messaging environment. Many
large-scale government, academic, and private organizations have messaging systems that use these types
of MTAs. However, these organizations still rely on SMTP or ESMTP-capable MTAs for
communicating with external messaging systems. Some examples of messaging systems that use
proprietary protocols are MTAs for Lotus Notes and Microsoft Exchange. 5 Discussion on the benefits
and disadvantages of using MTAs that support only proprietary message transfer protocols is outside the
scope of this document.

2.4     Client Access Standards

Once a message is delivered by the LDA, users need to access the mail server to retrieve the message.
Mail clients (MUAs) are used to access the mail server and retrieve email messages. Several methods
exist for users to access their mailboxes, the simplest being direct access.

The simplest scenario for a messaging system would be one in which all users have direct access to their
mailbox (common on hosts employing the Unix operating system). For each account that exists on the
system, there is a corresponding mailbox in that userâ€™s home directory. When messages are received,
users can use command line-based mail programs, such as mail or pine, to directly access the mailbox.
Although this method is straightforward, it requires all users accessing the mail server to receive
messages to have a user account and a command-line interface on the host operating system.

Allowing users, particularly external users, to have access to a command-line interface is a significant
security risk. To mitigate this risk, mailbox access protocols were devised. The two most widely
supported mailbox access protocols are Post Office Protocol (POP) and Internet Message Access Protocol
(IMAP). They are covered in Sections 2.4.1 and 2.4.2, respectively. As with message transfer protocols
for MTAs, other proprietary mailbox access protocols exist that are regularly used by commercial
software manufacturers; proprietary protocols are discussed in Section 2.4.3. It is important to understand
that POP, IMAP, and indeed most proprietary protocols in their default configuration use cleartext

      These product families have SMTP MTAs as well as their proprietary MTAs.
