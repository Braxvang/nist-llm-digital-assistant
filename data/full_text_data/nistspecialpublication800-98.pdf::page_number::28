GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



2.3.2.1 Power Output and Duty Cycle

In most cases, standards and regulations will determine the permitted power output and duty cycle of the
readers. A reader’s duty cycle is the percentage of time that the device is emitting energy over a specified
period. For example, a reader that communicates for 30 seconds every minute has a 50% duty cycle.
Readers that communicate with passive tags need greater power output than those that communicate with
active tags because the signal must be strong enough to reach the tag and enable the backscatter to return
to the reader. In general, readers with greater power output and duty cycles can read tags more
accurately, more quickly, and from longer distances, but the greater power output also increase the risk of
eavesdropping.

2.3.2.2 Enterprise Subsystem Interface

All readers have an RF subsystem interface to communicate with tags. Most also have a second interface
to communicate with the enterprise subsystem. The enterprise subsystem interface supports transfer of
RFID data from the reader to enterprise subsystem’s computers for processing and analysis. In most
cases, the enterprise subsystem interface is used for remote management of the readers. The interface
may be a wired (e.g., Ethernet) or wireless (e.g., Wi-Fi or satellite) link. Many systems use Simple
Network Management Protocol (SNMP) to monitor the readers and alert administrators of conditions that
warrant attention.

2.3.2.3 Mobility

A reader’s interface with an enterprise subsystem may be wired or wireless. Most wired readers are in
fixed locations and support applications in which the tags approach the reader. Some wired readers offer
limited mobility using cables. Figure 2-3 shows a reader portal that reads tags on a pallet of boxes
moving through the portal. Figure 2-4 shows reader antennas mounted above each toll lane in a series of
toll booths. As vehicles pass through one of the toll lanes, the reader reads a transponder that is attached
to that vehicle’s windshield.
