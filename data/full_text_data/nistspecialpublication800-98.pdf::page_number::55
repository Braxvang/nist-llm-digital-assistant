fail to perform its intended function because someone removed it from its packaging, an employee
accidentally damaged it with a box cutter, or a severe storm covered it in ice.

An example of an intentional attack on an RFID business process is cloning, which occurs when an
adversary reads information from a legitimate RFID tag and then programs another tag or device to
emulate the behavior of the legitimate tag. Documented examples of cloning have occurred in tags used
for financial payment 32 and access control. 33 Another attack on an RFID business process would be
removing a tag from the item it is intended to identify and attaching it to another unrelated item.
Someone might, for example, perform such an attack to get a better price on an expensive item in a store.

Potential problems are not just limited to the RF subsystem. If the network supporting the RFID system
is down, then the RFID system is likely down as well. In supply chain applications, network failures at
any point in the chain have the potential to impact the business processes of any subsequent link in the
chain. For example, if a supplier is unable to write manifest data to a tag, then the recipient cannot use
that data in its operations even if its RFID readers and network infrastructure are fully functional. Servers
hosting RFID middleware, databases, analytic systems, and authentication services are all points of
failure. Any efforts to assess business process risk need to be comprehensive, because such a wide
variety of potential threats exist. All of these threats have the potential to undermine the supported
business process and therefore the mission of the implementing organization.

4.2     Business Intelligence Risk

RFID is a powerful technology, in part, because it supports wireless remote access to information about
assets and people that either previously did not exist or was difficult to create or dynamically maintain.
While this wireless remote access is a significant benefit, it also creates a risk that unauthorized parties
could also have similar access to that information if proper controls are not in place. This risk is distinct
from the business process risk because it can be realized even when business processes are functioning as
intended.

A competitor or adversary can gain information from the RFID system in a number of ways, including
eavesdropping on RF links between readers and tags, performing independent queries on tags to obtain
relevant data, and obtaining unauthorized access to a back-end database storing information about tagged
items. Supply chain applications may be particularly vulnerable to this risk because a variety of external
entities may have read access to the tags or related databases. The risk of unauthorized access is realized
when the entity engaging in the unauthorized behavior does something harmful with that information.

In some cases, the information may trigger an immediate response. For example, someone might use a
reader to determine whether a shipping container holds expensive electronic equipment, and then break
into the container when it gets a positive reading. This scenario is an example of targeting.

In other cases, data might also be aggregated over time to provide intelligence regarding an organizationâ€™s
operations, business strategy, or proprietary methods. For instance, an organization could monitor the
number of tags entering a facility to provide a reasonable indication of its business growth or operating
practices. In this case, if someone determined that a warehouse recently received a number of very large
