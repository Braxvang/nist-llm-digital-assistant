           service agreement, making any needed adjustments, and monitor compliance of the
           service controls with the terms of the agreement.

           Establishing a level of trust about a cloud service is dependent on the degree of control an
           organization is able to exert on the provider to provision the security controls necessary
           to protect the organization’s data and applications, and also the evidence provided about
           the effectiveness of those controls [JTF10]. However, verifying the correct functioning
           of a subsystem and the effectiveness of security controls as extensively as with an
           organizational system may not be feasible in some cases, and other means (e.g., third-
           party audits) may be used to establish a level of trust. Ultimately, if the level of trust in
           the service falls below expectations and the organization is unable to employ
           compensating controls, it must either reject the service or accept a greater degree of risk.

4.4       Architecture
The architecture of the software and hardware used to deliver cloud services can vary
significantly among public cloud providers for any specific service model. The physical location
of the infrastructure is determined by the cloud provider as is the design and implementation of
the reliability, resource pooling, scalability, and other logic needed in the support framework.
Applications are built on the programming interfaces of Internet-accessible services, which
typically involve multiple cloud components communicating with each other over application
programming interfaces. Virtual machines typically serve as the abstract unit of deployment for
IaaS clouds and are loosely coupled with the cloud storage architecture. Cloud providers may
also use other computing abstractions in lieu of virtual machine technology to provision services
for other service models.

To complement the server side of the equation, cloud-based applications require a client side to
initiate and obtain services. While Web browsers often serve as clients, other possibilities exist.
In addition, an adequate and secure network communications infrastructure must be in place.
Many of the simplified interfaces and service abstractions on the client, server, and network belie
the inherent underlying complexity that affects security and privacy. Therefore, it is important to
understand the technologies the cloud provider uses to provision services and the implications
the technical controls involved have on security and privacy of the system throughout its
lifecycle. With such information, the underlying system architecture of a cloud can be
decomposed and mapped to a framework of security and privacy controls that can be used to
assess and manage risk.

          Attack Surface. The hypervisor or virtual machine monitor is an additional layer of
           software between an operating system and hardware platform that is used to operate
           multi-tenant virtual machines and is common to IaaS clouds. Besides virtualized
           resources, the hypervisor normally supports other application programming interfaces to
           conduct administrative operations, such as launching, migrating, and terminating virtual
           machine instances. Compared with a traditional, non-virtualized implementation, the
           addition of a hypervisor causes an increase in the attack surface. That is, there are
           additional methods (e.g., application programming interfaces), channels (e.g., sockets),
           and data items (e.g., input strings) an attacker can use to cause damage to the system.
