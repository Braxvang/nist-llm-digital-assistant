As noted on 13, this document uses the phrase de-identifcation to describe this process
and recommends avoiding the phrase anonymization, which is typically used to indicate
that the de-identifcation process cannot be reversed, and there is no technical mechanism
to ensure that de-identifed data cannot be re-identifed.

4.3.1.     Removing or Transforming of Direct Identifers
There are many possible processes for removing direct identifers from a dataset, including:
    • Removal and replacement. Replace identifers with the value used by the database
      to indicate a missing value, such as NULL or NA.
    • Masking. Replace identifers with a repeating character, such as XXXXXX or 999999.
    • Encryption. Encrypt the identifers with a strong encryption algorithm. After en-
      cryption, the key can be discarded to prevent decryption. However, if there is a desire
      to employ the same transformation at a later point in time, the key should be stored
      in a secure location that is separate from the de-identifed dataset. Encryption used
      for this purpose carries special risks that need to be addressed with specifc controls
      (see Sec. 4.3.2 for further information).
    • Hashing with a keyed hash. A keyed hash is a special kind of hash function that pro-
      duces different hash values for different keys. The hash key should have suffcient
      randomness to defeat a brute force attack aimed at recovering the hash key (e.g.,
      SHA-256 HMAC [26] with a 256-bit randomly generated key). As with encryption,
      the key should be secret and should be discarded unless there is a desire for repeata-
      bility. Hashing used for this purpose carries special risks that need to be addressed
      with specifc controls (see Sec. 4.3.2 below for further information). Hashing with-
      out a key generally does not confer security because an attacker can brute force all
      possible values to be hashed.
    • Replacement with keywords. This approach transforms identifers such as George
      Washington to PATIENT. Note that some keywords may be equally identifying, such
      as transforming George Washington to PRESIDENT.
    • Replacement with realistic surrogate values. This approach transforms identifers,
      such as George Washington, to surrogates that blend in, such as Abraham Polk.33
Encryption, hashing with a keyed hash, and replacement with realistic surrogate values are
pseudonymization techniques. The technique used to remove direct identifers should be
clearly documented for users of the dataset – especially if the technique of replacement by


33 A study by Carrell et al. found that using realistic surrogate names in de-identifed text like John
                                                                                                  Walker
  and 3900 Pennsylvania Ave instead of generic labels like PATIENT and ADDRESS could decrease or
  mitigate the risk of re-identifying the few names that remained in the text because “the reviewers were
  unable to distinguish the residual (leaked) identifers from the...surrogates” [27].
