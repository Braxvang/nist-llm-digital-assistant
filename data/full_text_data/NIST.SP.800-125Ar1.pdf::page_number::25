NIST SP 800-125A REV. 1                                                     SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR
                                                                        SERVER-BASED HYPERVISOR PLATFORMS

The dedicated security appliance is deployed in the virtual network in front of the monitored VM and
monitors all traffic going in and out of the VM. The main disadvantage of this approach is that if the VM is
migrated to some other physical host, the dedicated appliance must be migrated as well.

A generic security appliance deployed on a virtual network and configured to monitor multiple VMs may
have to be continuously reconfigured for the following reasons:

 •   The set of VMs to be monitored is continuously in a state of flux since VMs are subject to migration
     from one virtualized host to another due to load balancing, performance, and even security reasons.
 •   If virtual LANs (VLANs) are used to provide communication-level isolation among VMs, the
     configuration of VLANs may undergo continuous change as the workload patterns shift on VMs.
     This may require re-configuration of the network traffic mirroring capabilities to ensure that all
     virtual network traffic flows through the monitoring tool impacting the overall performance of the
     workloads inside that virtualized host.

In a hypervisor-based security monitoring solution, the security tool that monitors and protects VMs (User
VMs) is run outside of the VMs hosting business applications in a special security-hardened VM. A security
tool designed and configured to run in this mode is called Security Virtual Appliance (SVA). The SVA obtains
its visibility into the state of a VM (e.g., CPU, registers, memory, and I/O devices) as well as network traffic
amongst VMs and between VMs and the hypervisor through the virtual machine introspection API of the
hypervisor. This is the preferable solution since:

     (a) It is not vulnerable to a flaw in the Guest OS.
     (b) It is independent of the Virtual Network Configuration and does not have to be reconfigured every
         time the virtual network configuration changes due to migration of VMs or change in connectivity
         among VMs resident on the hypervisor host.

Therefore, the security recommendations, with respect to creating the VM monitoring solution for the
protection of the hypervisor, are as follows:

Security Recommendation HY-SR-14: There should be a mechanism for security monitoring, security
policy enforcement of VM operations, and detecting malicious processes running inside VMs and
malicious traffic going into and out of a VM. This monitoring and enforcement mechanism forms the
foundation for building Anti-Virus (AV) and Intrusion Detection & Prevention System (IDPS)
solutions.

Security Recommendation HY-SR-15: Solutions for Security Monitoring and security policy
enforcement of VMs should be based outside of VMs and leverage the virtual machine introspection
capabilities of the hypervisor. Generally, such solutions involve running a security tool as a Security
Virtual Appliance (SVA) in a security-hardened or trusted VM.

Security Recommendation HY-SR-16: All anti-malware tools (e.g., virus checkers, firewalls, and IDPS)
running in the virtualized host should have the capability to perform autonomous signature or reference
file updates on a periodic basis.
