                                                 CONTINGENCY PLANNING GUIDE FOR FEDERAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS



1.2       Scope

This document is published by NIST as recommended guidelines for federal organizations. To assist
personnel responsible for developing contingency plans, this document discusses common technologies
that may be used to support contingency capabilities. Given the broad range of information system
designs and configurations, as well as the rapid development and obsolescence of products and
capabilities, the scope of the discussion is not intended to be comprehensive. Rather, the document
describes technology practices to enhance an organization’s information system contingency planning
capabilities. These guidelines present contingency planning principles for the following common
platform types:

         Client/server systems;
         Telecommunications systems; and
         Mainframe systems.
The document outlines planning principles for a wide variety of incidents that can affect information
system operations. These range from minor incidents causing short-term disruptions to disasters that
affect normal operations for an extended period. Because information systems vary in design and
purpose, specific incident types and associated contingency measures are not addressed in this guide.
Instead, a defined process is provided for identifying planning requirements needed to develop an
effective contingency plan for any information system.

This document does not address facility-level information system planning (commonly referred to as a
disaster recovery plan) or organizational mission continuity (commonly referred to as a continuity of
operations [COOP] plan) except where it is required to restore information systems and their processing
capabilities. Nor does this document address continuity of mission/business processes. Although
information systems typically support mission/business processes, the processes also depend on a variety
of other resources and capabilities not associated with information systems. Recovery of mission
essential functions is addressed by COOP plans or business continuity plans. These plans are part of a
suite of security and emergency management-related plans further described in Section 2.2. The ISCP
may be prepared in coordination with disaster recovery planning, COOP planning, or business continuity
planning to the degree that a particular system is necessary to provide a capability that is required during
any of these events/efforts.

Information in this guide is consistent with guidelines provided in other NIST documents, including NIST
SP 800-53 and FIPS 199. The guidelines proposed are also consistent with federal mandates affecting
contingency, continuity of operations, and disaster recovery planning, including:

         Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002;
         OMB Circular A-130, Management of Federal Information Resources, Appendix III, November
          2000;
         Federal Continuity Directive (FCD)-1, Federal Executive Branch National Continuity Program
          and Requirements, February 2008;
         National Security Presidential Directive (NSPD)-51/Homeland Security Presidential Directive
          (HSPD)-20, National Continuity Policy, May 2007;
         National Continuity Policy Implementation Plan, August 2007; and
         National Response Framework, March 22, 2008.
