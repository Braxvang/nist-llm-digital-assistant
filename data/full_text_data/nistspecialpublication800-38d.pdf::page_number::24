with the pre-counter block that was generated in Step 2, and the result is truncated to the
specified tag length to form the authentication tag. The ciphertext and the tag are returned as the
output in Step 7.

The authenticated encryption function is illustrated in Figure 3 above. The determination of J0
from IV (Step 2) is not depicted.
