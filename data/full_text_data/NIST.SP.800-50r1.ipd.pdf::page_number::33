      NIST SP 800-50r1 ipd                                                      Building a Cybersecurity and
      August 2023                                                                 Privacy Learning Program

854   Examples of such responsibilities include configuring network management and granting system
855   access (e.g., system administration privileges). For each type of privileged user, the Learning
856   Program Manager must coordinate training with their manager or supervisor, human capital
857   officer, and the training managers to ensure that training is delivered and kept current.

858   2.5.3. Staff with Significant Cybersecurity or Privacy Responsibilities
859   Personnel with significant cybersecurity or privacy responsibilities and some of the privileged
860   users will be required to have training due to the nature of their role within the organization.
861   There are circumstances in which personnel have rights or access to sensitive or critical systems
862   and, therefore, will require additional training. The permitted personnel will have additional
863   access that can be rescinded when their work role changes. Examples of such environments
864   include acquisitions, financial management, healthcare, human resources, and web publishing.
865   NIST SP 800-53, the Role-Based Training control (AT-3) provides a definition for the training
866   required:
867               Comprehensive role-based training addresses management, operational,
868               and technical roles and responsibilities covering physical, personnel, and
869               technical controls. Role-based training also includes policies, procedures,
870               tools, methods, and artifacts for the security and privacy roles defined.
871               Organizations provide the training necessary for individuals to fulfill
872               their responsibilities related to operations and supply chain risk
873               management within the context of organizational security and privacy
874               programs. Role-based training also applies to contractors who provide
875               services to federal agencies.
876   This training is typically associated with job duties determined by organizational leaders, such as
877   the agency’s CIO, CPO, or CISO and the employee’s manager or supervisor, and is typically
878   documented in the employee’s performance plan. Personnel in these work roles may require
879   professional development to maintain their professional status or memberships, such as annual or
880   regular professional certifications or courses. Examples of typical role-based training recipients
881   include the CISO, privacy officers, cybersecurity managers, cybersecurity and privacy analysts,
882   and incident responders. References for cybersecurity work roles or competency areas are
883   explored in NIST SP 800-181r1 [3], which describes the knowledge, skills, and tasks associated
884   with cybersecurity-related work.

885   2.5.4. Determining Who Has Significant Cybersecurity and Privacy
886          Responsibilities
887   FISMA [9] requires personnel with significant cybersecurity and privacy responsibilities to
888   receive role-based training. Additional guidance can be found in NIST SP 800-37 [7], NIST SP
889   800-53 [8], and NIST SP 800-181r1 [3]. In combination, these documents assist with the
890   identification of roles and functions in the cybersecurity workforce that require role-based
891   training. As this document covers the concepts of managing a Learning Program for privacy as
892   well, consider how to extend the same concepts to help privacy professionals meet their own
893   role-based or significant privacy training needs.
