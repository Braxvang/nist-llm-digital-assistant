 2.4 Trends in Sanitization

For storage devices containing magnetic media, a single overwrite pass with a fixed pattern such
as binary zeros typically hinders recovery of data even if state of the art laboratory techniques are
applied to attempt to retrieve the data. One major drawback of relying solely upon the native
Read and Write interface for performing the overwrite procedure is that areas not currently
mapped to active Logical Block Addressing (LBA) addresses (e.g., defect areas and currently
unallocated space) are not addressed. Dedicated sanitize commands support addressing these
areas more effectively. The use of such commands results in a tradeoff because although they
should more thoroughly address all areas of the media, using these commands also requires trust
and assurance from the vendor that the commands have been implemented as expected.

Users who have become accustomed to relying upon overwrite techniques on magnetic media
and who have continued to apply these techniques as media types evolved (such as to flash
memory-based devices) may be exposing their data to increased risk of unintentional disclosure.
Although the host interface (e.g. Advanced Technology Attachment (ATA) or Small Computer
System Interface (SCSI)) may be the same (or very similar) across devices with varying
underlying media types, it is critical that the sanitization techniques are carefully matched to the
media.

Destructive techniques for some media types may become more difficult or impossible to apply
in the future. Traditional techniques such as degaussing (for magnetic media) become more
complicated as magnetic media evolves, because some emerging variations of magnetic
recording technologies incorporate media with higher coercivity (magnetic force). As a result,
existing degaussers may not have sufficient force to effectively degauss such media.

Applying destructive techniques to electronic storage media (e.g., flash memory) is also
becoming more challenging, as the necessary particle size for commonly applied grinding
techniques goes down proportionally to any increases in flash memory storage density. Flash
memory chips already present challenges with occasional damage to grinders due to the hardness
of the component materials, and this problem will get worse as grinders attempt to grind the
chips into even smaller pieces.

Cryptographic Erase (CE), as described in Section 2.6, is an emerging sanitization technique that
can be used in some situations when data is encrypted as it is stored on media. With CE, media
sanitization is performed by sanitizing the cryptographic keys used to encrypt the data, as
opposed to sanitizing the storage locations on media containing the encrypted data itself. CE
techniques are typically capable of sanitizing media very quickly and could support partial
sanitization, a technique where a subset of storage media is sanitization. Partial sanitization,
sometimes referred to as selective sanitization, has potential applications in cloud computing and
mobile devices. However, operational use of CE today presents some challenges. In some cases,
it may be difficult to verify that CE has effectively sanitized media. This challenge, and possible
approaches, is described in Section 4.7.3. If verification cannot be performed, organizations
should use alternative sanitization methods that can be verified, or use CE in combination with a
sanitization technique that can be verified.
