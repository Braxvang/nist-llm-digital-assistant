negotiated service agreements, which provide greater range and flexibility, necessitate careful
scrutiny and prioritization of requirements that are incorporated into the terms of service in order
to be cost effective. In either case, however, available risk mitigation techniques are unlikely to
ever be sufficient enough to allow high-value or highly sensitive data or mission-critical
applications to be deployed to a public cloud. For these situations, the organization could
consider employing a cloud computing environment with a more suitable deployment model,
such as an internal private cloud, which can potentially offer greater oversight and authority over
security and privacy, and better limit the type of tenants that share platform resources, reducing
exposure in the event of a failure or configuration error in a control.

There are several distinct stages of outsourcing at which an organization can carry out prescribed
activities to remain accountable and mitigate the above-mentioned security and privacy issues:
when planning the initiative (i.e., preliminary activities), when initiating the service contract and
overseeing it (i.e., initiating and coincident activities), and when closing down the services and
contract (i.e., concluding activities) [All88, Len03]. The subsequent sections of this chapter
discuss these stages in detail.

Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) are pertinent to all stages of outsourcing,
particularly FIPS 199 and FIPS 200, which apply to planning at the early stages.20

            FIPS 199. This standard, entitled Standards for Security Categorization of Federal
             Information and Information Systems, provides a common framework and method for
             categorizing information and information systems to ensure that adequate levels of
             information security are provided, which are commensurate with the level of risk. The
             resulting security categorization feeds into other activities such as security control
             selection, privacy impact analysis, and critical infrastructure analysis.

            FIPS 200. This standard, entitled Minimum Security Requirements for Federal
             Information and Information Systems, directs agencies to meet the identified minimum
             security requirements for federal information and information systems by selecting the
             appropriate security controls and assurance requirements described in NIST Special
             Publication (SP) 800-53 Revision 3.

In addition to SP 800-53 mentioned above, other NIST guidelines provide information and
guidance on planning, implementing, and managing information system security and protecting
information that apply to outsourcing initiatives. They include the NIST SPs listed below in
Table 2, whose principles have the utmost relevance to cloud computing environments overall
and should be used in conjunction with this publication.21
