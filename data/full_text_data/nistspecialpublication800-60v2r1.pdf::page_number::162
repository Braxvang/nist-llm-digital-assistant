Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized disclosure of much
energy resource management information can result in major financial consequences and impact
financial markets and have a severe adverse effect on public confidence in the agency. In some
cases, the probable consequences of damage to public confidence in the agency can even be
high.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of some
energy resource management information would have only a limited adverse effect on agency
operations. However, the consequences that can be expected to result from unauthorized
disclosure of most energy resource management information justify a moderate provisional
confidentiality impact level.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of energy resource management
information may depend on the urgency with which the information is typically needed.
Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external communications
(e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect operations and/or public confidence in the
agency, but the damage to the mission would usually be limited

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: If the energy resource management
information is mission-critical or very sensitive, the integrity impact level may be moderate or
high.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
most energy resource management information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to energy resource management
information. Generally, missions supported by energy resource management information are
tolerant of delay.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
energy resource management information is low.

D.7.4 Energy Production Information Type

Energy production involves the transformation of raw energy resources into useable, deliverable
energy. Impacts to some information and information systems associated with energy production
may affect the security of the critical energy infrastructure. The recommended provisional
categorization of the energy production information type follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}
