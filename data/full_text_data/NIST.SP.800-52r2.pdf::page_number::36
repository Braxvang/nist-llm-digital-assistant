NIST SP 800-52 REV. 2                                            GUIDELINES FOR TLS IMPLEMENTATIONS


3.4.2.11 Supported Versions

Applies to TLS version 1.3

The supported versions extension is sent in the ClientHello message to indicate which versions
of TLS the client supports. A TLS 1.3 server shall be able to process this extension. When it is
absent from the ClientHello message, the server shall use the version negotiation specified in
TLS 1.2 and earlier.

3.4.2.12 Cookie

Applies to TLS version 1.3

The cookie extension allows the server to force the client to prove that it is reachable at its
apparent network address and offload state information to the client. Servers that support TLS
1.3 may support the cookie extension in accordance with RFC 8446 [57].

3.4.2.13 Certificate Signature Algorithms

Applies to TLS versions: 1.2, 1.3

The Certificate Signature Algorithms extension (signature_algorithms_cert) indicates the
signature algorithms that may be used in certificates. (When it is not present, algorithms in the
Signature Algorithms extension apply to certificates as well.) TLS servers that support TLS 1.3
shall support this extension, and it should be supported for TLS 1.2.

3.4.2.14 Post-handshake Client Authentication

Applies to TLS version 1.3

The Post-handshake Client Authentication extension (post_handshake_auth) allows the server to
request client authentication after the handshake is complete. TLS servers that support TLS 1.3
may support this extension.

3.4.2.15 Signed Certificate Timestamps

Applies to TLS versions: 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3

The Certificate Transparency project (described in RFC 6962 [40]) strives to reduce the impact
of certificate-based threats by making the issuance of CA-signed certificates more transparent.
This is done through the use of public logs of certificates, public log monitoring, and public
certificate auditing. Certificate logs are cryptographically assured records of certificates that are
open to public scrutiny. Certificates may be appended to logs, but they cannot be removed,
modified, or inserted into the middle of a log. Monitors watch certificate logs for suspicious
certificates, such as those that were not authorized by the domain they claim to represent.
Auditors have the ability to check the membership of a particular certificate in a log, as well as
verify the integrity and consistency of logs.
