SP 800-152                                                   A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


k-1 of the key splits are compromised, the key still could not be reconstructed by an attacker
having the k-1 key splits.

FR: 6.100 The CKMS design shall specify all keys that are managed using key splitting
techniques and shall specify n and k for each technique.

FR: 6.101 For each (n, k) key splitting technique used, the CKMS design shall specify how
key splitting is done, and any known rationale (logic, mathematics) as to why any k of the n
key splits can form the key, but k-1 of the key splits provide no information about the key.

                           A Federal CKMS could use key splitting in order to

                           implement multiparty control of keys.

6.8   Compromise Recovery

A compromise is the unauthorized disclosure, modification, substitution, or use of sensitive
data (e.g., keys, metadata, or other security-related information) or the unauthorized
modification of a security-related system, device or process in order to gain unauthorized
access. An FCKMS should protect all keys and sensitive metadata so that they are not
disclosed, modified, substituted or used by unauthorized parties. This requires that all
components in the FCKMS remain secure.

However, since it is difficult to prevent all potential security problems that could arise from
all possible threats, an FCKMS should be designed to detect potential compromises and
unauthorized modifications, to mitigate their undesirable effects, to alert the appropriate
parties of compromises, and to recover (or help recover) to a secure state if a compromise or
unauthorized modification is discovered.

             PL-1          Recovery Plan for recovering from actual and suspected
             PS-1          compromises of its security.
             CP-2          A Federal CKMS shall perform the following when a
PR:6.76
                           compromise is detected or suspected:
                              a) Report the compromise to FCKMS management,
                              b) Evaluate the compromise to determine its cause and
                                 scope,
                              c) Institute compromise-mitigation measures to minimize
                                 key and/or metadata exposure,
                              d) Institute corrective measures to prevent the recurrence
                                 of the compromise, and,
                              e) Return the FCKMS to a secure operating state.

6.8.1 Key Compromise
Key compromise is the disclosure of a key or its sensitive metadata to one or more
unauthorized entities, or the modification, substitution, or use of a cryptographic key or its
