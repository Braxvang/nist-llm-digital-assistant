                                                       SECURE DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM (DNS) DEPLOYMENT GUIDE



•   Checklist item 1: When installing the upgraded version of name server software, the
    administrator should make necessary changes to configuration parameters to take advantage of
    new security features.

•   Checklist item 2: Whether running the latest version or an earlier version, the administrator
    should be aware of the vulnerabilities, exploits, security fixes, and patches for the version that is
    in operation in the enterprise. The following actions are recommended:

    –   Subscribe to ISC’s mailing list called “bind-announce” or NLnet Labs mailing list “nsd-
        users”

    –   Periodically refer to the BIND vulnerabilities page at
        http://www.isc.org/products/BIND/bind-security.html

    –   Refer to CERT®/CC’s Vulnerability Notes Database at http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/ and the
        NIST NVD metabase at http://nvd.nist.gov/.
    For other implementations (e.g., MS Windows Server), other announcement lists may exist.

•   Checklist item 3: To prevent information about which version of server software is running on a
    system, name servers should be configured to refuse queries for its version.

•   Checklist item 4: The authoritative name servers for an enterprise should be both network and
    geographically dispersed. Network-based dispersion consists of ensuring that all name servers are
    not behind a single router or switch, in a single subnet, or using a single leased line. Geographic
    dispersion consists of ensuring that not all name servers are in the same physical location, and
    hosting at least a single secondary server off-site.

•   Checklist item 5: If a hidden master is used, the hidden authoritative master server should only
    accept zone transfer requests from the set of secondary zone name servers and refuse all other
    DNS queries. The IP address of the hidden master should not appear in the name server set in the
    zone database.

•   Checklist item 6: For split DNS implementation, there should be a minimum of two physical
    files or views. One should exclusively provide name resolution for hosts located inside the
    firewall. It also can contain RRsets for hosts outside the firewall. The other file or view should
    provide name resolution only for hosts located outside the firewall or in the DMZ, and not for any
    hosts inside the firewall.
