SP 800-89                                                                               November 2006



entity obtaining the assurance, the entity’s organization, and any other relying parties; 2)
a clock whose accuracy is trusted by the entity recording the time; 3) a clock of unknown
accuracy. Parties relying on the value assigned to assurance_time shall be made aware of
the time source used, in order to assess its trustworthiness.

When assurance of private key possession is explicitly provided using one of the methods
described above, the assurance_time shall be recorded.

6.3.1 Obtaining Assurance of Possession Using a Digital Signature
Assurance that an entity possesses the private key corresponding to a given public key
may be obtained by verifying the signature on an appropriately formed message. The
party who obtains assurance using this method may be the same entity that is authorized
to use the private key of the key pair (i.e., the intended owner of the key pair), a TTP, or
some other entity.
6.3.1.1 The Private-Key-Possession Assurance Message
When a digital signature is used to provide assurance of private key possession, the
verifying entity (who must be trusted by all relying parties) is sent a signed private-key-
possession assurance message (simply called the assurance message herein); the digital
signature on the assurance message is called the assurance signature.
The assurance message shall include the following:
       1. The signatory’s identity;
       2. The intended verifier’s identity;
       3. A timestamp token (TST) created by a Trusted Timestamp Authority (TTA) that
          is trusted by all relying parties. This TST could be obtained from the TTA by the
          signatory or by the intended verifier (who then provides it to the signatory).
          Relying parties must be aware of the security strength provided by the TTA’s
          digital signature. The security strength provided by the TTA’s digital signature
          shall meet or exceed the security requirements of the requesting entity and relying
          party (see SP 800-57);
           AND/OR
           A nonce3 supplied by the intended verifier. If this option is used, the nonce shall
           contain a random component with entropy4 equal to or greater than the security
           strength associated with the private key for which assurance of possession is
           sought. If the assurance message will not include a TST, and the relying parties
           require that an assurance_time be recorded upon successful verification of the
           assurance signature, then the nonce should also contain a verifier-supplied
           timestamp component that unambiguously represents the time that the nonce was
           made available for inclusion in the assurance message.

3
    A time-varying value that has at most a negligible chance of repeating.
4
    A measure of the disorder, randomness or variability in a closed system. See SP 800-90.
