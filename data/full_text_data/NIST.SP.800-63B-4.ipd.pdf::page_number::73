2053   10.   Usability Considerations
2054   This section is informative.
2055         Note: In this section, the term users means claimants or subscribers.
2056   [ISO/IEC9241-11] defines usability as the “extent to which a system, product, or service
2057   can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency
2058   and satisfaction in a specified context of use.” This definition focuses on users, their
2059   goals, and the context of use as key elements necessary for achieving effectiveness,
2060   efficiency, and satisfaction. A holistic approach that accounts for these key elements
2061   is necessary to achieve usability.
2062   A user’s goal for accessing an information system is to perform an intended task.
2063   Authentication is the function that enables this goal. However, from the user’s perspective,
2064   authentication stands between them and their intended task. Effective design and
2065   implementation of authentication makes it easy to do the right thing, hard to do the wrong
2066   thing, and easy to recover when the wrong thing happens.
2067   Organizations need to be cognizant of the overall implications of their stakeholders’ entire
2068   digital authentication ecosystem. Users often employ multiple authenticators, each for
2069   a different RP. They then struggle to remember passwords, to recall which authenticator
2070   goes with which RP, and to carry multiple physical authentication devices. Evaluating the
2071   usability of authentication is critical, as poor usability often results in coping mechanisms
2072   and unintended workarounds that can ultimately degrade the effectiveness of security
2073   controls.
2074   Integrating usability into the development process can lead to authentication solutions that
2075   are secure and usable while still addressing users’ authentication needs and organizations’
2076   business goals.
2077   The impact of usability across digital systems needs to be considered as part of the
2078   risk assessment when deciding on the appropriate AAL. Authenticators with a higher
2079   AAL sometimes offer better usability and should be allowed for use with lower AAL
2080   applications.
2081   Leveraging federation for authentication can alleviate many of the usability issues, though
2082   such an approach has its own tradeoffs, as discussed in [SP800-63C].
2083   This section provides general usability considerations and possible implementations, but
2084   does not recommend specific solutions. The implementations mentioned are examples
2085   to encourage innovative technological approaches to address specific usability needs.
2086   Further, usability considerations and their implementations are sensitive to many factors
2087   that prevent a one-size-fits-all solution. For example, a font size that works in the
2088   desktop computing environment may force text to scroll off of a small OTP device screen.
2089   Performing a usability evaluation on the selected authenticator is a critical component of

                                                    61
