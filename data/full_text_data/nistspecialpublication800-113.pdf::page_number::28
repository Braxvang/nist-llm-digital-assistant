                                                                                                         GUIDE TO SSL VPNS



Some SSL VPN products provide endpoint security controls for systems that are connecting into the
network via the network extension function. Such systems are generally of higher concern than those that
are just accessing Web sites, since these systems are usually granted much broader access to resources.

Endpoint security controls should be used with care. Due to the nature of remote access, the client
systems are more likely to be originating from uncontrolled environments. It is imperative that remote
systems are evaluated before allowing access to internal resources and cleaned after access is granted.
There is no industry-wide standard for endpoint security controls; many leading network and security
companies are working to create vendor-driven standards.

3.3.8     Intrusion Prevention

Some SSL VPN products provide an integrated intrusion prevention security service. They inspect the
contents of the data after it has been decrypted by the SSL VPN for potential attacks and various forms of
malware, including viruses and worms. The SSL VPN may include its own anti-malware and intrusion
detection software, or it may integrate with third-party software. Performing content inspection adds
processing time and latency to the throughput of packets. For high-volume networks, this latency in
addition to the latency of the encryption and decryption process may exceed tolerable limits. In those
cases, it is best to offload the intrusion prevention capabilities to a specialized intrusion prevention system
(IPS) device on the inside of the trusted network (that is, after the SSL VPN has decrypted the data).

3.4     SSL Protocol Basics

The security of the data sent over an SSL VPN relies on the security of the SSL protocol. The SSL
protocol allows a client (such as a Web browser) and a server (such as an SSL VPN) to negotiate the type
of security to be used during an SSL session. Thus, it is critical to make sure that the security agreed to
by the remote user and the SSL gateway meets the security requirements of the organization using the
SSL VPN.

There are three types of security that the client and server can negotiate: the version of SSL, the type of
cryptography, and the authentication method. All three are important to the security of the
communications channel that is established and are thus important to SSL VPN systems. These are
discussed in more detail in Sections 3.4.1 through 3.4.3.

NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-52, Guidelines for the Selection and Use of Transport Layer Security
(TLS) Implementations 6 , describes the technology used in SSL and TLS in detail. Readers of this
document who want to know more about these technologies are encouraged to read that publication.

3.4.1     Versions of SSL and TLS

In this document, the terms SSL and TLS are often used together to describe the same protocol. In fact,
SSL refers to all versions of the SSL protocol as defined by the IETF, while TLS refers only to versions
3.1 and later of the SSL protocol. Two versions of TLS have been standardized: TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1.
TLS 1.0 is the same as SSL 3.1; there are no versions of SSL after 3.1. As of the writing of this guide,
work is being done on TLS version 1.2. TLS is approved for use in the protection of Federal information;
SSL versions other than 3.1 are not.

Different SSL VPNs and different Web browsers use different versions of the SSL and TLS protocols.
For example, some browsers support SSL 3.0 but not TLS 1.0 or 1.1; other browsers support TLS 1.0 but
