                                 GUIDE TO PROTECTING THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION (PII)



levels suggested for these factors are for illustrative purposes; each instance of PII is different, and each
organization has a unique set of requirements and a different mission. Therefore, organizations should
determine which factors, including organization-specific factors, they should use for determining PII
confidentiality impact levels and should create and implement policy and procedures that support these
determinations.

3.2.1     Identifiability

Organizations should evaluate how easily PII can be used to identify specific individuals. For example,
PII data composed of individuals‘ names, fingerprints, or SSNs uniquely and directly identify individuals,
whereas PII data composed of individuals‘ ZIP codes and dates of birth can indirectly identify individuals
or can significantly narrow large datasets.33 However, data composed of only individuals‘ area codes and
gender usually would not provide for direct or indirect identification of an individual depending upon the
context and sample size. 34 Thus, PII that is uniquely and directly identifiable may warrant a higher
impact level than PII that is not directly identifiable by itself.

3.2.2     Quantity of PII

Organizations may also choose to consider how many individuals are identified in the information (e.g.,
number of records). Breaches of 25 records and 25 million records may have different impacts, not only
in terms of the collective harm to individuals, but also in terms of harm to the organization‘s reputation
and the cost to the organization in addressing the breach. For this reason, organizations may choose to set
a higher impact level for particularly large PII datasets than would otherwise be set. However,
organizations should not set a lower impact level for a PII dataset simply because it contains a small
number of records.

3.2.3     Data Field Sensitivity

Organizations should evaluate the sensitivity of each individual PII data field, as well as the sensitivity of
the PII data fields together. 35 For example, an individual‘s SSN, medical history, or financial account
information is generally considered more sensitive than an individual‘s phone number or ZIP code.
Organizations often require the PII confidentiality impact level to be set at least to moderate if a certain
data field, such as SSN, is present. Organizations may also consider certain combinations of PII data
fields to be more sensitive, such as name and credit card number, than each data field would be
considered without the existence of the others. Data fields may also be considered more sensitive based
on potential harm when used in contexts other than their intended use. For example, basic background
information, such as place of birth or parent‘s middle name, is often used as an authentication factor for
password recovery at many web sites.

     A Massachusetts Institute of Technology study showed that 97% of the names and addresses on a voting list were
     identifiable using only ZIP code and date of birth. L. Sweeney, Computational Disclosure Control: A Primer on Data

     Section 4.2 discusses how organizations can reduce the need to protect PII by removing PII from records.

     Some organizations have defined certain types or categories of PII as sensitive and assign higher impact levels to those types
     of PII. For example, in its PIA policy, the Census Bureau has defined the following topics as sensitive: abortion; alcohol,
     drug, or other addictive products; illegal conduct; illegal immigration status; information damaging to financial standing,
     employability, or reputation; information leading to social stigmatization or discrimination; politics; psychological well-
     being or mental health; religion; same-sex partners; sexual behavior; sexual orientation; taxes; and other information due to
     specific cultural or other factors. http://www.census.gov/po/pia/pia_guide.html.
