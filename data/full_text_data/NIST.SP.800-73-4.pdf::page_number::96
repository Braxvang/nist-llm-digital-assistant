Special Publication 800-73-4                             Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification â€“ Part 2:
                                                         PIV Card Application Card Command Interface

The public key data object in tag '86' is encoded as follows:

                                   Table 13. Public Key encoding for ECC

                        Tag               Length                Value
                        '86'              L                     04 || X || Y [SECG, Section 2.3.3]

Note: The octet '04' indicates that the X and Y coordinates of point P are encoded without the use of
point compression. The length L is 65 bytes for points on Curve P-256 and 97 bytes for points on Curve
P-384.
