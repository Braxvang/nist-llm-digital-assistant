Q. What are the four phases of the incident response life cycle?
A. NIST SP 800-61, Computer Security Incident Handling Guide, states that the four
   phases of the incident response life cycle are:
   • Preparation;
   • Detection and Analysis;
   • Containment, Eradication, and Recovery; and
   • Post-Incident Recovery.

Q. What are some practices that may prevent incidents?
A. Examples of practices that help to prevent incidents are:
   • Having a patch management program to assist system administrators in
     identifying, acquiring, testing, and deploying patches that eliminate known
     vulnerabilities in systems and applications;
   • Hardening all hosts appropriately to eliminate vulnerabilities and configuration
     weaknesses;
   • Configuring the network perimeter to deny all activity that is not expressly
     permitted;
   • Deploying software throughout the organization to detect and stop malicious
     code; and
   • Making users aware of policies and procedures concerning the appropriate use
     of networks, systems, and applications.

Q. Why is it important to have an incident response capability?
A. Policy guidance issued by OMB Circular A-130, Appendix III, requires that
   agencies have a capability to provide help to users when security incidents occur
   in their systems and to share information concerning common vulnerabilities and
   threats.

Q. What does an incident response capability do?
A. A well-defined incident response capability helps an organization detect incidents
   rapidly, minimize losses and destruction, identify weaknesses, and restore IT
   operations without delay.
