       NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
       December 2023                                                                       and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

1898   maintenance
1899   The process of managing PIV Cards or derived PIV credentials once they are issued, including reissuance, post-
1900   issuance updates, and termination.

1901   mobile device
1902   A portable computing device that (i) has a small form factor such that it can easily be carried by a single individual;
1903   (ii) is designed to operate without a physical connection (e.g., wirelessly transmit or receive information); (iii)
1904   possesses local, non-removable, or removable data storage; and (iv) includes a self-contained power source. Mobile
1905   devices may also include voice communication capabilities, on-board sensors that allow the devices to capture
1906   information, and/or built-in features for synchronizing local data with remote locations. Examples include smart
1907   phones, tablets, and e-readers.

1908   personally identifiable information (PII)
1909   Any representation of information that permits the identity of an individual to whom the information applies to be
1910   reasonably inferred by either direct or indirect means. [E-GOV]

1911   PIV Card
1912   The physical artifact (e.g., identity card, “smart” card) issued to an applicant by an issuer that contains stored
1913   identity markers or credentials (e.g., a photograph, cryptographic keys, digitized fingerprint representations) so that
1914   the claimed identity of the cardholder can be verified against the stored credentials by another person (i.e., human-
1915   readable and verifiable) or an automated process (i.e., computer-readable and verifiable).

1916   PIV credential
1917   Evidence that attests to one’s right to credit or authority that authoritatively binds an identity (and, optionally,
1918   additional attributes) to an individual.

1919   PIV identity account
1920   The logical record that contains credentialing information for a given PIV cardholder. This is stored within the
1921   issuer’s identity management system and includes PIV enrollment data, cardholder identity attributes, and
1922   information regarding the cardholder’s PIV Card and any derived PIV credentials bound to the account.

1923   post-enrollment binding
1924   An association of the issued derived PIV credential to the subscriber’s PIV identity account, as specified in [SP800-
1925   63B].

1926   registration
1927   Making a person’s identity known to the enrollment/identity management information system by associating a
1928   unique identifier with that identity and collecting and recording the person’s relevant attributes into the information
1929   system. Registration is required for adjudication, card/credential personalization and issuance, and maintenance,
1930   which are necessary to issue or maintain a PIV Card or derived PIV credential. Attributes about a cardholder and
1931   derived PIV credential holder may also be recorded in the individual’s PIV identity account.

1932   risk
1933   The level of potential impact on an organization’s operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), its
1934   assets, or individuals of a threat or a given likelihood of that threat occurring.

1935   senior authorizing official (SAO)
1936   A senior organization official who has budgetary control, provides oversight, develops policy, and has authority
1937   over all functions and services provided by the issuer.

1938   subscriber
1939   A PIV cardholder to whom a derived PIV credential has been issued.

1940   system of record (SOR)
1941   A group of records under the control of a federal agency that contain a personal identifier (e.g., a name, date of birth,
1942   fingerprint, Social Security Number, Employee Number) and one other item of personal data (e.g., home address,
1943   performance rating, and blood type) from which information is retrieved using a personal identifier.
