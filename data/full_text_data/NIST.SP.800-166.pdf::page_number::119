                                                                     DATA MODEL TEST GUIDELINES

9.3.2.3 Public Key Size

 Test Assertion           TA-09.03.02.03
 Purpose                  Verifies that the key size requirements are in accordance with
                          Table 3-1 of [SP800-78].
 DTR(s)                   • DTR-07.03.02.09
 Issuer Documentation     None.
 Precondition(s)          • A token with the Derived PIV Application is inserted into an
                             appropriate token reader.
                          • Suitable drivers have been loaded between the test system and
                             an instance of the reader.
                          • A digital signature certificate is present within the Derived PIV
                             Application.
 Test Scenario            1. Send the SELECT token command with
                                • AID == 'A0 00 00 03 08 00 00 20 00 01 00'
                          2. Send the GET DATA command with
                                • Data field of the command containing the tag
                                   ('5FC10A') of the X.509 Certificate for
                                   Digital Signature data object
                          3. Extract subjectPublicKeyInfo->algorithm->algorithm
                             field value.
                          4. Extract the subjectPublicKeyInfo->subjectPublicKey
                             from the certificate
                          5. Match the key size to Table 3-1 of [SP800-78].
 Expected Result(s)       1. From Step 1, the command returns the application property
                             template with the status word '90 00'.
                          2. From Step 2, the command returns the requested data object
                             along with the status word '90 00'.
                          3. From Step 5, the key size is in accordance with Table 3-1 of
                             [SP800-78].

9.3.2.4 Key Usage Extension

 Test Assertion           TA-09.03.02.04
 Purpose                  Verifies that the digital signature certificate asserts the appropriate
                          purposes for the key.
