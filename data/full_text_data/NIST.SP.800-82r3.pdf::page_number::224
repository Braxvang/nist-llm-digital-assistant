Appendix E. OT Security Capabilities and Tools
This appendix provides an overview of key security technologies that are available to or being
developed to support the OT community. There are several security products that are marketed
specifically for OT, while others are general IT security products that are also applicable to OT.
Many cybersecurity products are marketed as a single platform that combines the capabilities
and tools listed here. Each organization should make a risk-based determination on whether to
employ the security technologies and tools mentioned in this appendix.

E.1.   Network Segmentation and Isolation
Network segmentation and separation technologies allow OT network owners to implement
cybersecurity strategies that isolate devices and network traffic by both physical and logical
means. Popular tooling for this capability area is described below.

E.1.1. Firewalls
Firewalls can be used to logically enforce user-defined rule sets on network traffic. Commonly
placed at network boundaries, firewalls can limit both incoming and outgoing traffic based on a
variety of data characteristics.
There are several types of general IT firewalls. Basic packet filtering firewalls directly inspect
current network traffic at OSI Layers 3 and 4 to inform decisions on whether to drop or forward
packets to their destination. Conversely, stateful inspection firewalls draw upon the memory of
both past and present network connections when making filtering decisions, thereby offering
more capabilities at an increased computational cost. Next generation firewalls (NGFWs) expand
upon stateful inspection firewalls by adding features such as application filtering, deep packet
inspection, VPN traffic awareness, adaptive rules, and threat detection.
Several vendors also offer OT-specific firewalls with unique feature sets. For example, they
often provide built-in parsers for common OT protocols, such as DNP3, CIP, and Modbus,
allowing for deep packet inspection of OT traffic.

E.1.2. Unidirectional Gateways
Unidirectional gateways, also referred to as data diodes, are designed to only allow data
transmission in a single direction. Unlike a firewall, data diodes cannot be programmed to allow
data to flow in both directions because the hardware is incapable. A common use case is placing
a data diode at the boundary between the operational network and the enterprise network. The
data diode would allow network traffic to leave the operational network but not enter, preventing
a potential avenue of cyber attack.

E.1.3. Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs)
A VLAN can be used to logically separate areas within a network when physical separation may
not be feasible due to cost or other prohibitive measures. VLANs are implemented on modern
network switching equipment that logically separates network traffic based on switch ports. For
example, an 8-port switch can be configured to separate traffic into two VLANs. One VLAN
