       November 2023

1423   3.4.12. System and Component Configuration for High-Risk Areas
1424             REQUIREMENT: 03.04.12

1425             ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE
1426             Determine if:

1427             A.03.04.12.ODP[01]: configurations for systems or system components to be issued to
1428             individuals traveling to high-risk locations are defined.
1429             A.03.04.12.ODP[02]: the security requirements to be applied to the system or system
1430             components when individuals return from travel are defined.
1431             A.03.04.12.a: systems or system components with the following configurations are issued to
1432             individuals traveling to high-risk locations: <A.03.04.12.ODP[01]: configurations>.
1433             A.03.04.12.b: the following security requirements are applied to the system or system
1434             components when the individuals return from travel: <A.03.04.12.ODP[02]: requirements>.

1435             ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS
1436             Examine
1437             [SELECT FROM: configuration management policy and procedures; configuration management
1438             plan; procedures for the baseline configuration of the system; procedures for system component
1439             installations and upgrades; system component inventory; system component installations or
1440             upgrades and associated records; records of system baseline configuration reviews and
1441             updates; system configuration settings; system architecture; change control records; system
1442             security plan; other relevant documents or records]
1443             Interview
1444             [SELECT FROM: personnel with configuration management responsibilities; personnel with
1445             information security responsibilities; system administrators]
1446             Test
1447             [SELECT FROM: processes for managing baseline configurations]

1450         Identification and Authentication

1451   3.5.1. User Identification, Authentication, and Re-Authentication
1452           REQUIREMENT: 03.05.01

1453           ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE
1454           Determine if:
1455           A.03.05.01.ODP[01]: circumstances or situations that require re-authentication are defined.
1456           A.03.05.01.a[01]: system users are uniquely identified and authenticated.
1457           A.03.05.01.a[02]: the unique identification of authenticated system users is associated with
1458           processes acting on behalf of those users.
