                                                                                          GUIDE TO GENERAL SERVER SECURITY



Administrators should ensure that servers, particularly new ones, are adequately protected during the
patching process. For example, a server that is not fully patched or not configured securely could be
compromised by threats if it is openly accessible while it is being patched. When preparing new servers
for deployment, administrators should do either of the following:

 Keep the servers disconnected from networks or connect them only to an isolated “build” network
  until all patches have been transferred to the servers through out-of-band means (e.g., CDs) and
  installed, and the other configuration steps listed in this section have been performed.

 Place the servers on a virtual local area network (VLAN) 16 or other network segment that severely
  restricts what actions the hosts on it can perform and what communications can reach the hosts—only
  allowing those events that are necessary for patching and configuring the hosts. Do not transfer the
  hosts to regular network segments until all the configuration steps listed in this section have been
  performed.

Administrators should generally not apply patches to production servers without first testing them on
another identically configured server because patches can inadvertently cause unexpected problems with
proper server operation. Although administrators can configure servers to download patches
automatically, the servers should not be configured to install them automatically so that they can first be
tested.

4.2     Hardening and Securely Configuring the OS

Administrators should perform the following steps to harden and securely configure a server OS:

 Remove unnecessary services, applications, and network protocols

 Configure OS user authentication

 Configure resource controls appropriately.

These steps are discussed further in Sections 4.2.1 through 4.2.3. Also, for particularly high-security
situations, administrators should consider configuring the OS to act as a bastion host. A bastion host has
particularly strong security controls and is configured so as to offer the least functionality possible. The
details of establishing a bastion host are necessarily OS-specific, so they are outside the scope of this
publication.

4.2.1     Remove or Disable Unnecessary Services, Applications, and Network Protocols

Ideally, a server should be on a dedicated, single-purpose host. When configuring the OS, remove all
services, applications, and network protocols (e.g., IPv4, IPv6) that are not required, and disable any such
unnecessary components that cannot be removed. If possible, install the minimal OS configuration and
then add, remove, or disable services, applications, and network protocols as needed. Many uninstall
scripts or programs are far from perfect in completely removing all components of a service, so it is better
not to install unnecessary services. Common types of services and applications that should usually be
removed if not required (or disabled if they cannot be removed) include the following:

      VLANs can easily be misconfigured in ways that reduce or eliminate their effectiveness as a security control. Organizations
      planning to use VLANs should ensure that they are configured properly and that any configuration changes are carefully
      verified.
