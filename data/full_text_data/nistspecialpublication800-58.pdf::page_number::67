       Request, sent over TLS. The Shared Secret Response provides the client with a
       one-time username and password. This password is then used to authenticate the
       Allocate message sent by the client to the TURN server to ask for a public IP
       address and port. For incoming data, the TURN server then stores the remote
       address and port where the data came from and forwards the data to the client.
       The TURN server is responsible for guaranteeing that packets sent to the public
       IP address route to the TURN server. TURN also allows a client to request an
       odd or even port when one is allocated, and for it to pre-allocate the next higher
       port as is useful, e.g. for the H.323 or RTP protocol.

       Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE)

       Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) is an IETF draft, that has also been
       submitted by J.Rosenberg (dynamicsoft), R. Mahy (Cisco), C. Huitema
       (Microsoft). ICE describes a methodology for NAT-Traversal for the SIP
       protocol. ICE is not a new protocol, but makes use of existing protocols, such as
       STUN, TURN and Real Specific IP (RSIP). ICE works through the mutual
       cooperation of both endpoints in a SIP dialog. ICE does not require extensions
       from STUN, TURN or RSIP. However, it does require some additional SDP
       attributes.

       Universal Plug and Play (UPnP)

       Another solution originally designed for the home market is Universal Plug and
       Play. In this scenario, the NAT is upgraded to support the UPnP protocol, and the
       client can query the NAT directly as to its external IP Address and Port number.
       However, UPnP does not scale to cascaded NATs, and there are potentially
       serious security issues with this solution, including vulnerability to denial of
       service attacks. For more information, refer to www.upnp.org


 7.6   Virtual Private Networks and Firewalls

       The next chapter deals with the integration of VPN tunneling, and specifically
       IPsec tunneling into the VOIP system. VPNs alleviate many of the problem
       issues set forth in this chapter by tunneling straight through firewalls. Hence,
       many of the firewall specific issues mentioned here become moot. However, this
       “inelegant” method has some drawbacks. First, tunneling all VOIP traffic over
       VPNs prohibits firewalls from investigating incoming and outgoing packets for
       malicious traffic. Also, the centralization of security at the firewall is virtually
       lost. Also, VPN tunneling with IPsec can be incompatible with NAT. Finally, a
       host of new QoS and security issues are introduced by the integration of IPsec
       into VOIP. The next chapter covers these issues in greater detail.
