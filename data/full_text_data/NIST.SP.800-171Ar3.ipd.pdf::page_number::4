     NIST SP 800-171Ar3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                    Assessing CUI Security Requirements
     November 2023

 1   Abstract
 2   The protection of Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) resident in nonfederal systems and
 3   organizations is of paramount importance to federal agencies and can directly impact the ability
 4   of the Federal Government to successfully conduct its essential missions and functions. This
 5   publication provides federal and nonfederal organizations with assessment procedures and a
 6   methodology that can be employed to conduct assessments of the security requirements in NIST
 7   Special Publication 800-171, Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information in Nonfederal
 8   Systems and Organizations. The assessment procedures are flexible and can be customized to the
 9   needs of organizations and assessors. Security assessments can be conducted as independent,
10   third-party assessments or as government-sponsored assessments. The assessments can also be
11   applied with various degrees of rigor based on customer-defined depth and coverage attributes.
12   The findings and evidence produced during the assessments can facilitate risk-based decisions by
13   organizations related to the security requirements.

20   The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and
21   Technology (NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical
22   leadership for the Nation’s measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops tests, test
23   methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance
24   the development and productive use of information technology. ITL’s responsibilities include the
25   development of management, administrative, technical, and physical standards and guidelines for
26   the cost-effective security and privacy of other than national security-related information in
27   federal information systems. The Special Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research,
28   guidelines, and outreach efforts in information system security, and its collaborative activities
29   with industry, government, and academic organizations.
