Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for advising and consulting information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of advising and consulting information
would have, at most, a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.
Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external communications
(e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect operations and/or public confidence in the
agency, but the damage to the mission would usually be limited.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
advising and consulting information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to advising and consulting information.
The effects of disruption of access to most advising and consulting information or information
systems would have limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
advising and consulting information is low.

D.20.4 Knowledge Dissemination Information Type

Knowledge Dissemination addresses those instances where the primary method used in
delivering a service is through the publishing or broadcasting of information, such as the Voice
of America or web-based museums maintained by the Smithsonian. Knowledge Dissemination is
not intended to address circumstances where the publication of information is a by-product of a
mission rather than the mission itself. The recommended provisional security categorization of
the knowledge dissemination information type follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of knowledge
dissemination information on the ability of responsible agencies to publish or broadcast
information. Premature and unauthorized disclosure of information being considered for
broadcast can be harmful if the information is subsequently determined to be false or
counterproductive to the knowledge dissemination mission. However, the consequences of
unauthorized disclosure of most knowledge dissemination information would have, at most, a
limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.
