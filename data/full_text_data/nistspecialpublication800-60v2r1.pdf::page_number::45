Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of the unauthorized disclosure of strategic planning
information on the ability of responsible agencies to determine long-term goals and to identify
the best approach for achieving those goals. Premature public release of draft plans before
internal coordination and review can result in unnecessary damage to public confidence in the
agency. This is particularly likely where the release includes unedited internal commentary and
discussion. However, the consequence of loss of confidentiality of most strategic planning
information is likely to do only limited harm to government assets, personnel, or missions.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized disclosure of some of
the background information that supports development of some Federal strategic plans can reveal
sensitive vulnerabilities, capabilities, or methods of anti-terrorism, law enforcement, or national
security activities. Depending on the information in question, the confidentiality impact can be
moderate, high, or involve national security information (outside the scope of this guideline).
Also, some strategic plans are themselves national security information.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for strategic planning information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Unauthorized modification or destruction
of information affecting external communications that contain strategic planning information
(e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect operations or public confidence in the
agency, but the damage to the mission would usually be limited. Public confidence consequences
will be more serious for agencies that have national defense, intelligence, or information security
missions. In such cases, the impact may be at least moderate.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
strategic planning information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the strategic planning information.
Strategic planning processes are usually tolerant of delays.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
strategic planning information is low.
C.2.3.5 Budget Execution Information Type

Budget Execution involves day-to-day requisitions and obligations for agency expenditures,
invoices, billing dispute resolution, reconciliation, service level agreements, and distributions of
shared expenses. The recommended provisional security categorization for budget execution
information is as follows:


                                                 20
