4.9.3 Equivalence of Domain Security Policies
Two security domains have equivalent security policies if the authority responsible for
each security domain agrees to accept the other domain’s policy as being equivalent to its
own policy in terms of the security protections provided. The domain security policies
have to be carefully examined before acceptance by the authorities responsible for each
domain 3. This process may be impossible if the authorities are not able to agree on the
equivalence of protections. The authorities responsible for a security domain may restrict
the security level of key and/or metadata, and therefore data, that they are willing to share
with other domains in order to mitigate the consequences of any potential compromises.
If entity A and entity B attempt to share a key and/or metadata, and security domain B
has weaker policies than security domain A, then a sophisticated CKMS should, at a
minimum, inform entity A of the possible security consequences.

If it is determined that the policies of the two domains are equivalent, an entity in one
domain may share data with any entity in another equivalent domain, when appropriate.

FR:4.19 The CKMS design shall specify if and how it supports the review and
verification of another domain’s security before intra-domain communications are
permitted.

FR: 4.20 The CKMS design shall specify how it detects, prevents or warns an entity of
the possible security consequences of communicating with an entity in a security domain
with weaker policies.

4.9.4 Third-Party Sharing
Suppose that entity A in security domain A and entity B in security domain B have
equivalent domain security policies. In that case, it would be reasonable for entity A and
entity B to share keys and/or metadata with any of the other members in either domain A
or domain B, because each security domain has accepted the other domain’s security
policy. However, suppose that entity B also shares keys and metadata with a third entity,
entity C in domain C. In this case, entity A and entity B have assurance that their
respective domain security policies are equivalent and entity B and entity C have
assurance that their respective domain security policies are equivalent. If entity B treats
keys and/or metadata received from entity A in the same manner as its own keys and/or
metadata, then entity A should expect that keys and/or metadata shared with entity B may
also be shared with other equivalent security domains. When two entities examine each
other’s domain security policies for equivalence, they should pay close attention to each
other’s policies for sharing keys, metadata and other information with entities in other
security domains.

 The process of determining the equivalence of security policies is similar to the Certificate
Authority cross-certification process for Public Key Infrastructures.
