companion roadmap to the Privacy Framework, highlighting priority areas that pose challenges
to organizations in achieving their privacy objectives. This document supports continued
collaboration between NIST and stakeholders from government, academia, and industry.
Workforce Advancement
As recognized in the Privacy Framework companion roadmap, stakeholders have signaled
that demand for a robust and effective privacy workforce is outpacing supply. To support the
development of a workforce capable of managing privacy risk and provide a common language
around roles, tasks, knowledge, and skills, NIST initiated the development of a privacy workforce
taxonomy aligned with the Privacy Framework and the NICE Workforce Framework. NIST
launched this effort by collecting stakeholder feedback during the International Association
of Privacy Professionals (IAPP) virtual event, “Help Wanted: Growing a Workforce Capable of
Managing Privacy Risk.” The working sessions were attended by participants representing a
broad spectrum of the public and private sectors, including consulting, consumer technology,
energy, financial, non-profit, transportation, law, manufacturing, academia, and standards
organizations. NIST will use the stakeholder feedback received at the workshop to inform the
development of sets of tasks, knowledge, and skill statements for a privacy workforce taxonomy.
Privacy Leadership
Through leadership positions in key privacy and security organizations, NIST helps drive
change and standardization of privacy considerations. NIST personnel co-chaired the
Interagency Working Group (IWG) for Privacy with the U.S. Networking and Information
Technology Research and Development (NITRD) Program, and served as the first privacy co-
chair of the Federal Computer Security Managers’ Forum (FCSM). Through these and many
other roles, NIST drives application standards for important risk management focus areas.
Differential Privacy
De-identification techniques can be useful to organizations in mitigating privacy risks. While
guidance, standards, practices, and tools are beginning to be developed in this area, more
work is needed to increase their market-readiness and assist organizations with
implementation. In FY 2020, NIST launched a series of blogs on differential privacy, covering the
basics, applicable use cases, and open-source tools available for implementation to leverage
the differential privacy contributions indexed in the Privacy Engineering Collaboration Space.
The series is designed to help business process owners and privacy program personnel
understand basic concepts about differential privacy and applicable use cases and to help
privacy engineers and IT professionals implement the tools. NIST’s longer-term goal is to
develop a guideline for deploying differential privacy, informed by feedback and engagement
generated by the series of blogs.
Leadership and Participation in Developing National and International Standards
During FY 2020, NIST actively engaged with international standards development
organizations to advance the development of risk-based standards to help organizations
protect individuals’ privacy. NIST participated in the International Organization for
Standardization (ISO) Project Committee 317, which focuses on developing ISO 31700,
Consumer protection: privacy by design for consumer goods and services; ISO/IEC 27557,
Organizational privacy risk management; and Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
(IEEE) P7002, Data Privacy Process. In FY 2021, NIST will continue supporting these efforts
with a longer-term goal of developing more technical privacy standards in the future.
