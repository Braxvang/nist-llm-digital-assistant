            b. The (claimed) signatory shall provide a new private-key-possession
               assurance message to the verifier (see Section 6.3.1), along with a
               corresponding assurance signature, and any other necessary data.
            e. The verifier shall determine a trusted value for t1 (see Sections 6.2 and
               6.3.1.2).
            f. The verifier shall verify the assurance signature using the public key of
               the key pair owned by the (claimed) signatory.
            g. If verification is successful:
               •   The verifier shall determine a trusted value for t2 (see Sections 6.2 and
                   6.3.1.2).
               •   Provided that t1 ≤ t2 ≤ t1+d, the verifier shall assign the
                   assurance_time and the initial assurance level (see Sections 6.3.1.2
                   and 6.3.1.3).
               •   The verifier shall record the assurance_time and the initial assurance
                   level.
   2. Assurance obtained via interaction with a TTP (trusted by the verifier):
            a. Determine the appropriate value of d. For example, d may be selected in
               accordance with the assurance of possession model described in Section
               6.2, along with appropriate values of a, b and c.
            b. The verifier shall request assurance of the (claimed) signatory’s
               possession of its private signature key from a TTP.
      If the TTP has obtained this assurance:
            c. The TTP shall provide the method of obtaining the assurance, the
               recorded assurance_time, and an initial level of assurance of private key
               possession.
            d. If requested by the verifier – the TTP should provide an upper bound on
               the value of t2 – t1, a description of the method(s) used to obtain the times
               t1 and t2 (see Sections 6.3.1.2 and 6.3.2.1), and/or the TTP’s assessment of
               its level of assurance that the (claimed) signatory is/was in possession of
               the private key at the time of this request.
            e. The verifier shall:
               •   (If provided by the TTP) reject the TTP-provided assurance if
                   the upper bound on t2 – t1 > d; otherwise,
               •   Record the assurance_time and the initial assurance level provided by
                   the TTP, and/or
               •   (If provided by the TTP) record the TTP’s assessment of its level of
                   assurance that the (claimed) signatory is/was in possession of the
                   private key at the time of this request, and/or
