SP 800-152                                                      A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


When two entities are in different security domains, they may not be able to provide
equivalent protection to the exchanged keys and metadata because they are operating in
different FCKMSs under different FCKMS Security Policies. However, there are
circumstances in which an entity in one domain can send keys and metadata to another entity
in a different domain, even though their policies are not identical.

Before information is shared between entities in two or more Security Domains, their
FCKMS Security Policies must be carefully examined before exchanging or combining their
information. The domain authorities for the domains intending to share information should
verify that the different FCKMS Security Policies provide acceptable protection for each
otherâ€™s data. Computers could verify the equivalence or compatibility of two or more
FCKMS Security Policies if they are encoded to enable such verification.

A security domain could be defined for a single information impact-level (e.g., Low) or
could be defined for multiple impact-levels (e.g., Low and Moderate). The computer systems
that are processing multiple levels of sensitive information must be designed, programmed,
and operated to separate and protect the processing of information at the different impact-
levels.

4.11.1 Conditions for Data Exchange
Both the entity intending to send sensitive data to another entity in a different domain, and
the intended receiving entity, should satisfy the following conditions:
    a) Have an acceptable means of sending and receiving the information (i.e., the
       communications channel with agreed-upon protocols),
    b) Have interoperable cryptographic capabilities (e.g., identical encryption/decryption
       algorithms that utilize identical key lengths),
    c) Have acceptable FCKMS Security Policies for exchanging information, and
    d) Trust each other to enforce their FCKMS Security Policies.
If two entities belong to the same security domain, it is likely that these conditions can be met.
If the entities do not belong to the same security domain, then these conditions are less likely
to be satisfied. See Section 4.9.2 of the Framework for additional information.

FR:4.15 The CKMS design shall specify design features that allow for the exchange of keys
and metadata with entities in other security domains that are considered to offer equivalent
but different security protections.

4.11.2 Assurance of Protection
Protection assurances within security domains include protecting a key and/or metadata from
unauthorized disclosure and unauthorized modification, as well as verifying the source and
destination of a key and/or metadata.
