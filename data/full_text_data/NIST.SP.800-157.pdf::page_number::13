Special Publication 800-157                                                           Guidelines for Derived PIV Credentials


presenting a temporary secret that was issued in a previous transaction, as described in Section 5.3.1 of
[SP800-63].

An LOA-4 Derived PIV Credential shall be issued in person, in accordance with [SP800-63], and the
Applicant shall identify himself/herself using a biometric sample that can be verified against the
Applicant’s PIV Card. If there are two or more transactions during the issuance process, the Applicant
shall identify himself/herself using a biometric sample that can either be verified against the PIV Card or
against a biometric that was recorded in a previous transaction. The issuer shall retain for future reference
the biometric sample used to validate the Applicant.4

It may be noted that this guideline doesn’t preclude the issuance of multiple Derived PIV Credentials to
the same Applicant on the basis of the same PIV Card. Issuing several Derived PIV Credentials to an
individual, however, could increase the risk that one of the tokens will be lost/stolen without the loss
being reported, or that the Subscriber will inappropriately provide one of the tokens to someone else.

2.3       Maintenance

Derived PIV Credentials may require typical maintenance activities applicable to asymmetric
cryptographic credentials – these maintenance activities include rekey, modification, and revocation.
These activities may be performed either remotely or in-person and shall be performed in accordance with
the certificate policy under which the Derived PIV Authentication certificate is issued. When certificate
re-key or modification is performed remotely for an LOA-4 Derived PIV Credential, the following shall
apply:

     Communication between the issuer and the cryptographic module in which the Derived PIV
      Authentication private key is stored shall occur only over mutually authenticated secure sessions
      between tested and validated cryptographic modules.5

     Data transmitted between the issuer and the cryptographic module in which the Derived PIV
      Authentication private key is stored shall be encrypted and contain data integrity checks.
The initial issuance process (Section 2.2, above) shall be followed for:

           1) re-key of an expired or compromised Derived PIV credential or

           2) re-key of a Derived PIV Credential at LOA-4 to a new hardware token.

The Derived PIV Authentication certificate shall be revoked or the token containing the corresponding
private key shall be either zeroized or destroyed when the binding between the Subscriber and the token
containing the private key corresponding to the certificate is no longer considered valid or when the
Subscriber no longer requires a Derived PIV Credential. Examples of circumstances that require one of
these actions are–

          The token containing the private key corresponding to the Derived PIV Credential is lost, stolen,
           damaged or compromised.6



4 The retained biometric shall be protected in a manner that protects the individual’s privacy.
5 In order to meet this requirement the issuer must be able to uniquely identify each hardware cryptographic module onto which

 Derived PIV Credentials are stored.
6 Recovering from a mobile device computer security incident [SP800-61] may also require revoking the Derived PIV

 Authentication certificate.
