NIST SP 800-166                                                    DERIVED PIV APPLICATION AND
                                                                   DATA MODEL TEST GUIDELINES

 Precondition(s)      •   A token with the Derived PIV Application is inserted into an
                          appropriate token reader.
                      •   Suitable drivers have been loaded between the test system and an
                          instance of the reader.
                      •   The Derived PIV Application Password’s retry counter is not 0.
 Test Scenario        1. Send the SELECT command with
                            • AID == 'A0 00 00 03 08 00 00 20 00 01 00'
                      2. Send the VERIFY command with
                            • P2, key reference value, is set to '80'
                            • Data field of the command will contain the
                               correct Derived PIV Application Password, padded
                               with 'FF' (if necessary) to complete the total
                               length of the value to 8 bytes
                      3. Repeat Step 1 with
                         • AID == 'A0 00 00 03 08 00 00 00 00' (invalid AID)
                      4. Send the GENERAL AUTHENTICATE command
                            • CLA is set to:
                                1. '00' if command chaining is not needed or
                                   '10' if command chaining is used. (The last
                                   chain of the command sets CLA to '00')
                            • P1, algorithm reference, is set to '07' or '11'.
                               P2, key reference, is set to '9A' indicating the
                               Derived PIV Authentication Key
                            • Data field in the command is to include '81'
                               specifying a challenge, followed by a randomly
                               generated challenge, and '82 00' in order to
                               request a response
 Expected Result(s)   1. From Step 1, the command returns the application property template
                         with the status word '90 00'.
                      2. From Step 2, the command returns status word '90 00'.
                      3. From Step 3, the command returns '6A 82' (application not found).
                      4. From Step 4, the command returns the signed challenge with the
                         status word '90 00'.
 Postcondition(s)     The Derived PIV Application continues to be the currently selected
                      application and the application security status of the Derived PIV
                      Application Password is TRUE.

8.3.1.5 Select with Another Valid AID when Derived PIV Application is Currently
        Selected

 Test Assertion       TA-08.03.01.05
 Purpose              Confirms that the Derived PIV Application is deselected when the
                      currently selected application is the Derived PIV Application and the
                      SELECT command is sent with another valid AID that is supported.
