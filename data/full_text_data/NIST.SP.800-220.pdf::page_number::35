Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF)
The Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF) is a set of fundamental secure software
development practices based on established practice documents from organizations such as BSA,
OWASP, and SAFECode. Few software development life cycle (SDLC) models explicitly address
software security in detail, so practices like those in the SSDF need to be added to and integrated
with each SDLC implementation.
Following the SSDF practices should help software producers reduce the number of vulnerabilities
in released software, mitigate the potential impacts of the exploitation of undetected or unaddressed
vulnerabilities, and address the root causes of vulnerabilities to prevent future recurrences.
Because the SSDF provides a common vocabulary for secure software development, software
consumers can also use it to foster communications with suppliers in acquisition processes and
other management activities.
In September 2021, NIST released Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF) Version
1.1: Recommendations for Mitigating the Risk of Software Vulnerabilities (draft SP 800-218). SP
800-218 will replace the NIST Cybersecurity White Paper released in April 2020, which defined the
original SSDF. Changes from version 1.0 to 1.1 include adding several references, creating new
practices and tasks related to secure software development environments, and mapping SSDF
practices to corresponding clauses from EO 14028.
NIST will continue to refresh and evolve the SSDF in response to public feedback and the changing
threats, vulnerabilities, practices, and automation capabilities in software development. Future work
may potentially cover topics such as how the SSDF may apply to and vary for particular software
development methodologies and associated practices like DevOps and how an organization can
transition from using just their current software development practices to also incorporating the
practices specified by the SSDF.
Improving Cybersecurity in Supply Chains
In August 2021, NIST launched the National Initiative for Improving Cybersecurity in Supply Chains
to help organizations build, evaluate, and assess the cybersecurity of products and services in
their supply chains, an area of increasing concern. The effort will emphasize tools, technologies,
and guidance focused on the developers and providers of technology. At the same time, there is a
need among those acquiring products and services for cohesive, practical, performance-oriented
guidance to address the broader cybersecurity risks to the security and resilience of all supply
chains. NIST expects to issue a Request for Information in FY 2022 to help guide this public-
private partnership.
Hardware-Enabled Security
The foundation of any data center or edge computing security strategy should be securing the
platform on which data and workloads will be executed and accessed. The physical platform
represents the first layer for any layered security approach and provides the initial protections to
help ensure that higher-layer security controls can be trusted. In FY 2021, the NCCoE continued
to develop and demonstrate approaches based on hardware-enabled security techniques and
technologies for safeguarding data and workloads. Hardware-Enabled Security: Container
Platform Security Prototype (NISTIR 8320A) was finalized in June 2021, and a second public
comment draft of Hardware-Enabled Security: Enabling a Layered Approach to Platform Security
for Cloud and Edge Computing Use Cases (NISTIR 8320) was released in May 2021. Additional
publications in the NISTIR 8320 series are also under development.
