7.      Implementing a Secure Network Infrastructure

The network infrastructure that supports the mail server plays a critical role in the security of the mail
server. In most configurations, the network infrastructure is the first line of defense between the Internet
and a mail server. Network design alone, however, cannot protect a mail server. The frequency,
sophistication, and variety of attacks perpetrated today lend support to the idea that email security must be
implemented through layered and diverse protection mechanisms. This section discusses those network
components that can support and protect mail servers to further enhance their overall security. While
security issues are paramount, network infrastructure considerations are influenced by many factors other
than security, including cost, performance, and reliability.

7.1     Network Composition and Structure

Firewalls and routers are devices or systems that control the flow of network traffic between networks.
They can protect mail servers from vulnerabilities inherent in the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet
Protocol (TCP/IP) suite and help reduce the security issues associated with insecure applications and
operating systems. However, an organization has many choices when determining a network
environment for the mail server, and security may not be the principal factor in deciding among those
options. Network composition and structure are the first and in many respects the most critical decisions
that affect mail server security, since they determine what network infrastructure elements protect the
mail server. For example, if the mail server is located before the organization’s main firewall, then the
firewall cannot be used to control traffic to and from the mail server. Network composition and structure
also determine what other portions of the network are vulnerable if the mail server is compromised. For
example, an externally accessible mail server located on the internal production network subjects the
internal network to attack if the mail server is compromised.

7.1.1    Inadvisable Network Layout

Some organizations choose to locate their public mail servers on their internal production networks. That
is, their mail servers reside on the same network as the internal users and servers. The principal weakness
of this layout is that it exposes internal network components to additional risks. Mail servers are often
targets of attackers. If attackers manage to compromise a mail server, they will have access to the internal
network and be able to more easily compromise internal hosts. Therefore, this layout is not
recommended.

Another network layout that is not generally recommended is placing the mail server before an
organization’s firewall or router that provides IP filtering. In this structure, the network provides little, if
any, protection for the mail server. Because the mail server itself has to maintain security, it provides a
single point of failure. To be even somewhat secure in this location, the mail server operating system and
application have to be well-hardened, with all unnecessary and insecure services disabled and all
necessary security patches applied. To maintain the “security” of the setup, the mail server administrator
must stay up-to-date on vulnerabilities and related patches. Another limitation of this structure is that
providing any sort of secure remote administration capability is difficult.

7.1.2    Demilitarized Zone

A demilitarized zone (DMZ) describes a host or network segment inserted as a “neutral zone” between an
organization’s private network and the Internet. It prevents outside users of the mail server from gaining
direct access to an organization’s internal network (intranet). A DMZ mitigates the risks of locating a
mail server on an internal network or exposing it directly to the Internet. It is a compromise solution that
offers the most benefits with the least amount of risk for most organizations. The DMZ allows access to
