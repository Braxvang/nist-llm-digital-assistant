NIST SP 800-207A                                          ZTA Model for Access Control in Cloud-Native
September 2023                                              Applications in Multi-Location Environments


The reference application platform consists of microservices-based applications using a service
mesh with sidecar proxies as the application services infrastructure. The service mesh technology
variation that uses a sidecar-less approach is not considered as the deployment of this technology
is still in early stages.

       Target Audience
This guidance is intended for security architects and infrastructure designers in organizations
with a hybrid IT environment (consisting of both on-premises and multiple cloud-based
applications) with a combination of legacy and microservices-based (i.e., cloud-native)
applications and a built-in application services infrastructure, such as a service mesh.

       Organization of This Document
The organization of this document is as follows:
   •   Section 2 describes a modern enterprise cloud-native application platform that includes a
       dedicated infrastructure for providing all application services as well as a management
       plane when the application spans both on-premises and multiple cloud service provider
       locations.
   •   Section 3 introduces the basic concepts of a policy framework for ZTA for the platform
       described in Section 2 in terms of drivers and design requirements. It also provides an
       analysis of identity-based policies and introduces the concept of multi-tier policies.
   •   Section 4 describes the implementation approach for deploying multi-tier policies for two
       enterprise application infrastructure scenarios by outlining the roles of the service mesh,
       the functional components involved, and the advantages of identity-tier policies, which
       provide service-level segmentation and play a critical role in the security assurance of an
       application ecosystem to conform to zero trust principles or tenets.
   •   Section 5 provides a summary and conclusion.
