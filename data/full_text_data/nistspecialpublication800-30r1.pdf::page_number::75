 Spill sensitive            Authorized user erroneously contaminates a device, information system, or network by placing on it or sending to it
 information                information of a classification/sensitivity which it has not been authorized to handle. The information is exposed to
                            access by unauthorized individuals, and as a result, the device, system, or network is unavailable while the spill is
                            investigated and mitigated.
 Mishandling of critical    Authorized privileged user inadvertently exposes critical/sensitive information.
