Hash function            An algorithm that computes a numerical value (called the hash
                         value) on a data file or electronic message that is used to
                         represent that file or message, and depends on the entire
                         contents of the file or message. A hash function can be
                         considered to be a fingerprint of the file or message.
Impact-level             Refers to the three broadly defined impact-levels in [FIPS
                         200] that categorize the impact of a security breach as Low,
                         Moderate or High.
Incremental testing      Testing a system or device to determine that minor changes
                         have not affected its security and intended functionality.
Information              The high-level policy of an organization that specifies what
Management Policy        information is to be collected or created, and how it is to be
                         managed.
Information Security     A high-level policy of an organization that is created to
Policy                   support and enforce portions of the organization’s Information
                         Management Policy by specifying in more detail what
                         information is to be protected from anticipated threats and
                         how that protection is to be attained.
Identity-based           A process that provides assurance of an entity’s identity by
authentication           means of an authentication mechanism that verifies the
                         identity of the entity. Contrast with role-based authentication
Integrity                A property whereby data has not been altered in an
                         unauthorized manner since it was created, transmitted, or
                         stored.
Integrity protection     A physical or cryptographic means of providing assurance
                         that information has not been altered in an unauthorized
                         manner since it was created, transmitted, or stored.
Integrity verification   Obtaining assurance that information has not been altered in
                         an unauthorized manner since it was created, transmitted or
                         stored.
Key agreement            A key-establishment procedure where the resultant keying
                         material is a function of information contributed by two or
                         more participants, so that an entity cannot predetermine the
                         resulting value of the keying material independently of any
                         other entity’s contribution.
Key confirmation         A procedure to provide assurance to one entity (the key-
                         confirmation recipient) that another entity (the key-
                         confirmation provider) actually possesses the correct secret
                         keying material and/or shared secret.
