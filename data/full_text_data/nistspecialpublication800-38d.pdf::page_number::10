binary Galois (i.e., finite) field. GCM can also provide authentication assurance for additional
data (of practically unlimited length per invocation) that is not encrypted.

If the GCM input is restricted to data that is not to be encrypted, the resulting specialization of
GCM, called GMAC, is simply an authentication mode on the input data. In the rest of this
document, statements about GCM also apply to GMAC.

GCM provides stronger authentication assurance than a (non-cryptographic) checksum or error
detecting code; in particular, GCM can detect both 1) accidental modifications of the data and 2)
intentional, unauthorized modifications.

The two functions of GCM are called authenticated encryption and authenticated decryption.
Each of these functions is relatively efficient and parallelizable; consequently, high-throughput
implementations are possible in both hardware and software. GCM has several other useful
characteristics, including the following:

      •   The GCM functions are “online” in the sense that the lengths of the confidential data
          and the additional, non-confidential data are not required in advance; instead, the
          lengths can be calculated as the data arrives and is processed.

      •   The GCM functions require only the forward direction of the underlying block cipher
          (i.e., the inverse direction is not required).

      •   The authenticity of the protected data can be verified independently from the recovery
          of the confidential data from its encrypted form.

      •   If the unique initialization string is predictable, and the length of the confidential data is
          known, then the block cipher invocations within the GCM encryption mechanism can
          be pre-computed.

      •   If some or all of the additional, non-confidential data is fixed, then the corresponding
          elements of the GCM authentication mechanism can be pre-computed.

An important caution to the use of GCM is that a breach of the requirement in Sec. 8 for the
uniqueness of the initialization strings may compromise the security assurance almost entirely, as
detailed in Ref. [5] and summarized in Appendix A. Therefore, this mode of operation should
not be deployed unless compliance with this uniqueness requirement is ensured. Some of the
practical considerations are discussed further in Secs. 9.1 and 9.2.

The designers of GCM are McGrew and Viega. They submitted GCM to NIST in Ref. [6], and
they discuss in detail its security and performance in Ref. [7].
