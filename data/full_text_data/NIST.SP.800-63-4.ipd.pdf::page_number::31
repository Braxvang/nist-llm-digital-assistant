801   physically present at the point of verification. This includes, but is not limited to, facial
802   features, fingerprints, iris patterns, and voiceprints.

803   4.3.2. Subscriber Accounts
804   As described in the preceding sections, a subscriber account binds one or more
805   authenticators to the subscriber via an identifier as part of the registration process. A
806   subscriber account is created, stored, and maintained by the CSP. The subscriber account
807   records all identity attributes validated during the identity proofing process.

808   4.3.3. Authentication Process
809   The authentication process enables an RP to trust that a claimant is who they say they
810   are. Figure 4 shows a sample authentication process. Other approaches are described in
811   [SP800-63B], Authentication and Lifecycle Management. This sample authentication
812   process shows interactions between the RP, a claimant, and a verifier/CSP. The verifier is
813   a functional role and is frequently implemented in combination with the CSP, as shown in
814   Fig. 4, the RP, or both.




                                Figure 4. Sample Authentication Process

815   A successful authentication process demonstrates that the claimant has possession and
816   control of one or more valid authenticators that are bound to the subscriberâ€™s identity. In
817   general, this is done using an authentication protocol involving an interaction between
818   the verifier and the claimant. The exact nature of the interaction is extremely important
