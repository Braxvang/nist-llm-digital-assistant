4.1       Introduction

The Learning Continuum presented in Chapter 2 shows the relationship among Awareness,
Security Basics and Literacy, Training, and Education. The Continuum demonstrates that
Awareness and Security Basics and Literacy form the baseUne which is required for all
individuals involved with the management, development, maintenance, and/or use of IT systems.
It also demonstrates that Training            and Education are to be provided selectively, based on
individual responsibilities and needs. Specifically, Training is to be provided to individuals
based on their particular job functions. Education is intended for designated IT security
specialists in addition to role-based training. This chapter establishes a model and requirements
for the Roles and Responsibilities Relative to IT Systems layer of the Learning Continuum.


Over time, individuals acquire different roles relative to the use of IT within an organization, or
as they make a career move to a different organization. Sometimes they will be users of
applications; in other instances they may be involved in developing a new system; and in some
situations they may serve on a source selection board to evaluate vendor proposals for IT
systems.      An individual's need for IT security training changes as their roles change. This is
recognized within the Learning Continuum by segmenting the Training level shown above into
six functional specialities which represent categories of generic organizational roles: Manage,
Acquire, Design and Develop, Implement and Operate, Review and Evaluate, and Use.                   A
seventh category, "Other," is a place holder, to allow the matrix to be updated to accommodate
any additional functional roles identified in the future.


This chapter examines the six role categories relative to three fundamental training content
categories:


      •     Laws and Regulations   —      the types of knowledge, skills, and abilities (KS As) relative to
            the laws and regulations pertaining to information and asset protection that govern the
            management and use of IT within the Federal Government. These include government-
            wide requirements such as the Computer Security Act of 1987, policy promulgated by the
            Office of Management and Budget, standards and guidance disseminated by NIST, as
            well as policies and procedures specific to a Department or agency;


      •     Security Program   — KSAs          relative to the establishment, implementation, and monitoring
            of an IT Security Program within an organization; and
