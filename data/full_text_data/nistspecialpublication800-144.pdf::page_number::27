    Under the Federal Records Act and NARA regulations, agencies are responsible for
    managing federal records effectively throughout their lifecycle, including records in
    electronic information systems and in contracted environments. If a contractor holds
    federal records, the contractor must manage them in accordance with all applicable
    records management laws and regulations. Managing the records includes secure
    storage, retrievability, and proper disposition, including transfer of permanently valuable
    records to NARA in an acceptable format [Fer10].

    Other government and industry-association requirements, such as the Health Insurance
    Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the Payment Card Industry Data
    Security Standard (PCI DSS), may apply to a particular organization. For example, the
    Veterans Health Administration falls under HIPAA regulations for private and public
    health care facilities, which apply to both employees and contractors [DVA]. HIPAA
    requires both technical and physical safeguards for controlling access to protected health
    information, which may create compliance issues for some cloud providers.

    Cloud providers are becoming more sensitive to legal and regulatory concerns, and may
    be willing to commit to store and process data in specific jurisdictions and apply required
    safeguards for security and privacy. However, the degree to which they will accept
    liability in their service agreements, for exposure of content under their control, remains
    to be seen. Even so, organizations are ultimately accountable for the security and privacy
    of data held by a cloud provider on their behalf.

   Data Location. One of the most common compliance issues facing an organization is
    data location [Bin09, Kan09, Ove10]. Use of an in-house computing center allows an
    organization to structure its computing environment and to know in detail where data is
    stored and what safeguards are used to protect the data. In contrast, a characteristic of
    many cloud computing services is that data is stored redundantly in multiple physical
    locations and detailed information about the location of an organization’s data is
    unavailable or not disclosed to the service consumer. This situation makes it difficult to
    ascertain whether sufficient safeguards are in place and whether legal and regulatory
    compliance requirements are being met. For example, NARA regulations (i.e., 36 CFR
    1234) include facility requirements for the storage of federal records and stipulate a
    minimum height above and distance away from a flood plain. External audits and
    security certifications can alleviate this issue to some extent, but they are not a panacea
    [Mag10].

    When information crosses borders, the governing legal, privacy, and regulatory regimes
    can be ambiguous and raise a variety of concerns (e.g., [CBC04, Wei11]). Consequently,
    constraints on the transborder flow of sensitive data, as well as the requirements on the
    protection afforded the data, have become the subject of national and regional privacy
    and security laws and regulations [Eis05].

    The main compliance concerns with transborder data flows include whether the laws in
    the jurisdiction where the data was collected permit the flow, whether those laws
    continue to apply to the data post transfer, and whether the laws at the destination present
