NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1                                                               Guidelines for Media Sanitization


Before any media are sanitized, system owners are strongly advised to consult with designated
officials with privacy responsibilities (e.g., Privacy Officers), Freedom of Information Act
(FOIA) officers, and the local records retention office. This consultation is to ensure compliance
with record retention regulations and requirements in the Federal Records Act. In addition,
organizational management should also be consulted to ensure that historical information is
captured and maintained where required by business needs. This should be ongoing, as controls
may have to be adjusted as the system and its environment changes.

 1.2 Audience

Protecting the confidentiality of information should be a concern for everyone, from federal
agencies and businesses to home users. Recognizing that interconnections and information
exchange are critical in the delivery of government services, this guide can be used to assist in
deciding what processes to use for sanitization or disposal.

 1.3 Assumptions

The premise of this guide is that organizations are able to correctly identify the appropriate
information categories, confidentiality impact levels, and location of the information. Ideally,
this activity is accomplished in the earliest phase of the system life cycle. 3 This critical initial
step is outside the scope of this document, but without this identification, the organization will,
in all likelihood, lose control of some media containing sensitive information.

This guide does not claim to cover all possible media that an organization could use to store
information, nor does it attempt to forecast the future media that may be developed during the
effective life of this guide. Users are expected to make sanitization and disposal decisions based
on the security categorization of the information contained on the media.

 1.4 Relationship to Other NIST Documents

The following NIST documents, including FIPS and Special Publications, are directly related to
this document:

        FIPS 199 and NIST SP 800-60 Revision 1, Guide for Mapping Types of Information and
         Information Systems to Security Categories 4, provide guidance for establishing the
         security categorization for a system’s confidentiality. This categorization will impact the
         level of assurance an organization should require in making sanitization decisions.
