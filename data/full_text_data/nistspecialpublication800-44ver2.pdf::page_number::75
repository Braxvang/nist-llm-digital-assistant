7.5     SSL/TLS

The SSL and TLS protocols provide server and client authentication and encryption of communications. 49
SSL was first introduced by Netscape Communications in 1994 and was revised twice (SSL version 3 is
the current version). 50 In 1996, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) established the TLS working
group to formalize and advance the SSL protocol to the level of Internet standard. The TLS protocol
version 1.0 is formally specified in IETF Request for Comments (RFC) 2246, 51 which was published in
1999 and is based in large part on SSL version 3. SSL version 3 and TLS version 1 are essentially
identical and are discussed together in this document. Most major Internet components, such as Web
browsers, support the use of both SSL 3 and TLS 1.0. TLS 1.1, specified in RFC 4436, was released in
April 2006, and future versions of Web browsers will likely support it.

TCP/IP governs the transport and routing of data over the Internet. Other protocols, such as HTTP,
LDAP, and Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP), run “on top of” TCP/IP in that they all use TCP/IP
to support typical application tasks, such as displaying Web pages or delivering e-mail messages. Thus,
SSL/TLS can support more than just secure Web communications. Figure 7-1 shows how SSL/TLS fits
between the application and network/transport layers of the Internet protocol suite.

7.5.1     SSL/TLS Capabilities

SSL/TLS provides the following capabilities to HTTP and other application layer protocols [SSL98]:

 Server Authentication—SSL/TLS allows a Web client (user) to confirm a Web server’s identity.
  SSL/TLS-enabled Web clients (browsers) can employ standard techniques of public key cryptography
  to check that a server’s name and public key are contained in a valid certificate issued by a CA listed
  in the client’s list of trusted CAs. This confirmation might be important if the user, for example, is
  sending a credit card number over the network and wants to confirm the receiving server’s identity.

 Client Authentication—SSL/TLS allows a Web server to confirm a user’s identity using the same
  techniques as those used for server authentication by reversing the roles. SSL/TLS-enabled Web

      Proper understanding of SSL and the information presented in this section requires at least a basic understanding of
      cryptographic algorithms, message digest functions, digital signatures, symmetric encryption algorithms, and asymmetric
      encryption algorithms. For an introduction to cryptography, see NIST SP 800-32, Introduction to Public Key Technology
      and the Federal PKI Infrastructure. For more information on transport layer security, see NIST SP 800-52, Guidelines for
      the Selection and Use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) Implementations. Both of these documents can be found at

      SSL versions before 3.0 are insecure and should not be used.
