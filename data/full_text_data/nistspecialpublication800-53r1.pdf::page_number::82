CA-7      CONTINUOUS MONITORING

          Control: The organization monitors the security controls in the information system on an ongoing
          basis.
          Supplemental Guidance: Continuous monitoring activities include configuration management and
          control of information system components, security impact analyses of changes to the system,
          ongoing assessment of security controls, and status reporting. The organization assesses all
          security controls in an information system during the initial security accreditation. Subsequent to
          the initial accreditation and in accordance with OMB policy, the organization assesses a subset of
          the controls annually during continuous monitoring. The selection of an appropriate subset of
          security controls is based on: (i) the FIPS 199 security categorization of the information system;
          (ii) the specific security controls selected and employed by the organization to protect the
          information system; and (iii) the level of assurance (or grounds for confidence) that the
          organization must have in determining the effectiveness of the security controls in the information
          system. The organization establishes the selection criteria and subsequently selects a subset of the
          security controls employed within the information system for assessment. The organization also
          establishes the schedule for control monitoring to ensure adequate coverage is achieved. Those
          security controls that are volatile or critical to protecting the information system are assessed at
          least annually. All other controls are assessed at least once during the information system’s three-
          year accreditation cycle. The organization can use the current year’s assessment results obtained
          during continuous monitoring to meet the annual FISMA assessment requirement (see CA-2).
          This control is closely related to and mutually supportive of the activities required in monitoring
          configuration changes to the information system. An effective continuous monitoring program
          results in ongoing updates to the information system security plan, the security assessment report,
          and the plan of action and milestones—the three principle documents in the security accreditation
          package. A rigorous and well executed continuous monitoring process significantly reduces the
          level of effort required for the reaccreditation of the information system. NIST Special
          Publication 800-37 provides guidance on the continuous monitoring process. NIST Special
          Publication 800-53A provides guidance on the assessment of security controls. Related security
          controls: CA-2, CA-4, CA-5, CA-6, CM-4.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization employs an independent certification agent or certification team to monitor the
                security controls in the information system on an ongoing basis.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: The organization can extend and maximize the value of
                the ongoing assessment of security controls during the continuous monitoring process by
                requiring an independent certification agent or team to assess all of the security controls
                during the information system’s three-year accreditation cycle. Related security controls:
                CA-2, CA-4, CA-5, CA-6, CM-4.
