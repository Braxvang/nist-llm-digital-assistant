        3.11 Serial Test
        The (generalized) serial test represents a battery of procedures based on testing the uniformity of
        distributions of patterns of given lengths.

        Specifically, for i1, …, im running through the set of all 2m possible 0,1 vectors of length m, let
        ν i1 …im denote the frequency of the pattern (i1, …, im) in the “circularized” string of bits (ε1, …, εn, ε1, …,
        εm-1).

        Set
€                                         2m                      2
                                                                n  2m
                                        2
                                      ψ =
                                        m      ∑    ν i1 …im − m  =
                                           n i1 …im           2 
                                                                          ∑
                                                                      n i1 …im
                                                                              ν i21 …im − n ,


        Thus, ψ m2 is a Χ 2 -type statistic, but it is a common mistake to assume that ψ m2 has the Χ 2 -distribution.
        Indeed, the frequencies ν i1 …im are not independent.

                       €                                ∇ψ m2 = ψ m2 − ψ m2 −1

        and
                                                   ∇ 2ψ m2 = ψ m2 − 2ψ m−1
                                                                       2       2
                                                                           + ψ m−2 .

        (Here ψ 02 = ψ−1 2
                           = 0 .) Then ∇ψ m2 has a Χ 2 -distribution with 2m-1 degrees of freedom, and ∇ 2ψ m2 has a
         Χ 2 -distribution with 2m-2 degrees of freedom. Thus, for small values of m, m ≤ log 2 ( n ) − 2 , one can
                                       €
        find the corresponding 2m P-values from the standard formulas.

€                                               P − value1 = igamc (2 m−2 ,∇Ψm2 /2)
                                                                            €
                                             P − value2 = igamc (2 m−3 ,∇ 2 Ψm2 /2)
                                 €
        The result for ∇ψ 22 and the usual counting of frequencies is incorrectly given in [1, p. 181, formula
        (5.2)]: +1 should be replaced by -1.
                            €
        The convergence of ∇ψ m2 to the Χ 2 -distribution was proven by Good (1953).
