                                                                   COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE



Organizations should emphasize the importance of incident detection and analysis throughout the
organization.

In an organization, millions of possible signs of incidents may occur each day, recorded mainly by
logging and computer security software. Automation is needed to perform an initial analysis of the data
and select events of interest for human review. Event correlation software can be of great value in
automating the analysis process. However, the effectiveness of the process depends on the quality of the
data that goes into it. Organizations should establish logging standards and procedures to ensure that
adequate information is collected by logs and security software and that the data is reviewed regularly.

Organizations should create written guidelines for prioritizing incidents.

Prioritizing the handling of individual incidents is a critical decision point in the incident response
process. Effective information sharing can help an organization identify situations that are of greater
severity and demand immediate attention. Incidents should be prioritized based on the relevant factors,
such as the functional impact of the incident (e.g., current and likely future negative impact to business
functions), the information impact of the incident (e.g., effect on the confidentiality, integrity, and
availability of the organizationâ€™s information), and the recoverability from the incident (e.g., the time and
types of resources that must be spent on recovering from the incident).

Organizations should use the lessons learned process to gain value from incidents.

After a major incident has been handled, the organization should hold a lessons learned meeting to review
the effectiveness of the incident handling process and identify necessary improvements to existing
security controls and practices. Lessons learned meetings can also be held periodically for lesser incidents
as time and resources permit. The information accumulated from all lessons learned meetings should be
used to identify and correct systemic weaknesses and deficiencies in policies and procedures. Follow-up
reports generated for each resolved incident can be important not only for evidentiary purposes but also
for reference in handling future incidents and in training new team members.
