3         On Card Cryptographic Requirements

FIPS 201-2 identifies a suite of objects that are stored on the PIV Card for use in authentication
mechanisms or in other security protocols. These objects may be divided into three classes:
cryptographic keys, signed authentication information stored on the PIV Card, and message
digests of information stored on the PIV Card. Cryptographic requirements for PIV keys are
detailed in Section 3.1. Cryptographic requirements for other stored objects are detailed
in Section 3.2.

3.1       PIV Cryptographic Keys

FIPS 201-2 and SP 800-73-4 specify six different classes of cryptographic keys to be used as
credentials by the PIV cardholder:

      +    the mandatory PIV Authentication key;
      +    the mandatory asymmetric Card Authentication key;
      +    an optional symmetric Card Authentication key;
      +    a conditionally mandatory digital signature key;
      +    a conditionally mandatory key management key; 1 and
      +    an optional asymmetric key to establish session keys for secure messaging.
Table 3-1 establishes specific requirements for cryptographic algorithms and key sizes for each
key type.

In addition to the key sizes, keys must be generated using secure parameters. Rivest, Shamir,
Adleman (RSA) keys must be generated using a public exponent of 65 537. Elliptic curve keys
must correspond to one of the following recommended curves from [FIPS186]:

      +    Curve P-256; or
      +    Curve P-384.
To promote interoperability, this specification further limits PIV Authentication and Card
Authentication elliptic curve keys to a single curve (P-256). 2 PIV cryptographic keys for digital
signatures and key management may use P-256 or P-384, based on application requirements.
There is no phase out date specified for either curve.

If the PIV Card Application supports the virtual contact interface [SP800-73] and the digital
signature key, the key management key, or any of the retired key management keys are elliptic
curve keys corresponding to Curve P-384, then the PIV Secure Messaging key shall use P-384,
otherwise it may use P-256 or P-384.

  The digital signature and key management keys are mandatory if the cardholder has a government-issued email
account at the time of credential issuance.
2
  To reduce computation times for authentication for physical access, it is recommended that the asymmetric Card
Authentication key be an elliptic curve key rather than an RSA key.
