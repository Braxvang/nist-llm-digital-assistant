                The Technical Specification for the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.2



Executive Summary

The Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) is a suite of specifications that standardize the format
and nomenclature by which software flaw and security configuration information is communicated, both
to machines and humans.1 SCAP is a multi-purpose framework of specifications that support automated
configuration, vulnerability and patch checking, technical control compliance activities, and security
measurement. Goals for the development of SCAP include standardizing system security management,
promoting interoperability of security products, and fostering the use of standard expressions of security
content.
SCAP version 1.2 is comprised of eleven component specifications in five categories:
   Languages. The SCAP languages provide standard vocabularies and conventions for expressing
    security policy, technical check mechanisms, and assessment results. The SCAP language
    specifications are Extensible Configuration Checklist Description Format (XCCDF), Open
    Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL®), and Open Checklist Interactive Language
    (OCIL™).
   Reporting formats. The SCAP reporting formats provide the necessary constructs to express
    collected information in standardized formats. The SCAP reporting format specifications are Asset
    Reporting Format (ARF) and Asset Identification. Although Asset Identification is not explicitly a
    reporting format, SCAP uses it as a key component in identifying the assets that reports relate to.
   Enumerations. Each SCAP enumeration defines a standard nomenclature (naming format) and an
    official dictionary or list of items expressed using that nomenclature. The SCAP enumeration
    specifications are Common Platform Enumeration (CPE™), Common Configuration Enumeration
    (CCE™), and Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE®).
   Measurement and scoring systems. In SCAP this refers to evaluating specific characteristics of a
    security weakness (for example, software vulnerabilities and security configuration issues) and, based
    on those characteristics, generating a score that reflects their relative severity. The SCAP
    measurement and scoring system specifications are Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
    and Common Configuration Scoring System (CCSS).
   Integrity. An SCAP integrity specification helps to preserve the integrity of SCAP content and
    results. Trust Model for Security Automation Data (TMSAD) is the SCAP integrity specification.
SCAP utilizes software flaw and security configuration standard reference data. This reference data is
provided by the National Vulnerability Database (NVD),2 which is managed by NIST and sponsored by
the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).
This publication defines the technical composition of SCAP version 1.2 in terms of its component
specifications, their interrelationships and interoperation, and the requirements for SCAP content. The
technical specification for SCAP in this publication describes the requirements and conventions that are to
be employed to ensure the consistent and accurate exchange of SCAP-conformant content and the ability
to reliably use the content with SCAP-conformant products.
The U.S. Federal Government, in cooperation with academia and private industry, is adopting SCAP and
encourages its use in support of security automation activities and initiatives.3 SCAP has achieved
widespread adoption by major software manufacturers and has become a significant component of large
information security management and governance programs. The protocol is expected to evolve and
1
    Products implementing SCAP can also be used to support non-security use cases such as configuration management and
    software inventory.
