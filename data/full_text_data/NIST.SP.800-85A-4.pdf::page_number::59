NIST SP 800-85A-4                                               PIV CARD APPLICATION & MIDDLEWARE
                                                                         INTERFACE TEST GUIDELINES

AS05.30: If the current value of the PUK’s retry counter is zero then the PIN’s retry counter
shall not be reset and the PIV Card Application shall return the status word '69 83'.

Required Vendor Information

VE05.30.01: This information is requested as part of VE05.17.01.

VE05.30.02: The vendor shall specify in its documentation that the RESET RETRY COUNTER
card command will not reset the PIN’s retry counter and the card will return '69 83' (Reset operation
blocked) when the PUK’s retry counter is zero.

Required Test Procedures

TE05.30.01: The tester shall review the vendor’s documentation and validate that the information
requested in VE05.30.02 and VE05.30.01 are present. (NOTE: Testing this condition will leave the
card unusable for further tests of the RESET RETRY COUNTER command since the reset counter
is zero).

AS05.31: If the card command succeeds, then the PIN’s retry counter shall be set to its reset
retry value. Optionally, the PUK’s retry counter may be set to its initial reset retry value. The
security status of the PIN’s key reference shall not be changed.

Required Vendor Information

VE05.31.01: This information is requested as part of VE05.17.01.

VE05.31.02: The vendor shall specify in its documentation that the card supports the assertion made
in AS05.31.

Required Test Procedures

TE05.31.01: The tester shall validate that when the card command succeeds, the PIN’s retry
counter is set to the PIN’s reset retry value specified in VE05.31.01, and the security status of the
PIN’s key reference is not changed. If the PUK’s retry counter can be reset, the tester shall validate
that the PUK’s retry counter was reset to its initial reset retry value.

AS05.32: If the PIV Card Application returns status word '63 CX' then the retry counter
associated with the PIN shall not be reset, the security status of the PIN’s key reference shall
be set to FALSE, and the PUK’s retry counter shall be decremented by one.

Required Vendor Information

VE05.32.01: The vendor shall state in its documentation that card supports the assertion made in
AS05.32.
