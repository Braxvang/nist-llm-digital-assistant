SP 800-152                                      A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


             When interoperability is required, and digital signature
PR:7.18
             generation and verification is to be performed using ECDSA,
             a Federal CKMS shall support curve P-256 as the default
             curve and SHA-256 as the default hash function to be used
             for Low and Moderate impact-levels, and curve P-384 and
             SHA-384 for High impact-levels.
             When interoperability is required, and digital signature
PR:7.19
             generation and verification is to be performed using RSA, a
             Federal CKMS shall support the RSASSA-PSS signature
             scheme as the default scheme.
             A CKMS shall use only cryptographic algorithms whose
PR:7.20
             security lifetimes extend up to or beyond the anticipated
             lifetime of the FCKMS itself and the information that it
             protects, or have a transition strategy for migration to stronger
             algorithms and longer key lengths in the future.
             A Federal CKMS shall maintain and use transition plans that
PR:7.21
             include the selection and use of cryptographic algorithm(s)
             and key length(s) to be used during a transition period.

             A Federal CKMS should support the update or replacement
PA:7.1
             of cryptographic algorithms, and do so in a manner that does
             not significantly impact FCKMS operations.

             A Federal CKMS could implement provisions that support
PF:7.1
             transitions to new algorithms or key lengths. Such provisions
             include:
                a) Common interfaces,
                b) Common formats for keys, metadata, and associated
                   protection mechanisms,
                c) Common procedures for cryptographically associating
                   (e.g., binding) metadata to their keys, and
                d) Cryptographic algorithms that can be replaced, when
                   needed.
