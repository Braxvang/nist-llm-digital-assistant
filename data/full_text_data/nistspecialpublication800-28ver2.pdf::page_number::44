x .3) of attacks. A number of complementary technical safeguards, discussed in Section 5.2, are available,
including classes of products that employ firewall, antivirus, intrusion detection, and behavior blocking
technologies.

Manufacturers also provide a range of security controls that can be deployed on gateways and end-user
systems, allowing organizations to more effectively layer defenses. For example, firewalls, intrusion
detection and prevention systems (IDPS), and malware scanners are available at both the network
perimeter and individual host levels.

5.1.11 Incident Response Handling

No matter how well an organization’s security program is executed, inevitably a security breach will
occur in a system. Besides adopting reasonable precautions for securing computer systems and networks,
organizations must also establish the ability to respond quickly and efficiently when a security incident
occurs. A security incident is a violation or imminent threat of violation of computer security policies,
acceptable use policies or standard security practices that affects the confidentiality, integrity, or
availability of a system or network. Examples of incidents include unauthorized use of an account,
unauthorized elevation of system privileges, execution of malicious code that corrupts data or other code,
DoS attacks, or a user providing illegal copies of software to others through file sharing services.
Incidents may result in a partial or complete loss of security controls, an attempted or actual compromise
of data, or the waste, fraud, abuse, loss, or damage of computational resources. Active content has played
an increasingly significant role in security incidents, because of the additional attack surfaces exposed by
each technology.

Responding to computer security incidents effectively necessitates a significant amount of preparation.
Incident response activities require technical knowledge as well as effective communication and
coordination among personnel who respond to the incident, to return the system as quickly as possible to
normal operations. Proper periodic backup of critical files is a key ingredient in recovering from the
adverse effects of an incident. NIST SP 800-61, Computer Security Incident Handling Guide [NIST04]
provides an overview of the processes necessary for organizations to develop effective incident handling
programs and policies.

5.2   Technical Safeguards

Appropriate technical controls need to be selected, deployed, and maintained as safeguards against
malicious active content and mobile code. Four broad classes of technical controls have been identified,
which can be summarized as follows [Rub98]:

 Filters that examine code at points of entry and block or disable it if deemed harmful
 Cages that constrain the code’s behavior (e.g., privilege or function) during execution
 Signatures that prevent code execution unless digitally signed by a trusted source
 Proofs that define properties of code and are conveyed with it, which must be successfully verified
  before the code is executed.
Multiple instances of these controls can be combined to form hybrid safeguards. Further explanation is
given in the following subsections.
