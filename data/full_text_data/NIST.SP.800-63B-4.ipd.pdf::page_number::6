      NIST SP 800-63B-4 ipd                                              Digital Identity Guidelines
      December 2022                                       Authentication and Lifecycle Management


131   including requirements for security and privacy as well as considerations for fostering
132   equity and the usability of digital identity solutions and technology.
133   Taking into account feedback provided in response to our June 2020 Pre-Draft Call
134   for Comments, as well as research conducted into real-world implementations of the
135   guidelines, market innovation, and the current threat environment, this draft seeks to:
136      1. Advance Equity: This draft seeks to expand upon the risk management content
137         of previous revisions and specifically mandates that agencies account for impacts
138         to individuals and communities in addition to impacts to the organization. It also
139         elevates risks to mission delivery – including challenges to providing services to
140         all people who are eligible for and entitled to them – within the risk management
141         process and when implementing digital identity systems. Additionally, the guidance
142         now mandates continuous evaluation of potential impacts across demographics,
143         provides biometric performance requirements, and additional parameters for the
144         responsible use of biometric-based technologies, such as those that utilize face
145         recognition.
146      2. Emphasize Optionality and Choice for Consumers: In the interest of promoting
147         and investigating additional scalable, equitable, and convenient identify verification
148         options, including those that do and do not leverage face recognition technologies,
149         this draft expands the list of acceptable identity proofing alternatives to provide
150         new mechanisms to securely deliver services to individuals with differing means,
151         motivations, and backgrounds. The revision also emphasizes the need for digital
152         identity services to support multiple authenticator options to address diverse
153         consumer needs and secure account recovery.
154      3. Deter Fraud and Advanced Threats: This draft enhances fraud prevention
155         measures from the third revision by updating risk and threat models to account
156         for new attacks, providing new options for phishing resistant authentication, and
157         introducing requirements to prevent automated attacks against enrollment processes.
158         It also opens the door to new technology such as mobile driver’s licenses and
159         verifiable credentials.
160      4. Address Implementation Lessons Learned: This draft addresses areas where
161         implementation experience has indicated that additional clarity or detail was
162         required to effectively operationalize the guidelines. This includes re-working
163         the federation assurance levels, providing greater detail on trusted referees,
164         clarifying guidelines on identity attribute validation sources, and improving address
165         confirmation requirements.
166   NIST is specifically interested in comments on and recommendations for the following
167   topics:
168   Authentication and Lifecycle Management
