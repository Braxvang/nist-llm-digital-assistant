NIST SP 800-90A Rev. 1                 HMAC_DRBG            Recommendation for Random Number
                                                             Generation Using Deterministic RBGs

10.1.2.4     Reseeding an HMAC_DRBG Instantiation

Notes for the reseed function specified in Section 9.2:
   The reseeding of an HMAC_DRBG instantiation requires a call to the
   Reseed_function specified in Section 9.2. Process step 6 of that function calls the
   reseed algorithm specified in this section. The values for min_length are provided in
   Table 2 of Section 10.1.
The reseed algorithm:
   Let HMAC_DRBG_Update be the function specified in Section 10.1.2.2. The
   following process or its equivalent shall be used as the reseed algorithm for this DRBG
   mechanism (see step 6 of the reseed process in Section 9.2):
   HMAC_DRBG_Reseed_algorithm (working_state, entropy_input, additional_input):
       1. working_state: The current values for V, Key and reseed_counter (see Section
          10.1.2.1).
       2. entropy_input: The string of bits obtained from the randomness source.
       3. additional_input: The additional input string received from the consuming
          application. Note that the length of the additional_input string may be zero.
   Output:
       1. new_working_state: The new values for V, Key and reseed_counter.
   HMAC_DRBG Reseed Process:
       1. seed_material = entropy_input || additional_input.
       2. (Key, V) = HMAC_DRBG_Update (seed_material, Key, V).
       3. reseed_counter = 1.
       4. Return (V, Key, reseed_counter).

10.1.2.5     Generating Pseudorandom Bits Using HMAC_DRBG

Notes for the generate function specified in Section 9.3:
   The generation of pseudorandom bits using an HMAC_DRBG instantiation requires a
   call to the Generate_function specified in Section 9.3. Process step 8 of that function
   calls the generate algorithm specified in this section. The values for
   max_number_of_bits_per_request and outlen are provided in Table 2 of Section 10.1.


The generate algorithm:
   Let HMAC be the keyed hash function specified in [FIPS 198] using the hash function
   selected for the DRBG mechanism. The value for reseed_interval is defined in Table 2
   of Section 10.1.
   The following process or its equivalent shall be used as the generate algorithm for this
   DRBG mechanism (see step 8 of the generate process in Section 9.3):
