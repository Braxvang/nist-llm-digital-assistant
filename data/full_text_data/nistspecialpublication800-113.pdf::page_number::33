                                                                                          GUIDE TO SSL VPNS



4.      SSL VPN Planning and Implementation

This section focuses on the planning and implementation of SSL VPNs in the enterprise. As with any
new technology deployment, SSL VPN planning and implementation should be addressed in a phased
approach. A successful SSL VPN deployment can be achieved by following a clear, step-by-step
planning and implementation process. The use of a phased approach can minimize unforeseen issues and
identify potential pitfalls early in the process. This section explores in depth each of the recommended
SSL VPN planning and implementation phases, as follows:

      1. Identify Requirements. The first phase of the process involves identifying the current and
         future requirements for remote access and determining how they can best be met by an SSL VPN
         implementation. Determining requirements for U.S. federal agencies also means assessing how
         to comply with FIPS 140-2.

      2. Design the Solution. The second phase involves all aspects of designing an SSL VPN solution.
         The design elements are grouped into five categories: access control, endpoint security,
         authentication methods, architecture, and cryptography policy.

      3. Implement and Test a Prototype. The next phase involves implementing and testing a
         prototype in a laboratory or test environment. The primary goals are to evaluate all aspects of the
         solution including authentication, application compatibility, management, logging, performance,
         security of the implementation, design and layout of the VPN portal, and default settings.

      4. Deploy the Solution. Once testing is completed and all issues are resolved, the next phase
         includes the deployment of the SSL VPN throughout the enterprise. This phase addresses issues
         specific to SSL VPNs that may occur during deployment. Support must be addressed, and this
         includes the process of working with a help desk to provide assistance for end users.

      5. Manage the Solution. After the SSL VPN solution has been deployed, it must be managed
         throughout its lifecycle. Management includes maintenance (e.g., patching, solution expansion,
         key management, policy changes), performance monitoring, and periodic testing/validation of the
         solution. The handling of operational issues must also be considered.

Organizations should also put into place other measures that support and complement SSL VPN
implementations. These measures help to ensure that the SSL VPN solution is implemented in an
environment with the technical, management, and operational controls necessary to provide sufficient
security for the SSL VPN. Examples of supporting measures include:

 Establish and maintain control over all entry and exit points for the protected network to help ensure
  its integrity.
 Ensure that all SSL VPN endpoints are secured and maintained properly to reduce the risk of SSL
  VPN compromise or misuse.
4.1     Identify Requirements

The purpose of this phase is to identify which resources or services need to be available for remote access
and who should be able to access them through the SSL VPN. It is also important to identify other
general and application-specific requirements, such as performance, and to think about future
requirements. For example, if it is likely that other resources will need to be accessible by remote users in
a year, then those needs should also be considered.
