operation to ensure that it meets all required security specifications. In addition, if
new controls are added to the application or the support system, additional
acceptance tests of those new controls must be performed. This approach ensures
that new controls meet security specifications and do not conflict with or invalidate
existing controls. The results of the design reviews and system tests should be fully
documented, updated as new reviews or tests are performed, and maintained in the
official organization records.

3.4 Operations/Maintenance Phase
    An effective security program demands comprehensive and continuous
understanding of program and system weaknesses. In the operation and
maintenance phase, systems and products are in place and operating, enhancements
and/or modifications to the system are developed and tested, and hardware and/or
software is added or replaced. During this phase, the organization should
continuously monitor performance of the system to ensure that it is consistent with
preestablished user and security requirements, and needed system modifications are
incorporated.
    For configuration management (CM) and control, it is important to document the
proposed or actual changes in the security plan of the system. Information systems
are typically in a constant state of evolution with upgrades to hardware, software,
firmware, and possible modifications to the surrounding environment where the
system resides. Documenting information system changes and assessing the
potential impact of these changes on the security of a system is an essential part of
continuous monitoring, and key to avoiding a lapse in the system security
accreditation. 20
    Monitoring security controls helps to identify potential security-related problems
in the information system that are not identified during the security impact analysis,
which is conducted as part of the CM and control process.

3.5 Disposal Phase
    The disposal phase of the system life cycle refers to the process of preserving (if
applicable) and discarding system information, hardware, and software. This step is
extremely important because during this phase, information, hardware, and software
are moved to another system, archived, discarded, or destroyed. If performed
improperly, the disposal phase can result in the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive
data. When archiving information, organizations should consider the need and
methods for future retrieval. While electronic information is relatively easy to store
and retrieve, problems can arise if the technology used to create the records is no
longer available in the future as a result of obsolescence or incompatibility with new
technologies. Additionally, the organization should consider what measures must be
taken for the future use of data that has been encrypted, such as taking appropriate
steps to ensure the secure long-term storage of cryptographic keys. It is equally
important to consider legal requirements for records retention when disposing of
information systems. For federal systems, system management officials should
consult with their office responsible for retaining and archiving federal records.
    The removal of information from a storage medium, such as a hard disk or tape,
is called sanitization. There are four categories of media sanitization: disposal,
