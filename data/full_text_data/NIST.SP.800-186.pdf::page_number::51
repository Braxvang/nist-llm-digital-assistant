      1. Compute h = HASH(s).
      2. Let h0 be the bit string obtained by taking the w rightmost bits of h.
      3. Let z be the integer whose binary expansion is given by the hdigest-bit string s.
      4. For i = 1 to v do
         4.1 Define the hdigest-bit string si to be the binary expansion of the integer
            (z + i) mod (2hdigest ).
         4.2 Compute hi = HASH(si).
      5. Let h be the bit string obtained by the concatenation of h0 , h1, … , hv as follows:
                  h = h0 || h1 || … || hv
      6. Let c be the integer whose binary expansion is given by the bit string h.
      7. Verify that b2 c ≡ –27 mod p.

C.3.3. Generation of Pseudorandom Curves (Binary Case)
Inputs:
      1. Prime number m
      2. Bit-string s of length hdigest
      3. Approved hash function HASH with output length of hdigest bits and security design
         strength of at least requested_security_strength

Output: Coefficient b used to generate a pseudorandom binary curve

Process:
Let
                  v =  (m – 1) / hdigest 
                  w = m – hdigest × v
      1. Choose an arbitrary hdigest-bit string s as the domain parameter seed.
      2. Compute h = HASH(s).
      3. Let h0 be the bit string obtained by taking the w rightmost bits of h.
      4. Let z be the integer whose binary expansion is given by the hdigest-bit string s.
      5. For i from 1 to v, do:
         5.1 Define the hdigest-bit string si to be the binary expansion of the integer
                 (z + i) mod (2hdigest )
         5.2 Compute hi = HASH(si).
      6. Let h be the bit string obtained by the concatenation of h0 , h1, … , hv as follows:
                 h = h0 || h1 || … || hv
      7. Let b be the element of GF(2m), which is represented by the bit string h in the Gaussian
         Normal Basis (see Appendix G.3.1).
      8. Choose an element a of GF(2m).
      9. Check that the elliptic curve E over GF(2m) given by y2 + xy = x3 + ax2 + b has suitable
         order. If not, go to Step 1.
