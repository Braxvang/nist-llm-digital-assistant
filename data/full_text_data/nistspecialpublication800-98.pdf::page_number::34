GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



Analytic systems are often enterprise applications that draw inputs from multiple sources, many of which
may not involve the RF subsystem. For example, some RFID systems are designed to co-exist with or
complement existing AIDC systems (e.g., bar code technology). Analytic systems also correlate RFID
data with non-RFID business records imported from other databases, such as records from business
partners, customers, logistics service providers, and suppliers. Therefore, analytic systems are often
based on commercial database software or legacy applications 20 that support processing of data other than
RFID data. Analytic systems that are a part of the EPCglobal Network and process data based on tags that
comply with EPCglobal standards are called EPC Information Services (EPCIS).

2.4.3     Network Infrastructure

Network infrastructure enables communication between the RF and enterprise subsystems, as well as
among components of the enterprise subsystem. Some important characteristics of network infrastructure
include:

 The physical and logical topology of the network, and
 Data communications protocols.
2.4.3.1 Physical and Logical Topology

The topology of a network describes how network computing elements are physically and logically
connected to each other. Physical topology describes the network’s cable plant or air interfaces. Logical
topology describes how the communications links between devices are arranged. Network
communications devices often are configured so that the logical topology is different than the physical
topology. For example, communications equipment can be configured to create virtual private networks
(VPN) that logically combine and segment physical networks to achieve performance and security
objectives.

The physical topology of a network infrastructure supporting an RFID system depends on the physical
location of the components in its enterprise subsystem. For example, the RF to enterprise subsystem
connections are physically located near readers.

The appropriate physical location of middleware servers depends on the level of traffic generated by the
readers. If RFID transactions are relatively infrequent (e.g., an access control system with relatively
small numbers of users), then the location of middleware is not critical. In this context, the middleware
can be placed in a central location to serve multiple readers. If the business process requires large
numbers of tags to be read quickly (e.g., multiple checkout stations in a busy store), then middleware is
located near the readers to avoid latency problems and data throughput restrictions associated with many
wide area networks. In some cases, middleware capabilities are incorporated into the communication
switches to which the readers connect, so RFID-related traffic does not need to traverse even a single
device before it is filtered and processed. This configuration is often termed an edge processing network
because the switches are considered at the network’s edges.

The physical location of analytic systems usually depends on how an organization manages its enterprise
applications. If the analytic systems are dedicated to the RFID application, then organizations often place
these systems near readers and middleware. On the other hand, some organizations locate their analytic
systems in remote data centers to take advantage of the centers’ physical security, on-site technical

     In this context, legacy applications are computer applications that significantly predate the RFID system and are not
     designed to process data in formats that middleware supports. In this situation, data has to be converted into a format that
     the legacy application can interpret.
