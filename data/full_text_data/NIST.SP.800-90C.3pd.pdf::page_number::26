708   2.8.1. DRBG Functions
709   SP 800-90A specifies several functions for use within a DRBG, indicating the input and output
710   parameters and other implementation details. Note that, in some cases, some input parameters may
711   be omitted, and some output information may not be returned.
712   At least two functions are required in a DRBG:
713       1. An instantiate function that seeds the DRBG using the output of a randomness source and
714          other input (see Section 2.8.1.1) and
715       2. A generate function that produces output for use by a consuming application (see Section
716          2.8.1.2).
717   A DRBG may also support a reseed function (see Section 2.8.1.3). A Get_randomness-
718   source_input function is used in SP 800-90A to request output from a randomness source during
719   instantiation and reseeding (see Section 2.8.1.4).
720   The use of the Uninstantiate_function specified in SP 800-90A is not explicitly discussed in SP
721   800-90C but may be required by an implementation.

722   2.8.1.1.        DRBG Instantiation
723   A DRBG shall be instantiated prior to the generation of pseudorandom bits at the highest security
724   strength to be supported by the DRBG instantiation using the following call:
725       (status, state_handle) = Instantiate_function(requested_instantiation_security_strength,
726                          prediction_resistance_flag, personalization_string).
