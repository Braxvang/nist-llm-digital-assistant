Memory configurations among mobile devices have evolved over time. Feature phones were
among the first types of devices that contained NOR flash and RAM memory. System and
user data are stored in NOR and copied to RAM upon booting for faster code execution and
access. This is known as the first generation of mobile device memory configurations.

As smartphones were introduced, memory configurations evolved, adding NAND flash
memory. This arrangement of NOR, NAND and RAM memory is referred to as the second
generation. This generation of memory configurations stores system files in NOR flash, user
files in NAND and RAM is used for code execution.

The latest smartphones contain only NAND and RAM memory (i.e., third generation), due to
requirements for higher transaction speed, greater storage density and lower cost. To facilitate
the lack of space on mobile device mainboards and the demand for higher density storage
space (i.e., 2GB – 128GB) the new Embedded MultiMedia Cards (eMMC) style chips are
present in many of today’s smartphones.

Figure 1 illustrates the various memory configurations contained across all mobile devices.

RAM is the most difficult to capture accurately due to its volatile nature. Since RAM is
typically used for program execution, information may be of value to the examiner (e.g.,
configuration files, passwords, etc.). Mobile device RAM capture tools are just beginning to
become available.

NOR flash memory includes system data such as: operating system code, the kernel, device
drivers, system libraries, memory for executing operating system applications and the storage
of user application execution instructions. NOR flash will be the best location for data
collection for first generation memory configuration devices.

NAND flash memory contains: PIM data, graphics, audio, video, and other user files. This
type of memory generally provides the examiner with the most useful information in most
cases. NAND flash memory may leave multiple copies of transaction-based files (e.g.,
databases and logs) due to wear leveling algorithms and garbage collection routines. Since
NAND flash memory cells can be re-used for only a limited amount of time before they
become unreliable, wear leveling algorithms are used to increase the life span of Flash memory
storage, by arranging data so that erasures and re-writes are distributed evenly across the SSD.
