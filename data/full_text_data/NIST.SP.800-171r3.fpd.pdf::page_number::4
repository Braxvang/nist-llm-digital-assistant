NIST SP 800-171r3 fpd (Final Public Draft)               Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information
November 2023

Abstract
The protection of Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) resident in nonfederal systems and
organizations is of paramount importance to federal agencies and can directly impact the ability
of the Federal Government to successfully conduct its essential missions and functions. This
publication provides federal agencies with recommended security requirements for protecting the
confidentiality of CUI when the information is resident in nonfederal systems and organizations.
The requirements apply to components of nonfederal systems that process, store, or transmit CUI
or that provide protection for such components. The security requirements are intended for use
by federal agencies in contractual vehicles or other agreements established between those
agencies and nonfederal organizations.

Reports on Computer Systems Technology
The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical
leadership for the Nation’s measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops tests, test
methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance
the development and productive use of information technology. ITL’s responsibilities include the
development of management, administrative, technical, and physical standards and guidelines for
the cost-effective security and privacy of other than national security-related information in
federal information systems. The Special Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research,
guidelines, and outreach efforts in information system security, and its collaborative activities
with industry, government, and academic organizations.
