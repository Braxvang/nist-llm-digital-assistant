1.    Introduction

1.1   Purpose and Scope

This document provides guidelines for BIOS protections in server-class systems. It is the second in a
series of publications on BIOS protections. The first document, SP800-147, BIOS Protection Guidelines,
was released in April 2011 and provides guidelines for desktop and laptop systems deployed in enterprise
environments.

Unauthorized modification of BIOS firmware by malicious software constitutes a significant threat
because of the BIOS’s unique and privileged position within modern computer system architectures.
Malicious BIOS modification could be part of a sophisticated, targeted attack on an organization—either
a permanent denial of service (if the BIOS is corrupted) or a persistent malware presence (if the BIOS is
implanted with malware).

The three core principles of BIOS protection outlined in NIST SP 800-147 for client systems—
authenticated firmware updates, integrity protection, and non-bypassability of protection mechanisms—
apply to server-class machines. However, the architectural and operational complexity in servers due to
the need to remotely manage them makes it more difficult to implement BIOS security protections in the
same manner as clients; the core reason for the increased difficulty is that servers typically possess
multiple BIOS update mechanisms. In addition, some servers have one or more Service Processors (SPs).
SPs perform various management functions for the hosts, which may include BIOS updates. This
introduces the SP as a security-critical component, and thus this document includes guidelines for SPs
that are part of the BIOS update process.

Boot firmware refers to software or firmware used to facilitate the hardware initialization process and
transition control to the hypervisor or operating system. This publication uses the term BIOS as a
generic, recognized term for system boot firmware in servers, including, but not limited to, boot firmware
based on conventional BIOS, Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) BIOS, and Unified Extensible
Firmware Interface (UEFI) BIOS. The guidelines in this document include requirements on servers to
mitigate the execution of malicious or corrupt BIOS code. They apply to BIOS firmware stored in the
BIOS flash memory, including the BIOS code, the cryptographic keys that are part of the Root of Trust
for Update (RTU), and static BIOS data. Device firmware that is stored with the system BIOS firmware
and is updated by the same mechanism is considered part of the BIOS for the purposes of this document
(e.g., Option ROMs embedded in the BIOS flash). These guidelines do not apply to other device firmware
or Option ROMs stored elsewhere in a server, such as on an option card itself.

This guide is intended to provide server platform vendors with recommendations and guidelines for a
secure BIOS update process. System administrators should consult Section 3.2 of NIST SP 800-147 for
recommended best practices for managing BIOS in client and server systems.

1.2   Audience

The intended audience for this document includes BIOS and platform vendors of server-class systems,
and information system security professionals who are responsible for managing the servers’ security.
The material may also be of use when developing enterprise-wide procurement strategies and
deployment.

The material in this document is technically oriented, and it is assumed that readers have at least a basic
understanding of system and network security. The document provides background information to help
