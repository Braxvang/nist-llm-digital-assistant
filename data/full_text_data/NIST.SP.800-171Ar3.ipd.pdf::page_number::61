1893   3.8.3. Media Sanitization
1894           REQUIREMENT: 03.08.03

1895           ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE
1896           Determine if:
1897           A.03.08.03: system media that contain CUI are sanitized prior to disposal, release out of
1898           organizational control, or release for reuse.
1899           ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS
1900           Examine
1901           [SELECT FROM: media protection policy and procedures; procedures for media sanitization and
1902           disposal; applicable standards and policies that address media sanitization policy; system audit
1903           records; media sanitization records; system design documentation; system configuration settings;
1904           records retention and disposition policy; records retention and disposition procedures; system
1905           security plan; other relevant documents or records]
1906           Interview
1907           [SELECT FROM: personnel with media sanitization responsibilities; personnel with records
1908           retention and disposition responsibilities; personnel with information security responsibilities;
1909           system administrators]
1910           Test
1911           [SELECT FROM: processes for media sanitization; mechanisms for supporting and/or

1916           REQUIREMENT: 03.08.04

1917           ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE
1918           Determine if:
1919           A.03.08.04[01]: system media that contain CUI are marked to indicate distribution limitations.
1920           A.03.08.04[02]: system media that contain CUI are marked to indicate handling caveats.
1921           A.03.08.04[03]: system media that contain CUI are marked to indicate security markings.
