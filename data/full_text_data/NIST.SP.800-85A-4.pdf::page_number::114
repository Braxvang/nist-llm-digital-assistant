                          1. The command returns '69 82' (security status not satisfied).
                          2. The command returns '90 00' (verify that the retry counter
                             is set to reset retry value).
                          3. The command returns the Cardholder Fingerprints data
                             object along with the status word '90 00'.
                          4. The command returns '90 00'.
                          5. The command returns '69 82' (security status not satisfied).
                          6. The command returns '6A 80' (incorrect parameter in
                             command data field) or '63 CX' (verification failed, with X
                             indicating the number of further allowed retries) (verify the
                             error code supplied matches what is described in vendor
                             documentation).
                          7. The command returns '6A 80' (incorrect parameter
                             command data field) or '63 CX' (verification failed, with X
                             indicating the number of further allowed retries (verify the
                             error code supplied matches what is described in vendor
                             documentation).
                          8. The command returns '6A 80' (incorrect parameter
                             command data field) or '63 CX' (verification failed, with X
                             indicating the number of further allowed retries (verify the
                             error code supplied matches what is described in vendor
                             documentation).
                          9. The command returns '6A 80' (incorrect parameter
                             command data field) or '63 CX' (verification failed, with X
                             indicating the number of further allowed retries) (verify the
                             error code supplied matches what is described in vendor
                             documentation).
                          9a. The command returns '6A 80' (incorrect parameter
                               command data field) or '63 CX' (verification failed, with X
                               indicating the numer of further allowed retries (verify the
                               error code supplied matches what is described in vendor
                               documentation).
                          10. The command returns:
                                  • '63 CX' until the maximum number of PIN tries is
                                       reached (X indicates the number of further allowed
                                       retries).
                                  • '69 83' (authentication method blocked) when the
                                       maximum number of PIN tries is exceeded.
                    2b:
                          1. Steps 1-10 have the same command response as in 2a (1-10).
                    2c:
                          1. The command returns '90 00' (verify that the retry counter
                             is set to reset retry value).
