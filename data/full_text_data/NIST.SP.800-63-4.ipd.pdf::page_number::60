       NIST SP 800-63-4 ipd                                              Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022


1753   Biometric Sample
1754   An analog or digital representation of biometric characteristics prior to biometric feature
1755   extraction. An example is a record containing a fingerprint image.

1756   Biometrics
1757   Automated recognition of individuals based on their biological and behavioral
1758   characteristics.

1759   Blocklist
1760   A documented list of specific elements that are blocked, per policy decision. This concept
1761   has historically been known as a blacklist.

1762   Challenge-Response Protocol
1763   An authentication protocol where the verifier sends the claimant a challenge (usually a
1764   random value or nonce) that the claimant combines with a secret (such as by hashing
1765   the challenge and a shared secret together, or by applying a private key operation
1766   to the challenge) to generate a response that is sent to the verifier. The verifier can
1767   independently verify the response generated by the claimant (such as by re-computing the
1768   hash of the challenge and the shared secret and comparing to the response, or performing
1769   a public key operation on the response) and establish that the claimant possesses and
1770   controls the secret.

1771   Claimant
1772   A subject whose identity is to be verified using one or more authentication protocols.

1773   Claimed Address
1774   The physical location asserted by a subject where they can be reached. It includes the
1775   individual’s residential street address and may also include their mailing address.
1776   For example, a person with a foreign passport living in the U.S. will need to give an
1777   address when going through the identity proofing process. This address would not be
1778   an “address of record” but a “claimed address.”

1779   Claimed Identity
1780   An applicant’s declaration of unvalidated and unverified personal attributes.

1781   Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart
1782   (CAPTCHA)
1783   An interactive feature added to web forms to distinguish whether a human or automated
1784   agent is using the form. Typically, it requires entering text corresponding to a distorted
1785   image or a sound stream.
