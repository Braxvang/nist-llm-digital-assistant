6.3.2   Memory Cards

        A wide array of memory cards exists on the market today, ranging from the size of a stamp to
        that of a matchbook. Removable media storage capacity ranges from 8MB to beyond 2GB.
        As technological advances are made, such media becomes smaller and offers larger storage
        densities. Removable media extends the storage capacity of PDAs, allowing individuals to
        store additional files beyond the deviceâ€™s built-in capacity. Memory cards provide another
        avenue for sharing data between multiple users that have compatible hardware.

        Unlike RAM within a device, removable media is non-volatile storage and requires no battery
        to retain data. Fortunately, such media can be treated similarly to a removable disk drive, and
        imaged and analyzed using conventional forensic tools with the use of an external media
        reader. Memory card adapters exist that support an Integrated Development Environment
        (IDE) interface. Such adapters allow removable media to be treated as a hard disk and used
        with write blocker software, which ensures that the removable media remains unaltered
        [Wie02]. Data contained on the media can be imaged and searched, and deleted files
        recovered. Below is a brief overview of several common storage media in use today that may
        contain significant information related to an investigation.

                Compact Flash Cards (CF) - Compact Flash memory is a solid-state disk card with
                a 50-pin connector, consisting of two parallel rows of 25 pins on one edge of the card.
                Compact Flash cards are designed for PCMCIA-ATA functionality and compatibility,
                have a 16-bit data bus, and are used more as a hard drive than as RAM. They use
                flash memory technology, a non-volatile storage solution that retains its information
                once power is removed from the card. Compact Flash cards are about the size of a
                matchbook (length-36.4 mm, width-42.8 mm, thickness-3.3 mm for Type I and 5mm
                for Type II) and consume a minimal amount of power.

                Microdrives - The Hitachi Microdrive digital media is a high-capacity, rotating mass
                storage device that is in a Compact Flash Type II package with a 16-bit data bus. A
                tiny glass disk serves as the storage media, which is more fragile than solid-state
                memory and requires energy to spin. Similar in function to the solid-state Flash
                memory cards, the 4GB Microdrive storage card is preformatted with a FAT32 file
                system. FAT32 is required to allow for storage over 2GB. By moving to FAT32,
                more storage space can be accessed, but cameras and other devices must support the
                newer file system. Many digital cameras and most PDAs support FAT32.

                Multi-Media Cards (MMC) - A Multi-Media Card (MMC) is a solid-state disk card
                with a 7-pin connector. MMC cards have a 1-bit data bus. As with CF cards, they are
                designed with flash technology, a non-volatile storage solution that retains
                information once power is removed from the card. The cards contain no moving parts
                and provide greater protection of data than conventional magnetic disk drives. Multi-
                Media Cards are about the size of a postage stamp (length-32 mm, width-24 mm, and
                thickness-1.4 mm). Reduced Size Multi-Media cards (RS-MMC) also exist. They
                are approximately one-half the size of the standard MMC card (length-18mm, width-
                24mm, and thickness-1.4mm). Though they were designed specifically for mobile
                phones, they can potentially be used with PDAs. An RS-MMC can be used in a full
                size MMC slot with a mechanical adapter. A regular MMC card can be also used in
                RS-MMC card slot, though part of it will stick out from the slot. MMCplus and
