                                                                                      planning of future projects
Implementation/Assessment    • Percentage of modules        • Identify software     • Provides insight into risk of
                               that contain                   defects that may        the system being exploited
                               vulnerabilities                be exploited in the     when implemented
                             • Percentage of failed           future                • Indicates need for additional
                               security control                                       security controls in
                               requirements                                           operations



 Collecting and analyzing these types of measures will help the project manager in the following
 manner:
     •     Determine if software defects that may impact information security are being identified
           early in the life cycle where they are more cost-effective to fix;
     •     Identify and remove potential vulnerabilities in software and develop more secure design
           practices;
     •     Identify and investigate trends that require corrective actions, such as training or revising
           poorly written and confusing procedures;
     •     Determine if the information system will comply with required security controls; and
     •     Track trends in information security risk throughout the SDLC.

 Collecting, analyzing, and reporting appropriate security measures during the SDLC can be used
 to improve integration of information security into the information system development effort to
 increase the overall assurance that system security requirements are built in rather than added
 later.

 3.5.3     Enterprise-Wide Programs

 Information security measurement can be implemented on an enterprise-wide level to monitor
 the implementation, effectiveness/efficiency, and impact on the organization’s information
 security activities. Enterprise-level measures may be derived by aggregating multiple
 information system-level measures or developed by using the entire enterprise as the scope.

 For an enterprise-wide measurement to be effective, the organization must operate at a certain
 level of maturity to ensure that processes the measures depend upon are consistent, repeatable,
 and can ensure availability of data across the enterprise.
