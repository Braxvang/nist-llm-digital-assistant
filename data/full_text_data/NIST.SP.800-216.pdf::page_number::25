NIST SP 800-216                                                                 Federal Vulnerability

   Vulnerability Disclosure Program Offices
This section describes the duties and operation of a Vulnerability Disclosure Program Office
(VDPO) and how it should work with the FCB and reporters to assess potentially vulnerable
systems and software. After verifying the merit of source vulnerability reports, VDPOs should
support system owners with the tasks of vulnerability verification, mitigation and/or remediation,
and advisory publication.

       Vulnerability Disclosure Program Office Description
VDPOs should ideally be implemented as part of an information technology security office
(ITSO) or existing program. ITSOs already have security oversight and support duties for all
systems, which benefits a VDPO by providing needed communications and contacts to all
systems (e.g., the system owners and their security officers). The role of the VDPO will, in turn,
benefit an ITSO with the management of reported vulnerabilities.
A VDPO may be an office with its own dedicated personnel or a virtual office with duties and
roles assumed by members of the operating unitâ€™s ITSO. At a minimum, it will consist of staff
who perform coordination and oversight duties and engagement with vulnerability disclosure
reporters. However, the VDPO may extend to provide technical services to system owners to
support their efforts in verifying and remediating vulnerabilities. In this case, the VDPO may
include more technically oriented developers or systems administrators with security expertise.

       Vulnerability Disclosure Program Office Structural Requirements
A VDPO is a key unit of an information technology security office that focuses on vulnerability
reporting management. Its structural requirements include:
   1. Development of source vulnerability report acceptance policies and the capability to
      receive source vulnerability reports
   2. Monitoring of source vulnerability reports
   3. Processing and resolution of source vulnerability reports
           a. Identification of potentially vulnerable systems and software
           b. Verification of a source vulnerability reports
           c. Oversight and support for the mitigation or remediation of verified vulnerabilities
   4. Development of vulnerability disclosure handling procedures
