NIST SP 800-166                                                   DERIVED PIV APPLICATION AND
                                                                  DATA MODEL TEST GUIDELINES

                                2. '10' if command chaining is used. (The last
                                   chain of the command sets CLA to '00')
                            • P1, algorithm reference, is set to '07' or '11'
                            • P2, key reference, is set to '9A' (the Derived
                               PIV Authentication key)
                            • Data field in the command is to include '81'
                               specifying a challenge, followed by a randomly
                               generated challenge, and '82 00' in order to
                               request a response
                      3. Send the VERIFY command with
                            • P2, key reference value, is set to '80'
                            • Data field of the command will contain the
                               correct Derived PIV Application Password, padded
                               with 'FF' (if necessary) to complete the total
                               length of the value to 8 bytes
                      4. Repeat Step 2
 Expected Result(s)   1. From Step 1, the command returns the application property template
                         with the status word '90 00'.
                      2. From Step 2, the command returns status word '69 82' (security
                         status not satisfied).
                      3. From Step 3, the command returns status word '90 00'.
                      4. From Step 4, the command returns the signed challenge with status
                         word '90 00'. Verify the signed challenge.

8.3.3.2 Internal Authenticate with the Derived PIV Authentication Key (with an Invalid
        Algorithm Reference and Data Length)

 Test Assertion       TA-08.03.03.02
 Purpose              Verifies that the Derived PIV Application responds to the GENERAL
                      AUTHENTICATE command appropriately when authenticating to the
                      test toolkit application using an invalid algorithm reference or data
                      length.

 Precondition(s)      •   A token with the Derived PIV Application is inserted into an
                          appropriate token reader.
                      •   Suitable drivers have been loaded between the test system and an
                          instance of the reader.
                      •   The Derived PIV Application Password is recorded.
                      •   The Derived PIV Application Password’s retry counter is not 0.
