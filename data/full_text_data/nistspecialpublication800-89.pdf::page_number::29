6.5      Obtaining Assurance of Private Key Possession: A Summary

6.5.1 Owner’s Assurance of Private Key Possession
A party that intends to act as a signatory (i.e., a key pair owner) shall have assurance of
possession of the (correct) private key either prior to the generation of a digital signature,
or as a result of the successful verification of a digital signature that was expressly
generated for the purpose of obtaining assurance of possession of the private key. Key
pairs shall be generated as specified in Section 5.1 using an Approved method for the
digital signature algorithm. For Federal government applications, sufficient assurance of
possession is not provided by generation alone.
An owner shall obtain an acceptable level of assurance of private key possession using
one or more of the following methods.

      1. Owner self-assurance using an assurance signature.
         The owner shall:
             a. Determine the appropriate value of d. For example, d may be selected in
                accordance with the assurance of possession model described in Section
                6.2, along with appropriate values of a, b and c.
             b. Determine a trusted value for t1 (see Sections 6.2 and 6.3.1.2).
             c. Generate a new private-key-possession assurance message (see Section
                6.3.1.1).
             d. Sign the assurance message using the private key for which assurance is to
                be obtained, thus generating an assurance signature.
             e. Verify the assurance signature using the public key that corresponds to the
                private key.
             f. If verification is successful:
                •   Determine a trusted value for t2 (see Sections 6.2 and 6.3.1.2).
                •   Provided that t1 ≤ t2 ≤ t1+d, assign and record the assurance_time and
                    the initial assurance level (see Sections 6.3.1.2 and 6.3.1.3).

      2. Owner obtains assurance from a TTP using an assurance signature:
             a. The owner shall determine the appropriate value of d. For example, d may
                be selected in accordance with the assurance of possession model
                described in Section 6.2, along with appropriate values of a, b and c.
                If the TTP will be responsible for assigning the assurance_time, then the
                value of d shall be made known to the TTP.
             b. The owner and/or the TTP shall determine a value for t1 that is trusted by
                the owner (see Sections 6.2 and 6.3.1.2).
             c. The owner shall generate a new private-key-possession assurance message
