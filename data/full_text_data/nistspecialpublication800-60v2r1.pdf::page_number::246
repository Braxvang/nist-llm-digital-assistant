Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Subsidies
activities are not typically time-critical. In most cases, the adverse effects of unauthorized
modification or destruction of subsidies information on agency mission functions, image or
public confidence in the agency will be limited.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
subsidies information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to subsidies information. Subsidies
processes are generally tolerant of delay. In most cases, disruption of access to subsidies
information can be expected to have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency
assets, or individuals.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
subsidies information is low.

D.23.4 Tax Credits Information Type

Tax Credits allow a special exclusion, exemption, or deduction from gross income or which
provide a special credit, a preferential rate of tax, or a deferral of tax liability designed to
encourage certain kinds of activities or to aid taxpayers in special circumstances. The
recommended provisional security categorization for the tax credits information type is as
follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Moderate), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of tax credit information
on the ability of responsible agencies to allow special exclusions, exemptions, or deductions
from gross income or which provide special credits, a preferential rate of tax, or a deferral of tax
liability designed to encourage certain kinds of activities or to aid taxpayers in special
circumstances. Many of the records associated with disbursements may include information
subject to privacy restrictions (e.g., the Privacy Act of 1974, the Internal Revenue Code and
Manual, or the Economic Espionage Act). (The provisional impact levels for personnel
information are documented in the Personal Identity and Authentication, Income, Representative
Payee, and Entitlement Event information types.) In such cases, punitive consequences and/or
loss of public confidence can have a seriously disruptive effect on an agencyâ€™s operations and
mission. In many cases, unauthorized disclosure of tax credit information can have a serious
adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level recommended
for tax credit information is moderate.
