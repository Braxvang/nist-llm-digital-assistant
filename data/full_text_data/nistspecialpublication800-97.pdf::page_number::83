                                           ESTABLISHING WIRELESS ROBUST SECURITY NETWORKS: A GUIDE TO IEEE 802.11I



The four most commonly used TLS-based EAP methods are as follows:

      EAP-TLS 73
      EAP Tunneled TLS (EAP-TTLS) 74
      Protected EAP (PEAP) 75
      EAP Flexible Authentication via Secure Tunneling (EAP-FAST). 76
These methods are described in Sections 6.1.3.1 through 6.1.3.4.

6.1.3.1 EAP-TLS

EAP-TLS is defined in RFC 2716, which was published in October 1999. EAP-TLS is considered the
most secure of the widely supported EAP methods, because it allows strong mutual cryptographic
authentication of both STA and AS using public key certificates. It is also favored by high-security
environments because it is not a compound method, unlike PEAP or EAP-TTLS, and therefore does not
suffer from compound binding problems. To enable mutual authentication, each STA must obtain and
host its own unique certificate. To provide each STA with its own certificate, organizations should
maintain a public key infrastructure (PKI). Ideally, the certificate should be stored on a smart card or
other device that can be removed from the STA, but certificates can also be stored on a STA’s hard disk
or firmware. Use of the certificate should force the user to enter a personal identification number (PIN),
password, or passphrase. Otherwise, theft of the STA or card may be all that is needed to authenticate to
the WLAN.

Establishing and maintaining a PKI and a smart card infrastructure are not simple endeavors for most
organizations. Implemented properly, a PKI involves a certificate policy and practice statement,
certificate and registration authorities, and the maintenance of certificate revocation lists, which are
needed for denying access when users’ devices are stolen or users no longer have a business need to
access the network. 77 Accordingly, EAP-TLS might be viable only for organizations that already have a
robust PKI in place or are planning one as part of an enterprise identity management solution. Another
concern with using EAP-TLS is that its authentication process involves more steps than other methods, so
its authentication transactions are slower. This can be problematic in environments in which users are
highly mobile, because users might need to re-authenticate frequently and could be frustrated if
performance suffers as a result.

Figure 6-1 shows a hypothetical WLAN that uses the EAP-TLS method for authentication. Certificates
are located on all of the STAs and the AS. In an infrastructure with several thousand STAs and only
several ASs, the need for client certificates greatly increases the level of PKI support required.

     http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2716.txt.

     At the current time, PEAP is not standardized in an IETF RFC or Internet Draft, but expired Internet Drafts describing
     PEAP are still available.

     For more information on EAP-FAST, see the draft Flexible Authentication via Secure Tunneling EAP Method (EAP-FAST),
     dated April 25, 2005, at http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-cam-winget-eap-fast-xx.txt.

     PKI implementations require a considerable investment in time and resources. It is outside the scope of this document to
     discuss PKI in detail. See NIST SP 800-32, Introduction to Public Key Technology and the Federal PKI Infrastructure, for
     more information; it is available at http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-32/sp800-32.pdf. Another document that
     might be helpful is The DoD Public Key Infrastructure and Public Key-Enabling Frequently Asked Questions. Although the
     document focuses on the Department of Defense PKI, its descriptions of PKI components are applicable to other
     environments. The document is located at http://iase.disa.mil/pki/faq-pki-pke-may-2004.doc.
