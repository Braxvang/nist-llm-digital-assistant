                        THE IMPORTANCE OF SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
         When crossing a bridge, we have a reasonable expectation that the bridge will not
         collapse and will get us to our destination without incident. For bridge builders, the
         focus is on equilibrium, static and dynamic loads, vibrations, and resonance. The
         science of physics combines with civil engineering principles and concepts to produce
         a product that we deem trustworthy, giving us a level of confidence that the bridge is
         fit-for-purpose.
         For system developers, there are also fundamental principles and concepts that can
         be found in mathematics, computer science, computer and electrical engineering,
         systems engineering, and software engineering that when properly employed,
         provide the necessary trustworthiness to engender that same level of confidence.
         Trustworthy secure systems are achieved by making a significant and substantial
         investment in strengthening the underlying systems and system components by
         employing transdisciplinary systems engineering efforts guided and informed by well-
         defined security requirements and secure architectures and designs. Such efforts
         have been proven over time to produce sound engineering-based solutions to
         complex and challenging systems security problems. Only under those circumstances
         can we build systems that are adequately secure and exhibit a level of trustworthiness
         that is sufficient for the purpose for which the system was built.
