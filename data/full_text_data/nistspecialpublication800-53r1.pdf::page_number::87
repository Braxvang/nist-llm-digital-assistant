CP-1      CONTINGENCY PLANNING POLICY AND PROCEDURES

          Control: The organization develops, disseminates, and periodically reviews/updates: (i) a formal,
          documented, contingency planning policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities,
          management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and (ii)
          formal, documented procedures to facilitate the implementation of the contingency planning
          policy and associated contingency planning controls.
          Supplemental Guidance: The contingency planning policy and procedures are consistent with
          applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. The
          contingency planning policy can be included as part of the general information security policy for
          the organization. Contingency planning procedures can be developed for the security program in
          general, and for a particular information system, when required. NIST Special Publication 800-34
          provides guidance on contingency planning. NIST Special Publication 800-12 provides guidance
          on security policies and procedures.
          Control Enhancements: None.

CP-2      CONTINGENCY PLAN

          Control: The organization develops and implements a contingency plan for the information system
          addressing contingency roles, responsibilities, assigned individuals with contact information, and
          activities associated with restoring the system after a disruption or failure. Designated officials
          within the organization review and approve the contingency plan and distribute copies of the plan
          to key contingency personnel.
          Supplemental Guidance: None.
          Control Enhancements:

                responsible for related plans.
