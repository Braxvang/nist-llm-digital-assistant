Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to industry sector income stabilization
information. Industry sector income stabilization processes are generally tolerant of delay. In
most cases, disruption of access to industry sector income stabilization information can be
expected to have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or
individuals.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
industry sector income stabilization information is low.

improving community and social development, social relationships, and social services in the
United States. This includes all activities aimed at locality-specific or nationwide social

D.10.1 Homeownership Promotion Information Type

Homeownership Promotion includes activities devoted to assisting citizens interested in buying
homes and educating the public as to the benefits of homeownership. Note: Activities devoted to
the provision of housing to low-income members of the public are covered under the Housing
Assistance mission. The recommended provisional categorization of the homeownership
promotion information type follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of homeownership
promotion information on the ability of responsible agencies to assist citizens interested in
buying homes and educating the public as to the benefits of homeownership. The consequences
of unauthorized disclosure of most homeownership promotion information would have a limited
adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Exceptions that might have a
potential for more serious consequences are based on privacy information processed in training
and employment systems (e.g., information required by the Privacy Act of 1974 or other statutes
and executive orders to receive special handling to protect the privacy of individuals). The
Privacy Act Information provisional impact levels are documented in the Personal Identity and
Authentication information type. This can result in assignment of a moderate impact level to
such information.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for homeownership promotion information is low.
