       NIST SP 800-90C 3pd (Third Public Draft)                           Recommendation for RBG Constructions
       September 2022

2290           For sub-DRBG2, state_handle = sub-DRBG2_state_handle;
2291       •   requested_number_of_bits must be ≤ 219 (see SP 800-90A for HMAC_DRBG);
2292       •   For sub_DRBG1, security strength must be ≤ 128;
2293       •   For sub_DRBG2, security strength must be ≤ 256;
2294       •   prediction_resistance_request = FALSE (or is omitted); and
2295       •   additional_input is optional.

2296   B.4.    Example of an RBG2(P) or RBG2(NP) Construction
2297   For this example of an RBG2 construction, no conditioning function is used, and only a single
2298   DRBG instantiation will be used (see Figure 22), so a state handle is not needed. Full-entropy
2299   output is not provided by the entropy source, which may be either a physical or non-physical
2300   entropy source.

2303   The targeted security strength is 256 bits, so a DRBG from [SP800-90A] that can support this
2304   security strength must be used; HMAC_DRBG using SHA-256 is used in this example. A
2305   personalization_string may be provided, as recommended in Section 2.4.1. Reseeding and
2306   prediction resistance are supported and will be available on demand.
2307   This example provides the following capabilities:
2308       •   An RBG instantiated at a security strength of 256 bits, and
2309       •   Access to an entropy source to provide prediction resistance.
