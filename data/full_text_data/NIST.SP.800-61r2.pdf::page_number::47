Because eradication and recovery actions are typically OS or application-specific, detailed
recommendations and advice regarding them are outside the scope of this document.

3.4.1    Lessons Learned

One of the most important parts of incident response is also the most often omitted: learning and
improving. Each incident response team should evolve to reflect new threats, improved technology, and
lessons learned. Holding a “lessons learned” meeting with all involved parties after a major incident, and
optionally periodically after lesser incidents as resources permit, can be extremely helpful in improving
security measures and the incident handling process itself. Multiple incidents can be covered in a single
lessons learned meeting. This meeting provides a chance to achieve closure with respect to an incident by
reviewing what occurred, what was done to intervene, and how well intervention worked. The meeting
should be held within several days of the end of the incident. Questions to be answered in the meeting
include:

 Exactly what happened, and at what times?
 How well did staff and management perform in dealing with the incident? Were the documented
  procedures followed? Were they adequate?
 What information was needed sooner?
 Were any steps or actions taken that might have inhibited the recovery?
 What would the staff and management do differently the next time a similar incident occurs?
 How could information sharing with other organizations have been improved?
 What corrective actions can prevent similar incidents in the future?
 What precursors or indicators should be watched for in the future to detect similar incidents?
