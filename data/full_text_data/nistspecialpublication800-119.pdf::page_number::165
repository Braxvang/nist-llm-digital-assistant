                                                                 GUIDELINES FOR THE SECURE DEPLOYMENT OF IPV6


phase, individual jobs should be evaluated, and training material should be developed or identified. IPv6
skills are not ready available in the job candidate pool, and organizations should expect to increase
training budgets for IPv6 training for existing staff and new hires.

Proving the connectivity and interoperability of the enterprise architecture is a key factor in the success of
the IPv6 transition. To ensure a successful transition, organizations must develop measures and test
procedures for key services, applications, and capabilities. These measures and procedures collectively
are the test plan. After a service, application, or capability is migrated, the test plan validates that the
IPv6 equivalent provides service equal to or better than the IPv4 service.

At the conclusion of the acquisition and development phase, an organization should have produced the
following artifacts:

        Enterprise Architecture
        Address Allocation Plan
        Address Management Plan
        Routing Plan
        Training Plan
        Security Plan
        Coexistence Plan.
The first design decision is to determine the organization’s IPv6 address allocation. The size of the
address space required to support the deployment depends on the number of devices and how many
networks those devices require.

At this point, the organization should request an IPv6 address allocation from their regional internet
registrar (RIR).

The organization also needs to create an address management plan. The address management plan
documents the following:

        How devices allocate an address (for example, clients could use autoconfiguration or
         DHCPv6)
        Which nodes will have fixed IP addresses.
        How to update DNS with address ranges.
The training plan documents the training requirements across the organization as related to the IPv6
deployment. Typically, core engineers, help desk support, application developers, the security team, and
system administrators will need training. The training plan includes both the types of training and length
of training required. Training should allow IT operations to support IPv6 in production along with their
current job specifications. Poor security practices, misconfiguration, and operator error are some of the
leading causes of system compromise and loss of availability. Increasing staff knowledge about security
and the computing environment will increase security and availability.

The goal of the security plan is to ensure that the IPv6 environment has the same level of security or
better than the existing IPv4 environment. It should document how an organization plans to maintain
