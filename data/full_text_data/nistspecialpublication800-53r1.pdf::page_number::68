________________________________________________________________________________________________

AC-14     PERMITTED ACTIONS WITHOUT IDENTIFICATION OR AUTHENTICATION

          Control: The organization identifies and documents specific user actions that can be performed on
          the information system without identification or authentication.
          Supplemental Guidance: The organization allows limited user activity without identification and
          authentication for public websites or other publicly available information systems (e.g.,
          individuals accessing a federal information system at http://www.firstgov.gov). Related security
          control: IA-2.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization permits actions to be performed without identification and authentication only to
                the extent necessary to accomplish mission objectives.


           LOW AC-14                     MOD AC-14 (1)               HIGH AC-14 (1)



AC-15     AUTOMATED MARKING

          Control: The information system marks output using standard naming conventions to identify any
          special dissemination, handling, or distribution instructions.
          Supplemental Guidance: Automated marking refers to markings employed on external media (e.g.,
          hardcopy documents output from the information system). The markings used in external marking
          are distinguished from the labels used on internal data structures described in AC-16.
          Control Enhancements: None.


           LOW Not Selected              MOD Not Selected            HIGH AC-15



AC-16     AUTOMATED LABELING

          Control: The information system appropriately labels information in storage, in process, and in
          transmission.
          Supplemental Guidance: Automated labeling refers to labels employed on internal data structures
          (e.g., records, files) within the information system. Information labeling is accomplished in
          accordance with: (i) access control requirements; (ii) special dissemination, handling, or
          distribution instructions; or (iii) as otherwise required to enforce information system security
          policy.
          Control Enhancements: None.


           LOW Not Selected              MOD Not Selected            HIGH Not Selected
