ESTABLISHING WIRELESS ROBUST SECURITY NETWORKS: A GUIDE TO IEEE 802.11I



      Phase 4: Operations/Maintenance. This phase includes security-related tasks that an
       organization should perform on an ongoing basis once the WLAN is operational, including log
       review and rogue AP detection.
      Phase 5: Disposition. This phase encompasses tasks that occur after a system or its components
       have been retired, including preserving information to meet legal requirements, sanitizing media,
       and disposing of equipment properly.
The recommendations presented in this section are provided in tables corresponding to the life cycle
phases. Each recommendation is accompanied by a brief explanation of the rationale for its inclusion,
and is rated as “best practice” or “should consider”. Organizations are strongly encouraged to adopt the
“best practice” recommendations. Failure to implement them significantly increases the risk of a WLAN
security failure. Organizations should also examine each of the “should consider” recommendations to
determine their applicability to the target environment. In general, “should consider” recommendations
enhance security beyond what can be achieved through the “best practice” recommendations. A “should
consider” recommendation should be rejected only if it is infeasible or the reduction in risk from its
implementation does not justify its cost.

Organizations should develop their WLAN security controls based not only on the recommendations in
the tables, but also using other guidance on security controls. FIPS Publication (PUB) 199 establishes
three security categories—low, moderate, and high—based on the potential impact of a security breach
involving a particular system. 97 NIST SP 800-53 provides recommendations for minimum management,
operational, and technical security controls for information systems based on the FIPS PUB 199 impact
categories. 98 The recommendations in NIST SP 800-53 should be helpful to organizations in identifying
controls that are needed to protect networks and systems, which should be used in addition to the specific
recommendations for WLANs listed in this document.

Some large organizations divide their IT duties among various teams. For example, one group may be
responsible for desktop and laptop support, while another might focus on the network infrastructure. In
these organizations, implementation of a WLAN may require participation from multiple IT support
teams. To assist with this division of labor, the tables identify the impacted WLAN components (i.e.,
STA, AP, AS, DS) for each of the listed recommendations. When the DS is listed, it refers to the
switches, routers, and network media of the organization’s enterprise network behind each AP. In most
cases, these are part of a wired network.

The tables can also serve as checklists; the status column on the right is blank so that IT staff can use it to
measure progress toward implementation of the recommendations.
