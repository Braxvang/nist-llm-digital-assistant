Appendix A : Actual Second Preimage Resistance Strengths of
Approved Hash functions
In an application, if the size of the messages is small, then the second preimage resistance
strengths of the hash functions are practically the same as their preimage resistance
strengths described in Section 4.2.
The actual second preimage resistance strength for SHA-1, SHA -224, SHA-256 and
SHA-512 is approximately (L – M), where L is the output block size of the hash function,
and the message is 2M input blocks in length.
For example, if a message that is 233 bits in length (i.e., a gigabyte long) is hashed by
SHA-256 (whose input block size is 29 bits), the second preimage resistance strength is
(L – M) = (256 – 24) = 232 bits (where L = 256, and M = log2(233/29) = (33 – 9) = 24).
That is, the amount of work required to find a second preimage is 2232.
It is important to note that the amount of work is based on the number of compression
function executions (compressing single message blocks), not on the number of hash
function executions (hashing messages of more than one block in length).
The actual second preimage resistance strength of SHA-1, SHA -224, SHA-256 and
SHA-512 varies, depending on the maximum size of the messages in the application
using the hash function.
The second preimage resistance of SHA-384, SHA-512/224 or SHA-512/256 does not
depend on the message length because the attack described in [Second Preimage Attack]
would actually require more work than a brute-force approach, which will break the
second preimage resistance of SHA-384, SHA-512/224 or SHA-512/256 with work of
384, 224, or 256 bits, respectively.
For any truncated message digest of λ bits, the actual second preimage resistance strength
of SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, and SHA-512 is the minimum of (L – M) and λ, where λ
≤ 160 for SHA-1, λ ≤ 224 for SHA-224, λ ≤ 256 for SHA-256, and λ ≤ 512 for SHA-512.
The actual second preimage resistance strengths of SHA-384, SHA-512/224 and SHA-
512/256 is λ (where λ ≤ 384 for SHA-384, λ ≤ 224 for SHA-512/224, and λ ≤ 256 for
SHA-512/256).
