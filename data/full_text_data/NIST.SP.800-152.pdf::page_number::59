6.4.6 Suspend and Re-Activate a Key
A key may be temporarily suspended and later re-activated, i.e., suspension is a temporary
revocation of the key. While revocation is generally irreversible, suspension can be reversed.
Entities that may be using or relying on a key must be notified of both the suspension and the
re-activation of the key.

Situations that may warrant suspension of a key, rather than irreversible revocation, include:
the unavailability of the owner for an extended period of time, a misuse of the key, a possible
compromise that is under investigation, and the misplacement of a token containing the key.

FR:6.29 The CKMS design shall specify how, and under what circumstances, a key can be
suspended.

FR:6.30 The CKMS design shall specify how suspension information is made available to
the relying or communicating parties.

FR:6.31 The CKMS design shall specify how, and under what circumstances, a suspended
key is re-activated.

FR:6.32 The CKMS design shall specify how the suspended key is prevented from
performing security services.

FR:6.33 The CKMS design shall specify how re-activation information is made available to
the relying or communicating parties.

                          When a key is suspended, a Federal CKMS shall provide a
PR:6.28
                          notification to all relying parties, including the reason for the
                          suspension.
                          When a key is re-activated after a suspension, a Federal
PR:6.29
                          CKMS shall provide a notification to all relying parties.


                          A Federal CKMS could be capable of suspending and

6.4.7 Renew a Public Key Certificate
Public key certificates contain the public key of an asymmetric key pair and a validity period
for that certificate. Renewal establishes a new validity period by issuing a new certificate
containing the same public key, but a new validity period.

The public key in a certificate corresponds to a private key (which is kept secret). One key of
the key pair is used to apply cryptographic protection (e.g., to generate a digital signature),
and the other key is used to process the protected information (e.g., to verify a digital
signature). Each key of the key pair has its own cryptoperiod. The cryptoperiod of a key used
to apply protection can be considered as being the "originator usage period," and the
cryptoperiod of a key used to process the protected information can be considered to be the
