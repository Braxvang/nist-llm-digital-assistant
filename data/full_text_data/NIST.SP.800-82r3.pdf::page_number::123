             Card+PIN+Biometric), depending on the risk level of the protected
             resource. If the Federal PIV is used as an identification token, the access
             control system should conform to the requirements of FIPS 201
             [FIPS201] and NIST SP 800-73-4 [SP800-73-4] and employ either
             cryptographic verification or biometric verification.

6.2.1.4.4.      Multi-Factor Authentication
There are several possible factors for determining the authenticity of a person, device, or system,
including something you know (e.g., PIN number or password), something you have (e.g., key,
dongle, smart card), and something you are (i.e., a biological characteristic, such as a fingerprint
or retinal signature). When two or more factors are used, the process is known as multi-factor
authentication (MFA). In general, the more factors that are used in the authentication process, the
more robust the process.
             OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
             Organizations need to consider whether MFA is required for protecting
             OT environments in whole or in part. MFA is an accepted best practice
             for remote access to OT applications. When determining the placement
             and usage of MFA within an OT environment, organizations may need to
             consider different authentication scenarios since some OT components
             support only a single factor or no authentication. Organizations may
             consider adjusting credential requirements based on the type of access or
             other mitigating factors for the environment. For example, remote access
             to the OT environment may require MFA, while local access may only
             require a user ID and password due to other mitigating factors, such as
             physical access controls before gaining physical access to the area where
             the user ID and password may be used.

6.2.1.4.5.      Password Authentication
While password authentication schemes are arguably the most common and simplest form of
authentication, numerous vulnerabilities are associated with the use of and reliance on password-
only authentication. For example, systems are often delivered with default passwords that can be
easily guessed, discovered, or researched. Another weakness is the ease of third-party
eavesdropping. Passwords typed at a keyboard can be visually observed by others or recorded
using keystroke loggers.
Some network services and protocols transmit passwords as plaintext (unencrypted), allowing
any network capture tool to expose the passwords. Additionally, passwords may be shared and
not changed frequently. The use of shared credentials, including shared passwords, limits the
ability to positively identify the individual person, process, or device that accessed a protected
resource. Defense in depth is often utilized to prevent password authentication from being the
only control in place to prevent unauthorized modification.
