       NIST SP 800-90C 3pd (Third Public Draft)                    Recommendation for RBG Constructions
       September 2022

1936       •   For an RBG2 construction (including a directly accessible DRBG within an RBG3
1937           construction), a statement indicating whether prediction resistance is always provided
1938           when a request is made by a consuming application, only provided when requested, or
1939           never provided.
1940       •   For an RBG3 construction, a statement indicating whether the DRBG can be accessed
1941           directly.
1942       •   Documentation specifying the guidance to users about fulfilling the non-testable
1943           requirements for RBG1 constructions, RBG2 constructions, and sub-DRBGs, as
1944           appropriate (see Sections 5.4 and 6.3, respectively).
