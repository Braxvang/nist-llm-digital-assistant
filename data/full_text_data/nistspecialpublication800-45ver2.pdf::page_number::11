                                                                       GUIDELINES ON ELECTRONIC MAIL SECURITY



Organizations should implement appropriate security management practices and controls when
maintaining and operating a secure mail server.

Appropriate management practices are essential to operating and maintaining a secure mail server.
Security practices entail the identification of an organization’s information system assets and the
development, documentation, and implementation of policies, standards, procedures, and guidelines that
help to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information system resources.

To ensure the security of a mail server and the supporting network infrastructure, the following practices
should be implemented:

 Organization-wide information system security policy
 Configuration/change control and management
 Risk assessment and management
 Standardized software configurations that satisfy the information system security policy
 Security awareness and training
 Contingency, continuity of operations, and disaster recovery planning
 Certification and accreditation.
Organizations should ensure that the mail server operating system is deployed, configured, and
managed to meet the security requirements of the organization.

The first step in securing a mail server is securing the underlying operating system. Most commonly
available mail servers operate on a general-purpose operating system. Many security issues can be
avoided if the operating systems underlying mail servers are configured appropriately. Default hardware
and software configurations are typically set by manufacturers to emphasize features, functions, and ease
of use at the expense of security. Because manufacturers are not aware of each organization’s security
needs, each mail server administrator must configure new servers to reflect their organization’s security
requirements and reconfigure them as those requirements change. Using security configuration guides or
checklists can assist administrators in securing systems consistently and efficiently. Securing an
operating system would generally include the following steps:

 Patching and updating the operating system
 Removing or disabling unnecessary services and applications
 Configuring operating system user authentication
 Configuring resource controls
 Installing and configuring additional security controls, if needed
 Performing security tests on the operating system.
Organizations should ensure that the mail server application is deployed, configured, and managed
to meet the security requirements of the organization.

In many respects, the secure installation and configuration of the mail server application mirrors the
operating system process discussed above. The overarching principle, as before, is to install the minimal
