Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Where more sensitive information is
involved, it will probably be personal information subject to the Privacy Act of 1974 or
information that is proprietary to a corporation or other organization. Such information will often
be assigned a moderate confidentiality impact level. The Privacy Act Information provisional
impact levels are documented in the Personal Identity and Authentication information type.
Additionally, there are legislative mandates prohibiting unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets.
Trade secrets will generally be assigned a moderate confidentiality impact level.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for corrective action information is low.
Integrity
The consequences of undetected unauthorized modification or destruction of corrective action
information can conceivably compromise the effectiveness of compliance enforcement actions
(e.g., by providing violators with a basis for claiming investigative or enforcement irregularities,
thus supporting legal challenges to proposed corrective actions). The integrity impact level is
based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission, not on the time required to
detect the modification or destruction of information. Unauthorized modification or destruction
of most corrective action information should have only a limited adverse effect on agency
operations, assets, or individuals.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
corrective action information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the corrective action information. The
availability impact is also dependent on whether the data is time-critical. In most cases,
disruption of access to corrective action information can be expected to have only a limited
adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
corrective action information is low.
C.2.1.2 Program Evaluation Information Type

Program Evaluation involves the analysis of internal and external program effectiveness and the
determination of corrective actions as appropriate. The impact levels should be commensurate
with the impact levels of the program that is being evaluated. For example, if the program
contains very sensitive financial data with moderate impact levels for confidentiality and
integrity, the program evaluation impact levels for confidentiality and integrity should also be
moderate. The recommended security categorization for the program evaluation information type
is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}
