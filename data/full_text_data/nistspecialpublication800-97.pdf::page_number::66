After the seven-step authentication process has been completed, the AAA key is installed in the STA and
the AS. As discussed in Section 4.2.1, the AAA key serves as a root key to enable the generation of other
keys used to secure communications between the STA and the AP. The AAA key for this particular STA
is the foundation of security, and its compromise would be devastating to the overall security of the
system. The IEEE 802.11 standard does not describe specifically how the MSK is delivered to the AS
and STA; it relies on EAP to handle this. RFC 3580, “IEEE 802.1X Remote Authentication Dial In User
Service (RADIUS) Usage Guidelines,” specifies the method for MSK delivery. Although the IEEE
standard does not prescribe a method for secure MSK delivery and installation, it does indicate the
importance of the connection between the AS and AP.

5.4.2   Authentication with the PSK

Typically, the authentication phase provides mutual authentication of a STA and an AS in an RSNA and
delivers the Master Session Key to the AP and, sometimes, to the STA. However, in an RSNA that has
negotiated the PSK AKM during the discovery phase, the authentication phase is not required, because
the shared key has already been distributed and installed in an out-of-band manner that has implicitly
provided authentication. Therefore, when the AKM is PSK, the authentication phase is skipped entirely,
as shown in Figure 5-11. However, the IEEE 802.1X controlled ports are still blocked, preventing users’
traffic from being passed to the DS.
