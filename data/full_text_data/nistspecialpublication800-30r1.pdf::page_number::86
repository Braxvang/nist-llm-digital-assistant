APPENDIX I

RISK DETERMINATION
ASSESSING RISK TO ORGANIZATIONS, INDIVIDUALS, AND THE NATION




T       his appendix provides: (i) a description of potentially useful inputs to the risk
        determination task including considerations for uncertainty of determinations; (ii)
        exemplary assessment scales for assessing the levels of risk; (iii) tables for describing
content (i.e., data inputs) for adversarial and non-adversarial risk determinations; and (iv)
templates for summarizing and documenting the results of the risk determination Task 2-6. The
assessment scales in this appendix can be used as a starting point with appropriate tailoring to
adjust for any organization-specific conditions. Table I-5 (adversarial risk) and Table I-7 (non-
adversarial risk) are outputs from Task 2-6.
