                                                        GUIDE TO SECURITY FOR FULL VIRTUALIZATION TECHNOLOGIES



3.    Virtualization Security Overview

Migrating computing resources to a virtualized environment has little or no effect on most of the
resources’ vulnerabilities and threats. For example, if a service has inherent vulnerabilities and that
service is moved from a non-virtualized server to a virtualized server, the service is still just as vulnerable
to exploitation. However, the use of virtualization may help reduce the impact of such exploitation—but
virtualization may also provide additional attack vectors, thus increasing the likelihood of successful
attacks. Many of the features of virtualization offer both benefits and disadvantages to security.

This section describes these security implications. Section 3.1 discusses the isolation of guest OSs from
each other and the underlying hypervisor and host OS. Section 3.2 explains the purpose of and
mechanisms for guest OS monitoring. Section 3.3 discusses image and snapshot management.

3.1   Guest OS Isolation

The hypervisor is responsible for managing guest OS access to hardware (e.g., CPU, memory, storage).
The hypervisor partitions these resources so that each guest OS can access its own resources but cannot
encroach on the other guest OSs’ resources or any resources not allocated for virtualization use. This
prevents unauthorized access to resources and also helps prevent one guest OS from injecting malware
into another, such as infecting a guest OS’s files or placing malware code into another guest OS’s
memory. Separately, partitioning can also reduce the threat of denial of service conditions caused by
excess resource consumption in other guest OSs on the same hypervisor.

Resources may be partitioned physically or logically. In physical partitioning, the hypervisor assigns
separate physical resources to each guest OS, such as disk partitions, disk drives, and network interface
cards. Logical partitioning may divide resources on a single host or across multiple hosts as in a pool of
resources with the same security impact level categorization, allowing multiple guest OSs to share the
same physical resources, such as processors and RAM, with the hypervisor mediating access to the
resources. Physical partitioning sets hard limits on resources for each guest OS because unused capacity
from one resource may not be accessed by any other guest OS. However, having physical separation for
resources may provide stronger security and improved performance than logical partitioning. Many
virtualization systems can do both physical and logical partitioning. Some organizations have policies
about which application data can physically reside on drives with the data of other applications, and such
policies should take into account physical and logical partitioning in hypervisors.

Having separate partitions for resource is an important part of isolating guest OSs. Isolation also involves
limiting guest OS communications and the access that each guest OS has to the other guest OSs, to the
hypervisor, and to the host OS (if present). Hypervisors can theoretically support a level of logical
isolation nearly equivalent to physical isolation, mediating all communications from each guest OS to
have full control over each guest OS’s actions. Hypervisors can permit interactions between guest OSs as
needed, such as allowing two desktop OSs to share a file system. Hypervisors can also dynamically alter
isolation for each guest OS as needed—for example, enabling and disabling networking at specific times.
Isolation has obvious security benefits, but it can also increase the reliability of a host by preventing
actions in one guest OS from directly affecting another. For example, if one guest OS crashes because of
an application fault or an attack, the other guest OSs on that host are unlikely to be affected. Isolating
each guest OS from the others and restricting what resources they can access and what privileges they
have is also known as sandboxing.

Another motivation for isolating guest OSs from each other and the underlying hypervisor and host OS is
the mitigation of side-channel attacks. These attacks exploit the physical properties of hardware to reveal
information about usage patterns for memory access, CPU use, and other resources. A common goal of
