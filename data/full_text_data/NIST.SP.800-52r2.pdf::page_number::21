3.2.2     Obtaining Revocation Status Information for the Client Certificate

The server shall perform revocation checking of the client certificate when client authentication
is used. Revocation information shall be obtained by the server from one or more of the
following locations:

     1. Certificate Revocation List (CRL) or OCSP [63] response in the server’s local store;
     2. OCSP response from a locally-configured OCSP responder;
     3. OCSP response from the OCSP responder location identified in the OCSP field in the
        Authority Information Access extension in the client certificate; or


15 The recommended elliptic curves now listed in FIPS 186-4 [45] will be moved to SP 800-186. Until SP 800-186 is published,

     the recommended elliptic curves should be taken from FIPS 186-4.
