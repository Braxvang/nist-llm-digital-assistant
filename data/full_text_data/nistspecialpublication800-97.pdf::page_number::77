                                            ESTABLISHING WIRELESS ROBUST SECURITY NETWORKS: A GUIDE TO IEEE 802.11I



6.     Extensible Authentication Protocol

As discussed in Section 4, the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) is used during the authentication
phase of an IEEE 802.11 RSN. It provides the authentication framework for IEEE 802.11 RSNs that use
802.1X port-based access control. EAP was first officially defined in RFC 2284, 57 which was released in
March 1998. It was revised in June 2004 with the release of RFC 3748. 58 The original EAP RFC focuses
primarily on the EAP packet format and message types. The subsequent RFC includes significant new
material on the EAP framework, security considerations, and interaction with other protocols.

The protocol was developed to provide authentication services for Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP), the
primary link-layer protocol for dial-up connections to IP networks. Before EAP, PPP employed the
authentication services of Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) and Challenge-Handshake
Authentication Protocol (CHAP). Increasingly, there was a demand to support additional deployed
authentication methods, such as One Time Passwords or tokens that issue passcodes. Rather than add
new authentication methods to PPP, a protocol was created that could be adapted to new authentication
methods as they became available. EAP is the outcome of that effort. As EAP deployment spread to
other environments, security flaws were discovered. Attempts were made to define generic EAP security
requirements, as well as the security needs applicable to specific environments.

EAP supports a wide variety of authentication methods, also called EAP methods. These methods include
authentication based on passwords, certificates, smart cards, and tokens. EAP methods can also include
combinations of authentication techniques, such as a certificate followed by a password, or the option of
using either a smart card or a token. This flexibility means that EAP can integrate with nearly any
environment to which a WLAN might connect. EAPâ€™s pass-through feature enables an AP to forward
authentication messages to and from a back-end authentication infrastructure consisting of one or a small
number of ASs, which greatly enhances the scalability and performance of the RSN solution. EAP is also
used to enable both peers (supplicant and AS) to agree on the keying material and to distribute the key
material that serves as the basis for nearly all of the RSN security protections. The keying material can be
mutually derived or distributed by the AS. Subsequently, the AS distributes the keying material to the
AP. The keying material is used as (loose) authorization from the AS to AP to signal the AP that the STA
is authorized to gain access to the WLAN. The protocol most commonly used to transport back-end EAP
authentication and key distribution traffic is RADIUS. In this configuration, EAP conversations are
carried within RADIUS packets.

The EAP method or methods deployed in an IEEE 802.11 RSN are critical in determining the security of
the resulting solution. IEEE 802.11 does not specify a particular authentication method for RSNs, which
gives organizations considerable discretion in choosing which authentication method to employ.
However, IEEE 802.11i describes the basic EAP assumptions and requirements that are necessary to
enable the IEEE 802.11i security model to hold up. If an organization chooses a weak authentication
method or implements a strong method improperly, the EAP implementation could seriously weaken the
RSN protections. Moreover, if the EAP implementation is also used to support integrated or single sign-
on in an enterprise, security breaches could compromise other network assets as well.

This section provides guidance to assist organizations in planning their EAP implementations. The
section first discusses common EAP methods and explains how organizations can select EAP methods
appropriate to their environment. The section next examines additional EAP security considerations. The
last part of the section introduces the EAP architectural model and related support requirements.
