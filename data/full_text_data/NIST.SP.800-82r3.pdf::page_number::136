NIST SP 800-82r3                                          Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security

6.2.7. Media Protection (PR.PT-2)
Removable media is protected, and use is restricted in accordance with policy. This includes
labeling media for distribution and handling requirements, as well as storage, transport,
sanitization, destruction, and disposal of the media.
Supplemental guidance can be found in the following documents:
   •   NIST SP 800-88, Rev. 1, Guidelines for Media Sanitation
   •   NIST SP 800-100, Information Security Handbook: A Guide for Managers
   •   NIST SP 800-209, Security Guidelines for Storage Infrastructure
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Processes and procedures for the handling of media assets should be
            developed and followed. Media assets include removable media and
            devices, such as floppy disks, CDs, DVDs, SD cards, and USB memory
            sticks, as well as printed reports and documents. Physical security
            controls should address specific requirements for the safe and secure
            maintenance of these assets and provide guidance for transporting,
            handling, and erasing or destroying these assets. Security requirements
            could include safe storage from loss, fire, theft, unintentional
            distribution, or environmental damage.
            OT devices should be protected against the misuse of media. The use of
            any unauthorized removable media or device on any node that is part of
            or connected to the OT should not be permitted. Solutions could be
            either procedural or technical to prevent the introduction of malware or
            the inadvertent loss or theft of data.
            Physically protecting media or encrypting the data on media is critical to
            protecting the OT environment. Gaining access to media that contains
            OT data could provide a malicious actor with valuable information for
            launching an attack.

6.2.8. Personnel Security
Cybersecurity should be included in human resources practices to reduce the risk of human error,
theft, fraud, or other intentional or unintentional misuse of information systems.
Supplemental guidance for the Personnel Security controls can be found in the following
documents:
   •   NIST SP 800-35, Guide to Information Technology Security Services
   •   NIST SP 800-73-4, Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification
   •   NIST SP 800-76-2, Biometric Specifications for Personal Identity Verification
   •   NIST SP 800-100, Information Security Handbook: A Guide for Managers
