NIST SP 800-85A-4                                               PIV CARD APPLICATION & MIDDLEWARE
                                                                         INTERFACE TEST GUIDELINES

Required Vendor Information

VE05.14.01: The vendor shall state in its documentation that the card supports the assertion made in
AS05.14.

Required Test Procedures

TE05.14.01: The tester shall review the vendorâ€™s documentation and validate that it contains the
information required in VE05.14.01.

AS05.15: Key reference '80' shall be able to be verified by the PIV Card Application VERIFY
command.

Note: This assertion is tested as part of AS05.13.

AS05.16: If the PIV Card Application contains the Discovery Object as described in Part 1 of
SP 800-73-4 and Bit 6 of the first byte of the PIN Usage Policy value is one, then key reference
'00' shall be able to be verified by the PIV Card Application VERIFY command.

Required Vendor Information

VE05.16.01: The vendor shall specify in its documentation if the Global PIN is implemented with
the VERIFY command to satisfy access control rules to read PIN protected PIV data objects. If
implemented, the vendor shall also specify the Discovery Object to be present on card with Bit 6 of
the first byte of the PIN Usage Policy value set to one.

Required Test Procedures

TE05.16.01: The tester shall validate that if the PIV Card Application contains the Discovery Object
and Bit 6 of the first byte of the PIN Usage Policy value is one, then key reference '00' is able to be
verified by the PIV Card Application VERIFY command.

AS05.16A-R4: If the key reference is '98' and the authentication data in the command data
field does not match the reference data associated with the key reference, the command shall
fail and the PIV Card Application shall return the status word '63 00'. If the authentication
data in the command data field does not satisfy the criteria in Section 2.4.3 of Part 2 of SP 800-
73-4, then the PIV Card Application may return the status word '6A 80' instead of '63 00'. If
status word '6A 80' is returned, the security status of the key reference shall remain
unchanged. If status word '63 00' is returned, the security status of the key reference shall be
set to FALSE.

Required Test Procedures

TE05.16A-R4.01: The tester shall validate that the card implements AS05.16A-R4 as specified.
