compliance with regulations such as FISMA, they can also be used to map specific technical
control settings to the corresponding NIST SP 800-53 security controls, which can make the
verification of compliance more consistent and efficient. For example, a checklist could examine
the password strength settings on a system and report whether or not those settings meet
requirements specified in NIST SP 800-53. The results of such automated data collection could
provide dynamic updates to an agency’s automated information security performance measures
to indicate if information security targets are being achieved and where corrective actions and
mitigation activities are required.

3.5       Information Security Measurement Program Scope

An information security measurement program can be scoped to a variety of environments and
needs:

      •   Quantifying information system-level security performance for an operational
          information system;

      •   Quantifying the integration of information security into the system development life
          cycle (SDLC) during information system and software development processes; and

      •   Quantifying enterprise-wide information security performance.

Information security measures can be applied to organizational units, sites, or other
organizational constructs. Organizations should carefully define the scope of their information
security measurement program based on specific stakeholder needs, strategic goals and
objectives, operating environments, risk priorities, and information security program maturity.

3.5.1     Individual Information Systems

Information security measurement can be applied at the information system level to provide
quantifiable data regarding the implementation, effectiveness/efficiency, or impact of required or
desired security controls. Information system owners can use measures to support the
determination of the information system’s security posture, demonstrate compliance with
organizational requirements, and identify areas in need of improvement. Information security
measurement can support certification and accreditation activities (e.g. risk assessments,
information system security plans, and continuous monitoring), FISMA reporting activities, or
capital planning activities.

3.5.2     System Development Life Cycle

Information security measurement should be used throughout the SDLC to monitor
implementation of appropriate security controls. Formalized measurement of information
security during the SDLC provides information to the project manager that is essential to
understanding how well information security is integrated into the SDLC and to what degree
vulnerabilities are being introduced into the information system. Different measures may be
