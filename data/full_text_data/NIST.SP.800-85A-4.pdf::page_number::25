NIST SP 800-85A-4                                             PIV CARD APPLICATION & MIDDLEWARE
                                                                       INTERFACE TEST GUIDELINES

6.       Test and Compliance Documentation

There are two sets of compliance documentation: vendor required and test facility generated.
The vendor-required documents consist of the following:
     +    Installation and Execution instructions (for PIV Middleware): The vendor
          provides technical instructions and other documentation to aid the testing personnel in
          installing and using the PIV Middleware implementation under test. The PIV
          Middleware implementation could be in any high-level programming language. Since
          all the implementations have to be tested from a common test program, the PIV
          Middleware vendor submitting the product for testing may have to provide Java
          wrapper programs in some cases to the test facility. The purpose of the wrapper
          program is to translate the test execution calls made using the test program to the PIV
          Middleware implementation’s native program calls.
     +    Technical documentation (for both PIV Card Application and PIV Middleware):
          The vendor-supplied technical documentation must include the detailed technical
          description and the design of the implementation to be tested. This document
          includes, at a minimum, all the required vendor information specified in DTRs in
          Appendix A of this document.
     +    Security-related information: The following security related information shall be
          provided by the vendor: (a) PIV Card Application PIN, (b) PIN Unblocking Key
          (PUK), (c) Global PIN, (d) pairing code, (e) cryptographic algorithms supported by
          the card, (f) minutia data, and (g) the number of unsuccessful attempts using (1)
          wrong PIV Card Application PIN, (2) wrong Global PIN, (3) wrong PUK, (4) and
          wrong minutia data.
The test facility-generated documents are required for performing and reporting the test
process. The following are some of the examples:
     +    Checklists: Checklists provide the tester with a list of actions and requirements to
          complete before the test starts. Information required in the preconditions section of
          the assertions is included in the checklists.
     +    Test logs: A test log is kept for each test run on any component and is used to
          summarize the results of all the tests run.
     +    Test reports: These provide the background (environmental information) for each of
          the test cases as well as summary of outcomes from test runs (from test logs)
          associated with each test case.
A test case is a sequence of command/function invocations that pertain to a given execution
condition for the ‘command/function under test’. For example, if the GET DATA command
is the command/function under test, then the execution condition ‘Invocation of this function
after PIN verification’ will consist of the following sequence of command/function
invocations – SELECT, VERIFY, GET DATA, and collectively constitutes a test case. There
may be many test runs for this test case. The function invocations returning the expected
return codes for a test case in all test runs indicate that the command/function has been
implemented correctly.
