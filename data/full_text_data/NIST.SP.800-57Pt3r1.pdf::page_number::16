2 Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
2.1 Description
A PKI is the most common key management approach for the distribution of public keys.
As described in SP 800-57 Part 1, Recommendation for Key Management, Part 1:
General [SP 800-57 Part 1], public keys are used to establish security services after
obtaining a variety of assurances: assurance of integrity, assurance of domain parameter
validity (where appropriate), assurance of public key validity, and assurance of private
key possession. In most cases, applications must also establish the identity of the user
associated with this key pair. In a PKI, the infrastructure establishes the user’s identity
and the required assurances to provide a strong foundation for security services in PKI-
enabled applications and protocols, including IPsec (Section 3), Transport Layer Security
(Section 4), S/MIME secure e-mail (Section 5) and some versions of Kerberos (Section
6). This section presents basic guidance for PKI-based key management. For broader and
more detailed information on PKI, see [SP 800-32].

Public key certificates bind two names to a public key, the user’s name and the issuer’s
name, using a digital signature generated by the issuer. The user is the party authorized to
use the private key associated with the public key in the certificate. The issuer is a trusted
third party that generates and signs the certificate after verifying: the identity of the user;
the validity of the public key, associated algorithms and any relevant parameters; and the
user’s possession of the corresponding private key. The issuer is known as a Certificate
Authority (CA). In many cases, the CA will delegate responsibility for the verification of
the subject’s identity to a Registration Authority (RA). The certificate is used to distribute
the user’s public key to other interested parties, known as relying parties, since they rely
on the assurances provided by the PKI and the certificate creation process.

CAs generally issue a self-signed certificate called a root certificate (sometimes also
called a trust anchor); this is used by applications and protocols to validate the
certificates issued by a CA. CA certificates play a key role in many protocols and
applications, and are generally kept in what is often called a root certificate store. Much
of the business of properly configuring applications and protocols consists of ensuring
that only appropriate root certificates are loaded into the root certificate store. In
Microsoft Windows operating systems, there are root certificate stores that are
maintained by the operating system for various purposes that are shared by various
Microsoft protocols and applications, and by other applications that may choose to use
them. There is a similar “Keychain” facility in the Apple operating systems. Some
applications, intended to be portable between operating systems, can maintain their own
root certificate stores and also have a feature that allows them to share a root certificate
store with other applications.6

 The various Mozilla browsers and e-mail clients, and the Apache web servers are examples. Microsoft
Internet Explorer, Outlook and Internet Information Server all use the Windows root certificate store;
Apple Safari and Mail use the Keychain; and Mozilla Firefox, Thunderbird and SeaMonkey all have their
own root certificate stores, and they also can share a root certificate store from Mozilla’s Network Security
Services (NSS) utility.
