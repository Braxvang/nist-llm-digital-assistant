                                                                                                   (SoC). This is the processing unit on which the primary operating system (and/or

                                                                                                   Whether discrete or integrated as part of an SoC, most modern client and server platforms
                                                                                                   have at least one NIC (wired or wireless), and could have multiple, including multiple

                                                                                                   platform, in today’s connected world it’s important to have some form of connectivity at
                                                                                                   some point after a system has booted. More importantly, a compromised NIC firmware
                                                                                                   image could serve as a launch pad for other exploits in the system, be used to exfiltrate
                                                                                                   data, serve as a man-in-the-middle, etc. In addition to firmware run by a microcontroller,
                                                                                                   a NIC may include expansion Read-Only Memory (ROM) firmware which is loaded
                                                                                                   during boot and executed by the host processor. It is critical that a NIC’s expansion
                                                                                                   ROM firmware is also protected. The expansion ROM firmware may be stored with the
                                                                                                   host processor boot firmware (in the case of an integrated NIC), or may be stored
                                                                                                   separately with the NIC itself as in the case of an add-in card. A NIC often also contains
                                                                                                   critical data, for example a Media Access Control (MAC) address may be stored in
                                                                                                   mutable memory. An attack on this critical data could result in a denial of service (DoS)
                                                                                                   both of this platform as well as of another system with a matching MAC address.

                                                                                                   A GPU is a device that serves as the primary ‘output’ human interface device (HID) in
                                                                                                   client platforms. In some cases, GPUs may also be used as coprocessors to support high-
                                                                                                   performance computing. GPUs could serve as a launch pad for other exploits in the
                                                                                                   system. In addition to firmware run by a microcontroller, a GPU may include an
                                                                                                   expansion ROM firmware which is loaded during boot and executed by the host

                                                                                                   firmware (in the case of an integrated GPU), or may be stored separately with the GPU
