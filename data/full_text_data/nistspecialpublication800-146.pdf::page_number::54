                                                            CLOUD COMPUTING SYNOPSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



7.4.1    Full Control of the Computing Resource Through Administrative Access to VMs

Consumer access to IaaS cloud resources is typically performed through standard network protocols that
use cryptography to prevent eavesdropping or tampering by third parties. Access to cloud resources over
the network takes essentially three distinct forms: (1) a consumer issues administrative commands to the
cloud provider, such as requests to run virtual machines or to save data on the cloud’s servers, (2) a
consumer with administrative access to specific running virtual machines (i.e., the consumer who is
currently renting them) issues administrative commands to the virtual machines, such as starting a Web
server on a virtual machine or installing a new application, and (3) any user, and possibly an anonymous
user, with access to the public network interacts with the virtual machines using the network services
running on the virtual machines that a consumer has previously enabled. As an example, for a UNIX-like
virtual machine, the consumer with administrative access typically has an administratively privileged
account that is accessed via a network protocol such as Secure Shell [Ylo06].

7.4.2    Flexible, Efficient Renting of Computing Hardware

Fundamentally, cloud computing provides rental of computing resources. These resources, which are
typically accessed by consumers over a network, must be measurable in units that can be individually
allocated to specific consumers, and paid for based on the length of time a consumer retains a resource.
In the case of an IaaS cloud, the primary units of allocation are (administrative access to) VMs, network
bandwidth, storage, and IP addresses. Additional resources include monitoring services, firewalls,
synchronization mechanisms such as queues, databases, etc. A powerful aspect of having administrative
access to a VM is that a consumer can run almost any software the consumer desires, including a custom
operating system.

In addition to providing the functionality of raw hardware access, public and outsourced IaaS clouds
provide the ability to quickly rent and then release large numbers of VMs or other cloud resources. This
gives a consumer the ability to quickly set up large networks of VMs running consumer-selected software
to solve large problems without incurring the expense of purchasing and maintaining the necessary
hardware.

7.4.3    Portability, Interoperability with Legacy Applications

Because IaaS clouds allow consumers to install and run operating systems of their choosing, a high level
of compatibility can be maintained between legacy applications and workloads in an IaaS cloud. For
example, nearly any conventional network application (e.g., Web server, email server, database) that a
consumer normally runs on consumer-owned server hardware can be run from VMs in an IaaS cloud.
Furthermore, many user-facing applications can also be run in an IaaS cloud by virtual desktop
technology. While many applications can readily be ported to VMs, however, not all applications can be.
For example, applications that require specialized hardware support are not ideal candidates for porting.

7.5     Issues and Concerns

As with PaaS and SaaS clouds discussed in Section 5, IaaS clouds depend on a secure and reliable
network, and also often depend on a secure and reliable browser for account administration.

 Network Dependence (5.4.2), and
 Browser-based Risks and Risk Remediation (5.4.1).
In addition, several issues are specific to IaaS clouds.
