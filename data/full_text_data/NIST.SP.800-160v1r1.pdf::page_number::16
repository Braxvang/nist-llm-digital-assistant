                             CRITICAL SYSTEM BEHAVIORS OF THE FUTURE
        “To deliver system behavior, the systems engineer must define a group of subsystems
        and precisely how those subsystems are to interact with each other. It is the subsystems
        and their interactions which produce the system-level behavior. Many of us recognize a
        vehicle that can take a 60-degree curve at 200 miles per hour as possessing a valuable
        system behavior. Would we as quickly recognize safe, private, trusted, and available as
        system behaviors? These behaviors require the same careful system-level design and
        trades to achieve optimal solutions as the performance system behavior I mentioned
        above. And there is a clear need — investors want the system to keep their data private,
        to be safe, and to be trustworthy so that their control is not compromised by a cyber
        threat, and to be highly available.
        If we systems engineers are willing to recognize these behaviors as system behaviors,
        then we are accountable for delivering them as part of our job. If we choose to view
        these behaviors as attributes of the parts of our system but not the system as a whole,
        then we are likely to consider them as jobs for the “specialty engineers.” I’ve looked
        back into past behaviors of our system engineering community. What I find are
        examples of systems engineers giving our ‘specialty engineering’ colleagues these
        challenges by way of the requirements-allocation process. I think we have been wrong
        to do this. Our “specialty” colleagues are likely to take these allocated requirements and
        focus on building safe, private, trusted, available parts of a system—rather than in
        delivering safe, private, trusted, and available system behaviors. It is true you can build
        a safer system by building safe parts. However, you can’t build a truly safe system
        without having safe parts interacting with each other in a safe manner. The same can
        be said for other system behaviors (private, trusted, available, and so on).”
