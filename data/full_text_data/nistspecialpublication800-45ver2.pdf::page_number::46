GUIDELINES ON ELECTRONIC MAIL SECURITY



they may increase the risks to the server. Whether the risks outweigh the benefits is a decision for each
organization to make.

If Web-based mail access is to be provided, the Web server running the mail application should be on a
separate host from the mail server. Having the Web and mail servers on separate hosts limits the impact
if one of them is compromised when compared with having both servers on the same host. The benefits
of the latter arrangement are efficient and protected communications, because the Web and mail servers
communicate directly within a host instead of over a network.

5.1.3   Configure Operating System User Authentication

For mail servers, the authorized users who can configure the operating system are limited to a small
number of designated mail server administrators. The users who can access the mail server, however,
may range from unrestricted to restricted subsets of the organization’s employees. To enforce policy
restrictions, if required, the mail server administrator must configure the operating system to authenticate
a prospective user by requiring proof that the user is authorized for such access.

Enabling authentication by the host computer involves configuring parts of the operating system,
firmware, and applications, such as the software that implements a network service. In special cases, for
high-value/high-risk sites, organizations may also use authentication hardware, such as tokens or one-time
password devices. Use of authentication mechanisms where authentication information is reusable (e.g.,
passwords) and transmitted in the clear over a network is strongly discouraged, because the information
can be intercepted and used by an attacker to masquerade as an authorized user.

To ensure the appropriate user authentication is in place, take the following steps [Alle00]:

 Remove or disable unneeded default accounts and groups. The default configuration of the
  operating system often includes guest accounts (with and without passwords), administrator or root
  level accounts, and accounts associated with local and network services. The names and passwords
  for those accounts are well known. Remove or disable unnecessary accounts to eliminate their use by
  attackers, including guest accounts on computers containing sensitive information. If there is a
  requirement to retain a guest account or group, severely restrict its access and change the default
  password in accordance with the organizational password policy. For default accounts that need to be
  retained, change the names (where possible and particularly for administrator or root level accounts)
  and passwords to be consistent with the organizational password policy. Default account names and
  passwords are commonly known in the attacker community.
 Disable non-interactive accounts. Disable accounts (and the associated passwords) that need to
  exist but do not require an interactive login. For Unix systems, disable the login shell or provide a
  login shell with NULL functionality (e.g., /bin/false).
 Create the user groups. Assign users to the appropriate groups. Then assign rights to the groups, as
  documented in the deployment plan. This approach is preferable to assigning rights to individual
  users because the latter becomes unwieldy with large numbers of users.
 Create the user accounts. The deployment plan identifies who will be authorized to use each
  computer and its services. Create only the necessary accounts. Permit the use of shared accounts
  only when no viable alternatives exist.
 Check the organization’s password policy. Set account passwords appropriately. This policy
  should address the following areas:
