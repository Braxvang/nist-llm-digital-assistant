are related. Thus, to obtain "good" information in each of these areas, the process of course
development should include the development of an evaluation plan. The remainder of this
section provides guidance in the development of an evaluation plan.


5.3.1     Behavioral Objectives

The major components of behavioral objectives are: Conditions of Activity, Activity to be
Performed, and Level of Success. There are several "schools" of behavioral objectives among
educational theorists; however, most agree with the three components, described below.


  •   Conditions of Activity


      This is a written description of existing conditions prior to, and in preparation for, the
      learning activity.   A "snowstorm" metaphor is illustrative. For meteorologists to forecast
      the arrival of a snowstorm, certain conditions must exist: e.g., relative humidity at a certain
      level, air temperature, conducive atmospheric conditions.    Similarly, certain conditions must
      be present to forecast training effectiveness. Does the student need a checklist, a set of
      items to manipulate, or an outline of the information? Does the instructor need audiovisual
      equipment, handouts, or a classroom with furniture set up in a specific format? Conditions
      of the learning activity, including computer-based training (CBT), not just "platform"
      training, must be specific and comprehensive.     Keep in mind that if just one of the
      conditions for a snowstorm is missing, the storm either will not arrive or its force will be
      diminished. So, too, with learning.


  •   Activity to be Performed


      The evaluation plan must state the activity to be performed in a manner permitting the
      evaluator to actually observe the behavior that the student is to learn   —whether observable
      in class (teacher as evaluator) or back on the job (supervisor as evaluator).   It is difficult, if

      not impossible, to measure the process of a student changing an attitude or thinking through
      a task or problem.    The evaluator, however, can measure a written exercise, a skill
      demonstration, a verbal or written pronouncement, or any combination of these outwardly
      demonstrable activities. He/she cannot take the student's word for the learned skill, or the
      simple fact that the student was present and exposed to the skill or information being taught.
      Rather, the evaluator must observe the skill being performed or the information being
      applied. (With CBT, evaluation measurement can be programmed to occur at the
      instructional block level, with subsequent blocks adjusted based on student response.        With
      platform training, adjustments Ccin be made in real time by the instructor based on the nature
      of student questions during the course. Adjustments can also be made between courses in a
        student's training sequence.)
