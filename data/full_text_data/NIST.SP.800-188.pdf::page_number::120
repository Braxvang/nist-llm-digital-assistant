personal data Any information relating to an identifed or identifable natural person (data
     subject). (ISO/TS 25237:2008)
personal identifer Information with the purpose of uniquely identifying a person within
     a given context. (ISO/TS 25237:2008)
personal information See personal data.
personally identifable information (PII) Information that can be used to distinguish or
     trace an individual’s identity, either alone or when combined with other information
     that is linked or linkable to a specifc individual. (A-130)
perturbation-based methods Perturbation-based methods falsify the data before publica-
     tion by introducing an element of error purposely for confdentiality reasons. This
     error can be inserted in the cell values after the table is created, which means the er-
     ror is introduced to the output of the data and will, therefore, be referred to as output
     perturbation, or the error can be inserted in the original data on the microdata level,
     which is the input of the tables one wants to create; the method with then be referred
     to as data perturbation – input perturbation being the better but uncommonly used
     expression. Possible methods are: rounding; random perturbation; [and] disclosure
     control methods for microstatistics applied to macrostatistics. (OECD Glossary of
     Statistical Terms)
privacy Freedom from intrusion into the private life or affairs of an individual when that
     intrusion results from undue or illegal gathering and use of data about that individual.
     (ISO/IEC 2382-8:1998, defnition 08-01-23)
privacy loss A measure of the extent to which a data release may reveal information that
     is specifc to an individual.
privacy loss budget An upper bound on the cumulative total privacy loss for individuals.
privacy risk The likelihood that individuals will experience problems resulting from data
     processing, and the impact should they occur. (NIST Privacy Framework Version
     1.0)
property value Instance of a specifc value together with an identifer for a data dictionary
     entry that defnes a property. (ISO 8000-2:2012(E))
protected health information (PHI) Individually identifable health information: (1) Ex-
     cept as provided in paragraph (2) of this defnition, that is: (i) Transmitted by elec-
     tronic media; (ii) Maintained in electronic media; or (iii) Transmitted or maintained
     in any other form or medium. (2) Protected health information excludes individu-
     ally identifable health information in: (i) Education records covered by the Fam-
     ily Educational Rights and Privacy Act, as amended, 20 USC. 1232g; (ii) Records
     described at 20 USC. 1232g(a)(4)(B)(iv); and (iii) Employment records held by a
