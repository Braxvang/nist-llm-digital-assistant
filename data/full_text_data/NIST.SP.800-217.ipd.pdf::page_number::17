      NIST SP 800-217 ipd                         Guidelines for PIV Federation (Initial Public Draft)

402   the PIV IdP for the account, then the transaction does not meet the requirements of PIV
403   federation, and therefore the definitions and requirements in this document do not apply.
404   A successful PIV federation transaction is, roughly, as follows:
405      1. The subscriber starts in an unauthenticated state at the RP.
406      2. The RP requests a federated login at the IdP.
407      3. The subscriber authenticates to the IdP using a PIV credential (i.e., a PIV Card or
408         derived PIV credential).
409      4. The IdP generates an assertion that represents the subscriber’s PIV identity account
410         to the RP.
411      5. The RP receives the assertion and processes it.
412      6. The RP creates an authenticated session for the subscriber. At the establishment of
413         this session, the subscriber is logged in to the RP.

414   2.1. PIV Identity Account
415   A PIV identity account, as established in [FIPS201], is the digital account of a PIV
416   cardholder, a party also known as the subject or subscriber in [SP800-63]. This account
417   contains a set of identity attributes for the subscriber, bindings to all PIV credentials for
418   the account, metadata about the account’s creation, and identification of the home agency
419   for the account.
420   The PIV identity account is the definitive source of PIV cardholder information in the
421   context of PIV federation transactions, whether this information is communicated directly
422   from that source to an RP (see home IdP in Sec. 2.2.1) or from another entity trusted by
423   an RP to have accurate and timely information aligned with the PIV identity account
424   records (see PIV IdP in Sec. 2.2.2). The strong identity proofing used in establishing this
425   account, along with the processes used to manage the attributes and authenticators bound
426   to this account, provide the foundation for trust in PIV identity assertions.
427   While the systems involved in PIV federation may also manage non-PIV accounts, the use
428   of these accounts is outside the scope of this specification.

429   2.2. Identity Providers
430   As described in [SP800-63C], the IdP is a service of the Credential Service Provider
431   (CSP) that issues and maintains the PIV identity account. In a federation transaction, the
432   IdP acts as the verifier for the authenticator held by the subscriber. In the case of PIV
433   federation, this means that the IdP verifies the PIV credential bound to the PIV identity
434   account, as discussed in Sec. 2.3.
435   The IdP sends a cryptographically verifiable message called an assertion to the RP that
436   identifies the PIV identity account being authenticated. The assertion contains attributes

                                                   7
