The GET DATA card command retrieves the data content of the single data object whose tag is given in
the data field. 5

Command Syntax

             CLA                           '00' or '0C' for secure messaging
             INS                           'CB'
             P1                            '3F'

             Le                            '00'


* The L c value is '05' for all PIV data objects except for the 0x7E interindustry tag (Discovery Object),
which has an L c value of '03', and the 0x7F61 interindustry tag (Biometric Information Templates (BIT)
Group Template), which has an L c value of '04'.

                         Table 6. Data Objects in the Data Field of the GET DATA Card Command

            Name           Tag       M/O                                  Comment
           Tag list        '5C'      M      BER-TLV tag of the data object to be retrieved. See Table 3, Part 1.

5 The GET RESPONSE command is used in conjunction with GET DATA to accomplish the reading of larger PIV data objects.

The GET RESPONSE command is illustrated in Appendix A.4.1 (Command 3).
