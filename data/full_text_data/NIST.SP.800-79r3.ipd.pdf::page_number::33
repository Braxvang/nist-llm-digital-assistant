       NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                   Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
       December 2023                                                                          and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

1004           Taxonomy of Issuer Controls

1005                Introducing Issuer Controls
1006   The assessment of a PCI or DPCI is broader than an assessment of the security of an information
1007   system under [SP800-37]. The requirements specified in [FIPS201] cover all major aspects of an
1008   issuer, including organizational preparedness, security management, data protection,
1009   infrastructure, and issuance processes. In this document, each broad area is defined as an issuer
1010   authorization topic (IAT). IATs are used to summarize the assessment results for reporting and
1011   to structure the report for senior organization management to provide an analysis of the strengths
1012   and weaknesses of an issuer and its level of compliance.
1013   IATs include the following:
1014           •    Organizational preparedness relates to the capability, knowledge, and understanding of
1015                senior management regarding the formation and operation of the issuer. Under this area,
1016                roles and responsibilities are clearly identified, and policies and procedures are defined,
1017                documented, implemented, and enforced.
1018           •    Security management and data protection involves implementing and operating
1019                appropriate security management procedures, operational controls, and technical
1020                protection measures to ensure that privacy requirements are satisfied, the rights of
1021                individuals are assured, and personal data is protected.
1022           •    Infrastructure elements represent the activities required to procure, deploy, and
1023                maintain the information system components used for the issuance of PIV Cards and
1024                derived PIV credentials. These information system components (e.g., PKI, card or token
1025                personalization, printers, tokens, etc.) must meet the technical specifications defined in
1026                [FIPS201] and related documents and must be authorized under [SP800-37] for FISMA
1027                compliance.
1028           •    Processes are classes of functions that collectively span the entire life cycle, 9 such as
1029                sponsorship, identity proofing/registration, adjudication, card/token production,
1030                activation/issuance, and maintenance of the PIV Card and derived PIV credential.
1031   Each IAT is subdivided into one or more authorization focus areas. A focus area is a set of
1032   closely related requirements that need to be met by an issuer. Under each focus area, there is a
1033   procedure or technical product (termed an “issuer control”) that is used to satisfy a particular
1034   requirement. However, the manner in which the requirements are satisfied and how the
1035   specifications are implemented and managed may vary from organization to organization. For
1036   example, each PCI is required to identity-proof their applicants. This process can be
1037   implemented in one of several ways, depending on the structure, size, and geographical
1038   distribution of the organization’s headquarters and remote locations. The process could be
1039   conducted at a central location or distributed in regional centers across the country. It could be
1040   operated directly by the organization or by an external service provider. However, irrespective of
1041   the implementation approach, this identity proofing/registration activity needs to be reliably and
1042   accurately performed.

           Some of the processes may not apply to derived PIV credential issuers.
