 Definition    —        The system life cycle is a model for building and operating an IT system
                        from its initial inception to its termination and disposal of assets. The
                        model includes six phases: Initiation, Development, Test and Evaluation,
                        Implementation, Operations, and Termination. Life cycle security is the
                        ensemble of processes and procedures which ensures data confidentiality, as
                        needed, as well as data and system integrity, and availability.


                        The implementation phase is the installation of the system into the
                        operational environment in a manner that does not compromise the integrity
                        and effectiveness of the successfully tested security safeguards.

 Behavioral Outcome          —   Individuals responsible for system design and/or modification are
                                 able to participate in the development of procedures which ensure
                                 that safeguards are not compromised as they are incorporated into
                                 the production environment.
