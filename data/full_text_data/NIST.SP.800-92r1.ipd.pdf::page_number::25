      NIST SP 800-92r1 ipd                                                   Cybersecurity Log Management
      October 2023                                                                          Planning Guide

659      GRC, Document Gaps and Their Root Causes
660   [Tasks]                                                                [Previous Play] [Next Play]
661   Summary: Document the implementation gaps between the current cybersecurity logging state
662   and the target state, and identify the root causes of each gap. The desired outcome is a list of
663   implementation gaps with an assessment of the relative risk posed by each gap and the root
664   causes of each gap.
665   Tasks to perform include the following:
666      1. GRC-1, Scope and Plan the Assessment
667      2. GRC-2, Conduct the Assessment and Document Findings
668   Supporting information for tasks: Root cause analysis should go beyond superficial
669   observations and determine the underlying factors. For example, suppose that one log source is
670   generating a much lower volume of log data than other similar log sources. Assessment indicates
671   that this is primarily due to logging configuration errors. Root cause analysis should not stop
672   there; it should determine why this log source is misconfigured (e.g., poor enforcement of
673   requirements, an approved exception to policy that needs to be reassessed, human error, possible
674   compromise of the log source, lack of log storage space).

675             GRC-1, Scope and Plan the Assessment
676   [Tasks]                                                                [Previous Play] [Next Play]
677   Summary: Scope the gap analysis, and determine how the gap analysis will be performed. The
678   desired outcome is an assessment plan.
679   Tasks to perform include the following (not necessarily in order):
680      1. GRC-1.1: Determine how comprehensive the gap analysis should be. For example, the
681         gap analysis could include all of the most critical systems, all security configuration
682         baselines, and a sampling of non-baselined logging sources that includes representatives
683         of all identified logging use cases.
684      2. GRC-1.2: Plan the assessment (e.g., utilizing automation, conducting interviews,
685         performing manual reviews of certain components).

686             GRC-2, Conduct the Assessment and Document Findings
687   [Tasks]                                                                [Previous Play] [Next Play]
688   Summary: Execute the assessment plan for identifying gaps and their root causes. The desired
689   outcome is a stakeholder-reviewed list of findings.
690   Tasks to perform include the following (not necessarily in order):
691      1. GRC-2.1: Conduct the assessment: document all gaps from the target state, characterize
692         each gap and assess its risk, identify the root causes of each gap, and estimate the relative
693         importance of each root cause in regards to all the gaps and the magnitude of the cost of
694         addressing it.
