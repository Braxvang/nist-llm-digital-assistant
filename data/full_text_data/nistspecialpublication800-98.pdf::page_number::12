GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



 The nature of the information that the RFID system processes or generates. One application may only
  need to have a unique, static identifier value for each tagged object, while another application may
  need to store additional information about each tagged object over time. The sensitivity of the
  information is also an important consideration.
 The physical and technical environment at the time RFID transactions occur. This includes the
  distance between the readers and the tags, and the amount of time in which each transaction must be
  performed.
 The physical and technical environment before and after RFID transactions take place. For example,
  human and environmental threats may pose risks to tagsâ€™ integrity while the tagged objects are in
  storage or in transit. Some applications require the use of tags with sensors that can track
  environmental conditions over time, such as temperature and humidity.
 The economics of the business process and RFID system. The economic factors for RFID systems
  are different than those for traditional IT systems. For example, many RFID tags offer few or no
  security features; selecting tags that incorporate basic security functionality significantly increases the
  cost of tags, especially if encryption features are needed. Also, the operational cost of some basic IT
  security controls, such as setting unique passwords and changing them regularly, may be higher for
  RFID systems because of the logistical challenges in managing security for thousands or millions of
  tags.
For RFID implementations to be successful, organizations should effectively manage their risk.

Like other technologies, RFID technology enables organizations to significantly change their business
processes to increase efficiency and effectiveness. This technology is complex and combines a number of
different computing and communications technologies. Both the changes to business process and the
complexity of the technology generate risk. The major risks associated with RFID systems are as
follows:

 Business process risk. Direct attacks on RFID system components potentially could undermine the
  business processes the RFID system was designed to enable. For example, a warehouse that relies
  solely on RFID to track items in its inventory may not be able to process orders in a timely fashion if
  the RFID system fails.
 Business intelligence risk. An adversary or competitor potentially could gain unauthorized access to
  RFID-generated information and use it to harm the interests of the organization implementing the
  RFID system. For example, an adversary might use an RFID reader to determine whether a shipping
  container holds expensive electronic equipment, and then target the container for theft when it gets a
  positive reading.
 Privacy risk. Personal privacy rights or expectations may be compromised if an RFID system uses
  what is considered personally identifiable information for a purpose other than originally intended or
  understood. As people possess more tagged items and networked RFID readers become ever more
  prevalent, organizations may have the ability to combine and correlate data across applications to
  infer personal identity and location and build personal profiles in ways that increase the privacy risk.
 Externality risk. RFID technology potentially could represent a threat to non-RFID networked or
  collocated systems, assets, and people. For example, an adversary could gain unauthorized access to
  computers on an enterprise network through Internet Protocol (IP) enabled RFID readers if the
  readers are not designed and configured properly.
