A STATISTICAL TEST SUITE FOR RANDOM AND PSEUDORANDOM NUMBER GENERATORS FOR CRYPTOGRAPHIC APPLICATIONS



                 certain test statistics are more difficult to address for short length sequences than their longer
                 length counterparts.

                 Sample Size

                 The issue of sample size is tied to the choice of the significance level. NIST recommends
                 that, for these tests, the user should fix the significance level to be at least 0.001, but no larger
                 than 0.018. A sample size that is disproportional to the significance level may not be suitable.
                 For example, if the significance level (α) is chosen to be 0.001, then it is expected that 1 out
                 of every 1000 sequences will be rejected. If a sample of only 100 sequences is selected, it
                 would be rare to observe a rejection. In this case, the conclusion may be drawn that a
                 generator was producing random sequences, when in all likelihood a sufficiently large
                 enough sample was not used. Thus, the sample should be on the order of the inverse of the
                 significance level (α-1). That is, for a level of 0.001, a sample should have at least 1000
                 sequences. Ideally, many distinct samples should be analyzed.


                 Block Size

                 Block sizes are dependent on the individual statistical test. In the case of Maurer's Universal
                 Statistical test, block sizes range from 1 to 16. However, for each specific block size, a
                 minimum sequence length should be used. If the block size were fixed at 16, a sequence of
                 more than a billion bits would be required. For some users, that may not be feasible.

                 Intuitively, it would seem that the larger the block size, the more information could be gained
                 from the parsing of a sequence, such as in the Approximate Entropy test. However, a block
                 size that is too large should not be selected either, for otherwise the empirical results may be
                 misleading and incorrect because the test statistic is better approximated by a distinct
                 probability distribution. In practice, NIST advises selecting a block size no larger than
                  log 2 n , where n is the sequence length. However, certain exceptions hold, and thus NIST
                 suggests choosing a smaller block size.

                 Template

                 Certain statistical tests are suited for detecting global non-randomness. However, other
                 statistical tests are more apt at assessing local non-randomness, such as tests developed to
                 detect the presence of too many m-bit patterns in a sequence. Still, it makes sense that
                 templates of a block size greater than log 2 n  should not be chosen, since frequency counts
                 will most probably be in the neighborhood of zero, which does not provide any useful
                 information. Thus, appropriate choices must be made.

                 Other Considerations

                 In principle, there are many commonly occurring questions regarding randomness testing.
                 Perhaps the most frequently asked question is, "How many tests should one apply?" In
                 practice, no one can truly answer this question. The belief is that the tests should be
                 independent of each other as much as possible.

    Note that for FIPS 140-2, the significance level has been set to 0.0001 for the power up tests.
