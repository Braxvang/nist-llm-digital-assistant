GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



Failure in any component or subsystem of the RFID system could result in system wide failure. In the
warehouse example, system wide failure might result from many causes, such as loss of the network
connection between the warehouse and the computing facility, a software virus that disables critical
middleware functionality, or a new source of radio interference that prevents readers from accurately
reading tags. If an RFID system is rendered unavailable for any reason, then potential impacts can range
from a deceleration of the business process to the loss of critical business or operational records. If the
system is mission critical, then the consequences could be devastating to the organization’s performance.

Table 4-1 reviews some of the factors that determine the level of business process risk.

 the organization                           is outside these areas, it is less likely to be impacted. For example, a
                                            hospital whose primary mission is patient care could be significantly

Unlike most of the other risks, business process risk can occur as a result of both human action and
natural causes. Moreover, human causes may be intentional or unintentional. For example, a tag might
