   Federal Vulnerability Disclosure Coordination Body
The Federal Coordination Body (FCB) is a group of cooperating government entities that operate
at the federal level to ensure vulnerability disclosure coordination services for all government
agencies and may also provide services to non-government industry sectors (e.g., health care).
Members of the FCB utilize their resources and capabilities to:
   •   Receive source vulnerability reports,
   •   Coordinate and investigate to identify vulnerable systems,
   •   Route findings reports to appropriate entities, and
   •   Produce advisories about vulnerabilities.
The coordination process is summarized here and described in detail in the subsequent sections.
