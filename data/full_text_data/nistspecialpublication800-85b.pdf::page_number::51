Test Scenario             1. Set cardHandle := <<valid card handle>>
                          2. Set OID := <<Card Holder Fingerprints
                              (2.16.840.1.101.3.7.2.96.16)>>
                          3. Call pivGetData w/
                              • (IN) cardHandle
                              • (IN) OID
                              • (OUT) data
                          4. Read and parse the byte array in accordance with BER-TLV
                              format.
Expected Result(s)        1. The size of the byte array does not exceed 4006 bytes.
                          2. All mandatory tags in “Card Holder Fingerprints” table are
                             present.


8.5   “Printed Information” Data Object
Purpose                   Confirms that the “Printed Information” Data Object of the PIV card
                          Application conforms to the PIV data model requirements as per
                          Appendix A of SP80073
Reference(s)              1. SP80073, Appendix A
                          2. TE04.01.01.01
Precondition(s)           1. A valid PIV card is inserted into the contact reader.
                          2. A valid PC/SC connection exists between the test application and the
                             contact reader.
                          3. The test application is currently connected to the card application
                             which is accessible through card handle.
                          4. A valid printed information is stored on the PIV card.
Test Scenario             1. Set cardHandle := <<valid card handle>>
                          2. Set OID := <<Printed Information
                              (2.16.840.1.101.3.7.2.48.1)>>
                          3. Call pivGetData w/
                              • (IN) cardHandle
                              • (IN) OID
                              • (OUT) data
                          4. Read and parse the byte array in accordance with BER-TLV
                             format.
Expected Result(s)        1. The size of the byte array does not exceed 120 bytes.
                          2. All mandatory tags in “Printed Information” table are present.


8.6   “Card Holder Facial Image” Data Object
Purpose                   Confirms that the “Card Holder Facial Image” data object of the PIV
                          card Application conforms to the PIV data model requirements as
                          per Appendix A of SP80073.
