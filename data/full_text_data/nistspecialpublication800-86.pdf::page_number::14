GUIDE TO INTEGRATING FORENSIC TECHNIQUES INTO INCIDENT RESPONSE



in this guide are designed to highlight key principles associated with the handling and examination of
electronic evidence. Because of the constantly changing nature of electronic devices and software, and
forensic procedures and tools, readers are expected to refer to other resources, including those listed in
this guide, for more current and detailed information than that presented in this guide.

1.4     Publication Structure

The remainder of this publication is divided into seven major sections:

      ! Section 2 discusses the need for computer and network forensics and provides guidance on
        establishing and organizing a forensics capability for an organization.
      ! Section 3 explains the basic steps involved in performing computer and network forensics: data
        collection, examination, analysis, and reporting.
      ! Sections 4 through 7 provide details on collecting, examining, and analyzing data from various
        data sources, based on the framework described in Section 3. The data source categories
        discussed in Sections 4 through 7 are data files, OSs, network traffic, and applications,
        respectively.
      ! Section 8 presents case studies that illustrate how analysis can correlate events among several
        data sources.
The publication also contains several appendices with supporting material:

      ! Appendix A presents the major recommendations made in the publication.
      ! Appendix B presents scenarios in which forensics techniques might be useful and asks the reader
        a series of questions regarding each scenario.
      ! Appendices C and D contain a glossary and acronym list, respectively.
      ! Appendix E lists print resources, and Appendix F identifies online tools and resources, that may
        be useful for establishing a forensics capability or understanding forensics tools and techniques.
      ! Appendix G contains an index for the publication.
