                                             GUIDE TO INTEGRATING FORENSIC TECHNIQUES INTO INCIDENT RESPONSE



Appendix Câ€”Glossary

Selected terms used in the Guide to Integrating Forensic Techniques into Incident Response are defined
below.

Analysis: The third phase of the computer and network forensic process, which involves using legally
justifiable methods and techniques, to derive useful information that addresses the questions that were the
impetus for performing the collection and examination.

Anti-Forensic: A technique for concealing or destroying data so that others cannot access it.

Bit Stream Imaging: A bit-for-bit copy of the original media, including free space and slack space.
Also known as disk imaging.

Cluster: A group of contiguous sectors.

Collection: The first phase of the computer and network forensics process, which involves identifying,
labeling, recording, and acquiring data from the possible sources of relevant data, while following
guidelines and procedures that preserve the integrity of the data.

Data: Distinct pieces of digital information that have been formatted in a specific way.

Digital Forensics: The application of science to the identification, collection, examination, and analysis,
of data while preserving the integrity of the information and maintaining a strict chain of custody for the
data.

Directory: Organizational structures that are used to group files together.

Disk Imaging: Generating a bit-for-bit copy of the original media, including free space and slack space.
Also known as a bit stream image.

Disk-to-Disk Copy: Copying the contents of media directly to another media.

Disk-to-File Copy: Copying the contents of media to a single logical data file.

Examination: The second phase of the computer and network forensics process, which involves
forensically processing large amounts of collected data using a combination of automated and manual
methods to assess and extract data of particular interest, while preserving the integrity of the data.

False Negative: Incorrectly classifying malicious activity as benign.

False Positive: Incorrectly classifying benign activity as malicious.

File: A collection of information logically grouped into a single entity and referenced by a unique name,
such as a filename.

File Allocation Unit: A group of contiguous sectors, also known as a cluster.

File Header: Data within a file that contains identifying information about the file and possibly metadata
with information about the file contents.
