                          Reports on Computer Systems Technology

The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical leadership for the
Nation’s measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops tests, test methods, reference data,
proof of concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance the development and productive
use of information technology. ITL’s responsibilities include the development of management,
administrative, technical, and physical standards and guidelines for the cost-effective security and
privacy of other than national security-related information in Federal information systems. The Special
Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research, guidelines, and outreach efforts in information system
security, and its collaborative activities with industry, government, and academic organizations.


                                               Abstract
Federal Information Processing Standard 201-2 (FIPS 201-2) defines requirements for the Personal
Identity Verification (PIV) lifecycle activities including identity proofing, registration, PIV Card
issuance, and PIV Card usage. FIPS 201-2 also defines the structure of an identity credential that
includes cryptographic keys. This document contains the technical specifications needed for the
mandatory and optional cryptographic keys specified in FIPS 201-2 as well as the supporting
infrastructure specified in FIPS 201-2 and the related NIST Special Publication 800-73-4, Interfaces for
Personal Identity Verification [SP800-73], and NIST SP 800-76-2, Biometric Specifications for Personal
Identity Verification [SP800-76], that rely on cryptographic functions.
