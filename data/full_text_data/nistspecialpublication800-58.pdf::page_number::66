       Session Controller, or a Session Border Controller (SBC). SBCs are dedicated
       appliances that offer one or more of the following services to a VOIP perimeter:
       Firewall/NAT traversal, Call Admission Control, Service Level Agreement
       monitoring, support for lawful intercept, and protocol interworking. Third party
       analysis of these solutions is not widely available as of yet, but in the near term,
       the demand for these products is expected to grow.

 7.5   Mechanisms to solve the NAT problem

       Especially for real-time communication protocols like H.323 and SIP, NAT
       causes trouble because these protocols include IP addresses in their messages. For
       integrity protection the NAT device would have to be a trusted intermediate host
       to recalculate the integrity checksum. From an end-to-end security point of view
       this is not recommended. Therefore the following section describes mechanisms
       to handle the NAT problem differently.

       Simple Traversal of UDP through NATs (STUN)

       As defined in RFC 3489, Simple Traversal of User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
       Through Network Address Translators (NATs) (STUN) is a lightweight protocol
       that allows applications to discover the presence and types of NATs and firewalls
       between them and the public Internet. It also provides the ability for applications
       to determine the public Internet Protocol (IP) addresses allocated to them by the
       NAT (address bindings). STUN works with many existing NATs, and requires no
       changes to NATs. STUN does not work with symmetric NAT, because the IP
       address port mapping is dependent on the destination, i.e. The STUN server
       would deliver the IP address port mapping for the connection to the STUN server
       itself, which is different from the mapping for the destination client.

       Traversal Using Relay NAT (TURN)

       The draft for Traversal Using Relay NAT (TURN) was submitted by J.Rosenberg
       (dynamicsoft), R. Mahy (Cisco), C. Huitema (Microsoft) in October 2003 and
       revised July 19, 2004. TURN is a protocol that allows for an element behind a
       NAT or firewall to receive incoming data over TCP or UDP connections to
       complement the limitations of STUN. The connection has to be requested by the
       TURN client, TURN supports the connection of a user behind a NAT to only a
       single peer. The TURN server would act as a data relay, receiving data on the
       address it provides to clients, and forwarding them to the clients. TURN is
       identical in syntax and general operation to STUN, but allocates transport address
       bindings.

       Unlike a STUN server, a TURN server provides resources (bandwidth and ports)
       to clients that connect to it. Therefore, only authorized clients can access the
       TURN server. TURN assumes the existence of a long-lived shared secret between
       the client and the TURN server in order to achieve authentication of the TURN
       requests. The client uses this shared secret to authenticate itself in a Shared Secret
