ately archived and curated so that they can be recovered. In the case of large data releases,
the defnitive version of the released data should be curated using an externally validated
procedure, such as a recorded cryptographic hash value or signature, and a digital object
identifer (DOI) [83].
DRBs may wish to institute a two-step process in which the applicant frst proposes and
receives approval for a specifc de-identifcation process that will be applied to a specifc
dataset and then submits and receives approval for the release of the dataset that has been
de-identifed according to the proposal. However, because it is theoretically impossible
to predict the results of applying an arbitrary process to an arbitrary dataset [31, 159],
the DRB should be empowered to reject a proposed release of a dataset even if it has
been de-identifed in accordance with an approved procedure because performing the de-
identifcation may demonstrate that the procedure was insuffcient to protect privacy. The
DRB should be able to delegate the responsibility of reviewing the de-identifed dataset,
but such responsibility should not be delegated to the individual or group that performed
the de-identifcation.
The DRB charter should specify whether the DRB needs to approve each data release by
the organization or if it may grant blanket approval for all data of a specifc type that are
de-identifed according to a specifc methodology. The charter should specify the duration
of the approval. Given advances in the science and technology of de-identifcation, a Board
should not be empowered to grant release authority for an indefnite or unlimited amount
of time.
In most cases, a single privacy protection methodology will be insuffcient to protect the
varied datasets that an agency may wish to release. That is, different techniques might best
optimize the trade-off between re-identifcation risk and data usability, depending on the
specifcs of each kind of dataset. Nevertheless, the DRB may wish to develop guidance, rec-
ommendations, and training materials regarding specifc de-identifcation techniques that
are to be used. Agencies that standardize on a small number of de-identifcation techniques
will gain familiarity with these techniques and are likely to have results with a higher level
of consistency and success than those that have no such guidance or standardization.
Although it is envisioned that DRBs will work in a cooperative, collaborative, and conge-
nial manner with those inside an agency seeking to release de-identifed data, there will
at times be a disagreement of opinion. For this reason, the DRB’s charter should state
whether the DRB has the fnal say over disclosure matters or if the DRB’s decisions can be
overruled, by whom, and by what procedure. For example, an agency might give the DRB
fnal say over disclosure matters but allow the agency’s leadership to replace members of
the DRB as necessary. Alternatively, the DRB’s rulings may merely be advisory, with all
data releases being individually approved by agency leadership or its delegates.25
25 At the Census Bureau, staff members who are not satisfed with the DRB’s decision may appeal to the Data

 Stewardship Executive Policy Committee (DSEP), which has on several occasions instructed the DRB to
 revise the way that it handles a particular request.
