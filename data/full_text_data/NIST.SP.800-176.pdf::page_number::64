     Most research on AC model or policy verification
techniques are focused on one particular model, and almost
all of the research is in applied methods, which require the
completed AC policies as the input for verification or test
processes to generate fault reports. Even though correct
verification is achieved, and counterexamples may be
generated when faults were found, those methods provide
no information about the source of faults that might allow
conflicts in privilege assignment, leakage of privileges, or
conflict of interest permissions. The difficulty in finding the
source of faults is increased, especially when the AC rules
are intricately covering duplicated variables to a degree of
complexity. The complexity is due to the fact that a fault
might not be caused by one particular rule. Thus, it requires
manually analyzing each rule in the policy in order to find the
correct solution for the fault.
