CHAPTER 4                                                                Awareness and Training


an awareness and training program plan for implementing that strategy has been
completed, and awareness and training material has been developed.
    The program’s implementation must be fully explained to the organization to
achieve support for its implementation and commitment of necessary resources.
This explanation includes expectations of agency management and staff support, as
well as expected results of the program and benefits to the organization. Funding
issues must also be addressed. For example, agency managers must know if the
cost to implement the awareness and training program will be totally funded by the
chief information officer (CIO) or information security program budget, or if their
budgets will be impacted to cover their share of the expense of implementing the
program. It is essential that everyone involved in the implementation of the
program understand their roles and responsibilities. In addition, schedules and
completion requirements must be communicated.
   Once the plan for implementing the awareness and training program has been
explained to (and accepted by) agency management, the implementation can begin.
Since there are several ways to present and disseminate awareness and training
material throughout an organization, agencies should tailor their implementation to
the size, organization, and complexity of their enterprise. 33

4.4 Post-Implementation
    An organization’s information security awareness and training program can
quickly become obsolete if sufficient attention is not paid to technology
advancements, IT infrastructure changes, organizational changes, and shifts in
organizational mission and priorities. CIOs and senior agency information security
officers (SAISOs) need to be cognizant of this potential problem and incorporate
mechanisms into their strategy to ensure that the program continues to be relevant
and compliant with overall objectives. Continuous improvement should always be
the theme for security awareness and training initiatives, as this is one area where
“you can never do enough.” Efforts supporting this post-implementation feedback
loop should be developed in consideration of the security organization’s overall
ongoing performance measures program. 34

4.4.1      Monitoring Compliance
   Once the program has been implemented, processes must be put in place to
monitor compliance and effectiveness. An automated tracking system should be
designed to capture key information on program activity (e.g., courses, dates,
audience, costs, sources). The tracking system should capture this data at an
agency level, so it can be used to provide enterprise-wide analysis and reporting
regarding awareness, training, and education initiatives.
    Tracking compliance involves assessing the status of the program as indicated by
the database information and mapping it to standards established by the agency.
Reports can be generated and used to identify gaps or problems. Corrective action
and necessary follow-up can then be taken. This follow-up may take the form of
formal reminders to management; additional awareness, training, or education
offerings; and/or the establishment of a corrective plan with scheduled completion
dates.
