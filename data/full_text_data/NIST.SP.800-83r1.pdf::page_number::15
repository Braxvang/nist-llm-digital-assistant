                                  GUIDE TO MALWARE INCIDENT PREVENTION AND HANDLING FOR DESKTOPS AND LAPTOPS


          administration tools, which are installed on a host to enable a remote attacker to gain access to the
          host’s functions and data as needed.
       Keystroke Loggers. A keystroke logger monitors and records keyboard use. Some require the
        attacker to retrieve the data from the host, whereas other loggers actively transfer the data to
        another host through email, file transfer, or other means.
       Rootkits. A rootkit is a collection of files that is installed on a host to alter its standard
        functionality in a malicious and stealthy way. A rootkit typically makes many changes to a host to
        hide the rootkit’s existence, making it very difficult to determine that the rootkit is present and to
        identify what the rootkit has changed.
       Web Browser Plug-Ins. A web browser plug-in provides a way for certain types of content to be
        displayed or executed through a web browser. Malicious web browser plug-ins can monitor all
        use of a browser.
       E-Mail Generators. An email generating program can be used to create and send large quantities
        of email, such as malware and spam, to other hosts without the user’s permission or knowledge.
       Attacker Toolkits. Many attackers use toolkits containing several different types of utilities and
        scripts that can be used to probe and attack hosts, such as packet sniffers, port scanners,
        vulnerability scanners, password crackers, and attack programs and scripts.
Because attacker tools can be detected by antivirus software, some people think of them as forms of
malware. However, attacker tools have no infections capability on their own; they rely on malware or
other attack mechanisms to install them onto target hosts. Strictly speaking, attacker tools are not
malware, but because they are so closely tied to malware and often detected and removed using the same
tools, attacker tools will be covered where appropriate throughout this publication.
2.3     The Nature of Today’s Malware

The characteristic of today’s malware that most distinguishes it from previous generations of malware is
its degree of customization. It has become trivial for attackers to create their own malware by acquiring
malware toolkits, such as Zeus, SpyEye, and Poison Ivy, and customizing the malware produced by those
toolkits to meet their individual needs. Many of these toolkits are available for purchase, while others are
open source, and most have user-friendly interfaces that make it simple for unskilled attackers to create
customized, high-capability malware.

Here’s an example of what a malware toolkit can do, illustrated by how the resulting attack works.

1. The toolkit sends spam to users, attempting to trick them into visiting a particular website.

2. Users visit the website, which has malicious content provided by the toolkit.

3. The website infects the users’ computers with Trojan horses (provided by the toolkit) by exploiting
   vulnerabilities in the computers’ operating systems.

4. The Trojan horses install attacker tools, such as keystroke loggers and rootkits (provided by the
   toolkit).

Many attackers further customize their malware by tailoring each instance of malware to a particular
person or small group of people. For example, many attackers harvest information through social
networks, then use that affiliation and relationship information to craft superior social engineering attacks.
