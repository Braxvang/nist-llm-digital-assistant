                                                                                         GUIDE TO SSL VPNS



 Users
 Access
 Policies.
To begin, the administrator needs to configure the addresses of the Ethernet interface on the SSL VPN.
The administrator goes to the Ethernet choice in the System menu and sets the address assigned to the
SSL VPN on the inside of the corporate network. Because this system is configured inside the existing
network, no routing needs to be defined; had this SSL VPN been located outside the firewall or on the
DMZ, the administrator would need to specify routing information.

Using the Add User Group choice of the Users menu, the administrator creates a group called
“NormalUsers”. In this dialog box, the administrator specifies which authentication mechanisms are used
(a password and a physical token) and specifies how the authentication is validated (using the existing
RADIUS server). The administrator specifies that participation in the NormalUsers group for the VPN is
given to people whom the RADIUS server labels as “User”. They use the Add User Group choice to add
a second group, “HROnlyUsers”, but participation in that group is the people the RADIUS server labels
as “HR Users”.

The Access menu allows the administrator to define those resources to which the members of each user
group have access. Using the Add Access Group command, the administrator creates an access group
called “NormalFullAccess” that links “NormalUsers” to all network services, using a network extension
program from the SSL VPN. The network extension’s packet filter is set up to block TCP ports 80 and
443 of the addresses of the Web servers that are controlled by the HR department. The administrator also
selects only display available resources for this access group.

Next, for users accessing the SSL VPN from equipment that is not owned by the organization, the
administrator uses the Add Access Group command to create an access group called
“NormalPartialAccess” that links “NormalUsers” only to TCP port 80 of the addresses for the three Web
servers that have the corporate calendar, the Web mail system, and the employee phone directory, using a
reverse Web proxy, and selects only display available resources. Last, the administrator creates the
“HRAccess” group that links “HROnlyUsers”, using a network extension program from the SSL VPN to
allow access to only TCP ports 80 and 443 of the addresses of the Web servers that are controlled by the
HR department, and selects only display available resources.

The three access lists each have policies associated with them, so the administrator uses the Policy List
command in the Policies menu to create a list of policies. The dialog box starts with an empty list, and
the administrator clicks the Add button to create the first policy. In that dialog box, the administrator
specifies that everyone in the NormalFullAccess group must use the following policies:

 The remote host is managed by the organization.
 The latest version of one or more specific versions of Windows is being used.
 The most current set of patches and security updates has been applied to the operating system.
 An approved antivirus program is running.
 An approved firewall program with an approved configuration is running.
 Split tunneling is not permitted.
 The protocol used must be TLS 1.0 or later.
