are several options to protect the link between a validating recursive resolver and a non-DNSSEC aware
stub resolver (see Section 9.8).

If the enterprise network is considered trusted (using one of the last hop mechanisms listed in Section 9.8
or similar), then the stub resolvers can be considered to be using DNSSEC. However, end users will not
see DNSSEC validation (especially errors), and network administrators should be aware that DNSSEC
validation failures might complicate diagnosis of Internet error messages. DNSSEC validation failures
will be seen by the upstream validator and not the stub resolver that initiated the query. The stub resolver
will only see a generic server failure message, which applications interpret differently. Network
administrators should check validator logs when responding to network errors to rule out DNSSEC
validation failures.


Checklist item 47: Non-validating stub resolvers (both DNSSEC-aware and non-DNSSEC-aware) must
have a trusted link with a validating recursive resolver.

Checklist item 48: Validators should routinely log any validation failures to aid in diagnosing network
errors.


13.1.4 Recommendations for Providing Service to Mobile Hosts

Mobile or nomadic hosts present a particular challenge for network administrators. These systems are
often (or always) accessing the network outside of the trusted enterprise; so nomadic hosts must either
perform their own validation or have a trusted tunnel back to the enterprise with which to send DNS
queries.


Checklist item 49: Mobile or nomadic systems should either perform their own validation or have a
trusted channel back to a trusted validator.



If the mobile (or nomadic) hosts can perform their own validation, then the same policy in place for the
enterprise validators should be applied for the mobile host. That is, the same trust anchors and validation
policy should be set for mobile hosts as for validators on the enterprise networks.


Checklist item 50 : Mobile or nomadic systems that perform its own validation should have the same
DNSSEC policy and trust anchors as validators on the enterprise network.



A mobile hosts that can perform its own validation that frequently migrates between the enterpise
network and external networks may run into the problem that its local validator may not choose the
correct trust anchor for the enterprise zone. In this scenario, the enterprise has an internal and external
network with the same zone name (e.g., “example.com”) but different zone keys (ZSK and/or KSK).
When the mobile host is on the enterprise network, it uses the internal example.com trust anchor to
validate DNS responses for internal services. When accessing external facing services, the internal zone
