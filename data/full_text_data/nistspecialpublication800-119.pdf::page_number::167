                                                                 GUIDELINES FOR THE SECURE DEPLOYMENT OF IPV6


    1. Enabling perimeter firewall IPv6 policies and IPv6 access control lists and configuring devices in
       accordance with security plan, standards, and procedures.
    2. Deploying external IPv6 connectivity with exterior IPv6 routing.
    3. Deploying basic IPv6 services (DNS, DHCPv6, and NTPv6).
    4. Enabling dual protocols on core routers. (This step can be performed at this point or after
       completing Step 5).
    5. For each IPv6 island:
                 a. Enabling IPv6 on hosts.
                 b. Enabling transition mechanism (tunnels) to other IPv6 islands.
    6. Enabling management monitoring (SNMP, service monitoring, IDPS, authentication, statistical
       monitoring, and netflow).
    7. Deploying IPv4 to IPv6 translation mechanisms.
With Step 5 above, the process is iterative until all hosts are either dual stack or IPv6 enabled.

Organizations should have a change control board that enforces the change control process. The security
manager should be a member of the change control board. An IPv6 transition should follow established
change control processes. Once a system is transitioned, it should be accredited and certified using
inspection and acceptance testing. The measures and test procedures developed during the acquisition
and development phase are used to certify that the transition equipment performs in the environment as
intended.

Organizations must validate IPv6 migrated equipment by inspecting the configuration and running test
procedures before transitioning devices to production. Device configurations must comply with
established security and operations standards. Device configuration settings can be validated using either
manual inspection or automated inspection tools. When possible, the use of automated compliance
management solutions will increase the accuracy and consistency of configuration compliance.

Transitioned equipment must integrate and interoperate with other production and migrated equipment
and systems. Integration validates that equipment is able to communicate with other systems and
equipment and correctly exchange data. Checklists should be consulted that list the services with which a
transitioned device must interoperate. Some examples include routing neighbors, DNS, DHCPv6,
NTPv6, SNMP trap servers, syslog servers, mail servers, and application gateways. Integration and
interoperations testing is difficult and usually performed manually.

Transitioned equipment must perform at the levels established in the test plan. Performance testing may
be validated using live traffic or load generators. Failure to comply with test plans could result in a loss
of availability when the equipment is placed into production.

IPv6 migration efforts require the certification and accreditation of systems. The migration to IPv6
(either IPv6 or dual stack) has the potential to significantly change the existing security posture. While
the same security controls required for IPv4 are also required for IPv6, existing controls require
reworking and reconfiguration to support IPv6, and new security controls are required to mitigate new
IPv6 vulnerabilities. Organizations should plan on certifying and accrediting systems that have been
migrated to IPv6 and systems that interact with IPv6 systems. Organizations should evaluate their
certification support tools, techniques and procedures to ensure that these support IPv6. Organizations
