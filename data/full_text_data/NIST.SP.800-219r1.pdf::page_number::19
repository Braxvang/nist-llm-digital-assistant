3.2.2. Rule File Categories
The mSCP organizes YAML files in the rules directory into the following subdirectories, each
of which corresponds to a category of settings:
       •    audit – OpenBSM 3

       •    auth – Smartcard authentication

       •    icloud – Apple’s iCloud/Apple ID service

       •    os – Rules to configure the operating system that do not fit into the other categories

       •    pwpolicy – Password policy

       •    system_settings or sysprefs – Settings controlled within the System Settings or
            System Preferences application
The rules directory also includes a supplemental subdirectory, which contains additional
information that supports the guidance provided by the baselines. Supplemental content contains
information for rules that are not part of an existing baseline but could be beneficial for certain
use cases. Supplemental content may not have mappings and may not contain the YAML rule
file check and fix sections mentioned in Section 3.2.1. Supplemental content can be added to
enhance baselines where organizational requirements are different than the system baseline
requirements.

            Configuration Profiles and Scripts
When an mSCP YAML file is processed, it yields a configuration script and/or configuration
profile (mobileconfig file) as outputs. Both are used to apply configuration settings to a system.
A configuration profile is an Extensible Markup Language (XML) formatted file with a
mobileconfig extension that contains a configuration payload. macOS can automatically
configure itself based on a mobileconfig file’s contents upon execution. Configuration profiles
