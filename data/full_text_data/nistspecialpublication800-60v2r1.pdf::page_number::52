malicious attacks. Even so, in the case of Federal government systems, the case of hostile
attacks on systems must be considered. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of extracts
from contingency plans are likely to have negligible to limited adverse effects on agency
operations. In such cases, the confidentiality impact would be, at most, low. Unauthorized
disclosure of the entire plan to malicious entities may have serious effects. As a result, the
consequence of loss of confidentiality of comprehensive contingency plans is likely to involve
serious harm to government assets, personnel, or missions. In such cases, the confidentiality
impact would be, at least, moderate.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for contingency planning information is moderate.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Errors in
contingency plans that result from integrity compromise can result in serious consequences to
system recovery capabilities. These can range from incorrect telephone numbers and e-mail
addresses on notification lists to erroneous schedules and file designations for database back-ups
and archives or software baselines, updates, and patches.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
contingency planning information is moderate.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the contingency planning information.
The effects of disruption of access to contingency planning information or information systems
depend on the timing of the disruption. If access to contingency planning information is denied
because of a power outage, recovery may be delayed and the work of government agencies
disrupted.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: The contingency planning processes are
usually tolerant of delays. In contrast, the contingency plan implementation process is not
tolerant of delays. The consequences of disruption of access to contingency planning
information depend on both the period of the outage and the criticality of the disrupted processes.
The consequent impact level may range from low to high.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
contingency planning information is moderate.
C.2.4.2 Continuity of Operations Information Type

Continuity of operations involves the activities associated with the identification of critical
systems and processes, and the planning and preparation required to ensure that these systems
and processes will be available in the event of a catastrophic event. The recommended
provisional security categorization for the continuity of operations information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Moderate), (integrity, Moderate), (availability, Moderate)}
