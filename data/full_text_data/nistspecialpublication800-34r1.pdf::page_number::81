5.3       Recovery Declaration

Upon successfully completing testing and validation, the {system owner} will formally declare recovery
efforts complete, and that {system name} is in normal operations. {System name} business and technical
POCs will be notified of the declaration by the ISCP Coordinator.

5.4       Notifications (users)

Upon return to normal system operations, {system name} users will be notified by {role} using
predetermined notification procedures (e.g., email, broadcast message, phone calls, etc.).

5.5       Cleanup

Cleanup is the process of cleaning up or dismantling any temporary recovery locations, restocking
supplies used, returning manuals or other documentation to their original locations, and readying the
system for a possible future contingency event.

Provide any specific cleanup procedures for the system including preferred locations for manuals and
documents and returning backup or installation media to its original location.


5.6       Data Backup

As soon as reasonable following recovery, the system should be fully backed up and a new copy of the
current operational system stored for future recovery efforts. This full backup is then kept with other
system backups. The procedures for conducting a full system backup are:

Provide appropriate procedures for ensuring that a full system backup is conducted within a reasonable
time frame, ideally at the next scheduled backup period.

5.7       Event Documentation

It is important that all recovery events be well-documented, including actions taken and problems
encountered during the recovery and reconstitution effort, and lessons learned for inclusion and update to
this ISCP. It is the responsibility of each ISCP team or person to document their actions during the
recovery and reconstitution effort, and to provide that documentation to the ISCP Coordinator.

Provide details about the types of information each ISCP team member is required to provide or collect
for updating the ISCP with lessons learned. Types of documentation that should be generated and
collected after a contingency activation include:
         Activity logs (including recovery steps performed and by whom, the time the steps were initiated
          and completed, and any problems or concerns encountered while executing activities);
         Functionality and data testing results;
         Lessons learned documentation; and
         After Action Report.

Event documentation procedures should detail responsibilities for development, collection, approval, and
maintenance.
