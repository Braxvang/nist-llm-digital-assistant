           (NEW)       investigations and for PIV Card personalization on separate occasions, a       Data Collection for PIV Card
                       biometric comparison is performed to confirm that the two fingerprints
                       collected for off-card one-to-one comparisons elicit a positive biometric
                       verification decision when compared to the same two fingerprints from the
                       original set of 10 fingerprints.

                       Assessment
                       Determine that:
                          (i) The organization has implemented a solution to perform a biometric
                              comparison to confirm that the fingerprints collected on separate
                              occasions elicit a positive biometric verification decision (review).
                         (ii) The organization performs a biometric comparison to confirm that the
                              fingerprints collected for off-card one-to-one comparison are
                              compared to the same two fingerprints from the original set of 10
                              fingerprints (review, observe).
            CI-17      PIV Card application administration keys meet the algorithm and key size       [FIPS201], Sec. 4.3.2 – Activation
           (NEW)       requirements stated in [SP800-78].                                             by Card Management System

                       Assessment
                       Determine that:
                         (i) The PIV Card application administration keys meet the algorithm and
                             key size requirements stated in Table 5-1 of [SP800-78] (review,
                             test).

            SP-1       A PIV Card is issued to an individual only after a proper authority has        [FIPS201], Sec. 2.1 – Control
                       authorized issuance of the card.                                               Objectives

                       Assessment
                       Determine that:
                          (i) The process for making a request is documented (review).
                         (ii) A request from a valid authority is required to issue a PIV Card
                              (observe).
            SP-2       The issuing facility collects personal information using only the forms        Paperwork Reduction Act [PAPER-
                       approved by OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.                     RED]

                       Assessment
                       Determine that:
