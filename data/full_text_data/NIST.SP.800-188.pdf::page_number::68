      For example, instead of reporting that a person is 84 years old, the person may be
      reported as being 79 years old. Noise addition increases variance in reported statis-
      tics and leads to regression dilution, also known as attenuation bias, in estimated
      regression coeffcients and decreased correlations among attributes [47, 8]. When
      combined with a requirement for the non-negative reporting of attributes, such as
      age or population, noise addition may also introduce systematic bias since more val-
      ues are increased in value than decreased.
These techniques (and others) are described in detail in several publications, including:
    • The Data Protection Toolkit (BETA). A website maintained by the Federal Com-
      mittee on Statistical Methodology for the purpose of promoting data access while
      protecting confdentiality throughout the federal statistical system [40], which can be
      found at https://nces.ed.gov/fcsm/dpt.
    • The Anonymisation Decision-Making Framework (2nd Edition). By Mark El-
      liot, Elaine MacKey and Kieron O’Hara, UKAN, University of Manchester, Manch-
      ester, UK, 2020. This 119-page book provides tutorials and worked examples for
      de-identifying data and calculating risk [56].
    • IHE IT Infrastructure Handbook: De-Identifcation. Integrating the Healthcare
      Enterprise, June 6, 2014. IHE offers a variety of guides, including one on de-
      identifcation at http://www.ihe.net/User Handbooks [78].
Swapping and noise addition both introduce noise into the dataset, such that records lit-
erally contain incorrect data. Certain kinds of noise addition have been mathematically
proven to provide formal privacy guarantees. Swapping has no such guarantees.
All of these techniques impact data accuracy, but whether they impact data utility depends
on the downstream uses of the data. For example, top-coding household incomes will not
impact a measurement of the 90-10 quantile ratio, but it will impact a measurement of the
top 1 % of household incomes [129].
Statistical agencies should document the specifc statistical disclosure techniques that they
used when performing statistical disclosure limitation. Where possible, statistical agencies
should document the specifc parameters used in data-protecting transformations [8]. This
documentation should accompany the release of de-identifed data. Without such trans-
parency, data users may reach erroneous conclusions regarding their working data [72,
150, 76, 6].

4.3.4.   De-Identifying Dates
Dates can exist in many ways in a dataset. Dates may be in particular kinds of typed
columns, such as a date of birth or the date of an encounter. Dates may be present as a
number, such as the number of days since an epoch like January 1, 1900. Dates may be
