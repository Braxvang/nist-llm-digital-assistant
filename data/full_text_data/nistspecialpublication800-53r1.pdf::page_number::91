CP-9      INFORMATION SYSTEM BACKUP

          Control: The organization conducts backups of user-level and system-level information (including
          system state information) contained in the information system [Assignment: organization-defined
          frequency] and protects backup information at the storage location.
          Supplemental Guidance: The frequency of information system backups and the transfer rate of
          backup information to alternate storage sites (if so designated) are consistent with the
          organizationâ€™s recovery time objectives and recovery point objectives. While integrity and
          availability are the primary concerns for system backup information, protecting backup
          information from unauthorized disclosure is also an important consideration depending on the type
          of information residing on the backup media and the FIPS 199 impact level. An organizational
          assessment of risk guides the use of encryption for backup information. The protection of system
          backup information while in transit is beyond the scope of this control. Related security controls:
          MP-4, MP-5.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization tests backup information [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] to verify
                media reliability and information integrity.
          (2)   The organization selectively uses backup information in the restoration of information system
                functions as part of contingency plan testing.
          (3)   The organization stores backup copies of the operating system and other critical information
                system software in a separate facility or in a fire-rated container that is not collocated with the
                operational software.
          (4)   The organization protects system backup information from unauthorized modification.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: The organization employs appropriate mechanisms (e.g.,
                digital signatures, cryptographic hashes) to protect the integrity of information system
                backups. Protecting the confidentiality of system backup information is beyond the scope of
                this control. Related security controls: MP-4, MP-5.

           LOW CP-9                       MOD CP-9 (1) (4)              HIGH CP-9 (1) (2) (3) (4)



CP-10     INFORMATION SYSTEM RECOVERY AND RECONSTITUTION

          Control: The organization employs mechanisms with supporting procedures to allow the
          information system to be recovered and reconstituted to a known secure state after a disruption or
          failure.
          Supplemental Guidance: Information system recovery and reconstitution to a known secure state
          means that all system parameters (either default or organization-established) are set to secure
          values, security-critical patches are reinstalled, security-related configuration settings are
          reestablished, system documentation and operating procedures are available, application and
          system software is reinstalled and configured with secure settings, information from the most
          recent, known secure backups is loaded, and the system is fully tested.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization includes a full recovery and reconstitution of the information system as part of
                contingency plan testing.


           LOW CP-10                      MOD CP-10                     HIGH CP-10 (1)
