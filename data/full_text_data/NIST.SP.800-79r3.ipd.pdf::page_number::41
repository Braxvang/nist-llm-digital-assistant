       NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                       Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
       December 2023                                                              and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

1232                               Fig. 4. Sample issuer control assessment result (PCI)

1233   The assessment result for each issuer control SHALL be one of the following:
1234       •   Satisfied
1235       •   Partially Satisfied
1236       •   Not Satisfied
1237       •   Not Applicable
1238   After carrying out an assessment procedure, the assessor records their conclusion in one of two
1239   ways: MET or NOT MET. Using the list of conclusions pertaining to the assessment procedures
1240   associated with an issuer control, the assessment result (i.e., one of the four outcomes listed
1241   above) is arrived at as follows:
1242       •   If the conclusion from all assessment procedures is MET, then the assessment result for
1243           the issuer control is “Satisfied.”
1244       •   If some of the conclusions are NOT MET, then the assessment result for the issuer
1245           control is marked as either “Partially Satisfied” or “Not Satisfied,” depending on whether
1246           any of the underlying tasks in the assessment procedures are critical (i.e., they represent
1247           the only way to meet the issuer control’s objective). Figure 4 shows an example of an
1248           assessment that resulted in “Partially Satisfied.” In this instance, there is an awareness of
1249           a task requirement and the task itself is being carried out, but the reference to the task is
1250           missing in the document.
1251   When drawing a conclusion after an assessment procedure, the assessor must consider the
1252   potential subjective and objective aspects of the assessment methods used (e.g., interviews,
1253   document reviews, observations, and tests) for that assessment procedure. Deficiencies that result
1254   in “Partially Satisfied” or “Not Satisfied” must be reported by the assessor. The assessor must
1255   also outline the potential adverse impacts if the issuer control is deployed with the identified
1256   deficiencies.
1257   The assessment report template provides the means for recording the assessment result for each
1258   issuer control. The assessment results for all issuer controls are aggregated to generate the
1259   assessment result for an issuer authorization focus area. The set of issuer authorization focus area
1260   results are aggregated to generate issuer authorization topic results. Finally, the group of issuer
1261   authorization topic results is used to generate the overall issuer assessment report and an
1262   accompanying executive summary (intended for senior management).
