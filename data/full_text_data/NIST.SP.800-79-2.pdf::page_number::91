                   AI-6         The PIV Card is valid for no more than six years.                    [FIPS 201-2], Section 2.8 –

                                Assessment                                                           Requirements
                                Determine that:
                                   (i) the expiration date printed on the PIV Card is no more        [FIPS 201-2], Section 2.9.1 –
                                       than six years from the issuance date (observe);              PIV Reissuance
                                  (ii) the expiration date is printed in the CHUID (test);           Requirements
                                 (iii) the two dates (printed on the card and the expiration date
                                       in the CHUID) are the same (test).
                                 (iv) the biometric that is used for reissuance is not older than
                                       12 years (review)


                   AI-7         Before the PIV Card is provided to the applicant, the issuer          [FIPS 201-2], Section 2.8 –
                                performs a 1:1 biometric match of the applicant against               PIV Card Issuance
                                biometrics available on the PIV Card or in the chain-of-trust. The
                                1:1 biometric match requires either a match of fingerprint(s) or, if
                                unavailable, other optional biometric data that are available. If the
                                match is unsuccessful, or if no biometric data is available, the
                                cardholder provides two identity source documents (as specified
                                in Section 2.7 of [FIPS 201-2]), and an attending operator
                                inspects these and compares the cardholder with the facial image
                                printed on the PIV Card.

                                Assessment
                                Determine that:
                                   (i) the issuer performs a 1:1 biometric match of the applicant
                                       against the biometric included in the PIV Card or in the
                                       PIV chain of trust prior to releasing the card (review);
                                  (ii) the issuer has alternate processes in place for situations
                                       where biometric matches are not possible (review,
                                       observe).


                   AI-8         This control has been withdrawn. Renewal is covered as part of       -
                                re-issuance in [FIPS 201-2].



                   AI-9         The issuer advises applicants that the PIN on the PIV Card           [FIPS 201-2], Section 4.3.1
                                should not be easily-guessable or otherwise individually-            Activation by Cardholder
                                identifiable in nature.

                                Assessment
                                Determine that:
                                   (i) the requirement that the issuer advises applicants that the
                                       PIN on the PIV Card should not be easily guessable or
                                       otherwise individually-identifiable in nature is documented
                                       (review);
                                  (ii) the issuer advises applicants that the PIN on the PIV Card
                                       should not be easily guessable or otherwise individually-
                                       identifiable in nature (observe).
