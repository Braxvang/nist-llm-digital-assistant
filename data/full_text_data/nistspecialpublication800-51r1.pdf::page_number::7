2.    Overview of Vulnerability Naming Schemes

A vulnerability naming scheme is a systematic method for creating and maintaining a standardized
dictionary of common names for a set of vulnerabilities in IT systems, such as software flaws in an
operating system or security configuration issues in an application. The naming scheme ensures that each
vulnerability entered into the dictionary has a unique name. Using standardized vulnerability naming
schemes supports interoperability. Organizations typically have many tools for system security
management that reference vulnerabilities—for example, vulnerability and patch management software,
vulnerability assessment tools, antivirus software, and intrusion detection systems. If these tools do not
use standardized names for vulnerabilities, it may not be clear that multiple tools are referencing the same
vulnerabilities in their reports, and it may take extra time and resources to resolve these discrepancies and
correlate the information. This lack of interoperability can cause delays and inconsistencies in security
assessment, reporting, decision-making, and vulnerability remediation, as well as hampering
communications both within organizations and between organizations. Use of standardized names also
helps minimize confusion regarding which problem is being addressed, such as which vulnerabilities a
new patch mitigates. This helps organizations to quickly identify the information they need, such as
remediation information, when a new problem arises.

This publication provides information and recommendations related to two commonly used vulnerability
naming schemes: Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE), and Common Configuration
Enumeration (CCE). Both are described in detail below.

2.1   Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)

The CVE vulnerability naming scheme is for a dictionary of unique, common names for publicly known
software flaws. CVE provides the following:

 A comprehensive list of publicly known software flaws
 A globally unique name to identify each vulnerability
 A basis for discussing priorities and risks of vulnerabilities
 A way for a user of disparate products and services to integrate vulnerability information
A CVE vulnerability entry consists of a unique identifier number, a short description of the vulnerability,
and references to public advisories on the vulnerability. Figure 1 shows an example.

       CVE ID:        CVE-2000-0001
       Description:   RealMedia server allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a
                      long ramgen request.

Working with researchers, The MITRE Corporation assigns CVE IDs to publicly known vulnerabilities in
commercial and open source software. General information on CVE is available at http://cve.mitre.org/.
The National Vulnerability Database (NVD), which is maintained by NIST, provides several ways of
