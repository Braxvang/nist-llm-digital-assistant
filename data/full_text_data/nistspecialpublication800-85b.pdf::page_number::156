TE06.02.07.01       10.2.1.13: Verify digital      The tester shall validate that there is a single X.509
                    signature                      certificate in the certificates field that can verify the
                                                   digital signature in the SignerInfo.
TE06.02.07.02       10.2.1.13: Verify digital      If the certificates field is omitted, the tester shall
                    signature                      validate that the certificate in the SignedData for the
                                                   CHUID can verify the digital signature in the

TE06.02.08.01       10.2.1.5: Verify crls field    The tester shall validate that the crls field has been
                    omission                       omitted from the SignedData.
TE06.02.09.01       10.2.1.6: Verify contents of   The tester shall validate that only a single SignerInfo
                    signerInfos                    exists in the SignedData.
TE06.02.10.01       10.2.1.7: Verify Signer        The tester shall validate that the
                    Identifier in SignerInfo       issuerAndSerialNumber choice has been used for the
                                                   SignerIdentifier.
TE06.02.11.01       10.2.1.8: Verify Digest        The tester shall validate that the digest algorithm in
                    Algorithm in SignerInfo        the SignerInfo is based on the expiration date of the
                                                   PIV card and is in accordance with Table 3-3 of SP
                                                   800-78.
