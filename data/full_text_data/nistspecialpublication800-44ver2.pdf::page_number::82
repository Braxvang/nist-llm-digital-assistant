                              Figure 7-3. Sample Encoded SSL/TLS Certificate

When a Web browser contacts a Web site that is using SSL/TLS, the browser examines the certificate and
attempts to verify its validity. Each browser has a store of certificates, and these typically include root
certificates for many third-party CAs. If the browser has a root certificate for the third-party CA that
issued the Web server’s certificate, it can use the CA’s root certificate to validate the Web server’s
certificate, which is based partially on that root certificate. If the browser does not have the needed root
certificate, then it typically displays a warning to the user that says the Web server’s certificate could not
be verified and asks the user how it should proceed.

Some organizations decide to create and sign their own Web server certificates instead of having
certificates issued by third-party CAs. The main advantage of self-signed certificates is that it avoids the
cost of purchasing and renewing certificates; however, by default, Web browsers will not be able to
validate self-signed certificates, so they provide no assurance of the legitimacy of the certificate or the
Web server. Given the increasing use of phishing and other techniques to trick users into visiting rogue
Web sites, failing to authenticate the server’s identity before using SSL/TLS with it is unacceptable. If a
particular Web server is only going to be accessed from the organization’s own systems (e.g.,
telecommuters using laptops issued and managed by the organization), then those systems’ browsers
could be provisioned with the root certificates needed to validate the Web server’s self-signed certificate
and authenticate the server’s identity. Otherwise, the use of self-signed certificates for public Web
servers is generally not recommended because of the logistics involved in securely distributing the root
certificates to users’ Web browsers and having the certificates installed correctly by the users so that the
browsers can authenticate the organization’s Web servers.

For all SSL/TLS certificates for Web servers, regardless of issuer or format, administrators should take
extreme caution in securing their certificate and encryption keys. The following are recommendations:

 Create and store a backup copy of the certificate on read-only media in case the original certificate is
  deleted accidentally. If the certificate is lost and cannot be recovered from backup media, a new
  certificate must be created.
