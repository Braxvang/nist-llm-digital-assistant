(e.g., to rekey). This approach permits a decoupling of the key management mechanism
from the other security mechanisms, thus facilitating the use of alternative key
management methods without having to modify other security mechanisms.

The preferred automated keying method is IKE, the Internet Key Exchange protocol that
was designed specifically for use with IPsec. IKE generates the necessary keying material
for IPsec via an authenticated secure channel between the two IKE peers. There are two
versions of IKE in use: IKEv1 ([RFC 2407], [RFC 2408] and [RFC 2409]) and IKEv2
[RFC 5996]; both versions perform mutual authentication, and establish and maintain
security associations. SAs will be valid for a specified period of time or volume of traffic.
IKEv1 is still implemented in numerous current systems, despite the fact that it is
obsolete. These two versions of IKE are not interoperable. IKEv2 was designed to be
more reliable and efficient than IKEv1; therefore, IKEv2 should be used.

Table 3-1 provides the IETF reference materials for versions 2 and 3 of IPsec.

The IPsec security mechanisms are not tied to any specific cryptographic algorithms; in
fact, many algorithms and modes have IETF Requests For Comment (RFCs) describing
their use with IPsec. This, however, can result in a situation where there are so many
choices for typical system administrators to make that it is difficult to achieve
interoperability. To improve interoperability in IPsec-v3, two cipher suites: VPN-A and
VPN-B were specified [RFC 4308]. However, these two cipher suites are not NIST-
approved cipher suites. Four additional cipher suites have been defined in [RFC 6379]:
Suite-B-GCM-128, Suite-B-GCM-256, Suite-B-GMAC-128 and Suite-B-GMAC-256
and they are NIST-approved.

Implementers may allow the individual selection of security algorithms (i.e., rather than
selecting one of the pre-specified suites of algorithms) specified in [RFC 6379], but users
must be aware that picking non-standard groupings of algorithms may result in limited
interoperability. However, when IPsec is used in the context of a VPN, security policy
can be centrally managed, thus ensuring interoperability without the use of pre-defined
cipher suites. Current IETF algorithm guidance is in [RFC 7321].
