3.6   Summary

RFID technology can support a wide range of applications—from asset management and tracking to
access control and automated payment. The business requirements for these applications are as varied as
the applications themselves. In particular, they are implementation-specific and depend on such factors
as:

 The nature of the information that the RFID system manages, including its sensitivity and how it
  changes over time,
 The RFID transaction environment, including the distance between reader and tag, the required speed
  of the transactions, and the level of network connectivity during the transaction,
 The characteristics of the tag environment between transactions, such as whether tags collect data
  from sensors and the human and environmental threats that tags face, and
 The economics of RFID technology and security controls.
