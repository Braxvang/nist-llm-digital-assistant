NIST SP 800-160v1r1                                                 Engineering Trustworthy Secure Systems
November 2022

Systems security considerations within activities and tasks such as those described in Appendices
H, I, J, and K provide the security perspective to ensure that stakeholder security requirements
are included in the stakeholder requirements and that the stakeholder security requirements are
consistent with all other stakeholder requirements.

C.2.2. System Security Requirements
System requirements specify the technical view of a system or solution that meets the specified
stakeholder needs. The system requirements are a transformation of the validated stakeholder
requirements. System requirements specify what the system or solution must do to satisfy the
stakeholder requirements. System security requirements are those system requirements that have
security relevance. These requirements define:
   •   The protection capabilities provided by the security solution
   •   The performance and behavioral characteristics exhibited by the security solution
   •   Assurance processes, procedures, and techniques
   •   Constraints on the system and the processes, methods, and tools used to realize the
       system
