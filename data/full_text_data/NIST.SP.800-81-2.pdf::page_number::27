                                                          SECURE DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM (DNS) DEPLOYMENT GUIDE



A resolver (either stub or part of a caching name server) that performs DNSSEC validation is called a
validating resolver (sometimes validator for short). A validating resolver performs all the same DNS
operations (i.e., formulating name resolution queries) as a stub/caching name server but also attempts to
validate the responses in the form of DNSSEC signed data when available. In order for a validator to
perform its validation, it must first be configured with one or more public keys as trust anchors. See
Section 13 for more information about DNSSEC validation.
