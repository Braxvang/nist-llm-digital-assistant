GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



5.3.3.2 Encryption of Data at Rest

Control: Data stored on a tag is encrypted before it is written to the tag. The control does not require
that the tag encrypt or decrypt data. Instead, the encryption is performed by either the reader,
middleware, or other enterprise subsystem components.

Applicability: All applications that store additional data beyond an identifier on the tag that needs to be
kept confidential on the tag. If the encryption and decryption functions are performed in the enterprise
subsystem, then network access is required to read the content of data stored on the tag, which makes the
control unsuitable for mobile readers that do not always have real-time network access.

Benefits: Data encryption protects sensitive tag data from being read by individuals with unauthorized
access to the tags.

Weaknesses:

 Data encryption requires a key management system, which can be complex to manage and operate.
 Sending tag data to network components for encryption or decryption is a source of network latency,
  when in conjunction with the time to complete cryptographic functions may introduce an
  unacceptable delay in RFID systems that require very fast read or write transactions.
5.3.3.3 Kill Feature

Control: The kill feature permanently disables a tag’s functionality using a remote command. The most
common implementation of the kill feature is the EPCglobal kill command. The EPCglobal Class-1
Generation-2 kill command is password-protected using a 32-bit password different from the access
password. 63

Applicability: RFID applications that encounter business intelligence and privacy risks after a tag has
moved beyond its intended functional environment (e.g., after a tag moves beyond the supply chain in
which it served inventory and checkout functions). EPCglobal tags are the only standards-based tags that
support a kill feature.

Benefits: Using the kill feature prevents a tag from being reused improperly. The kill feature was
designed and implemented in EPCglobal tags primarily to protect consumer privacy. It also protects
improper access to tag data used in business processes. For example, discarded tags that have not been
disabled may be read by adversaries to gain access to data, such as which products an organization or
individual is purchasing or using.

Weaknesses:

     Several alternative technical controls to the kill feature are under development, but have not yet been fully commercialized.
     One approach is to disable the tag’s antenna in such a way that it can still perform transactions over short distances (e.g., 10
     cm or less) but not longer than that. The objective is to greatly reduce the probability that an adversary could track or target
     someone in possession of the tag after the tag longer serves its primary purpose, but still enable the tag to perform some
     additional functions, albeit with additional effort. For example, the primary purpose of the tag might be to facilitate a point-
     of-sale transaction, but using the approach described, the tag could also facilitate a receipt-less return, although the item
     would need to be placed closer to the reader to complete this post-sale transaction. Another approach is to use multiple
     control domains as described in the immediately preceding footnote. The objective of both of these approaches is to extend
     the life of a tag to support some residual functionality that would otherwise be eliminated as a result of the kill feature.
