NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1                                                 Guidelines for Media Sanitization


well as their business missions and specific use cases. For example, a drive in a datacenter may
contain customer data from multiple customers. When one customer discontinues service and
another begins storing data on the same media, the organization may choose to apply partial
sanitization in order to retain the data of other customers that is also stored on the same storage
device on other areas of the media. The organization may choose to apply partial sanitization
because the drive remains in the physical possession of the organization, access by the customer
is limited to the interface commands, and the organization has trust in the partial sanitization
mechanism available for that specific piece of media. In cases where the alternative to partial
sanitization is not performing sanitization at all, partial sanitization provides benefits that should
be considered.
