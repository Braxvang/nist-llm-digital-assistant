not be listed since they mandate security for all systems. Each agency should decide on
the level of laws, regulations, and policies to include in the system security plan.
Examples might include the Privacy Act of 1974 or a specific statute or regulation
concerning the information processed (e.g., tax or census information). If the system
processes records subject to the Privacy Act, include the number and title of the Privacy
Act system(s) of records and whether the system(s) are used for computer matching
activities.


3.13 Security Control Selection
In preparation for documenting how the NIST SP 800-53 security controls for the
applicable security control baseline (low-, moderate-, or high impact information
systems) are implemented or planned to be implemented, the security controls contained
in the baseline should be reviewed and possibly tailored. The scoping guidelines
explained in Section 2.5.1 should be used when determining the applicability or tailoring
of individual controls. Additionally the controls that are common among numerous
systems or within the whole agency should be identified and then documented in the
plan. See Section 2.5.3 for guidance on how the common controls should be determined,
documented, and coordinated. The process of selecting the appropriate security controls
and applying the scoping guidelines to achieve adequate security17 is a multifaceted, risk-
based activity involving management and operational personnel within the agency and
should be conducted before the security control portion of the plan is written.

-       For low-impact information systems, an agency must, as a minimum, employ the
        security controls from the low baseline of security controls defined in NIST SP
        800-53 and must ensure that the minimum assurance requirements associated with
        the low baseline are satisfied.

-       For moderate-impact information systems, an agency must, as a minimum,
        employ the security controls from the moderate baseline of security controls
        defined in NIST SP 800-53 and must ensure that the minimum assurance
        requirements associated with the moderate baseline are satisfied.

-       For high-impact information systems, an agency must, as a minimum, employ the
        security controls from the high baseline of security controls defined in NIST SP
        800-53 and must ensure that the minimum assurance requirements associated with
        the high baseline are satisfied.


3.14 Minimum Security Controls
Now that the security controls have been selected, tailored, and the common controls
identified, describe each control. The description should contain 1) the security control
title; 2) how the security control is being implemented or planned to be implemented; 3)
17
  The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Appendix III, defines adequate security
as security commensurate with the risk and the magnitude of harm resulting from the loss, misuse, or
unauthorized access to or modification of information.
