         Security Category investigative information = {(confidentiality, high), (integrity, moderate), (availability,
         moderate)}.

EXAMPLE 3: A financial organization managing routine administrative information (not privacy-
related information) determines that the potential impact from a loss of confidentiality is low, the
potential impact from a loss of integrity is low, and the potential impact from a loss of
availability is low. The resulting security category of this information type is expressed as:
         Security Category administrative information = {(confidentiality, low), (integrity, low), (availability, low)}.

In general, security objective impact assessment is independent of mechanisms employed to
mitigate the consequences of a compromise.

4.3 Step 3: Review Provisional Impact Levels and Adjust/Finalize
    Information Type Impact Levels
In Step 3, organizations should review and adjust the provisional security impact levels for
the security objectives of each information type and arrive at a finalized state. To accomplish
this, organizations should: (i) review the appropriateness of the provisional impact levels
based on the organization, environment, mission, use, and data sharing; (ii) adjust the
security objective impact levels as necessary using the special factors 18 guidance found in
Volume II, Appendices C and D; and (iii) document all adjustments to the impact levels and
provide the rationale or justification for the adjustments.
When security categorization impact levels recommended in Section 4.2 or Volume II,
Appendices C and D are adopted as provisional security impact levels, the agency should
review the appropriateness of the provisional impact levels in the context of the organization,
environment, mission, use, and data sharing associated with the information system under
review. This review should include the agency’s mission importance; lifecycle and
timeliness implications; configuration and security policy related information; special
handling requirements; etc. The FIPS 199 factors presented in Section 4.2.2 of this
document should be used as the basis for decisions regarding adjustment or finalization of the
provisional impact levels. The confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact levels may
be adjusted one or more times in the course of the review. Once the review and adjustment
process is complete, the mapping of impact levels by information type can be finalized.
The impact of information compromise of a particular type can vary in different agencies or
in dissimilar operational contexts. Also, the impact for an information type may vary
throughout the life cycle. For example, contract information that has a moderate
confidentiality impact level during the life of the contract may have a low impact level when
the contract is completed. Policy information may have moderate confidentiality and
integrity impact levels during the policy development process, low confidentiality and
moderate integrity impact levels when the policy is implemented, and low confidentiality and
integrity impact levels when the policy is no longer used.

  The special factor guidance in NIST SP 800-60, Volume II, provides specific guidance on considerations for
adjusting each security objective (confidentiality, integrity, and availability) for each information type. The
special factor guidance is applied to each information type, based on how the information type is used, the
organization’s mission, or the system’s operating environment.
