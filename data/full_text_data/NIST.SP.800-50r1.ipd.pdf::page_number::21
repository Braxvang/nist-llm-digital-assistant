      NIST SP 800-50r1 ipd                                                      Building a Cybersecurity and
      August 2023                                                                 Privacy Learning Program

475   The size, maturity, and resources of CPLPs can also vary widely, even within components of the
476   same organization. The roles and responsibilities for key positions in a CPLP should be
477   documented to help ensure the most effective use of resources and enable the program to mature
478   to its desired state.

479   1.8.1. Organization Head
480   Organization heads must prioritize the development of an effective CPLP. This includes
481   implementing a viable cybersecurity and privacy program with a strong learning component.
482   Organization heads should:
483      •    Designate leadership roles to manage the organization’s cybersecurity and privacy
484           learning programs. Empower these roles to develop the strategic direction for the learning
485           program; performance goals and objectives are written; and performance metrics are
486           reviewed and managed. Learning Program Managers, who are responsible for the
487           analysis, design, development and delivery of the CPLP, are identified and given
488           resources adequate to meet the performance goals and objectives
489      •    Ensure that an agency- or organization-wide cybersecurity and privacy program is
490           implemented, well-supported by resources, including personnel and funding, and
491           effective at reducing and managing risk
492      •    Ensure that the agency or organization has enough sufficiently knowledgable and skilled
493           personnel to support its programs and resources and individuals’s privacy

494   1.8.2. Senior Leadership
495   FISMA [9], OMB A-130 [1], and various other regulations designate the responsibility for
496   ensuring cybersecurity and privacy learning programs to certain senior official positions, such as
497   the Chief Information Officer, Chief Privacy Officer, Chief Information Security Officer, and
498   Chief Data Officer. These roles are tasked with setting strategic direction, ensuring resources are
499   available, and overseeing personnel with significant responsibilities for cybersecurity and
500   privacy, including the roles found in the NICE Framework [3]. Senior officials should work with
501   their Learning Program Managers to:
502      •    Establish an overall strategy for the CPLPs
503      •    Provide resource support for the implementation of the CPLPs’ life cycle phases
504      •    Recognize any deficiencies in the organizational culture, risks, or requirements and
505           address them with appropriate program funding and management
506   In addition, senior leaders must champion workforce requirements, such as:
507      •    Leading by example and participating in their own CPLP training, as required.
508       •   Identifying who has cybersecurity and privacy responsibilities and documenting it in
509           position descriptions or other relevant work and performance requirement statements
510       •   Identifying relevant learning requirements and documenting it in individual development
511           plans or other career pathway documentation
