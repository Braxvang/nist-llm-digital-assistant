Special Publication 800-53, Revision 1               Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________


•    Implement the security controls in the information system. For legacy systems, some or all of
     the security controls selected may already be in place.
•    Assess the security controls using appropriate methods and procedures to determine the
     extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing
     the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the system. 34
•    Authorize information system operation based upon a determination of the risk to
     organizational operations, organizational assets, or to individuals resulting from the operation
     of the information system and the decision that this risk is acceptable. 35
•    Monitor and assess selected security controls in the information system on a continuous basis
     including documenting changes to the system, conducting security impact analyses of the
     associated changes, and reporting the security status of the system to appropriate
     organizational officials on a regular basis.

Figure 1 illustrates the specific activities in the NIST Risk Management Framework and the
information security standards and guidance documents associated with each activity.

                                FIGURE 1: THE RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK


The remainder of this chapter focuses on several key activities in the Risk Management
Framework—the FIPS 199 categorization, the initial selection and tailoring of security controls,
supplementing the initial controls based on the organization’s risk assessment, and updating the
controls when necessary.




34
  NIST Special Publication 800-53A, Guide for Assessing the Security Controls in Federal Information Systems
(Second Public Draft), April 2006, provides guidance for determining the effectiveness of security controls.
35
  NIST Special Publication 800-37, Guide for the Security Certification and Accreditation of Federal Information
Systems, provides guidance on the security authorization of information systems.
