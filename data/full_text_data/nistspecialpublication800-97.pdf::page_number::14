ESTABLISHING WIRELESS ROBUST SECURITY NETWORKS: A GUIDE TO IEEE 802.11I



        –   Phase 2a: Planning and Design. In this phase, WLAN network architects specify the
            technical characteristics of the WLAN solution, such as authentication methods, and related
            network components, such as firewall rulesets. The WLAN network architects should also
            conduct a site survey to help determine the architecture of the solution and how the WLAN
            should be integrated with the existing authentication infrastructure, including PKI.

        –   Phase 2b: Procurement. This phase involves specifying the number and type of WLAN
            components that must be purchased, the feature sets they must support (e.g., FIPS-validated
            encryption modules), and any certifications they must hold (e.g., WPA2 Enterprise).
     Phase 3: Implementation. In this phase, procured equipment is first configured to meet
      operational and security requirements, and then installed and activated on a production network,
      with appropriate event logging enabled.
     Phase 4: Operations/Maintenance. This phase includes security-related tasks that an
      organization should perform on an ongoing basis once the WLAN is operational, including
      patching, periodic security assessment, log reviews, and incident handling.
     Phase 5: Disposition. This phase encompasses tasks that occur after a system or its components
      have been retired, including preserving information to meet legal requirements, sanitizing media
      that might contain sensitive material, and disposing of equipment properly.
