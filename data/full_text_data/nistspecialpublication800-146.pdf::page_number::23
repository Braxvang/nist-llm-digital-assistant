                                                             CLOUD COMPUTING SYNOPSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



    provider’s management and operational policies and procedures could compromise the security of a
    consumer organization by exposing client workloads to one another contrary to the consumer's
    security policy. Logical segregation techniques at the network layer, such as VPN Routing and
    Forwarding (VRF), can help mitigate risks. An on-site private cloud mitigates these risks somewhat
    further by restricting the number of possible attackers; all of the clients would typically be members
    of the consumer organization or authorized guests or partners, but the on-site private cloud is still
    vulnerable to attack conducted by authorized but also malicious insiders. Different organizational
    functions, such as payroll, storage of sensitive personally identifiable information, or the generation
    of intellectual property may be merged as a consequence of such security failures, which can provide
    access to users who are not authorized to access specific classes of data and who then may disclose
    data from the on-site private cloud.
 Data import/export, and performance limitations (on-site-private). As with the general case, on-
  demand bulk data import/export is limited by the on-site private cloud's network capacity, and real-
  time or critical processing may be problematic because of networking limitations. In the on-site
  private cloud scenario, however, these limits may be adjusted, although not eliminated, by
  provisioning high-performance and/or high-reliability networking within the consumer's
  infrastructure. Particularly if a consumer has only one site that requires access to the on-site private
  cloud, a consumer may be able to provision local networks that provide higher performance than can
  practically be achieved via wide area networks.
 Potentially strong security from external threats (on-site-private). In an on-site private cloud, a
  consumer has the option of implementing an appropriately strong security perimeter to protect private
  cloud resources against external threats to the same level of security as can be achieved for non-cloud
  resources. For low-impact data and processing, the security perimeter may consist of commercial
  firewall rule sets and VPNs. For higher-impact data, security perimeters can be constructed via more
  restrictive firewall policies [Zwi00, Ran99], multi-factor authentication [SP-800-63], encryption
  [Sch94, Ros99], intrusion detection and prevention, and even physical isolation.
 Significant-to-high up-front costs to migrate into the cloud (on-site-private). An on-site private
  cloud requires that cloud management software be installed on computer systems within a consumer
  organization. If the cloud is intended to support process-intensive or data-intensive workloads, the
  software will need to be installed on numerous commodity systems or on a more limited number of
  high-performance systems. Installing cloud software and managing the installations will incur
  significant up-front costs, even if the cloud software itself is free, and even if much of the hardware
  already exists within a consumer organization. Three potential approaches to accomplish this are:
        New Data Center: The most direct approach is for a consumer to provision a data center in which
        to deploy the cloud software. In this case, the on-site private cloud incurs up-front costs that are
        similar to those of a typical data center and the consumer can provision the data center for
        anticipated workloads.

        Converted Data Center: As an alternative to provisioning a new data center, a consumer may
        convert part or all of an existing data center to support the on-site private cloud. This approach,
        however, may not be compatible with running parallel cloud and non-cloud systems during the
        initial evaluation period.

        Scavenged Resources: Another alternative approach, supported by [Nur-08, Nur-08-2], is for
        cloud software to be installed primarily on computers that already exist within an organization.
        In this scenario, cloud systems share hardware resources with other uses of the hardware and
        essentially can harvest cycles that might otherwise be wasted. This approach offers the advantage
        that cloud services can be made available on an experimental basis without a large hardware
