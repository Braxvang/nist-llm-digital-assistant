new application, and the normal phases of software development, including testing, version management,
and decommissioning phases, are not shown.

6.2   Software Stack and Provider/Consumer Scope of Control

In PaaS, the cloud provider controls the more privileged, lower layers of the software stack. Figure 14
illustrates how control and management responsibilities are shared. In the center, the figure depicts a
traditional software stack comprising layers for the hardware, operating system, middleware, and
application. The figure also depicts an assignment of responsibility either to the cloud provider, the cloud
consumer, or both.




                          Figure 14: PaaS Component Stack and Scope of Control

The provider operates and controls the lowest layers, the operating system and hardware; implicit in this
is control over networking infrastructure such as LANs and routers between data centers. At the
middleware layer, the provider makes programming and utility interfaces available to the consumer; these
interfaces provide the execution environment within which consumer applications run and provide access
to needed resources such as CPU cycles, memory, persistent storage, data stores, data bases, network
connections, etc. The provider determines the programming model, i.e., the circumstances under which
consumer application code gets activated, and monitors the activities of consumer programs for billing
and other management purposes. Once a consumer has used the facilities of the PaaS cloud to implement
and deploy an application, the application essentially is a SaaS deployment as discussed in Section 5 and
the consumer has administrative control over the application subject only to the provider supporting the
consumer according to the terms of use, as discussed in Section 3.

6.3   Benefits

In the public and outsourced PaaS scenarios, a cloud provider is free to locate cloud infrastructure in low-
cost areas, and consumers access cloud services over the open Internet. For all scenarios, by retaining
control over the lower layers of the software stack as illustrated in Figure 14, PaaS providers are able to
manage the lower layers and relieve PaaS consumers of the responsibility for selecting, installing,
maintaining, or operating the platform components. Infrastructure charges are implicitly present in PaaS
offerings because PaaS consumes infrastructure resources in some form, but the infrastructure charges are
bundled in the rates charged for the PaaS execution environment resources (e.g., CPU, bandwidth,
storage).

PasS shares many of the benefits of SaaS as discussed in Section 5.3:

 Very Modest Software Tool Footprint (5.3.1),
 Centralized Management and Data (5.3.3),
 Platform Issues Managed by Providers (5.3.4), and
 Savings in Up-front Costs (5.3.5).
