     IMPERATIVE 5 – Improving Cybersecurity Awareness, Training, Education, and Workforce Development



               together with interagency and industry partners and collaborators. The NIST
               Small Business Cybersecurity Act, which became law on August 14, 2018, codified
               the Institute’s focus on small businesses. Specifically, the statute directed NIST to
               “disseminate clear and concise resources to help small business concerns identify,
               assess, manage, and reduce their cybersecurity risks.” During FY18, the NIST Small
               Business Outreach Program began updating the Small Business Cybersecurity
               Corner website to make resources easier to find and use. In FY19, those training
               materials and accompanying resources will be expanded based on contributed
               cybersecurity resources and feedback received from federal partners and the public.
          •    National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE). Hosted by NIST, NICE
               seeks to help equip, promote, and energize a robust network of organizations
               that address cybersecurity education, training, and workforce development.
               Efforts to achieve this goal include: 1) accelerating learning and skills development,
               2) nurturing a diverse learning community, and 3) guiding career development and
               workforce planning to achieve each of the objectives identified in the NICE
               Cybersecurity Workforce Framework.39

               In FY18, fulfilling a directive in Executive Order 13800,40 NICE joined with the
               Department of Homeland Security to prepare a report to the President41 that
               made a series of recommendations. In their transmittal to the President, the
               Commerce and Homeland Security Secretaries noted that “in both the private
               and public sectors, cybersecurity practitioners and educators are vital to our
               national security—especially since other nations are paying greater attention
               to their cybersecurity workforce needs and the cybersecurity weaknesses of
               their adversaries.” The report was based on an analysis of available data and
               the information and views shared by businesses, educational organizations,
               training and certification providers, government agencies at multiple levels,
               and individuals. Findings and specific, forward-thinking, and actionable
