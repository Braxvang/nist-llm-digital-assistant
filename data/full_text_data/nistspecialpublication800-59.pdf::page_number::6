                                                              Guideline for Identifying an Information
                                                              System as a National Security System


Information Systems (see NSTISSD Number 502). The Director of the Office of
Management and Budget (OMB) retains responsibility for oversight of national security
system information security policies and practices with respect to:

   •   Overseeing agency compliance with the requirements of Subchapter III of
       Chapter 35 of Title 44, United States Code, including through any authorized
       action under Title 40, United States Code, section 11303, to enforce
       accountability for compliance with such requirements; and

   •   Reporting to Congress no later than March 1 of each year on agency compliance
       with the requirements of Subchapter III of Chapter 35 of Title 44 United States
       Code, including –

            o A summary of the findings of evaluations required by 44 U.S.C. 3545;
            o An assessment of the development, promulgation, and adoption of, and
              compliance with, standards developed under 15 USC 278g-3 and
              promulgated under 40 U.S.C. 11331;
            o Significant deficiencies in agency information security practices;
            o Planned remedial action to address such deficiencies; and
            o A summary of, and OMB views on, the report prepared by NIST under 15
              USC 278g-3.

Accordingly, the purpose of these guidelines is not to establish requirements for national
security systems, but rather to assist agencies in determining which, if any, of their
systems are national security systems as defined by FISMA and are to be governed by
applicable requirements for such systems, issued in accordance with law and as directed
by the President.
