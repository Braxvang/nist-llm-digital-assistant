GUIDE TO INTEGRATING FORENSIC TECHNIQUES INTO INCIDENT RESPONSE



The media containing the tools should protect them from changes. Floppy disks should be write-
protected to ensure that no changes are made to the tools. CD-ROMs should be write-once CDs (i.e., CD-
R), not rewritable CDs, since the contents of a rewritable CD could be altered by CD-burning utilities on
the userâ€™s computer. After the tools have been burned to a write-once CD, the disc should be finalized to
ensure that no additional data can be written to it.66

Because the media containing the tools should be write-protected, the results produced by the tools cannot
be placed onto the tool media. Analysts often direct tool output to a floppy disk, but the prevalence of
floppy disk drives on computing devices is decreasing. As a result, alternative methods of collecting
output have been developed. Specially prepared CDs and USB flash drives containing a Windows or
Linux-based environment can be used to gather output without changing the state of the system and
typically direct the output to another USB flash drive, external hard drive, or other writable media, or to a
remote system.

5.2.1.2 Types of Volatile OS Data

The following list shows several types of volatile OS data and explains how forensic tools can be used in
collecting each type of data:67

     ! Contents of Memory. There are several utilities that can copy the contents of RAM to a data file
       and assist in subsequent analysis of the data. On most systems, it is not possible to avoid
       alteration of RAM when running a utility that attempts to make a copy of RAM. Instead, the goal
       is to perform the copying with as small a footprint as possible to minimize the disruption of
       RAM.
     ! Network Configuration. Most OSs include a utility that displays the current network
       configuration, such as ifconfig on UNIX systems and ipconfig on Windows systems.
       Information that can be provided through network configuration utilities includes the hostname,
       the physical and logical network interfaces, and configuration information for each interface (e.g.,
       IP address, Media Access Control [MAC] address, current status).
     ! Network Connections. OSs typically provide a method for displaying a list of the current
       network connections. Both Windows and UNIX-based systems usually include the netstat
       program, which lists network connections by source and destination IP addresses and ports, and
       also lists which ports are open on each interface.68 Third-party utilities are available that can
       display port assignments for each program. Most OSs also can display a list of remotely mounted
       filesystems, which provides more detailed information than a network connection list. Section
       6.2.7 provides additional information about gathering network connection information.69

66
     Finalizing a CD is a typical feature of CD-burning utilities. Some CD-burning utilities also allow the current session to be
     closed. However, closing a session simply indicates to the CD-burning utility that no additional data will be written to the
     disc in the current session; it does not prevent additional data from being written to the disc in a different session (often
     referred to as a multisession disc). Therefore, analysts should finalize the disc, not close the session, when creating a toolkit
     CD.
67
     Many resources are available that list the hundreds of tools available for analysts. Appendix F lists several Web sites that
     contain more information on computer forensic tools. For tools that are included with OSs, analysts should use copies of the
     tools that are on read-only media, not tools on the OS of a system of interest.
68
     Another way of identifying the open ports is by running port scanning software from another system. Port scanning
     software sends network traffic to various ports and analyzes the responses, as well as missing responses, to determine which
     ports are open. However, port scanning might produce inaccurate results due to security controls, such as host-based
     firewalls that block the scans; also, the scans could change the state of the system. Accordingly, port scans are best suited
     for informal data acquisition and for information collection when access to the OS is not available.
