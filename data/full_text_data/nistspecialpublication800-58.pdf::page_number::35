 4.2.1.2 H.235v2 Annex E – Signature Security Profile

        The Signature Security Profile relies on asymmetric techniques. Certificates and
        digital signatures are used to provide authentication and message integrity. The
        signature security profile mandates the gatekeeper-routed model. Other call
        models are for further study. Since this profile relies on a public key
        infrastructure rather than on pre-established shared secrets it scales for larger,
        global environments. In addition to the Baseline Security Profile it provides non-
        repudiation.

        This profile supports secure fast connect and H.245 tunneling and may be
        combined with the Voice Encryption Option described in section 4.2.1.3. Note:
        This protocol may have a critical impact on overall performance. This is due to
        the use of digital signatures for every message, requiring signature generation and
        verification on the sender’s and the receiver’s side. The Hybrid Security Profile
        described in section 4.2.1.4 provides an alternative to the Signature Security
        Profile.

 4.2.1.3 H.235v2 Annex D - Voice Encryption Option

        The voice encryption option offers confidentiality for the voice media stream data
        and may be combined with the baseline or the signature security profile.
