                     CI(DC)-13   A Derived PIV Credential issuer shall only issue a          DPCI         [SP 800-157], Section 2.3 –
                     (NEW)       Derived PIV Credential to an Applicant if it has access                  Maintenance
                                 to information about the Applicant’s PIV Card from the
                                 issuer of the PIV Card. In particular the Derived PIV                    [SP 800-157], Section 2.4 –
                                 Credential issuer shall have a mechanism to                              Linkage with PIV Card
                                 periodically check with the PIV Card issuer to determine
                                 if the PIV Card has been terminated or if information
                                 about the individual that will appear in the Derived PIV
                                 Credential (e.g., name) has changed, as these would
                                 require revocation or modification of the Derived PIV
                                 Credential. Examples of such mechanisms include: (i)
                                 if the Derived PIV Credential is issued by the same
                                 organization that issued the subscriber’s PIV Card, the
                                 linkage between the two credentials is maintained
                                 through the common Identity Management System
                                 (IDMS) database, (ii) if the issuer is different from the
                                 PCI, the Backend Attribute Exchange can be queried
                                 for the termination status of the PIV Card and attribute
                                 changes, (iii) if the issuer is different, from the PCI,
                                 the issuer of the PIV Card maintains a list of
                                 corresponding Derived PIV Credential issuers and
                                 sends notification to the latter set when the PIV Card is
                                 terminated, (iv) if the issuer is different from the PCI, a
                                 Uniform Reliability and Revocation Service (URRS) can
                                 be implemented in accordance with Section 3.7 of
                                 [NIST IR 7817],

                                 Assessment
                                 Determine that:
                                    (i) the issuer has developed procedures for
                                        updating Derived PIV Credentials data as a
                                        result of a change to PIV Card information
                                        (review);
                                   (ii) the issuer of the Derived PIV Credential does
                                        not solely rely on tracking the revocation status
                                        of the PIV Authentication certificate as a means
                                        of tracking the termination status of the PIV Card
                                        (review);
                                  (iii) The issuer has implemented one or more
                                        mechanisms to trigger an update to the Derived
                                        PIV Credential as a result of a change to the PIV
                                        Card (review, observe).


                     CI(DC)-14   The issuer retains for future reference the biometric       DPCI – LOA   [SP 800-157], Section 2.2 –
                     (NEW)       sample used to validate the Applicant.                      4 Only       Initial Issuance

                                 Assessment
                                 Determine that:
                                   (i) the issuer has implemented a process/system to
                                       retain the Applicant’s biometric for maintenance
                                       of the Derived PIV Credential (review).
