SP 800-152                                                  A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


3 Federal CKMS Goals
A Federal CKMS should achieve goals and satisfy requirements that are specified in the
security policies of one or more Federal organizations. The typical primary security goal of
an organization is to protect its information at a level commensurate with its value,
sensitivity, and perceived risks. Three information-system impact-levels are defined in [FIPS
200] and [FIPS 199]: Low, Moderate, and High. As discussed in Section 8.5, Federal
organizations are required to establish the appropriate impact-levels for the various
categories of information processed, stored, and transmitted within Federal information
systems, based on the potential adverse impact to organizational operations and assets, if
such information is lost or compromised. After the impact-level is determined, the
appropriate controls for an FCKMS may be selected from [SP 800-53] and this Profile (i.e.,
SP 800-152), and then assessed using [SP 800-53A].

3.1   Providing Key Management to Networks, Applications, and Users

The information-processing network in which an FCKMS operates is also typically used as
the communications backbone of both the userâ€™s applications and the FCKMS. Network
characteristics, such as error properties, could influence the selection of the cryptographic
algorithms and cryptographic modes of operation, because some modes of operation extend
communication errors, which could make the decrypted communication unintelligible. Other
modes can minimize the effects of a communication error.

An FCKMS could provide key-management services for a single organization, application,
or user, or for many of each. An FCKMS designed for a single application could be
integrated into that application, while an FCKMS supporting many applications and/or users
in geographically distributed locations could be distributed to wherever key-management
services are needed and require communication networks to provide interaction between the
distributed applications and users.

FR:3.1 The CKMS design shall specify its goals with respect to the communications
networks on which it will function.

FR:3.2 The CKMS design shall specify the intended applications that it will support.

FR:3.3 The CKMS design shall list the intended number of users and the responsibilities that
the CKMS places on those users.

3.2   Maximize the Use of COTS Products in an FCKMS

Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) products that are designed and produced for many
customers are typically less costly to acquire, operate, and maintain than custom products
that have been designed for a single customer. A CKMS that satisfies a wide range of
requirements is often a goal of CKMS designers, FCKMS service providers and FCKMS
service-using organizations because of its reduced cost, wider market acceptance, and greater
interoperability among FCKMSs. A COTS CKMS could be configurable to meet the special
needs of multiple customers and, therefore, be widely accepted in the marketplace.
