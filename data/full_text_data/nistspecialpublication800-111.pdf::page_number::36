Appendix B—Glossary

Selected terms used in the publication are defined below.

Container: The file used by a virtual disk encryption technology to encompass and protect other files.

End User Device: A personal computer (desktop or laptop), consumer device (e.g., personal digital
assistant [PDA], smart phone), or removable storage media (e.g., USB flash drive, memory card, external
hard drive, writeable CD or DVD) that can store information.

File: A collection of information logically grouped into a single entity and referenced by a unique name,
such as a filename.

File Encryption: The process of encrypting individual files on a storage medium and permitting access
to the encrypted data only after proper authentication is provided.

Filesystem: A mechanism for naming, storing, organizing, and accessing files on logical volumes.

Folder: An organizational structure used by a filesystem to group files.

Folder Encryption: The process of encrypting individual folders on a storage medium and permitting
access to the encrypted files within the folders only after proper authentication is provided.

Full Disk Encryption (FDE): The process of encrypting all the data on the hard drive used to boot a
computer, including the computer’s operating system, and permitting access to the data only after
successful authentication with the full disk encryption product.

Malware: A program that is inserted into a system, usually covertly, with the intent of compromising the
confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the victim’s data, applications, or operating system.

Master Boot Record (MBR): A special region on bootable media that determines which software (e.g.,
operating system, utility) will be run when the computer boots from the media.

Metadata: Data about data; in the context of a filesystem, information regarding files and folders
themselves, such as file and folder names, creation dates and times, and sizes.

Partitioning: The act of logically dividing a media into portions that function as separate units.

Pre-Boot Authentication (PBA): The process of requiring a user to authenticate successfully before
decrypting and booting an operating system.

Residual Data: Data from deleted files or earlier versions of existing files.

Sector: The smallest unit that can be accessed on media.

Storage Security: The process of allowing only authorized parties to access stored information.

Trusted Platform Module (TPM) Chip: A tamper-resistant integrated circuit built into some computer
motherboards that can perform cryptographic operations (including key generation) and protect small
amounts of sensitive information, such as passwords and cryptographic keys.
