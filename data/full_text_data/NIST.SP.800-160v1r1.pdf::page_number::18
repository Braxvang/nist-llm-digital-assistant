NIST SP 800-160v1r1                                                                           Engineering Trustworthy Secure Systems
November 2022

Systems security engineering provides complementary engineering capabilities that extend the
concept of trustworthiness to deliver trustworthy secure systems. Trustworthiness is not only
about demonstrably meeting a set of requirements. The requirements must also be complete,
consistent, and correct. From a security perspective, a trustworthy system meets a set of well-
defined requirements, including security requirements. Through evidence and expert judgment,
trustworthy secure systems can limit and prevent the effects of modern adversities. Such
adversities come in malicious and non-malicious forms and can emanate from a variety of
sources, including physical and electronic. Adversities can include attacks from determined and
capable adversaries, human errors of omission and commission, accidents and incidents,
component faults and failures, abuses and misuses, and natural and human-made disasters.


             “Security is embedded in systems. Rather than two engineering groups designing two
             systems, one intended to protect the other, systems engineering specifies and designs
             a single system with security embedded in the system and its components.”

           Purpose and Applicability
This publication is intended to:
•    Provide a basis for establishing a discipline for systems security engineering as part of
     systems engineering in terms of its principles, concepts, activities, and tasks
•    Foster a common mindset to deliver security for any system, regardless of its purpose, type,
     scope, size, complexity, or stage of the system life cycle
•    Demonstrate how selected systems security engineering principles, concepts, activities, and
     tasks can be effectively applied to systems engineering activities
•    Advance the field of systems security engineering as a discipline that can be applied and
     studied
•    Serve as a basis for the development of educational and training programs, including
     individual certifications and other professional assessment criteria

The considerations set forth in this publication are applicable to all federal systems other than
those systems designated as national security systems as defined in 44 U.S.C., Section 3542. 6
These considerations have been broadly developed from a technical and technical management
perspective to complement similar considerations for national security systems and may be used
for such systems with the approval of federal officials who exercise policy authority over such
systems. State, local, and tribal governments, as well as private sector entities, are encouraged to
consider using the material in this publication, as appropriate.


6
  Increasing the trustworthiness of systems is a significant undertaking that requires a substantial investment in the requirements, architecture,
design, and development of systems, system components, applications, and networks. The policy in [8] requires federal agencies to implement the
systems security engineering principles, concepts, techniques, and system life cycle processes in this publication for all high-value assets.
