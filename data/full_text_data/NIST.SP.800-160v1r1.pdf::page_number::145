          Note: Subject-matter experts are consulted and participate in the formulation of conclusions
          and recommendations.
          SA-2.4 Record the results of the security aspects of the system analysis.

SA-3      MANAGE SYSTEM ANALYSIS
          SA-3.1 Maintain traceability of the security aspects of the system analysis results.
          Note: Bidirectional traceability captures the relationship between the security aspects of the
          system analysis results, the methods employed, the data used for the analysis, the assumptions,
          and the context that defines the problem or question addressed.
          SA-3.2 Provide the security-relevant artifacts that have been selected for baselines.
          Note: This includes general artifacts and security-specific artifacts.

H.7.      Implementation
The purpose of the Implementation process is to realize a specified system element.

H.7.1. Security Purpose
-      Transform system security requirements, architecture, and design (including interfaces) into
       actions that create a trustworthy secure system element according to the practices of the
       selected implementation technology using appropriate security and non-security technical
       specialties or disciplines.

H.7.2. Security Outcomes
-      Security-relevant implementation constraints that influence the requirements, architecture, or
       design are identified.
-      A trustworthy secure system element is realized.
-      System elements are securely packaged and stored.
-      Enabling systems or services for the security aspects of implementation are available.
-      Traceability of the security aspects of the implemented system elements is established.

H.7.3. Security Activities and Tasks
IP-1      PREPARE FOR IMPLEMENTATION
          IP-1.1 Define the trustworthy secure aspects of the implementation strategy.
          Note 1: These aspects apply to all system elements that are acquired new, built new, or reused
          (with or without modification). If the strategy is reuse, the project determines the extent,
