                                            GUIDE TO INTEGRATING FORENSIC TECHNIQUES INTO INCIDENT RESPONSE



A.2.1    Data Collection

   ! Organizations should be proactive in collecting useful data. Configuring auditing on OSs,
     implementing centralized logging, performing regular system backups, and using security
     monitoring controls can all generate sources of data for future forensic efforts.
   ! Analysts should be aware of the range of possible data sources. Analysts should be able to
     survey a physical area and recognize possible sources of data. Analysts should also think of
     possible data sources located elsewhere within an organization and outside the organization.
     Analysts should be prepared to use alternate data sources if it is not feasible to collect data from a
     primary source.
   ! Analysts should consider all possible application data sources. Application events might be
     recorded by many different data sources. In addition, applications might be used through
     multiple mechanisms, such as multiple client programs installed on a system and Web-based
     client interfaces. In such situations, analysts should identify all application components, decide
     which are most likely to be of interest, find the location of each component of interest, and
     acquire the data.
   ! Analysts should perform data collection using a standard process. The recommended steps
     are identifying sources of data, developing a plan to acquire the data, acquiring the data, and
     verifying the integrity of the data. The plan should prioritize the data sources, establishing the
     order in which the data should be acquired, based on the likely value of the data, the volatility of
     the data, and the amount of effort required. Before data collection begins, a decision should be
     made by the analyst or management regarding the need to collect and preserve evidence in a
     manner that supports its use in future legal or internal disciplinary proceedings. In such
     situations, a clearly defined chain of custody should be followed to avoid allegations of
     mishandling or tampering of evidence.
   ! Analysts should act appropriately to preserve volatile OS data. The criteria for determining
     whether volatile OS data must be preserved should be documented in advance so that analysts can
     make informed decisions as quickly as possible. To determine whether the effort required to
     collect volatile OS data is warranted, the risks associated with such collection should be weighed
     against the potential for recovering important information.
   ! Analysts should use a forensic toolkit for collecting volatile OS data. Use of a forensic toolkit
     enables accurate OS data to be collected while minimizing disturbance to the system and
     protecting the tools from changes. The analyst should know how each tool is likely to affect or
     alter the system during collection of data.
   ! Analysts should choose the appropriate shutdown method for each system. Each way of
     shutting down a particular OS can cause different types of data to be preserved or corrupted;
     analysts should be aware of the typical shutdown behavior of each OS.
   ! Analysts should preserve and verify file integrity. Using a write-blocker during backups and
     imaging prevents a computer from writing to its storage media. The integrity of copied data
     should be verified by computing and comparing the message digests of files. Backups and
     images should be accessed as read-only whenever possible; write-blockers can also be used to
     prevent writes to the backup or image file or restored backup or image.
