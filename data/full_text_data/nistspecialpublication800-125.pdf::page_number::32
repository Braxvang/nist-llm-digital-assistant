                                                      GUIDE TO SECURITY FOR FULL VIRTUALIZATION TECHNOLOGIES



 Control. Reconfigure access control features as needed based on factors such as policy changes,
  technology changes, audit findings, and new security needs
 Logging. Document anomalies detected within the virtualized environment. Such anomalies might
  indicate malicious activity or deviations from policy and procedures. Anomalies should be reported to
  other systems’ administrators as appropriate.
Organizations should periodically perform assessments to confirm that the organization’s virtualization
policies, processes, and procedures are being followed properly. Assessment activities may be passive,
such as reviewing logs, or active, such as performing vulnerability scans and penetration testing.
Assessments need to be made at all levels of the virtualized infrastructure, including the host and guest
OSs, the hypervisor, and shared storage media. More information on technical assessments is available
from NIST SP 800-115, Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment.

5.5   Disposition

Before a device using virtualization permanently leaves an organization (such as when a leased server’s
lease expires or when an obsolete PC is being recycled), the organization should remove any sensitive
data from the host. Data may also need to be wiped if an organization provides “loaner” devices to
teleworkers, particularly for travel. The task of scrubbing all sensitive data from storage devices is often
surprisingly difficult because of all the places where such data resides. See NIST SP 800-88, Guidelines
for Media Sanitization, for additional information and recommendations on removing data from devices.
Note that sensitive data may be found nearly anywhere on a device because of the nature of virtualization.
An organization should strongly consider erasing all storage devices completely.
