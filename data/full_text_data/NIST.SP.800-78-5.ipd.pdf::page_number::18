      NIST SP 800-78-5 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                  Cryptographic Algorithms
      September 2023                                                                  and Key Sizes for PIV

392       Certificate Status Information
393   The FIPS 201-3 functional component PIV Card Issuance and Management Subsystem generates
394   and distributes status information for PIV asymmetric keys other than PIV Secure Messaging
395   keys. FIPS 201-2 mandates two formats for certificate status information:
396       1. X.509 CRLs and
397       2. OCSP status response messages.
398   The CRLs and OCSP status responses shall be digitally signed to support authentication and
399   integrity using a key size and hash algorithm that satisfy the requirements for signing PIV
400   information, as specified in Table 2, and that are at least as large as the key size and hash
401   algorithm used to sign the certificate.
402   CRLs and OCSP messages rely on object identifiers to specify which signature algorithm was
403   used to generate the digital signature. The object identifiers specified in Table 3 must be used in
404   CRLs and OCSP messages to identify the signature algorithm.
