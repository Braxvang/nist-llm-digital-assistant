          NIST has a repository of security configuration checklists for various operating systems and applications, which is located at http://checklists.nist.gov/. The checklists can be
          helpful to organizations in securing STAs, ASs, and other RSN components. NIST SP 800-70, Security Configuration Checklists Program for IT Products, describes the
          checklist program in more detail.

          For more information on SNMPv3, see http://www.snmp.com/snmpv3/, which provides links to pertinent RFCs, trade press articles, white papers, and related Web sites.

          More information on TLS is available from NIST SP 800-52, Guidelines for the Selection and Use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) Implementations. Another helpful
          resource is NIST SP 800-77, Guide to IPsec VPNs, which compares IPsec, TLS, and other methods for protecting network traffic.
