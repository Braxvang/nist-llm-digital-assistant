 Step 1: Prepare for Risk Assessment

 TASK 1-1                        Identify the purpose of the risk assessment in terms of the information that the
 IDENTIFY PURPOSE                assessment is intended to produce and the decisions the assessment is intended to
                                 support.

 IDENTIFY ASSUMPTIONS            conducted.
 AND CONSTRAINTS
