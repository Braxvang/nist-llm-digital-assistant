NIST SP 800-216                                                                Federal Vulnerability
May 2023                                                                       Disclosure Guidelines

When possible, the underlying software flaw for each vulnerability should be documented, and
each CVE should be mapped to one or more security elements in the [CWE] list.
The NIST Bugs Framework is a complementary system that provides:
            …factoring and restructuring of information contained in Common
            Weakness Enumeration (CWE), Software Fault Patterns (SFP), Semantic
            Templates (ST) and numerous other sources. The goal is to categorize
            the types of weaknesses unambiguously, allowing similarities and
            differences to be easily explored and examined. [NIST_TBF]
Most vulnerabilities are described using a textual description, which may not be machine-
readable. This approach may also leave out important details because a structured data
framework is not being followed. To address this, NIST has created the Vulnerability Data
Ontology or Vulntology project, which provides an ontology “to characterize vulnerabilities and
provide a granular and intuitive structure for that information” and “is intended to be a drop-in
replacement for a vulnerability description” that is structured and machine-readable
[NIST_VULN].
