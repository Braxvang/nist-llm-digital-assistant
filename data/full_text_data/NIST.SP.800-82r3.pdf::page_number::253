NIST SP 800-82r3                                         Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

Control Enhancement: (4) OT Discussion: Identify and communicate suspicious and anomalous
behaviors within the OT environment. Some examples of OT suspicious or anomalous behavior
may include a PLC still in programming mode when it is expected to be in run mode, process
trips with an undetermined root cause, malware on an HMI, unexpected mouse movement, or
process changes that are not being performed by the operator.
Rationale for adding AT-2 (4) to MOD and HIGH baselines: Training OT personnel on
potentially suspicious communications and anomalous behaviors as well as the actions to take if
anomalous system behavior occurs can supplement system detection and protection mechanisms
for improved response.

OT Discussion: Security training includes initial and periodic review of OT-specific policies,
standard operating procedures, security trends, and vulnerabilities. The OT security training
program is consistent with the requirements of the security awareness and training policy
established by the organization. The training may be customized for specific OT roles, which
could include operators, maintainers, engineers, supervisors, and administrators.

F.7.3. AUDITING AND ACCOUNTABILITY â€“ AU
Tailoring Considerations for the Audit Family
In general, security audit information and audit tools are not available on legacy OT. When OT
cannot support the specific audit and accountability requirements of a control, the organization
employs compensating controls in accordance with the general tailoring guidance. For example,
organizations may want to consider whether security audit information is available from separate
systems or system components (e.g., the historian, firewall logs, physical security systems).
Additional examples of compensating controls are given with each control as appropriate.
