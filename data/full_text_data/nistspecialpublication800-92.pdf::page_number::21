                                                                          GUIDE TO COMPUTER SECURITY LOG MANAGEMENT



each type of situation, certain logs are typically the most likely to contain detailed information on the
activity in question. Other logs typically contain less detailed information, and are often only helpful for
correlating events recorded in the primary log types. For example, an intrusion detection system could
record malicious commands issued to a server from an external host; this would be a primary source of
attack information. An incident handler could then review a firewall log to look for other connection
attempts from the same source IP address; this would be a secondary source of attack information.

Administrators using logs should also be mindful of the trustworthiness of each log source. Log sources
that are not properly secured, including insecure transport mechanisms, are more susceptible to log
configuration changes and log alteration. Of course, administrators should be particularly cautious about
the accuracy of logs from hosts that have been attacked successfully; it is usually prudent to examine
other logs as well.

2.2     The Need for Log Management

Log management can benefit an organization in many ways. It helps to ensure that computer security
records are stored in sufficient detail for an appropriate period of time. Routine log reviews and analysis
are beneficial for identifying security incidents, policy violations, fraudulent activity, and operational
problems shortly after they have occurred, and for providing information useful for resolving such
problems. Logs can also be useful for performing auditing and forensic analysis, supporting the
organization’s internal investigations, establishing baselines, and identifying operational trends and long-
term problems.

Besides the inherent benefits of log management, a number of laws and regulations further compel
organizations to store and review certain logs. The following is a listing of key regulations, standards,
and guidelines that help define organizations’ needs for log management:

       Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA). FISMA emphasizes the
        need for each Federal agency to develop, document, and implement an organization-wide
        program to provide information security for the information systems that support its operations
        and assets. NIST SP 800-53, Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems,
        was developed in support of FISMA.11 NIST SP 800-53 is the primary source of recommended
        security controls for Federal agencies. It describes several controls related to log management,
        including the generation, review, protection, and retention of audit records, as well as the actions
        to be taken because of audit failure.
       Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA).12 GLBA requires financial institutions to protect their
        customers’ information against security threats. Log management can be helpful in identifying
        possible security violations and resolving them effectively.
       Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). HIPAA includes
        security standards for certain health information. NIST SP 800-66, An Introductory Resource
        Guide for Implementing the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
        Security Rule, lists HIPAA-related log management needs. 13 For example, Section 4.1 of NIST
        SP 800-66 describes the need to perform regular reviews of audit logs and access reports. Also,
