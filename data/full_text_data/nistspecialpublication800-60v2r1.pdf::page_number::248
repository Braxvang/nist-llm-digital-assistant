severe effect on public confidence in the agency. In such cases, the confidentiality impact can be
moderate.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for direct loan information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Loan assistance
activities are not generally time-critical. In most cases, the adverse effects of unauthorized
modification or destruction of direct loan information on agency mission functions and public
confidence in the agency will be limited.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: There are significant differences between
the ability to modify a document authorizing a payment and the modification of the payment
itself. The unauthorized modification of a document authorizing a payment is less time critical
than the modification of the payment itself while the payment is in transit. Modifications to
payments in transit will result in immediate inaccurate payments. This can result in assignment
of a moderate impact level to such information.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
direct loan information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to direct loan information. Loan
assistance processes are generally tolerant of delay. In most cases, disruption of access to direct
loan information can be expected to have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations,
agency assets, or individuals.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
direct loan information is low.

D.24.2 Loan Guarantees Information Type

Loan guarantees involve any guarantee, insurance, or other pledge with respect to the payment of
all or a part of the principal or interest on any debt obligation of a non-Federal borrower to a
non-Federal lender, but does not include the insurance of deposits, shares, or other withdrawable
accounts in financial institutions. The general recommended security categorization for the loan
guarantees information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of loan guarantee
information on the ability of responsible agencies to execute guarantees, insurance, or other
