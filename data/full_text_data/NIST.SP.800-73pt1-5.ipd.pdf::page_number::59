       NIST SP 800-73pt1-5 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification: Part 1

1218   B.1.4. Authentication Using OCC (OCC-AUTH)
1219   The OCC-AUTH authentication mechanism is implemented by performing OCC over secure
1220   messaging. The PIV Application authenticates the PIV Card as part of the process of establishing
1221   secure messaging. When the live-scan fingerprint biometric is supplied to the card for OCC over
1222   secure messaging, both the request and the response are protected using message authentication
1223   codes (MAC), allowing the PIV Application on the local system to verify that the response has
1224   not been altered and that it was created by the PIV Card that was authenticated during the
1225   establishment of secure messaging.
1226   The OCC-AUTH authentication mechanism is performed by establishing secure messaging as
1227   described in Section 4 of SP 800-73-5 Part 2 and then performing the VERIFY command, as
1228   illustrated in Fig. 6.
