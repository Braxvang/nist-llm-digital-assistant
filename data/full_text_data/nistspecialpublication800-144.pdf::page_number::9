architecture, organizations should review existing security and privacy measures and employ
additional ones, if necessary, to secure the client side.

Maintain accountability over the privacy and security of data and applications implemented
and deployed in public cloud computing environments.
Organizations should employ appropriate security management practices and controls over cloud
computing. Strong management practices are essential for operating and maintaining a secure
cloud computing solution. Security and privacy practices entail monitoring the organization’s
information system assets and assessing the implementation of policies, standards, procedures,
controls, and guidelines that are used to establish and preserve the confidentiality, integrity, and
availability of information system resources.

The organization should collect and analyze available data about the state of the system regularly
and as often as needed to manage security and privacy risks, as appropriate for each level of the
organization (i.e., governance level, mission or business process level, and information systems
level) [Dem10]. Continuous monitoring of information security requires maintaining ongoing
awareness of privacy and security controls, vulnerabilities, and threats to support risk
management decisions. The goal is to conduct ongoing monitoring of the security of an
organization’s networks, information, and systems, and to respond by accepting, avoiding, or
mitigating risk as situations change.

Assessing and managing risk in cloud computing systems can be a challenge, since significant
portions of the computing environment are under the control of the cloud provider and may
likely be beyond the organization’s purview. Both qualitative and quantitative factors apply in a
risk analysis. Risks must be carefully weighed against the available technical, management, and
operational safeguards and the necessary steps must be taken to reduce risk to an acceptable
level. The organization must also ensure that security and privacy controls are implemented
correctly, operate as intended, and meet organizational requirements.

Establishing a level of confidence about a cloud service environment depends on the ability of
the cloud provider to provision the security controls necessary to protect the organization’s data
and applications, and also the evidence provided about the effectiveness of those controls
[JTF10]. Verifying the correct functioning of a subsystem and the effectiveness of security
controls as extensively as with an internal organizational system may not be feasible in some
cases, however, and other factors such as third-party audits may be used to establish a level of
trust. Ultimately, if the level of confidence in the service falls below expectations and the
organization is unable to employ compensating controls, it must either reject the service or
accept a greater degree of risk.

Cloud computing depends on the security of many individual components. Besides components
for general computing, there are also components that the management backplane comprises,
such as those for self-service, resource metering, quota management, data replication and
recovery, service level monitoring, and workload management. Many of the simplified
interfaces and service abstractions afforded by cloud computing belie the inherent underlying
complexity that affects security. Organizations should ensure to the maximum extent practicable
that all cloud computing elements are secure and that security and privacy are maintained based
