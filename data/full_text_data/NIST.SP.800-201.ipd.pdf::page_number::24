      NIST SP 800-201 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                     Cloud Computing Forensic
      February 2023                                                                     Reference Architecture

717   challenge makes it easier to conduct forensics on the capability is asked. This determines
718   whether the capability is affected by the challenge. If the grouping is appropriate and
719   overcoming the challenge makes it easier to conduct forensics, then the challenge is considered
720   to affect the capability (i.e., the mapping is YES).
721   However, suppose a challenge is non-technical but requires technology to overcome the
722   challenge. Examples of non-technical challenges that have both non-technical and technical
723   solutions include the following ([1], Annex A):
724       •   FC-56 (Confidentially and PII) deals with legal/privacy issues (a non-technical
725           challenge). Privacy issues can be resolved with a combination of legal steps (e.g.,
726           legislation) and technology steps (privacy-enhancing technologies).
727       •   FC-64 and FC-65 deal with training (non-technical challenges). Training issues can be
728           resolved with better and more widely available training classes, but they can also be
729           resolved with better technology to perform the training.
730   There are non-technical challenges that require solutions that are non-technical, technical, or a
731   combination of both. If the non-technical challenge requires only a non-technical solution (and
732   the capability is non-technical), it is in Group 2. If it requires only a technical solution (and the
733   capability is technical), it is in Group 1. If it requires both, then it is in Group 1 or Group 2,
734   depending on whether the capability is technical or non-technical.
735   When a challenge is technical but requires a non-technical solution to overcome the challenge
736   (and the capability is non-technical), then this challenge is in Group 2.
737   In Fig. 2, the two purple circles refer to two notes, as follows:
738       •   NOTE 1: When this circle is reached, the challenge does not fit in either of the two
739           groups. It is neither technical nor non-technical. Fortunately, none of the challenges reach
740           this node as none have this property. This node is included simply for logical
741           completeness of the flowchart, so that every node has both a YES exit path and a NO exit
742           path.
743       •   NOTE 2: When this circle is reached, the capability does not fit in either of the two
744           groups. It is neither technical nor non-technical. There are a few capabilities that reach
745           this node. However, these capabilities do not deal with issues directly related to digital
746           forensics for cloud computing. Instead, they involve controlling physical access to
747           facilities (e.g., using barriers, security patrols, checking physical ID cards, etc.). They
748           also involve mitigating physical threats to facilities, such as installing fire suppression
749           equipment.
750   The process described in this section, which is employed for the analysis of any pair consisting
751   of a cloud functional capability and a cloud forensic challenge, represents a core component of
752   the CC FRA – the methodology – and can be applied to any set of capability-challenge pairs,
753   either modified from the sets used in this document or adapted from a different architectural
754   framework or empirical data.
