GUIDELINES ON ELECTRONIC MAIL SECURITY



 Misconfiguration may allow malicious entities to use the organizationâ€™s mail server to send email-
  based advertisements (i.e., spam).
 Users may send inappropriate, proprietary, or other sensitive information via email. This could
  expose the organization to legal action.
This document is intended to assist organizations in installing, configuring, and maintaining secure mail
servers and mail clients. More specifically, this document discusses the following items in detail:

 Email standards and their security implications
 Email message signing and encryption standards
 Planning and management of mail servers
 Securing the operating system underlying a mail server
 Mail server application security
 Email content filtering
 Email-specific considerations in the deployment and configuration of network protection
  mechanisms, such as firewalls, routers, switches, and intrusion detection and intrusion prevention
  systems
 Securing mail clients
 Administering the mail server in a secure manner, including backups, security testing, and log
  reviews.
The following key guidelines are recommended to Federal departments and agencies for maintaining a
secure mail server.

Organizations should carefully plan and address the security aspects of the deployment of a mail
server.

As it is much more difficult to address security once deployment and implementation have occurred,
security should be considered from the initial planning stage. Organizations are more likely to make
decisions about configuring computers appropriately and consistently when they develop and use a
detailed, well-designed deployment plan. Developing such a plan will support mail server administrators
in making the inevitable tradeoff decisions between usability, performance, and risk.

Organizations often fail to take into consideration the human resource requirements for both deployment
and operational phases of the mail server and supporting infrastructure. Organizations should address the
following points in a deployment plan:

 Types of personnel required (e.g., system and mail server administrators, network administrators,
  information systems security officers)
 Skills and training required by assigned personnel
 Availability of personnel.
