SI-3      MALICIOUS CODE PROTECTION

          Control: The information system implements malicious code protection.

          Supplemental Guidance: The organization employs malicious code protection mechanisms at critical
          information system entry and exit points (e.g., firewalls, electronic mail servers, web servers,
          proxy servers, remote-access servers) and at workstations, servers, or mobile computing devices
          on the network. The organization uses the malicious code protection mechanisms to detect and
          eradicate malicious code (e.g., viruses, worms, Trojan horses, spyware) transported: (i) by
          electronic mail, electronic mail attachments, Internet accesses, removable media (e.g., USB
          devices, diskettes or compact disks), or other common means; or (ii) by exploiting information
          system vulnerabilities. The organization updates malicious code protection mechanisms
          (including the latest virus definitions) whenever new releases are available in accordance with
          organizational configuration management policy and procedures. The organization considers
          using malicious code protection software products from multiple vendors (e.g., using one vendor
          for boundary devices and servers and another vendor for workstations). The organization also
          considers the receipt of false positives during malicious code detection and eradication and the
          resulting potential impact on the availability of the information system. NIST Special Publication
          800-83 provides guidance on implementing malicious code protection.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization centrally manages malicious code protection mechanisms.
          (2)   The information system automatically updates malicious code protection mechanisms.
