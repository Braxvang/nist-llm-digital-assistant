NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1                                                             Guidelines for Media Sanitization




                       Table A-9: RAM- and ROM-Based Storage Device Sanitization


   RAM and ROM-Based Storage Devices

   Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM)

   Clear/ Purge:   Power off device containing DRAM, remove from the power source, and remove the battery (if
                   battery backed). Alternatively, remove the DRAM from the device.

   Destroy:        Shred, Disintegrate, or Pulverize.


   Notes:          In either case, the DRAM must remain without power for a period of at least five minutes.

   Electronically Alterable PROM (EAPROM)

   Clear/ Purge:   Perform a full chip Purge as per manufacturerâ€™s data sheets.

   Destroy:        Shred, Disintegrate, or Pulverize.


   Notes:          None.

   Electronically Erasable PROM (EEPROM)

   Clear/ Purge:   Overwrite media by using organizationally approved and validated overwriting
                   technologies/methods/tools.

   Destroy:        Shred, Disintegrate, Pulverize, or Incinerate by burning the device in a licensed incinerator.


   Notes:          None.
