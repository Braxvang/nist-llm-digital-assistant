                                                                           SECTION 5: RFID SECURITY CONTROLS



 Prevents access to sensitive data stored on tags.
These benefits apply to both business intelligence and privacy risks.

Weaknesses:

 Even if minimal, the effort it takes to destroy a tag increases the tagâ€™s life cycle cost, which is a
  concern if very low costs are required to justify an RFID-enabled business process.
 Destruction of a tag precludes the ability to use it for future value-added applications such as post-
  sale product support, targeted recalls, receipt-free returns, expiration date monitoring, and sorting
  assistance for recycling.
5.2.4   Operator and Administrator Training

Control: Operator and administrator training provides personnel with the skills and knowledge necessary
to comply with RFID usage, IT security, and privacy policies, as well as agreements with external
organizations. In most RFID implementations, personnel will perform various roles, which might require
different training materials for each role. For example, an administrator of middleware might need
different information than an operator of a mobile reader. Appropriate security and privacy training
addresses at least three points:

 What constitutes unauthorized use,
 How to detect that unauthorized use might be occurring, and
 To whom to report violations.
If HERF/HERO/HERP risks are present, appropriate security training covers mitigation techniques, such
as safe handling distances.

If tags are destroyed or recycled, training should cover how to perform these functions. For example,
operators might be trained how to clear tag memory before reuse.

Applicability: All RFID implementations.

Benefits: Operator training helps ensure that the system is used and maintained properly. Training also
helps operators identify security violations and take appropriate actions to prevent their reoccurrence.

Weaknesses: Training alone cannot ensure proper operation of the system or compliance with policy.

5.2.5   Information Labels / Notice

Control: A written message is affixed to or distributed with each tag or is posted near readers. The
notice may inform users of the purposes of the RFID system or advise users on how to minimize privacy
or other risks (e.g., place an RFID-enabled access card or transponder in metal foil or a sleeve that shields
RF radiation when the card or transponder is not in use).

Applicability: All applications in which there is a risk that could be mitigated with simple informational
messages. The control is particularly relevant to consumer applications in which privacy is a concern.
