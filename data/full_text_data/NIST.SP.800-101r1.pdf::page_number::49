                                                                                  Guidelines on Mobile Device Forensics

                        The ICCID of the UICC may be up to 20 digits long. It consists of an industry
                         identifier prefix (89 for telecommunications), followed by a country code, an
                         issuer identifier number, and an individual account identification number
                         [ITU06]. The country and network operator name may be determined by the
                         ICCID. If the ICCID does not appear on the UICC, it may be obtained with a
                         UICC acquisition tool. The GSM numbering plan Web site supports ICCID
                         queries for this information.18

                        The first 3 characters of the FCC ID are the company code; the next 14 are the
                         product code. The FCC provides a database lookup service that can be used to
                         identify a device manufacturer and retrieve information about the mobile device,
                         including photos, user manual, and radio frequency test results.19

                        MEID consists of a set of characters 56-bits in length (14 hex digits). It contains
                         three fields, including an 8-bit regional code (RR), a 24-bit manufacturer code,
                         and a 24-bit manufacturer-assigned serial number. The check digit (CD) is not
                         considered part of the MEID. The MEID was created to replace ESNs, as all
                         ESN’s were exhausted by November 2008.

                  Carrier Identification – The carrier for a mobile device may have their logo printed
                   on the exterior. This is traditionally displayed prominently to allow for advertising and
                   branding. This may provide the examiner with insight on which carrier the mobile
                   device operates. Mobile devices may be unlocked and possibly re-flashed to operate
                   using a competing carrier. One method to make this determination is to examine the
                   UICC if present. Most carriers imprint their logo on the front of the UICC.
                   Additionally, extraction and analysis of the ICCID provides further confirmation.

                  Reverse Lookup – The Number Portability Administration Center (NPAC) provides
                   an automated phone system for law enforcement agencies to determine the current
                   service provider assigned to a number and obtain contact information.20 This service
                   covers both U.S. and Canadian phone numbers. If the telephone number of the mobile
                   device is known, a reverse lookup may be used to identify the network operator and
                   the originating city and state. For example, FoneFinder™ is a service to obtain such
                   information.21 The network operator’s web site typically contains lists of supported
                   devices that may be used to narrow down and possibly identify the mobile device in
                   question. Because phone numbers may be ported among service providers, in many
                   situations more up-to-date information is required.

5.2   Tool Selection and Expectations

      Once the make and model of the mobile device are known, available manuals should be
      retrieved and studied. The manufacturer’s web site is a good place to begin. Typing the model
      number into a search engine may also reveal a significant amount of information about the
      mobile device. As mentioned earlier, the device being acquired largely dictates the choice of
