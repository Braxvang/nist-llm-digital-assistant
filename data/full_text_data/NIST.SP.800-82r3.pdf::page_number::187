NIST SP 800-82r3                                                   Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security

         Type of Threat Source                                Description                           Characteristics
  STRUCTURAL                           Failures of equipment, environmental controls, or            Range of effects
  - Hardware failure                   software due to aging, resource depletion, or other
    • Processors, input/output         circumstances that exceed expected operating
         cards, communications cards   parameters, including failures of critical infrastructures
                                       within the control of the organization
    • Networking equipment
    • Power supply
    • Sensor, final element
    • HMI, displays
  - Software failure
    • OS
    • General-purpose applications
    • Mission-specific applications
  - Environmental controls failure
    • Temperature control
    • Humidity control
  - Communications degradation
    • Wireless
    • Wired
  ENVIRONMENTAL                        Natural disasters and failures of critical infrastructures   Range of effects
  - Natural or human-caused disaster   on which the organization depends but that are outside
    • Fire                             of the control of the organization.
                                       Note: Natural and human-caused disasters can also be
    • Flood/tsunami
                                       characterized in terms of their severity and/or duration.
    • Windstorm/tornado                However, because the threat source and the threat event
    • Hurricane                        are strongly identified, severity and duration can be
    • Earthquake                       included in the description of the threat event (e.g.,
    • Bombing                          Category 5 hurricane causes extensive damage to the
                                       facilities that house mission-critical systems, making
    • Animal interference              those systems unavailable for three weeks).
    • Solar flares, meteorites
  - Critical infrastructure failure
    • Telecommunications
    • Electrical power
    • Transportation
    • Water/wastewater


C.2.   Vulnerabilities and Predisposing Conditions
Vulnerabilities are weaknesses in information systems, system procedures, controls, or
implementations that can be exploited by a threat source. Predisposing conditions are properties
of the organization, mission or business process, architecture, or information systems that
contribute to the likelihood of a threat event. The order of these vulnerabilities and predisposing
conditions does not reflect priority in terms of likelihood of occurrence or severity of impact.
Additionally, the vulnerabilities and predisposing conditions identified in this section should not
be considered a complete list, nor should they be assumed to occur in every OT environment.
Vulnerabilities and predisposing conditions are grouped according to where they exist, such as in
the organization’s policy and procedures, or the inadequacy of security mechanisms
