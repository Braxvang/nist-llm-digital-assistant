can be identified quickly in an emergency. This requires that the organization develop an effective media
marking and tracking strategy.

Alternate processing facilities provide a location for an organization to resume system operations in the
event of a catastrophic event that disables or destroys the systems primary facility. There are three
primary types of alternate processing facilities, corresponding to the level of readiness to function as a
system’s operations facility.

       Cold Sites. Cold sites are locations that have the basic infrastructure and environmental controls
        available (such as electrical and HVAC), but no equipment or telecommunications established or
        in place. There is sufficient room to house needed equipment to sustain a system’s critical
        functions. Examples of cold sites include unused areas of a data center and unused office space
        (if specialized data center environments are not required). Cold sites are normally the least
        expensive alternate processing site solution, as the primary costs are only the lease or
        maintenance of the required square footage for recovery purposes. However, the recovery time is
        the longest, as all system equipment (including telecommunications) will need to be acquired or
        purchased, installed, tested, and have backup software and data loaded and tested before the
        system can be operational. Depending on the size and complexity of a system, recovery could
        take several days to weeks to complete.

       Warm Sites. Warm sites are locations that have the basic infrastructure of cold sites, but also
        have sufficient computer and telecommunications equipment installed and available to operate
        the system at the site. However, the equipment is not loaded with the software or data required to
        operate the system. Warm sites should have backup media readers that are compatible with the
        system’s backup strategy. Warm sites may not have equipment to run all systems or all
        components of a system, but rather only enough to operate critical mission/business processes.
        An example of a warm site is a test or development site that is geographically separate from the
        production system. Equipment may be in place to operate the system, but would require reverting
        to the current production level of the software, loading the data from backup media, and
        establishing communications to users. Another example is available equipment at an alternate
        facility that is running noncritical systems and that could be transitioned to run a critical system
        during a contingency event. A warm site is more expensive than a cold site, as equipment is
        purchased and maintained at the warm site, with telecommunications in place. Some costs may
        be offset by using equipment for noncritical functions or for testing. Recovery to a warm site can
        take several hours to several days, depending on system complexity and the amount of data to be
        restored.

       Hot Sites. Hot sites are locations with fully operational equipment and capacity to quickly take
        over system operations after loss of the primary system facility. A hot site has sufficient
        equipment and the most current version of production software installed, and adequate storage for
        the production system data. Hot sites should have the most recent version of backed-up data
        loaded, requiring only updating with data since the last backup. In many cases, hot site data and
        databases are updated concurrently with or soon after the primary data and databases are updated.
        Hot sites also need a way to quickly move system users’ connectivity from the primary site. One
        example of a hot site is two identical systems at alternate locations that are in production, serving
        different geographical locations or load balancing production workload. Each location is built to
        handle the full workload, and data is continuously synchronized between the systems. This is the
        most expensive option, requiring full operation of a system at an alternate location and all
        telecommunications capacity, with the ability to maintain or quickly update the operational data
        and databases. Hot sites also require having operational support nearly equal to the production
