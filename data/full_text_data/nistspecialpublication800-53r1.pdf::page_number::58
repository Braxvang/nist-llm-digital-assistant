MINIMUM ASSURANCE REQUIREMENTS
LOW, MODERATE, AND HIGH BASELINE APPLICATIONS




T
       he minimum assurance requirements for security controls described in the security control
       catalog are listed below. The assurance requirements are directed at the activities and
       actions that security control developers and implementers 49 define and apply to increase
the level of confidence that the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and
producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the
information system. The assurance requirements are applied on a control-by-control basis. The
requirements are grouped by security control baseline (i.e., low, moderate, and high) since the
requirements apply to each control within the respective baseline. Using a format similar to
security controls, assurance requirements are followed by supplemental guidance that provides
additional detail and explanation of how the requirements are to be applied. Bolded text indicates
requirements that appear for the first time in a particular baseline.

Low Baseline
Assurance Requirement: The security control is in effect and meets explicitly identified functional
requirements in the control statement.
Supplemental Guidance: For security controls in the low baseline, the focus is on the controls being in place
with the expectation that no obvious errors exist and that, as flaws are discovered, they are addressed in a
timely manner.

Moderate Baseline
Assurance Requirement: The security control is in effect and meets explicitly identified functional
requirements in the control statement. The control developer/implementer provides a description of the
functional properties of the control with sufficient detail to permit analysis and testing of the control.
The control developer/implementer includes as an integral part of the control, assigned
responsibilities and specific actions supporting increased confidence that when the control is
implemented, it will meet its required function or purpose. These actions include, for example,
requiring the development of records with structure and content suitable to facilitate making this
determination.
Supplemental Guidance: For security controls in the moderate baseline, the focus is on actions supporting
increased confidence in the correct implementation and operation of the control. While flaws are still likely
to be uncovered (and addressed expeditiously), the control developer/implementer incorporates, as part of
the control, specific capabilities and produces specific documentation supporting increased confidence that
the control meets its required function or purpose. This documentation is also needed by assessors to
analyze and test the functional properties of the control as part of the overall assessment of the control.

High Baseline
Assurance Requirement: The security control is in effect and meets explicitly identified functional
requirements in the control statement. The control developer/implementer provides a description of the
functional properties and design/implementation of the control with sufficient detail to permit analysis


49
  In this context, a developer/implementer is an individual or group of individuals responsible for the development or
implementation of security controls for an information system. This may include, for example, hardware and software
vendors providing the controls, contractors implementing the controls, or organizational personnel such as information
system owners, information system security officers, system and network administrators, or other individuals with
security responsibility for the information system.
