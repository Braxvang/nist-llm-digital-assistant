                                                            SECURE DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM (DNS) DEPLOYMENT GUIDE



5.4       Security Objectives

Common objectives with respect to protection of the DNS host platform, DNS software, and DNS data
are integrity and availability.

5.5       Host Platform Protection Approach

The protection/threat mitigation approaches for the DNS host platform consist of the following:

      •    Running a secure OS

      •    Secure configuration/deployment of OS.
These approaches are discussed in Section 7.1.

5.6       DNS Software Protection Approach

Best practice protection approaches for DNS software are as follows:

      •    Running the latest version of name server software, or an earlier version with appropriate patches

      •    Running name server software with restricted privileges

      •    Isolating name server software

      •    Setting up a dedicated name server instance for each function

      •    Removing name server software from nondesignated hosts

      •    Creating a topological and geographic dispersion of authoritative name servers for fault tolerance

      •    Limiting IT resource information exposure through two different zone files in the same physical
           name server (termed as split DNS) or through separate name servers for different client classes.
These approaches are described in Sections 7.2.1 through 7.2.9.

5.7       DNS Data Content Control – Protection Approach

Control of undesirable content in the zone file is accomplished by analyzing the contents for security
implications, formulating integrity constraints that will check for the presence of such contents and
verifying the zone file data for satisfaction of those constraints. Therefore, the only protection approach is
to develop the zone file integrity checker software that contains the necessary constraints and can be run
against the zone file to flag those contents that violate the constraints. To aid in formulation of
constraints, desirable field values (ranges or lists) in the various RRs of zone file are required. These
constraints need to be developed not only for RRs in an unsigned zone but also for additional RRs in a
signed zone (zones that have implemented the DNSSEC specification). Hence, the recommendations for
control of content of zone files are deferred to Section 10 after discussion of deployment guidelines for
DNSSEC in Section 9 so that they cover those additional RRs as well.
