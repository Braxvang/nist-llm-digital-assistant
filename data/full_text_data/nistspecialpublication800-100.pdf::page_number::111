Chapter 11                       Certification, Accreditation, and Security Assessments


    The system security plan provides an overview of the security requirements for
the information system and explains the measures the information system owner has
taken or plans to take to comply with those requirements. 73 While not strictly
required and left to the discretion of the agency, the plan may contain supporting
appendices or as references, other system security documents. Such documents may
include the risk assessment, privacy impact assessment, contingency plan,
configuration management plan, security configuration checklists, and any system
interconnection agreements.
   The security assessment report (SAR) summarizes the results of the activities
undertaken by the certification agent. The security assessment report can also
contain a list of recommended corrective actions and the completed system reporting
form.
    The POA&M describes the measures that have been implemented or planned to
correct any deficiencies noted during the assessment of the security controls and to
reduce or eliminate known system vulnerabilities. Figure 11-1 provides an overview
of the key sections of the security accreditation package.

11.5 Accreditation Decisions
    The security accreditation package documents the results of the security
certification. To ensure that the agency's business and operational needs are fully
considered, the authorizing official should meet with the system owner prior to
issuing the security accreditation decision. In this meeting, the certification and
accreditation authorities should clearly explain the rationale for their risk-based
decision and, where appropriate, fully explain the terms and conditions of the
authorization.
   The security accreditation decision communicates the accreditation authority’s
decision and provides the information system owner with the:
       • Security accreditation decision – official decision by the authorizing official on
         whether to accredit the system, accredit the system with conditions, or deny
         system accreditation;
