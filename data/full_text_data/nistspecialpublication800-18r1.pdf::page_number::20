                    Guide for Developing Security Plans for Federal Information Systems


system security plan. The additional security controls specific to the minor application
should be documented in the system security plan as an appendix or paragraph. The
minor application owner (often the same as information owner) may develop the
appendix or paragraph describing the additional controls. The complete general support
system or major application system security plan should be shared with the information
owner.

The minor application can have a FIPS 199 security category of low or moderate.
However, if the minor application resides on a system that does not have adequate
boundary protection, the minor application must implement the minimum baseline
controls required by the host or interconnected system.


2.5 Security Controls
FIPS 200 provides seventeen minimum security requirements for federal information and
information systems. The requirements represent a broad-based, balanced information
security program that addresses the management, operational, and technical aspects of
protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of federal information and
information systems. An agency must meet the minimum security requirements in this
standard by applying security controls selected in accordance with NIST SP 800-53 and
the designated impact levels of the information systems. An agency has the flexibility to
tailor the security control baseline in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth
in the standard. Tailoring activities include: (i) the application of scoping guidance; (ii)
the specification of compensating controls; and (iii) the specification of agency-defined
parameters in the security controls, where allowed. The system security plan should
document all tailoring activities.

2.5.1 Scoping Guidance
Scoping guidance provides an agency with specific terms and conditions on the
applicability and implementation of individual security controls in the security control
baselines defined in NIST SP 800-53. Several considerations described below can
potentially impact how the baseline security controls are applied by the agency. System
security plans should clearly identify which security controls employed scoping guidance
and include a description of the type of considerations that were made. The application
of scoping guidance must be reviewed and approved by the authorizing official for the
information system.

Technology-related considerationsâ€”

   -   Security controls that refer to specific technologies (e.g., wireless, cryptography,
       public key infrastructure) will only be applicable if those technologies are
       employed or are required to be employed within the information system.

   -   Security controls will only be applicable to those components of the information
       system that typically provide the security capability addressed by the minimum
       security requirements.
