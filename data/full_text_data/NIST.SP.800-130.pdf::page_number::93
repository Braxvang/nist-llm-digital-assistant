SP 800-130                                                            August 2013



FR:10.11 The CKMS design shall specify its procedures for backing-up and archiving
cryptographic keys and their metadata.

FR:10.12 The CKMS design shall specify its procedures for restoring or replacing
corrupted keys and metadata that have been stored or transmitted.

11. Security Assessment
CKMS security may be assessed at any time throughout the lifetime of the CKMS. This
section highlights assessment considerations to be made during the initial deployment,
during periodic (e.g., annual) reviews, and during incremental assessments after major
changes. For additional information on U.S. Government security assessment practices,
see [SP 800-37], [SP 800-53], [SP 800-53A], and [SP 800-115].

11.1 Full Security Assessment
Prior to or upon deployment of a CKMS, its security should be fully assessed. The
activities that can be undertaken to assess the security of the CKMS include the
following:
    a) Review of third-party validations,
    b) Architectural review of the system design,
    c) Functional and security testing of the CKMS, and
    d) Penetration testing of the CKMS.

Each of these activities is described in the following subsections.

FR:11.1 The CKMS design shall specify the necessary assurance activities to be
undertaken prior to or in conjunction with a full CKMS security assessment.

FR:11.2 The CKMS design shall specify the circumstances under which a full security
assessment is repeated.

11.1.1 Review of Third-Party Validations
While there are currently no formal validation programs for the security of a CKMS, the
following validation programs exist for certain devices of a CKMS:
    a) NIST-approved cryptographic algorithm implementations can be validated under
       the NIST Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP),
    b) Cryptographic modules can be validated for conformance to [FIPS 140]-2 under
       the NIST Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP),
    c) Non-cryptographic security and hardware (e.g. operating systems, DBMS, or
       firewall) can be validated using the Common Criteria Standard (see [ISO/IEC
       15408 Parts 1-3]) under the National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP),
       and
    d) A CKMS, or parts thereof, could also be validated by a private entity hired by the
       vendor or a sponsor.
