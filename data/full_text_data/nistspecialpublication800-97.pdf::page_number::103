                                           ESTABLISHING WIRELESS ROBUST SECURITY NETWORKS: A GUIDE TO IEEE 802.11I



8.     WLAN Security Best Practices

As explained in the previous sections, IEEE 802.11 RSNs are complex, involving multiple devices,
protocols, and standards. This section distills this complexity into a manageable and actionable set of
recommendations that organizations can implement to provide reasonable assurance that they are
protected against most WLAN security threats. The recommendations should be particularly helpful to
organizations that have made a decision to integrate WLAN technology into their computer networks and
want to determine the best way to do it. The recommendations should also be helpful to organizations
that are already managing WLANs, but are not satisfied with the level of security they provide; they
might want to upgrade, replace, and configure their infrastructure so that it is capable of supporting RSNs
and other security controls.

To be effective, WLAN security should be incorporated throughout the entire life cycle of WLAN
solutions, involving everything from policy to operations. This section references a five-phase life cycle
model to help organizations determine at what point in their WLAN deployments a recommended best
practice might be relevant. The model is based on one introduced in NIST SP 800-64, Security
Considerations in the Information System Development Life Cycle. 96 Organizations may follow a project
management methodology or life cycle model that does not directly map to the phases in the model
presented here, but the types of tasks in the methodology and their sequencing are probably similar. The
phases of the life cycle are as follows:

      Phase 1: Initiation. This phase includes the tasks that an organization should perform before it
       starts to design its WLAN solution. These include providing an overall vision for how the
       WLAN would support the mission of the organization, creating a high-level strategy for the
       WLAN’s implementation, developing a WLAN use policy, and specifying business and
       functional requirements for the solution.
      Phase 2: Acquisition/Development. For the purposes of this guide, the
       Acquisition/Development phase is split into the following two phases:

          –    Phase 2a: Planning and Design. In this phase, WLAN network architects specify the
               technical characteristics of the WLAN solution and related network components. These
               characteristics include the EAP method or methods used to support authentication; the
               protocols used to support communication between AP and AS; access control lists and
               firewall rules to segregate WLAN traffic; and the nature of the supporting PKI. The types of
               clients to be deployed also need to be considered, since they can affect the desired security
               policies. There is a wide variety of supplicants that may or may not support desired EAP
               methods; care must be taken to ensure that the security policy can be employed and enforced
               by all components (client, AP, and AS). A site survey is typically conducted to help
               determine the number and placement of access points, as well as how they integrate into the
               existing network.

          –    Phase 2b: Procurement. This phase involves specifying the number and type of WLAN
               components that must be purchased, the feature sets they must support, and any certifications
               they must hold.
      Phase 3: Implementation. In this phase, procured equipment is first configured to meet
       operational and security requirements, and then installed and activated on a production network.
       Implementation includes altering the configuration of other security controls and technologies,
       such as security event logging, network management, AAA server integration, and PKI.
