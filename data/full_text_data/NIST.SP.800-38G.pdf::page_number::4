                      Reports on Computer Systems Technology

The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical
leadership for the Nation’s measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops tests, test
methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance
the development and productive use of information technology. ITL’s responsibilities include the
development of management, administrative, technical, and physical standards and guidelines for
the cost-effective security and privacy of other than national security-related information in
federal information systems. The Special Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research,
guidelines, and outreach efforts in information system security, and its collaborative activities
with industry, government, and academic organizations.

                                           Abstract

This Recommendation specifies two methods, called FF1 and FF3, for format-preserving
encryption. Both of these methods are modes of operation for an underlying, approved
symmetric-key block cipher algorithm.

                                          Keywords

Block cipher; confidentiality; encryption; FF1; FF3; format-preserving encryption; information
security; mode of operation.

The author gratefully acknowledges the designers of the two algorithms that are specified in this
publication: 1) Mihir Bellare, Phil Rogaway, and Terence Spies; and 2) Eric Brier, Thomas
Peyrin, and Jacques Stern. The author also wishes to thank his colleagues who reviewed drafts of
this publication and contributed to its development, especially Elaine Barker, Lily Chen, John
Kelsey, Meltem Somnez Turan, Kerry McKay, Allen Roginsky, Larry Bassham, Ray Perlner,
Rene Peralta, Jim Foti, Sara Kerman, Andy Regenscheid, Bill Burr, and Tim Polk. The author
also acknowledges the comments from the public and private sectors to improve the quality of
this publication.

                                   Conformance Testing

Conformance testing for implementations of the functions that are specified in this publication
will be conducted within the framework of the Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program
(CAVP) and the Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP). The requirements on these
implementations are indicated by the word “shall.” Some of these requirements may be out-of-
scope for CAVP or CMVP validation testing, and thus are the responsibility of entities using,
implementing, installing, or configuring applications that incorporate this Recommendation.
