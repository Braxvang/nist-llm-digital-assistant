NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1                                                               Guidelines for Media Sanitization


                  The storage device may support configuration capabilities that artificially restrict the ability to
                  access portions of the media as defined in the ATA standard, such as a Host Protected Area
                  (HPA), Device Configuration Overlay (DCO), or Accessible Max Address. Even when a
                  dedicated sanitization command addresses these areas, their presence may affect the ability to
                  reliably verify the effectiveness of the sanitization procedure if left in place. Any configuration
                  options limiting the ability to access the entire addressable area of the storage media should be
                  reset prior to applying the sanitization technique. Recovery data, such as an OEM-provided
                  restoration image may have been stored in this manner, and sanitization may therefore impact
                  the ability to recover the system unless reinstallation media is also available.
                  Not all implementations of encryption are necessarily suitable for reliance upon Cryptographic
                  Erase as a Purge mechanism. The decision regarding whether to use Cryptographic Erase
                  depends upon verification of attributes previously identified in this guidance and in Appendix D.
                  Given the variability in implementation of the Enhanced Secure Erase feature, use of this
                  command is not recommended without first referring the manufacturer to identify that the storage
                  deviceâ€™s model-specific implementation meets the needs of the organization.
                  Whereas ATA Secure Erase was a Purge mechanism for magnetic media, it is only a Clear
                  mechanism for flash memory due to variability in implementation and the possibility that sensitive
                  data may remain in areas such as spare cells that have been rotated out of use.
                  Degaussing must not be solely relied upon as a sanitization technique on flash memory-based
                  storage devices or on hybrid devices that contain non-volatile flash memory storage media.
                  Degaussing may be used when non-volatile flash memory media is present if the flash memory
                  components are sanitized using media-dependent techniques.

   SCSI Solid State Drives (SSSDs) This includes Parallel SCSI, Serial Attached SCSI (SAS), Fibre
   Channel, USB Attached Storage (UAS), and SCSI Express.

   Clear:         Overwrite media by using organizationally approved and tested overwriting
                  technologies/methods/tools. The Clear procedure should consist of at least one pass of writes
                  with a fixed data value, such as all zeros. Multiple passes or more complex values may
                  alternatively be used.
                  Note: It is important to note that overwrite on flash-based media may significantly reduce the
                  effective lifetime of the media and it may not sanitize the data in unmapped physical media (i.e.,
                  the old data may still remain on the media).

   Purge:         Two options are available:
                      1. Apply the SCSI SANITIZE command, if supported. One or both of the following options
                           may be available:
                                a. The BLOCK ERASE service action.
                                b. If the device supports encryption, the CRYPTOGRAPHIC ERASE service
                                     action.
                                     Optionally: After Cryptographic Erase is successfully applied to a device, use
                                     the block erase command (if supported) to block erase the media. If the block
                                     erase command is not supported, the Clear procedure could alternatively be
                                     applied.
                      2. Cryptographic Erase through the TCG Opal SSC or Enterprise SSC interface by
                           issuing commands as necessary to cause all MEKs to be changed. Refer to the TCG
                           and vendors shipping TCG Opal or Enterprise storage devices for more information.
                           Optionally: After Cryptographic Erase is successfully applied to a device, use the block
                           erase command (if supported) to block erase the media. If the block erase command is
                           not supported, the Clear procedure is an acceptable alternative.

   Destroy:       Shred, Disintegrate, Pulverize, or Incinerate by burning the device in a licensed incinerator.


   Notes:         Verification must be performed for each technique within Clear and Purge as described in the
                  Verify Methods subsection.
                  The storage device may support configuration capabilities that artificially restrict the ability to
                  access portions of the media, such as SCSI mode select. Even when a dedicated sanitization
