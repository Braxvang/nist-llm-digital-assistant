364   2.       Lifecycle Activities and Related Requirements
365   This section is normative.
366   The lifecycle activities for a derived PIV credential are initial issuance, maintenance, and
367   termination. At a more detailed level, the lifecycle activities for PKI-based and non-PKI-
368   based derived PIV credentials differ considerably from each other. This section describes
369   these lifecycle activities and provides requirements and recommendations as appropriate.
370   Issuers of derived PIV credentials SHALL document the process for each of the lifecycle
371   activities described below. In accordance with [HSPD-12], the reliability of the derived
372   PIV credential issuer SHALL be established through an official accreditation process.

373   2.1. Derived PIV Credential Lifecycle Activities
374   The derived PIV credential lifecycle consists of the three classes of activities described
375   above. The activities that take place at the manufacturer during fabrication and pre-
376   personalization of the authenticator (as applicable) are not considered part of this lifecycle
377   model. Figure 1 presents the PKI-based derived PIV credential activities alongside the
378   PIV Card lifecycle activities. Figure 2 presents the corresponding lifecycle activities for
379   non-PKI-based derived PIV credentials.

380   The lifecycle of a derived PIV credential begins with the issuance of a derived PIV
381   credential on an approved device or authenticator associated with the applicant. This
382   may be part of the process of issuing a PIV Card or a subsequent process. Mobile devices
383   with derived PIV credentials are managed as described in [SP800-124].
384   The maintenance activities for a PKI-based derived PIV credential are the same as
385   for other X.509 public key certificates. Certificate re-key is typically used to replace

                                                                                                 5
