                                 GUIDE TO PROTECTING THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION (PII)



2.3     PII and Fair Information Practices

The protection of PII and the overall privacy of information are concerns both for individuals whose
personal information is at stake and for organizations that may be liable or have their reputations damaged
should such PII be inappropriately accessed, used, or disclosed. Treatment of PII is distinct from other
types of data because it needs to be not only protected, but also collected, maintained, and disseminated in
accordance with Federal law. 22 The Privacy Act, as well as other U.S. privacy laws, is based on the
widely-recognized Fair Information Practices, also called Privacy Principles. The Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)23 Privacy Guidelines are the most widely-accepted
privacy principles, and they were endorsed by the Department of Commerce in 1981.24 The OECD Fair
Information Practices are also the foundation of privacy laws and related policies in many other countries,
(e.g., Sweden, Australia, Belgium). 25 In 2004, the Chief Information Officers (CIO) Council issued the
Security and Privacy Profile for the Federal Enterprise Architecture 26 that links privacy protection with a
set of acceptable privacy principles corresponding to the OECD‘s Fair Information Practices.

The OECD identified the following Fair Information Practices.

 Collection Limitation—There should be limits to the collection of personal data and any such data
  should be obtained by lawful and fair means and, where appropriate, with the knowledge or consent
  of the data subject.
 Data Quality—Personal data should be relevant to the purposes for which they are to be used, and, to
  the extent necessary for those purposes, should be accurate, complete and kept up-to-date.
 Purpose Specification—The purposes for which personal data are collected should be specified not
  later than at the time of data collection and the subsequent use limited to the fulfillment of those
  purposes or such others as are not incompatible with those purposes and as are specified on each
  occasion of change of purpose.
 Use Limitation—Personal data should not be disclosed, made available or otherwise used for
  purposes other than those specified, except with the consent of the data subject or by the authority of
  law.
 Security Safeguards—Personal data should be protected by reasonable security safeguards against
  such risks as loss or unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification or disclosure of data.
 Openness—There should be a general policy of openness about developments, practices and policies
  with respect to personal data. Means should be readily available of establishing the existence and
  nature of personal data, and the main purposes of their use, as well as the identity and usual residence
  of the data controller.
 Individual Participation—An individual should have the right: (a) to obtain from a data controller,
  or otherwise, confirmation of whether or not the data controller has data relating to him; (b) to have
  communicated to him, data relating to him within a reasonable time; at a charge, if any, that is not
  excessive; in a reasonable manner; and in a form that is readily intelligible to him; (c) to be given

      This document focuses on protecting the confidentiality of PII. Protecting the privacy of PII is a broader subject, and
      information about the Fair Information Practices is provided to increase reader awareness and to improve reader
      understanding of the relationship between privacy and security.
