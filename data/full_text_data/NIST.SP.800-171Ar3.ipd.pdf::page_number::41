1169           REQUIREMENT: 03.04.02

1170           ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE
1171           Determine if:
1172           A.03.04.02.ODP[01]: configuration settings for the system that reflect the most restrictive
1173           mode consistent with operational requirements are defined.
1174           A.03.04.02.a[01]: the following configuration settings for the system that reflect the most
1175           restrictive mode consistent with operational requirements are established and documented:
1176           <A.03.04.02.ODP[01] configuration settings>.
1177           A.03.04.02.a[02]: the following configuration settings for the system are implemented:
1178           <A.03.04.02.ODP[01] configuration settings>.
1179           A.03.04.02.b[01]: any deviations from established configuration settings are identified and
1180           documented.
1181           A.03.04.02.b[02]: any deviations from established configuration settings are approved.

1182           ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS
1183           Examine
1184           [SELECT FROM: configuration management policy and procedures; procedures for system
1185           configuration settings; configuration management plan; system design documentation; system
1186           configuration settings; common secure configuration checklists; system component inventory;
1187           evidence supporting approved deviations from established configuration settings; change control
1188           records; system data processing and retention permissions; system audit records; system
1189           security plan; other relevant documents or records]
1190           Interview
1191           [SELECT FROM: personnel with security configuration management responsibilities; personnel
1192           with information security responsibilities; system administrators]
1193           Test
1194           [SELECT FROM: processes for managing configuration settings; mechanisms that implement,
1195           monitor, and/or control system configuration settings; mechanisms that identify and/or document
1196           deviations from established configuration settings]
