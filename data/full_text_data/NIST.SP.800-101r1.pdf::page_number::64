certain area at a certain time) [Wil03]. The analysis of the initial set of records obtained usually
leads to additional requests for related records of other subscribers and equipment, based on
the data uncovered. For example, frequent calls to a victimâ€™s mobile device from one or more
other mobile devices before a homicide would logically lead to interest in obtaining the records
of the caller(s).

CDRs can be analyzed for a variety of purposes. For example, a service provider may use
them to understand the calling patterns of their subscribers and the performance of the network
[Aja06]. Call detail records can also be used with cell site tower information obtained from the
service provider to translate cell identifiers into geographical locations for the cells involved
and identify the general locale from which calls were placed. While plotting call record
locations and information onto a map can sometimes be useful, it does not necessarily provide
a complete and accurate picture. Cell towers can service phones at distances of up to 35
kilometers (approximately 21 miles) and may service several distinct sectors. Radio frequency
coverage maps maintained by the service provider can be obtained to create a more exact
portrayal of the data for the sectors involved. The results of the data analysis can be used to
determine the location of the mobile device at a given time [Oco09]. The analysis can also help
to establish timelines and identify possible co-conspirators [Mil08]. A change of cell identifier
between the beginning and the end of a call, over a series of calls, may also indicate a general
direction of travel or pattern of behavior.

The boundaries of a cell are somewhat variable. Various factors, such as terrain, seasonal
changes, antenna performance, and call loading, affect the coverage area of cells and the
plausible locale to associate with a call record. Detailed field tests and measurements may be
required to ensure an accurate analysis. Tools exist to aid law enforcement in performing cell
site analysis and mapping activities independently. In some situations, such as densely
populated urban locations involving microcells or picocells with a limited coverage area,
location determination may be relatively straightforward by the very nature of the network.

Identifying the geographical coverage of specific cells may provide valuable information when
combined with call detail records, geographically establishing plausible locations with some
degree of certainty for the times involved. Professional criminals are aware of these
capabilities and may attempt to turn them to their advantage by having someone use their
mobile device to establish a false alibi. Attempts at evasion may also occur. A common ploy
used is to purchase, use, and quickly dispose of pay-as-you-go prepaid phones to minimize
exposure or use stolen phones. To obfuscate usage and complicate analysis of records, a
variety of different UICCs may be swapped among different GSM/UMTS mobile devices.

Careful analysis of the call records in conjunction with other forms of available data may be
useful establishing the relationship between the mobile device and its owner. For example, call
detail records of pay-as-you-go prepaid phones are maintained by and available from network
providers, the same as for contract subscriptions. By analyzing the patterns and content of
communications and mapping the dat to known associates of a suspect, ownership of such
phones is possible to establish. Other traditional forms of forensic evidence (e.g.,
fingerprinting, DNA) may also be used to establish ownership.

Network traffic information quantifying the amount of data transferred to/from the device is
also frequently reported and may aid an investigator in specific investigations.
