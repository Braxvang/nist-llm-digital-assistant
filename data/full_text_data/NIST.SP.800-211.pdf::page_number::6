     REPORTS ON COMPUTER SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY
     The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Information Technology
     Laboratory (ITL) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical
     leadership for the Nation’s measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops tests,
     test methods, reference data, proof-of-concept implementations, and technical analyses
     to advance the development and productive use of information technology. ITL’s
     responsibilities include the development of management, administrative, technical, and
     physical standards and guidelines for the cost-effective security and privacy of national
     security-related information in federal information systems. The Special Publication
     800-series reports on ITL’s research, guidelines, and outreach efforts in information
     system security and its collaborative activities with industry, government, and academic
     organizations.


     ABSTRACT
     During Fiscal Year 2019 (FY 2019), from October 1, 2018 through September 30, 2019,
     the NIST Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) Cybersecurity and Privacy Program
     successfully responded to numerous challenges and opportunities in security and
     privacy. This annual report highlights the FY 2019 research agenda and activities for
     the ITL Cybersecurity and Privacy Program, including: the ongoing participation and
     development of international standards; the enhancement of privacy and security
     risk management models, including those for the protection of controlled unclassified
     information (CUI), systems engineering and cyber resiliency, supply chains, and
     mobile technologies; the continued advancement of cryptographic technologies,
     including updates to Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) Publication 140-3,
     Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules, and preparation for post-quantum
     cryptographic methods; and improved infrastructure protection in areas such as zero
     trust architectures and advanced networking security. NIST maintained a strong focus
     on supporting small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), including updates to the
     Small Business Cybersecurity Corner website to make resources easier to find and use,
     and drawing on contributed cybersecurity resources and feedback received from federal
     partners and the public.
