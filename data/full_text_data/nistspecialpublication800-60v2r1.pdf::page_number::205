threat to human life or result in a loss of major assets. In such cases, confidentiality impact level
is high.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: For most Federal law enforcement systems that
support criminal apprehension activities the harm that results from unauthorized disclosure will
be limited. Therefore, the provisional confidentiality impact level recommended for criminal
apprehension information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of criminal apprehension information
may depend on the urgency with which the information is needed and on the success of
subsequent prosecution of the apprehended criminal(s). Unauthorized modification or
destruction of information affecting external communications (e.g., web pages, electronic mail)
may adversely affect operations and/or public confidence in the agency, but the damage to the
mission would usually be limited.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Unauthorized modification or destruction
of criminal apprehension information may have an adverse effect on the subsequent prosecution
of the apprehended criminal. Consequently, a serious adverse effect on agency operations can
result. This can place the agency at a significant disadvantage. In such cases, the integrity
impact level recommended for criminal apprehension information is at least moderate. When
the criminal apprehension information is time-critical, the unauthorized modification or
destruction of this information may have a severe or catastrophic effect on public confidence in
the agency, pose a significant threat to major assets, and/or pose a threat to human life. This is
applicable for many crimes that are the responsibility of Federal law enforcement agencies. For
this criminal apprehension information, the Recommended Integrity Impact Level is high.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: For most Federal law enforcement systems that support
criminal apprehension activities the harm that results from unauthorized modification or
destruction will be limited. Therefore, the provisional integrity impact level recommended for
criminal apprehension information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to criminal apprehension information.
Missions supported by criminal apprehension information are not typically tolerant of delay.
While there are many cases in which elements of criminal apprehension information are not
urgent, there are many in which relatively short periods of unavailability can pose a threat to
human life and/or result in a loss of major assets.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
most criminal apprehension information is moderate.
