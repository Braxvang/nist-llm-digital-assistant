4.2.3   Identify Options and Risks

In this last step of the assessment phase, decision makers should begin to identify options and risks. The
baseline showed the current environment, and the opportunities and barriers step began to describe the
desired target. In this step, the “how-to” becomes clearer.

The “how-to” step will determine the service arrangement. As discussed in Chapter 3, organizations may
fulfill a security service requirement using various security service arrangements—from using only
internal teams and staff to fully outsourcing for the security service. At this life-cycle phase, many
organizations will still need to consider many options and various service arrangements. For each of
these, the organization needs to identify the benefits and risks.

Finally, the evidence may suggest the current arrangement and service level are effective and/or
appropriate. It is most important to focus on business function, customers, and effective security. The
choices made should best support these three focus points. Improving business and IT processes will
likely be more effective and less risky than changing the service arrangement; organizations should not
seek to change the current environment unless the assessment identifies improvement areas that can be
met only by implementing a change in service, service arrangement, or service provider.
