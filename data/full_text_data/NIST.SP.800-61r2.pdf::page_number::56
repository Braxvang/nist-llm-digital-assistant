Team-to-       Team-to-team relationships exist whenever         The information most frequently shared in team-to-

Coordinating   Relationships between multiple coordinating       The type of information shared by coordinating

coordinating   to share information relating to cross-cutting    periodical summaries during “steady state”
team           incidents which may affect multiple               operations, punctuated by the exchange of tactical,
               communities. The coordinating teams act on        technical details, response plans, and impact or risk

               and reusable mitigation strategies to assist in
               inter-community response.


Organizations may find it challenging to build the relationships needed for coordination. Good places to
start building a community include the industry sector that the organization belongs to and the geographic
region where the organization operates. An organization’s incident response team can try to form
relationships with other teams (at the team-to-team level) within its own industry sector and region, or
join established bodies within the industry sector that already facilitate information sharing. Another
consideration for building relationships is that some relationships are mandatory and others voluntary; for
example, team-to-coordinating team relationships are often mandatory, while team-to-team relationships
are usually voluntary. Organizations pursue voluntary relationships because they fulfill mutual self-
interests. Mandatory relationships are usually defined by a regulatory body within the industry or by
another entity.

4.1.2   Sharing Agreements and Reporting Requirements

Organizations trying to share information with external organizations should consult with their legal
department before initiating any coordination efforts. There may be contracts or other agreements that
need to be put into place before discussions occur. An example is a nondisclosure agreement (NDA) to
protect the confidentiality of the organization’s most sensitive information. Organizations should also
consider any existing requirements for reporting, such as sharing incident information with an ISAC or
reporting incidents to a higher-level CIRT.
