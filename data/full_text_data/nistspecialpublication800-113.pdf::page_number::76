                                                                                           GUIDE TO SSL VPNS



 Transport Layer Solution: SSL VPN. The organization could provide an SSL VPN between the
  remote users and the office over the Internet. Network extension is the most flexible option because
  it provides broad access for users into an internal network.
 Application Layer Solution: Application Modification. The organization could modify every
  application required for remote access. Applications such as SSH are already supported for remote
  access. Due to the broad range of relevant applications, it is not considered feasible to modify all of
  them.
The organization decides to develop an SSL VPN solution. This solution will complement and not
replace the existing IPsec VPN services. It is assumed that some users will stay with the IPsec solution,
but others will migrate to SSL VPN over time. The organization purchases a commercial appliance with
a support contract to ensure the existence of vendor support.

7.2     Designing the Solution

The organization goes through the process described in Section 4.3 to design the SSL VPN solution. It
first designs an access control policy to determine who can access internal resources and under what
conditions. The next step is to create an endpoint security policy that enforces access control, usually
with host integrity checks. Creating an authentication infrastructure follows, and designing the
architecture and deciding on encryption are the last steps.

7.2.1     Access Control Policy

The organization goes through the four major steps to designing an access control policy that are
described in Section 4.3.1:

      1. List the resources that will be accessed through the SSL VPN. Users should have access to all
         internal network resources, so these resources can all be grouped together. If a specific resource
         such as a file share or database requires additional authentication, then this takes place when a
         user accesses the resource. The only exception to this policy of grouping all resources is a set of
         HR applications that only a small set of external users is authorized to access. Note that these
         users may not access the other internal resources that other users can access.

      2. List the groups or users. Most users are in one main group that has network connectivity to all
         internal resources. A smaller group is composed of external users that have access to the set of
         HR applications mentioned in the previous step.

      3. List the conditions under which the resources should be accessible by the groups. There are
         several conditions for accessing resources:

          –   Users must use hosts managed by the organization to gain access to internal resources. These
              organization-managed hosts all have a system registry key installed that can be checked to
              verify their identity.

          –   Users who login from systems in a public location such as a kiosk or Internet café or use their
              personal computers can only access a limited set of Web-based applications such as email,
              calendaring, and employee phone directory.

          –   The small group of external users that access the HR applications must also use organization-
              managed hosts to gain access to these applications.
