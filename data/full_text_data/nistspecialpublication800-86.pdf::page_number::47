complicated by unintentional or intentional discrepancies in time settings among systems. Knowing the
time, date, and time zone settings for a computer whose data will be analyzed can greatly assist an
analyst; Section 5 describes this in more detail.
It is usually beneficial to analysts if an organization maintains its systems with accurate timestamping.
The Network Time Protocol (NTP) synchronizes the time on a computer with an atomic clock run by
NIST or other organizations. Synchronization helps ensure that each system maintains a reasonably
accurate measurement of time.
If multiple tools are used to complete an examination and analysis, the analyst should understand how
each tool extracts, modifies, and displays file modification, access, and creation (MAC) times. For
instance, some tools modify the last access time of a file or directory if the filesystem has been mounted
with write permissions by the OS. Write-blockers can be used to prevent these tools from modifying the
MAC times; however, although write-blockers can prevent these times from being modified on the media,
they cannot prevent the OS from caching the changes in memory (i.e., storing the changes in random
access memory [RAM]). The OS might then report the cached MAC times rather than the actual times,
thereby returning inaccurate results. The analyst should be aware that the last access time for data files
and directories might change between queries, depending on the tool used to perform the query. Because
of these issues, analysts should take care in choosing a MAC viewing method and record the details of
that method.
Analysts can use special tools that can generate forensic timelines based on event data. Such tools
typically give analysts a graphical interface for viewing and analyzing sequences of events. A common
feature of these tools is to permit analysts to group related events into meta-events. This helps analysts to
get a “big picture” view of events.
In many cases, forensic analysis involves not only data from files, but also data from other sources, such
as the OS state, network traffic, or applications. Section 8 provides examples of how data from files and
data from other sources can be correlated through analysis.
4.5     Recommendations

The key recommendations presented in this section for using data from data files are as follows.

      ! Analysts should examine copies of files, not the original files. During the collection phase, the
        analyst should make multiple copies of the desired files or filesystems, typically a master copy
        and a working copy. The analyst can then work with the working copy of the files without
        affecting the original files or the master copy. A bit stream image should be performed if
        evidence may be needed for prosecution or disciplinary actions, or if preserving file times is
        important.
      ! Analysts should preserve and verify file integrity. Using a write-blocker during backups and
        imaging prevents a computer from writing to its storage media. The integrity of copied data
        should be verified by computing and comparing the message digests of files. Backups and
        images should be accessed as read-only whenever possible; write-blockers can also be used to
        prevent writes to the backup or image file or restored backup or image.
      ! Analysts should rely on file headers, not file extensions, to identify file content types.
        Because users can assign any file extension to a file, analysts should not assume that file
        extensions are accurate. Analysts can identify the type of data stored in many files by looking at
        their file headers. Although people can alter file headers to conceal actual file types, this is much
        less common than altering file extensions.
