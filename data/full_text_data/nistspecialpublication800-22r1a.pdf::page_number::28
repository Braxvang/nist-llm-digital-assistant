A STATISTICAL TEST SUITE FOR RANDOM AND PSEUDORANDOM NUMBER GENERATORS FOR CRYPTOGRAPHIC APPLICATIONS



ones and zeros of various lengths is as expected for a random sequence. In particular, this test determines
whether the oscillation between such zeros and ones is too fast or too slow.

2.3.2 Function Call
Runs(n), where:

        n        The length of the bit string.

Additional inputs for the function, but supplied by the testing code:

        ε        The sequence of bits as generated by the RNG or PRNG being tested; this exists as a
                 global structure at the time of the function call; ε = ε1, ε2, … , εn.

2.3.3   Test Statistic and Reference Distribution
        Vn(obs):       The total number of runs (i.e., the total number of zero runs + the total number of
                       one-runs) across all n bits.

The reference distribution for the test statistic is a χ2 distribution.

2.3.4 Test Description
Note: The Runs test carries out a Frequency test as a prerequisite.

                                                                                          ∑jε j
(1)     Compute the pre-test proportion π of ones in the input sequence: π =                      .
                                                                                             n

        For example, if ε = 1001101011, then n=10 and π = 6/10 = 3/5.

(2)     Determine if the prerequisite Frequency test is passed: If it can be shown that π - 1 2             ≥ τ , then the

        Runs test need not be performed (i.e., the test should not have been run because of a failure to
        pass test 1, the Frequency (Monobit) test). If the test is not applicable, then the P-value is set to
        0.0000. Note that for this test, τ = 2 has been pre-defined in the test code.
                                                 n


        For the example in this section, since τ = 2             ≈ 0.63246 , then |π - 1/2| = | 3/5 – 1/2 | = 0.1 < τ,
                                                            10
        and the test is not run.

        Since the observed value π is within the selected bounds, the runs test is applicable.

                                               n−1
(3)     Compute the test statistic Vn ( obs ) = ∑ r( k ) + 1 , where r(k)=0 if εk=εk+1, and r(k)=1 otherwise.
                                               k =1


        Since ε = 1 00 11 0 1 0 11, then

                          V10(obs)=(1+0+1+0+1+1+1+1+0)+1=7.

                                     |V n (obs) − 2nπ (1− π ) | 
(4)     Compute P-value = erfc                                  .
                                           2 2nπ (1− π )        
                                                                



                                                           2-6
