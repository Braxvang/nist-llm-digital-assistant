       NIST SP 800-50r1 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                                Building a Cybersecurity and
       August 2023                                                                                  Privacy Learning Program

2188   significant cybersecurity or privacy responsibilities
2189   The preferred terminology herein for identifying those whose roles in the organization necessitate ongoing role-
2190   based training. These individuals have work-related responsibilities beyond those of All Users and will need to
2191   participate in general as well as specialized Learning Program activities.
2192            NOTE: From FISMA FY2014 CIO Metrics [12]: Those with significant cybersecurity responsibilities
2193            include all users who have one or more privileged network user account and all other users who have
2194            managerial or operational responsibilities that allow them to increase or decrease cybersecurity.

2195   synchronous training
2196   Training in which instructors and students are scheduled to participate together, whether it is in a virtual or a
2197   physical classroom-based learning environment.

2198   tabletop materials
2199   Materials designed for a discussion-based exercise where personnel with roles and responsibilities in a particular IT
2200   plan meet in a classroom setting or in breakout groups to discuss their roles during an emergency and their responses
2201   to a particular emergency situation. A facilitator initiates the discussion by presenting a scenario and asking
2202   questions based on the scenario.
2203            NOTE: From NIST SP 800-84, Tabletop exercises typically include the following documentation:
2204            o    Briefing. A briefing is created for the participants; it includes an agenda and logistics information.
2205            o    Facilitator Guide. The facilitator guide includes the following:
2206                 –   The purpose for conducting the exercise
2207                 –   The exercise’s scope and objectives
2208                 –   The exercise’s scenario, which is a sequential, narrative account of a hypothetical incident that
2209                     provides the catalyst for the exercise and is intended to introduce situations that will inspire
2210                     responses and thus allow demonstration of the exercise objectives
2211                 –   A list of questions regarding the scenario that address the exercise objectives14
2212                 –   A copy of the IT plan being exercised.
2213            The types of questions documented in the facilitator guide should be tailored to the participants. For
2214            example, if senior-level personnel are the participants, the questions should be of a more general, high-level
2215            nature and focus on decision-making and oversight, which are consistent with their roles and
2216            responsibilities within the plan. If operational personnel are the participants, the questions should typically
2217            be focused on specific procedures and processes that are followed to carry out roles and responsibilities.
2218            o    Participant Guide. The participant guide includes the same information as the facilitator guide without
2219                 the list of questions. Participant guides contain a modified, shorter list of questions to orient
2220                 participants to the types of issues that may be discussed during the exercise.
2221            o    After Action Report.

2222   training
2223   Instruction to enhance the employee’s capacity to perform specific job functions and tasks. It is a learning activity
2224   that focuses on skills, concepts, knowledge, and attitudes related to performing a job. It is designed to change what
2225   employees know and how they work.
2226            NOTE: References to training in US law: See U.S. Code § 4101 – Definitions [14]: (4) “training” means
2227            the process of providing for and making available to an employee, and placing or enrolling the employee
2228            in, a planned, prepared, and coordinated program, course, curriculum, subject, system, or routine of
2229            instruction or education, in scientific, professional, technical, mechanical, trade, clerical, fiscal,
2230            administrative, or other fields which will improve individual and organizational performance and assist in
2231            achieving the agency’s mission and performance goals.
