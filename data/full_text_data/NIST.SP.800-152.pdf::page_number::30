                         Figure 2: CKMS Security Policy Configurations

An FCKMS Security Policy is intended to support the Information Security Policy of the
FCKMS service-using organization(s) by specifying the rules for managing the cryptographic
keys and metadata used to protect the information. An FCKMS Security Policy may be a
configured subset of the designerâ€™s CKMS Security Policy, which specifically meets Federal
government requirements and also the specific requirements of the service-using
organization(s). See Figure 2 for an example.

Figure 2 depicts a CKMS Security Policy (in the top-level box) with general features and
capabilities, as well as optional features/capabilities that can be selected or prohibited to
create a sub-policy appropriate for a specific CKMS service provider. The green text is used
to indicate features that are compliant with the United States Government (USG)
requirements of this document. Options A, C, and D (indicated in green text) are all approved
for USG use. However, Option B (indicated by red text) is not approved. For example,
Option B may involve the use of a cryptographic algorithm that is not approved for USG use.
The second-level boxes show three possible configurations that could be selected using the
CKMS options. Configuration 1 contains Options A, C, and D; Configuration 2 contains
Options A and B; and Configuration 3 contains only Option B. Configuration 1 can always
function as an FCKMS, since all its features and options are consistent with USG use.
Configuration 2 can function as an FCKMS when Option A is used, but it can function only
as a CKMS when Option B is used. Finally, Configuration 3 can never function as an
FCKMS, since the non-approved Option B is always used. Federal agencies could always
                                                    20
