This Framework is not intended to be a CKMS design. That task is left to the CKMS
designers. Rather, the Framework provides specification requirements using lists of
options that the designers may choose to incorporate in their design.

This Framework specifies documentation requirements, not security requirements. It does
not mandate particular security features. The requirements of this Framework are placed
on the CKMS design documentation. The Framework aids the designer by providing the
essential implementation choices that form the basis of a good CKMS design. The
specific choices that ensure a secure CKMS are left to the designer or to other documents,
such as security profiles that are based on this Framework.

This Framework does not mandate requirements for the protection of the information
belonging to a given public or private sector (e.g., the U.S. Government, the financial
industry, or health care services). It is anticipated that sectors will either develop their
own profiles, or they will adopt the profiles of other sectors that fulfill their own
requirements.

Requirements for conformance to this Framework are indicated by a “shall” statement.
Recommendations are indicated by the use of “should”, but are not requirements for
compliance with this Framework. The words “must” or “need(s) to” convey assumptions
upon which this Framework is based, but do not constitute a specific requirement on the
CKMS design documentation. In this Framework, “FR:i.j” indicates the jth Framework
Requirement in Section i.

FR:1.1 A conformant CKMS design shall meet all “shall” requirements of the
Framework.

Since the requirements in this Framework are documentation requirements, it may be
adequate to address a requirement by stating that the feature specified in the requirement
is not implemented in the CKMS. In many requirements, the words “if, how, where, and
under what circumstances” may appear. The “if” indicates a conditional requirement. If
the answer to the “if” question is “no” then the designer is expected to address the
requirement by indicating why the condition does not apply. If the answer to the “if”
question is “yes”, then the designer is expected to address the requirement by providing
the information levied by the requirement. The “how” response should address how the
requirement is met (i.e., how it will be implemented, enforced, and used). The “where”
response should address where (logically in the system) the implementing mechanism is
located. Finally, the “under what circumstances” response addresses the conditions that
must apply before the mechanism is used.

A CKMS design that adequately addresses, specifies, and satisfies all the requirements
specified herein can be considered as conforming to, and complying with, this
Framework. A conformant CKMS design can be compared to another conformant CKMS
design by examining the design specifications meeting each requirement.
