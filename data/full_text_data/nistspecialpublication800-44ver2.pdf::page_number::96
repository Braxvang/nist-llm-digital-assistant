network-based IDPS to detect attacks. Network-based IDPSs are also more susceptible to being disabled
by DoS attacks (even those not directly targeted at the IDPS). Also, depending on how the network-based
IDPS is integrated into the network, it is possible to negatively affect the availability of the network in the
event of an IDPS hardware failure.

Both host-based and network-based IDPSs require frequent updates to their attack signature databases so
that they can recognize new attacks. An IDPS that is not updated frequently will fail to recognize the
latest (and often most popular) attacks. Both types of IDPSs may be limited in their ability to detect zero-
day attacks because it is unlikely that an appropriate signature is available. A host-based IDPS may have
a better chance of detecting a zero-day attack because it is better able to detect the actions taken by an
attacker after a successful exploit (e.g., new unauthorized privileged accounts, installation of malicious
software).

File integrity checkers are a simple form of host-based IDPS. A file integrity checker computes and
stores a hash for every file of interest and establishes a database of file hashes. It provides a tool for
system administrators to recognize changes to files, particularly unauthorized changes. File integrity
checkers are available as standalone products and bundled with other host-based IDPS techniques. Some
host-based IDPSs can monitor file access attempts and stop suspicious attempts to read, modify, delete,
and execute files. A host-based IDPS with this capability could be configured to protect important Web
server files.

To successfully protect a Web server using an IDPS, ensure that the IDPS is configured to—

 Monitor network traffic to and from the Web server

 Monitor changes to critical files on the Web server (file integrity checking capability) 70

 Monitor the system resources available on the Web server host (host-based)

 Block (in conjunction with the firewall) IP addresses or subnets that are attacking the organizational
  network

 Notify the appropriate parties (e.g., IDPS administrator, Web server administrator, incident response
  team) of suspected attacks through appropriate means according to the organizational incident
  response policy and procedures

 Detect as wide a variety of scanning and attacks as possible with an acceptable level of false positives

 Log events, including the following details:

      Time/date

      Sensor IP address

      Manufacturer-specific attack name

      Standard attack name (if one exists)

     Certain critical files, such as files storing user passwords and log files, will change regularly and thus should not be
     protected by a file integrity checker. This tendency will vary depending on the Web server and OS employed.
