      NIST SP 800-50r1 ipd                                                                                      Building a Cybersecurity and
      August 2023                                                                                                 Privacy Learning Program

765   Learning Program Managers should build programs with efficient data gathering techniques to
766   provide effective reporting information. This will likely include collecting PII on employees that
767   may carry a heightened sensitivity due to context (e.g., training records are often part of
768   employment or contract records and can be tied to performance evaluations or result in
769   consequences for failing to take required training). Learning Program Managers must identify
770   and manage the cybersecurity and privacy risks associated with processing learning data,
771   including risks associated with learning management systems and reporting practices.
772   Developing a CPLP metrics plan can be one of the most important yet most challenging parts of
773   the CPLP effort. An effective set of measurements can help the program get support from the
774   organization, increase funding, reveal impact on the cybersecurity risk management program,
775   and demonstrate returns on investment. In recent research efforts by NIST, participants reported
776   [10] that despite best intentions, their organizations often used a limited number of metrics that
777   did not provide a complete view of program effectiveness. NIST SP 800-55 Performance
778   Measurement Guide for Information Security provides guidance on the selection, development,
779   and aggregation of information security measures and developing an information security
780   measurement program. 9
781   Examples of Quantitative Learning Program Data:
782                •    Cybersecurity incident data, limited to employee-generated incidents or topics that
783                     can be mitigated or addressed in the learning programs
784                •    Metrics on incident reporting, demonstrating employee ability to recognize and report
785                     potential cybersecurity events
786                •    Phishing or other simulated attack responses
787                •    Longitudinal data that depicts program impact over time
788                •    Employee testing data before the learning program, immediately after the learning
789                     program, and three months after attending the course to assess knowledge retention
790                •    Performance data by department, including technical performance measures
791                •    Training attendance, performance assessments, and completion rates
792                •    Closed-ended (quantitative) employee survey feedback
793                •    Cost of development and delivery invested per participant
794                •    Frequency of updating the training material may be used to evaluate relevancy
795                •    Extent of cybersecurity or privacy events, such as reduced downtime or outages due
796                     to events (these may be indicators for role-based training)
797                •    Ability to recognize and report privacy information disclosures or misuse
798                •    Changes following technical training may also provide measurements, such as
799                     reduction of accounts with privileged access, identification of high value assets, new
800                     network segmentation, or additional controls written in acquisition and budget
801                     documentation
