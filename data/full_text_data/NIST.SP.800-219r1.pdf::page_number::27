Creating the macOS Security Compliance Tool and configuration profiles
Using the generate_guidance.py script, create the macOS Security Compliance Tool and
configuration profiles. The example below illustrates this, continuing from the previous example.

Running a compliance scan
As the example below shows, the macOS Security Compliance Tool is typically run with
administrator privileges so that it can access all of the settings.
