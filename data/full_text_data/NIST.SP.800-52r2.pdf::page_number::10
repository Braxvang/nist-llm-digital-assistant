NIST SP 800-52 REV. 2                                                               GUIDELINES FOR TLS IMPLEMENTATIONS



1       Introduction

Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols are used to secure communications in a wide variety of
online transactions, such as financial transactions (e.g., banking, trading stocks, e-commerce),
healthcare transactions (e.g., viewing medical records or scheduling medical appointments), and
social transactions (e.g., email or social networking). Any network service that handles sensitive
or valuable data, whether it is personally identifiable information (PII), financial data, or login
information, needs to adequately protect that data. TLS provides a protected channel for sending
data between a server and a client. The client is often, but not always, a web browser.
Memorandum M-15-13 2 requires that all publicly accessible federal websites and web services
only provide service through a secure connection. 3 The initiative to secure connections will
enhance privacy and prevent modification of the data from government sites in transit.

TLS is a layered protocol that runs on top of a reliable transport protocolâ€”typically the
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). Application protocols, such as the Hypertext Transfer
Protocol (HTTP) and the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP), can run above TLS. TLS is
application-independent and used to provide security to any two communicating applications that
transmit data over a network via an application protocol.

1.1     History of TLS

The Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol was designed by the Netscape Corporation to meet the
security needs of client and server applications. Version 1 of SSL was never released. SSL 2.0
was released in 1995 but had well-known security vulnerabilities, which were addressed by the
1996 release of SSL 3.0. During this timeframe, the Microsoft Corporation released a protocol
known as Private Communications Technology (PCT) and later released a higher-performance
protocol known as the Secure Transport Layer Protocol (STLP). PCT and STLP never
commanded the market share that SSL 2.0 and SSL 3.0 commanded. The Internet Engineering
Task Force (IETF), a technical working group responsible for developing Internet standards to
ensure communications compatibility across different implementations, attempted to resolve
security engineering and protocol incompatibility issues between the protocols as best it could.
The IETF standards track Transport Layer Security protocol Version 1.0 (TLS 1.0) emerged and
was codified by the IETF as Request for Comments (RFC) 2246 [23]. While TLS 1.0 is based on
SSL 3.0, and the differences between them are not dramatic, they are significant enough that
TLS 1.0 and SSL 3.0 do not interoperate.

TLS 1.1, specified in RFC 4346 [24], was developed to address weaknesses discovered in TLS
1.0, primarily in the areas of initialization vector selection and padding error processing.
Initialization vectors were made explicit 4 to prevent a certain class of attacks on the Cipher

    message.
