IA-5      AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT

          Control: The organization manages information system authenticators by: (i) defining initial
          authenticator content; (ii) establishing administrative procedures for initial authenticator
          distribution, for lost/compromised, or damaged authenticators, and for revoking authenticators;
          (iii) changing default authenticators upon information system installation; and (iv)
          changing/refreshing authenticators periodically.
          Supplemental Guidance: Information system authenticators include, for example, tokens, PKI
          certificates, biometrics, passwords, and key cards. Users take reasonable measures to safeguard
          authenticators including maintaining possession of their individual authenticators, not loaning or
          sharing authenticators with others, and reporting lost or compromised authenticators immediately.
          For password-based authentication, the information system: (i) protects passwords from
          unauthorized disclosure and modification when stored and transmitted; (ii) prohibits passwords
          from being displayed when entered; (iii) enforces password minimum and maximum lifetime
          restrictions; and (iv) prohibits password reuse for a specified number of generations. For PKI-
          based authentication, the information system: (i) validates certificates by constructing a
          certification path to an accepted trust anchor; (ii) establishes user control of the corresponding
          private key; and (iii) maps the authenticated identity to the user account. In accordance with OMB
          policy and related E-authentication initiatives, authentication of public users accessing federal
          information systems (and associated authenticator management) may also be required to protect
          nonpublic or privacy-related information. FIPS 201 and Special Publications 800-73, 800-76, and
          800-78 specify a personal identity verification (PIV) credential for use in the unique identification
          and authentication of federal employees and contractors. NIST Special Publication 800-63
          provides guidance on remote electronic authentication.
          Control Enhancements: None.

IA-6      AUTHENTICATOR FEEDBACK

          Control: The information system obscures feedback of authentication information during the
          authentication process to protect the information from possible exploitation/use by unauthorized
          individuals.
          Supplemental Guidance: The feedback from the information system does not provide information
          that would allow an unauthorized user to compromise the authentication mechanism. Displaying
          asterisks when a user types in a password is an example of obscuring feedback of authentication
          information.
          Control Enhancements: None.
