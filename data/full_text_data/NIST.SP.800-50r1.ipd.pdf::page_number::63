1920   working with functional managers and other staff may help in the development of measurable
1921   objectives to assess behavioral changes.

1922   5.3.1. Instructor Evaluation
1923   Each CPLP will determine whether they can support a dedicated in-house team of instructors.
1924   Others may need to use contractors to implement courses and training. In some organizations, the
1925   cybersecurity Learning Program Manager is also the privacy Learning Program Manager and
1926   lead instructor for all of the above. Regardless of the size of the organization, it is important to
1927   consider the required skills of the instructor. Learning Program Managers should work with
1928   leadership to find the right instructors for their personnel and their CPLP’s learning objectives. It
1929   is also important to monitor the performance of instructors via observation and other forms of
1930   feedback.
1931   Instructors can also give feedback on the learning material. Learning Program Managers should
1932   work with the instructors to review the material for effectiveness. Instructors frequently provide
1933   feedback on:
1934      •   Perceived accuracy
1935      •   Ease of instruction and ease of learner understanding
1936      •   Adequacy of materials to support content
1937      •   Relevance and timeliness of materials

1938   5.3.2. Learner Performance and Feedback
1939   An effective CPLP will include evaluations of learner performance and ask personnel for
1940   feedback.
1941   There are many techniques for addressing how well the learner has absorbed the content and will
1942   be able to apply it. The most common technique for measuring learner performance is the use of
1943   in-course or post-course evaluations. Questions or assessments should be developed at a level
1944   commensurate with both the complexity of the material and the level of understanding expected
1945   of the learner. Note: these evaluations won’t show whether there was long-term learning or
1946   application of that learning. Refer back to other ways of measuring employee behaviors as a
1947   long-term way to measure learner performance. Additionally, these measures should be
1948   aggregated across the workforce or a group, not necessarily attributed to a unique learner.
1949   As needed, the Learning Program Manager should work with other functional managers to
1950   identify weaknesses in the knowledge and skills of personnel, whether individually or by role, to
1951   determine where results do not match the goals and learning objectives for each training element.
1952   Helping personnel to provide CPLP feedback is recommended for encouraging a sense of shared
1953   responsibility in the cybersecurity and privacy culture of the organization. Learning Program
1954   Managers should consider how they can provide easy feedback mechanisms throughout their
1955   program.
