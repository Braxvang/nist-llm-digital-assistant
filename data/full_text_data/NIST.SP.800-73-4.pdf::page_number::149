Appendix Aâ€”Terms, Acronyms, and Notation

A.1              Terms

Application Identifier      A globally unique identifier of a card application as defined in ISO/IEC
                            7816-4.

Application Session         The period of time within a card session between when a card application
                            is selected and a different card application is selected or the card session
                            ends.

Algorithm Identifier        A PIV algorithm identifier is a one-byte identifier that specifies a
                            cryptographic algorithm and key size. For symmetric cryptographic
                            operations, the algorithm identifier also specifies a mode of operation
                            (i.e., ECB).

BER-TLV Data Object A data object coded according to ISO/IEC 8825-2.

Card                        An integrated circuit card.

Card Application            A set of data objects and card commands that can be selected using an
                            application identifier.

Card Interface Device An electronic device that connects an integrated circuit card and the card
                      applications therein to a client application.

Card Reader                 Synonym for card interface device.

Client Application          A computer program running on a computer in communication with a
                            card interface device.

Card Management             Any operation involving the PIV Card Application Administrator.
Operation

Data Object                 An item of information seen at the card command interface for which are
                            specified a name, a description of logical content, a format and a coding.

Interface Device            Synonym for card interface device.

Key Reference               A PIV key reference is a one-byte identifier that specifies a
                            cryptographic key according to its PIV Key Type. The identifier used in
                            cryptographic protocols such as an authentication or a signing protocol.

Object Identifier           A globally unique identifier of a data object as defined in ISO/IEC 8824-
                            2.

Reference Data              Cryptographic material used in the performance of a cryptographic
                            protocol such as an authentication or a signing protocol. The reference
                            data length is the maximum length of a password or PIN. For algorithms,
                            the reference data length is the length of a key.
