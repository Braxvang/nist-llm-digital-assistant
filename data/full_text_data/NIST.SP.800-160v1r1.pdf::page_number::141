H.5.     Design Definition
The purpose of the Design Definition process is to provide sufficient data and information about
the system and its elements to realize the solution in accordance with the system requirements
and architecture.

H.5.1. Security Purpose
-   Provide sufficient detailed data and information about the security aspects of the system and
    its elements to realize a trustworthy secure solution in accordance with the system
    requirements and architecture.

H.5.2. Security Outcomes
-   Security aspects of design alternatives for system elements are assessed.
-   System requirements are allocated to address their security aspects.
-   Security interfaces and security aspects of interfaces between system elements composing the
    system are defined.
-   Security design characteristics of each system element are defined.
-   Enabling systems or services for the security aspects of design definition are available.
-   Traceability of security design characteristics is established.

H.5.3. Security Activities and Tasks
DE-1     PREPARE FOR DESIGN DEFINITION
         DE-1.1 Establish the trustworthy secure aspects of the design definition strategy.
