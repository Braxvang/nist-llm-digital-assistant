SAMPLE COMPREHENSIVE TEST VALIDATION

A comprehensive test of many systems and system components requires a method and criteria to evaluate
whether the component or process worked as intended. Because a comprehensive test is a compilation of
many system and component tests, the validation can be determined from the validation of the system and
component, and evaluated as a whole.

Comprehensive test validation should include the metrics by which the success of the component or
process will be measured. It should detail the expected outcome.

SAMPLE COMPREHENSIVE TEST EVALUATION

Based on the objectives and validation metrics, the test should be evaluated to determine whether the
comprehensive test and its associated system and component tests performed adequately. Because a
comprehensive test is a compilation of system and component tests, the comprehensive test will be
determined from the evaluations of the individual system and, and then evaluated as a whole. Possible
improvements and recommendations are an important part of the evaluation process.

COMPREHENSIVE TEST AFTER ACTION REPORT

A comprehensive test after action report should consist of the following components:

     General findings, often in the form of an executive summary
     Specific findings
     Supporting data.

COMPREHENSIVE TEST GENERAL FINDINGS

The General Findings section highlights the outcome of the test. It might consist of a statement along the
lines of the following:

        The test provided an excellent opportunity for participants to [insert relevant information]. As a
        result of the test, participants received a heightened awareness of the importance of [insert
        relevant information]. The [organization or department] as a whole learned [insert relevant
        information] as a result of this test.

COMPREHENSIVE TEST SPECIFIC FINDINGS

The Specific Findings section provides greater detail of the results of the test. It should provide sufficient
detail so that a person knowledgeable of the technical aspects of the component could use the evaluation
to improve the component or process. A possible outline for the specific observations section is as
follows:

        Specific observations made during the exercise, and recommendations for enhancement of the
        plan, are as follows:

        Observation 1. [Insert general topic area]

        [Insert observation]
