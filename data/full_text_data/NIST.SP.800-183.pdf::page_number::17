                                                                                                   15. Failure to execute decision triggers at time t x may occur due to tardy data collection,

                                                                                                   17. There may be intermediate decision triggers at any point in a NoT’s workflow.

                                                                                                   18. Decision triggers act similarly to aggregators, and can be viewed as a special case of
