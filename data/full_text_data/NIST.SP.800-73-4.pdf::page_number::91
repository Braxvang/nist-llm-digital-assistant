Special Publication 800-73-4                                 Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification – Part 2:
                                                             PIV Card Application Card Command Interface

The only key reference allowed in the P2 parameter of the RESET RETRY COUNTER command is the
PIV Card Application PIN. The PIV Card Application may allow the reference data associated with other
key references to be changed by the PIV Card Application RESET RETRY COUNTER, if PIV Card
Application will only perform the command with other key references if the requirements specified in
Section 2.9.2 of FIPS 201-2 are satisfied. If a key reference is specified in P2 that is not supported by the
card, the PIV Card Application shall return the status word '6A 88'. 10

If the current value of the PUK’s retry counter is zero, then the PIN’s retry counter shall not be reset and
the PIV Card Application shall return the status word '69 83'.

If the reset retry counter authentication data (PUK) in the command data field of the command does not
match reference data associated with the PUK, then the PIV Card Application shall return the status word
'63 CX'. If the new reference data (PIN) in the command data field of the command does not satisfy the
criteria in Section 2.4.3, then the PIV Card Application shall return the status word '6A 80'. If the reset
retry counter authentication data (PUK) in the command data field of the command does not match
reference data associated with the PUK and the new reference data (PIN) in the command data field of the
command does not satisfy the criteria in Section 2.4.3, then the PIV Card Application shall return either
status word '6A 80' or '63 CX'. If the PIV Card Application returns status word '6A 80', then the retry
counter associated with the PIN shall not be reset, the security status of the PIN’s key reference shall
remain unchanged, and the PUK’s retry counter shall remain unchanged. 11 If the PIV Card Application
returns status word '63 CX', then the retry counter associated with the PIN shall not be reset, the security
status of the PIN’s key reference shall be set to FALSE, and the PUK’s retry counter shall be
decremented by one.

If the card command succeeds, then the PIN’s retry counter shall be set to its reset retry value. Optionally,
the PUK’s retry counter may be set to its initial reset retry value. The security status of the PIN’s key
reference shall not be changed.

The initial retry counter associated with the PUK, i.e., the number of failures of the RESET RETRY
COUNTER command before the PUK’s retry counter reaches zero, is issuer dependent.

10 The PIV Card Application may be implemented to reset the retry counter associated with OCC data when new OCC data is

loaded onto the card.
11 It is recommended that in this case the authentication data not be compared to the on-card reference data.
