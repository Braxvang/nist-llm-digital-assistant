       9     Solutions to the VOIPsec Issues

              Thus far, we have raised a number of significant concerns with IPsec’s role in
              VOIP. However, many of these technical problems are solvable. Despite the
              difficulty associated with these solutions it is well worth the establishment of a
              secure implementation of VOIPsec.

       9.1    Encryption at the End Points

              One proposed solution to the bottlenecking at the routers due to the encryption
              issues is to handle encryption/decryption solely at the endpoints in the VOIP
              network [33]. One consideration with this method is that the endpoints must be
              computationally powerful enough to handle the encryption mechanism. But
              typically endpoints are less powerful than gateways, which can leverage hardware
              acceleration across multiple clients. Though ideally encryption should be
              maintained at every hop in a VOIP packet’s lifetime, this may not be feasible with
              simple IP phones with little in the way of software or computational power. In
              such cases, it may be preferable for the data be encrypted between the endpoint
              and the router (or vice versa) but unencrypted traffic on the LAN is slightly less
              damaging than unencrypted traffic across the Internet. Fortunately, the increased
              processing power of newer phones is making endpoint encryption less of an issue.
              In addition, SRTP and MIKEY are future protocols for media encryption and key
              management enabling secure interworking between H.323 and SIP based clients.

9.2           Secure Real Time Protocol (SRTP)
              RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol) is commonly used for the transmission of
              real-time audio/video data in Internet telephony applications. Without protection
              RTP is considered insecure, as a telephone conversation over IP can easily be
              eavesdropped. Additionally, manipulation and replay of RTP data could lead to
              poor voice quality due to jamming of the audio/video stream. Modified RTCP
              (Real-time Transport Control Protocol) data could even lead to an unauthorized
              change of negotiated quality of service and disrupt the processing of the RTP
              stream.

              The Secure Real-time Protocol is a profile of the Real-time Transport Protocol
              (RTP) offering not only confidentiality, but also message authentication, and
              replay protection for the RTP traffic as well as RTCP (Real-time Transport
              Control Protocol). SRTP was being standardized at the IETF in the AVT working
              group. It was released as RFC 3711 in March 2004.

              SRTP provides a framework for encryption and message authentication of RTP
              and RTCP streams. SRTP can achieve high throughput and low packet expansion.
              SRTP is independent of a specific RTP stack implementation and of a specific
              key management standard, but Multimedia Internet Keying (MIKEY) has been
              designed to work with SRTP.
