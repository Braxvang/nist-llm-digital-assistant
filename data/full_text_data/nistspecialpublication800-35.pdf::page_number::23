      Strategic/ Mission   When thinking about the implications of any decision, decision makers must ask
                           themselves what is best for the organization from a strategic point of view and what
                           best helps the organization meet its mission. Applied appropriately, security services
                           should result in enhanced mission effectiveness, not reduced mission capability.


      Budgetary/           When considering cost, the focus should be on value and full life-cycle costs. (see
      Funding              Section 4.2.1.2)


      Technical/           IT services, even if a management service, has technical implications. Throughout the
      Architectural        life cycle, IT security managers must consider impacts to technical issues and the
                           organization’s enterprise architecture.


      Organizational       These issues are related to the intangible elements of an organization, such as damage
                           to an organizations image and reputation, change in focus on core competencies, and
                           resiliency of the organization. In many cases, long accepted internal controls and
                           business practices that have developed over time due to natural business unit divisions
                           or regulatory requirements may have to be reconsidered when an IT security service
                           provider is engaged.


      Personnel            These issues are related to the organization’s contractors and employees. Managers
                           must remain aware of the impact of their decision on their employees. Depending on
                           the service arrangement implemented, major ramifications could exist for current
                           employees; understanding these potential implications is an essential element of
                           making a good trade-off between internal and external services. Dealing with them
                           early will ensure the employees remain an important resource for the organization.


      Policy/Process       Effective security starts with strong policy, and implications to policies and process
                           must be considered to ensure that good decisions are being made and that appropriate
                           transitions and implementations occur.



These issues, tools, and arrangements will be discussed repeatedly in this guide because of their
importance to providing IT security services.

3.5    General Considerations for IT Security Services

Listed below are some general questions that decision makers should answer to identify the service
provider that best meets the organization’s needs. These questions have been grouped into the various
issue categories described in Section 3.4.

These questions are intended as a guide and each organization will need to decide which questions are
relevant to its specific needs. The questions are not an exhaustive list and organizations may need to
develop additional questions. In some instances, the organization and not the service provider may best
answer the question.
