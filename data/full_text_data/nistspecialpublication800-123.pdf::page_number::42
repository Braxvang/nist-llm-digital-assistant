 Procedures for ensuring data is properly retained and protected

 Procedures for ensuring data is properly destroyed or archived when no longer required

 Procedures for preserving information for Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, legal
  investigations, and other such requests

 Responsibilities of those involved in data retention, protection, and destruction activities

 Retention period for each type of information logged

 Specific duties of a central/organizational data backup team, if one exists.

6.2.2   Server Backup Types

Three primary types of backups exist: full, incremental, and differential. Full backups include the OS,
applications, and data stored on the server (i.e., an image of every piece of data stored on the server hard
drives). The advantage of a full backup is that it is easy to restore the entire server to the state (e.g.,
configuration, patch level, data) it was in when the backup was performed. The disadvantage of full
backups is that they take considerable time and resources to perform. Incremental backups reduce the
impact of backups by backing up only data that has changed since the previous backup (either full or
incremental).

Differential backups reduce the number of backup sets that must be accessed to restore a configuration by
backing up all changed data since the last full backup. However, each differential backup increases as
time lapses from the last full backup, requiring more processing time and storage than would an
incremental backup. Generally, full backups are performed less frequently (weekly to monthly or when a
significant change occurs), and incremental or differential backups are performed more frequently (daily
to weekly). The frequency of backups will be determined by several factors:

 Volatility of information on the site

    –   Static content (less frequent backups)

    –   Dynamic content (more frequent backups)

    –   E-commerce/e-government (very frequent backups)

 Volatility of configuring the server

 Type of data to be backed up (e.g., system, application, log, or user data)

 Amount of data to be backed up

 Backup device and media available

 Time available for dumping backup data

 Criticality of data

 Threat level faced by the server
