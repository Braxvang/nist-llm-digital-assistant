Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Tax credits are
not generally time-critical. In most cases, the adverse effects of unauthorized modification or
destruction of tax credits on agency mission functions or public confidence in the agency will be
limited.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for tax
credits is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to tax credits information. Taxation
processes are generally tolerant of delay. In most cases, disruption of access to tax credit
information can be expected to have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency
assets, or individuals.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
tax credit information is low.

D.24 Credit and Insurance
Credit and Insurance involves the use of government funds to cover the subsidy cost of a direct
loan or loan guarantee or to protect/indemnify members of the public from financial losses.

D.24.1 Direct Loans Information Type

Direct loans involve a disbursement of funds by the Government to a non-Federal borrower
under a contract that requires the repayment of such funds with or without interest. The
recommended provisional security categorization for the direct loan information type is as
follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of direct loan
information on the ability of responsible agencies to disburse Federal funds to non-Federal
borrowers under contract terms that require the repayment of such funds with or without interest.
Much direct loan information includes information covered by the provisions of the Privacy Act
of 1974. (The Privacy Act Information provisional impact levels are documented in the Personal
Identity and Authentication information type.) In most cases, unauthorized disclosure of direct
loan information will have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or
individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized disclosure of large
volumes of information protected under the Privacy Act can be expected to have a serious to
