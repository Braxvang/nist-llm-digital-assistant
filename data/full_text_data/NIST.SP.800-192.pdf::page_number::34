                                                                                             MTBDDs have three defining characteristics, which are valuable for AC model black box
                                                                                             verification. First, they are constructed relative to some fixed ordering on the variables (read from
                                                                                             root to terminal): an MTBDD does not allow two subtrees to inspect variables in different orders.
                                                                                             This restriction makes MTBDDs a canonical representation up to the chosen variable ordering.
                                                                                             Second, MTBDDs maximally share subtrees, in that at most one copy of a subtree appears
                                                                                             anywhere in the decision diagram; for example, the three paths to the same grade node in Figure
                                                                                             11. Third, MTBDDs collapse irrelevant variables, meaning that if both values of the same variable
                                                                                             refer to the same subtree, the node for that variable is removed, and all references to it are
                                                                                             redirected to the shared subtree. The combined effect of the latter two characteristics on the
                                                                                             MTBDD in Figure 11 shows the faculty and student variables are false: rather than enumerate the
                                                                                             remaining variablesâ€™ values, the MTBDD refers directly to the not-applicable terminal.

                                                                                             While in the worst case the number of nodes in an MTBDD is exponential in the number of
                                                                                             variables, in practice the number of nodes is often polynomial or even linear. This representation
                                                                                             therefore gains dramatically over naive DNF in practice. Operations that combine MTBDDs tend
                                                                                             to be efficient in practice; most policy verification needs yield MTBDDs with at most the product
                                                                                             of the numbers of nodes of the originals.
