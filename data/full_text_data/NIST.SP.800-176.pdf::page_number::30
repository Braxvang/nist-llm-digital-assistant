     Each subgroup consists of co-leads from academia,            SMART GRID CYBERSECURITY
industry and NIST. CSD co-leads the Cybersecurity and
Privacy subgroup focused on identifying strategies
for cybersecurity and privacy in CPS, and will work
collaboratively with the other subgroups to ensure that
cybersecurity is included as a design principle during
development.
     In 2015, the CPS PWG will publish an integrated
Framework that includes the work of the five technical
subgroups and begin work on a CPS Technology Roadmap,
which will identify opportunities for a coordinated effort
on key technical challenges. The CPS PWG deliverables will
be technology and business-model neutral, and freely
available online and intended for open use by all stakeholders.
     Additionally, in 2015, CSD, in conjunction with NISTâ€™s
Engineering Laboratory, Intelligent Systems Division, will
finalize SP 800-82 Revision 2, Guide to Industrial Control
Systems Security. CSD will also continue to participate in the
International Society of Automation (ISA) 99 Committee,
which develops and establishes standards, recommended                                   Figure 5: Smart Meter
