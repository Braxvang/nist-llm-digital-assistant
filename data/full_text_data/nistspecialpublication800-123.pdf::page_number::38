6.      Maintaining the Security of the Server

After initially deploying a server, administrators need to maintain its security continuously. This section
provides general recommendations for securely administering servers. Vital activities include handling
and analyzing log files, performing regular server backups, recovering from server compromises, testing
server security regularly, and performing remote administration securely. As discussed in Section 4,
security configuration guides and checklists are publicly available for many OSs and server software;
many of these documents contain OS and server-specific recommendations for security maintenance.
Other maintenance activities discussed in earlier sections, and thus not duplicated here, include testing
and deploying OS and server patches and updates, maintaining the secure configuration of the OS and
server software, and maintaining additional security controls used for the server. 34

6.1     Logging

Logging is a cornerstone of a sound security posture. Capturing the correct data in the logs and then
monitoring those logs closely is vital. 35 Network and system logs are important, especially system logs in
the case of encrypted communications, where network monitoring is less effective. Server software can
provide additional log data relevant to server-specific events.

Reviewing logs is mundane and reactive, and many server administrators devote their time to performing
duties that they consider more important or urgent. However, log files are often the only record of
suspicious behavior. Enabling the mechanisms to log information allows the logs to be used to detect
failed and successful intrusion attempts and to initiate alert mechanisms when further investigation is
needed. Procedures and tools need to be in place to process and analyze the log files and to review alert
notifications.

Server logs provide—

 Alerts to suspicious activities that require further investigation

 Tracking of an attacker’s activities

 Assistance in the recovery of the server

 Assistance in post-event investigation

 Required information for legal proceedings.

The selection and implementation of specific server software determines which actions the server
administrator should perform to establish logging configurations. Some of the information contained in
the steps below may not be fully applicable to all server software products.

6.1.1     Identifying Logging Capabilities and Requirements

Each type of server software supports different logging capabilities. Some server software may use a
single log, while other server software may use multiple logs (each for different types of records). Some

      This includes both host-based and network-based security controls. However, in many environments, network-based
      security controls such as enterprise firewalls and intrusion detection systems are maintained by someone other than the
      server administrator.
