                               Table 3: H235v2 - Voice Encryption Option
       The voice encryption option describes the master key exchange during H.225.0
       call signaling and the generation and distribution of media stream keys during
       H.245 call control. The encryption algorithms are to be used in CBC mode. New
       is the support of the AES. AES and TDEA may also be used in EOFB mode.

       The following security mechanisms are described within the voice encryption
       security profile:
       • Encryption of RTP packets with an assortment of algorithms and modes to be
          taken;
       • Key management with key and security capability exchange;
       • Key update mechanism and synchronization.

       The following issues are not covered by this profile:
       • Encryption and key management for RTCP;
       • Authentication and integrity for RTP and RTCP (a lightweight authentication
          and integrity could be provided by media anti-spamming).

       To counter denial of service and flooding attacks on discovered RTP/UDP ports,
       the H.235 standard defines the media anti-spamming procedure, which provides
       lightweight RTP packet authentication and integrity on selected fields through a
       computed message authentication code (MAC). The algorithms used are triple-
       DES-MAC or the cryptographic one-way function SHA1. Media anti-spamming
       uses the padding mechanism of RTP. For this feature, no special security profile
       was specified in H.235 like the voice encryption security profile for the RTP
       encryption, but media anti-spamming may be used in combination with media
       encryption.

 4.2.1.4 H.235v2 Annex F – Hybrid Security Profile

       The Hybrid Security Profile relies on asymmetric and symmetric techniques. It
       can be seen as a combination of the Baseline and the Signature Security Profile.
       Certificates and digital signatures are used to provide authentication and message
       integrity (as in the Signature Security Profile) for the first handshake between two
       entities. During this handshake a shared secret is established that will be used
       further on in the same way described for the Baseline Security Profile. The hybrid
       security profile mandates the gatekeeper-routed model. Other call models are
       open for further study.
