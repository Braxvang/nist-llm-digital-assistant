Special Publication 800-73-4      Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification â€“ Part 1: PIV

III.       NPIVP Conformance Testing

As outlined in FIPS 201-2, Appendix A.3, NIST has established the NIST Personal Identity Verification
Program (NPIVP) to:

       +   validate the compliance/conformance of two PIV components: PIV Middleware and PIV Card
           Applications with the specifications in NIST SP 800-73 and
       +   provide the assurance that the set of PIV Middleware and PIV Card Applications that have been
           validated by NPIVP are interoperable.
For further information on NPIVP, see http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/piv/npivp/index.html.

With the final release of SP 800-73-4, NPIVP plans to revise and publish SP 800-85A-4, PIV Card
Application and Middleware Interface Test Guidelines. This document will outline the Derived Test
Requirements (DTRs) of SP 800-73-4 based PIV Card Applications and PIV Middleware. In parallel,
NPIVP plans to update the test tools for NPIVP laboratories to test PIV Card Applications and PIV
Middleware in accordance with the DTRs in SP 800-85A-4. Once SP 800-85A-4 is published, and the
test tools are available to NPIVP test laboratories, SP 800-73-3 based testing will be discontinued and SP
800-73-4 based testing will begin. NPIVP will announce the start of SP 800-73-4 based testing at
http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/piv/npivp/announcements.html.
