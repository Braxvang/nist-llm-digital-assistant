NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                       Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
December 2023                                                                              and Derived PIV Credential Issuers


   Identifier                                   Issuer Control                                                  Source

                records stored in the PIV enrollment record or when compared to the
                biometric data records on the PIV Card using the BIO-A or OCC-AUTH
                authentication mechanisms. If the biometric verification decision is negative
                or the cardholder’s biometric characteristics are not successfully acquired,
                the cardholder provides another identity source document, and an
                attending operator inspects it and compares the cardholder with the
                electronic facial image retrieved from the enrollment data record and the
                photograph printed on the card.

                Assessment
                Determine that:
                   (i) The reset PIV Card is released to the cardholder only after a
                       positive biometric verification decision (review, observe).
                  (ii) If the biometric verification decision is negative, the cardholder
                       provides a primary identity source document that is compared to the
                       electronic facial image retrieved from the enrollment data record and
                       the photograph printed on the card (interview, observe).
    MP-13       When a PIN reset is performed at an unattended issuer-operated kiosk, the [FIPS201], Sec. 2.9.3.1 – PIN
  (UPDATED)     issuer ensures that the PIV Card is authenticated and that the cardholder’s Reset
                biometric characteristics elicit a positive biometric verification decision
                when compared to biometric data records stored in the PIV enrollment
                record or when compared to the biometric data records on the PIV Card
                using the OCC-AUTH authentication mechanism. If the biometric
                verification decision is negative or the cardholder’s biometric characteristics
                are not successfully acquired, the session is terminated, and the kiosk does
                not reset the PIV Card.

                Assessment
                Determine that:
                  (i) The reset PIV Card is only released to the cardholder after a
                      positive biometric verification decision (review, observe).
    MP-14       Remote PIN reset on a general computing platform (e.g., desktop, laptop)           [FIPS201], Sec. 2.9.3.1 – PIN
                is only performed if the following requirements are met: (i) the cardholder        Reset
                initiates a PIN reset with the issuer operator, (ii) the operator authenticates
                the owner of the PIV Card through an independent procedure (e.g.,
                authenticating the cardholder with an associated derived PIV credential or
                by confirming reset via email to the on-record government-issued email
                address), and (iii) the cardholder’s biometric characteristics elicit a positive
                biometric verification decision when compared to the stored biometric data
                records on the PIV Card through the OCC-AUTH authentication
                mechanism.

                Assessment
                Determine that:
                   (i) The PIV Card PIN is only reset after a positive biometric verification
                       decision (observe).
                  (ii) Remote PIN resets meet all security requirements to be
                       implemented by the issuer and the issuer information systems
                       (review, observe, test).
    MP-15       The intent of this control is covered by MP-21, MP-22, and MP-23.                  -


    MP-16       The issuer ensures that an adjudicative entity has authorized the issuance         [FIPS201], Sec. 2.9.1 – PIV Card
    (NEW)       of the new PIV Card if the expiration date of the new PIV Card is later than       Reissuance Requirements
                the expiration date of the old card or if any data about the cardholder is
                being changed.
