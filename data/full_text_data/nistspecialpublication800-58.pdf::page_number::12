NIST SP 800-58                                             Voice Over IP Security
    _________________________________________________________________________

      vulnerable than conventional telephone systems, in part because they are tied in to
      the data network, resulting in additional security weaknesses and avenues of
      attack (see Appendix A for more detailed discussion of vulnerabilities of VOIP
      and their relation to data network vulnerabilities). Confidentiality and privacy
      may be at greater risk in VOIP systems unless strong controls are implemented
      and maintained. An additional concern is the relative instability of VOIP
      technology compared with established telephony systems. Today, VOIP systems
      are still maturing and dominant standards have not emerged. This instability is
      compounded by VOIP’s reliance on packet networks as a transport medium. The
      public switched telephone network is ultra-reliable. Internet service is generally
      much less reliable, and VOIP cannot function without Internet connections,
      except in the case of large corporate or other users who may operate a private
      network. Essential telephone services, unless carefully planned, deployed, and
      maintained, will be at greater risk if based on VOIP.

3. Special consideration should be given to E-911 emergency services
communications, because E-911 automatic location service is not available
with VOIP in some cases.

      Unlike traditional telephone connections, which are tied to a physical location,
      VOIP’s packet switched technology allows a particular number to be anywhere.
      This is convenient for users, because calls can be automatically forwarded to their
      locations. But the tradeoff is that this flexibility severely complicates the
      provision of E-911 service, which normally provides the caller’s location to the
      911 dispatch office. Although most VOIP vendors have workable solutions for E-
      911 service, government regulators and vendors are still working out standards
      and procedures for 911 services in a VOIP environment. Agencies must carefully
      evaluate E-911 issues in planning for VOIP deployment.

4. Agencies should be aware that physical controls are especially
important in a VOIP environment and deploy them accordingly.

      Unless the VOIP network is encrypted, anyone with physical access to the office
      LAN could potentially connect network monitoring tools and tap into telephone
      conversations. Although conventional telephone lines can also be monitored when
      physical access is obtained, in most offices there are many more points to
      connect with a LAN without arousing suspicion. Even if encryption is used,
      physical access to VOIP servers and gateways may allow an attacker to do traffic
      analysis (i.e., determine which parties are communicating). Agencies therefore
      should ensure that adequate physical security is in place to restrict access to VOIP
      network components. Physical securities measures, including barriers, locks,
      access control systems, and guards, are the first line of defense. Agencies must
      make sure that the proper physical countermeasures are in place to mitigate some
      of the biggest risks such as insertion of sniffers or other network monitoring
      devices. Otherwise, practically speaking this means that installation of a sniffer
      could result in not just data but all voice communications being intercepted.
