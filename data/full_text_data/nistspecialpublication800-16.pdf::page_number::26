Information Technology Security Training Requirements


The model is role-based. It defines the FT security learning needed as a person assumes different
roles within an organization and different responsibilities in relation to IT systems. This
document uses the model to identify the knowledges, skills, and abilities an individual needs to
perform the IT security responsibilities specific to each of his or her roles in the organization.


The type of learning that individuals need becomes more comprehensive and detailed at the top
of the continuum.   Thus, beginning at the bottom, all employees need awareness. Training
(represented by the two bracketed layers "Security Basics and Literacy" and "Roles and
Responsibilities Relative to IT Systems") is required for individuals whose role in the
organization indicates a need for special knowledge of IT security threats, vulnerabilities, and
safeguards.   The "Education and Experience" layer applies primarily to individuals who have
made IT security their profession.

The model illustrates the following concepts:

    •   "Security Awareness" is explicitly required for ALL employees, whereas "Security Basics
        and Literacy" is required for those employees, including contractor employees, who are
        involved in any way with FT systems. In today's environment this typically means all
        individuals within the organization.


    •   The "Security Basics and Literacy" category is a transitional stage between "Awareness"
        and "Training." It provides the foundation for subsequent training by providing a
        universal baseline of key security terms and concepts.


    •   After "Security Basics and Literacy," training becomes focused on providing the
        knowledges, skills, and abilities specific to an individual's "Roles and Responsibilities
        Relative to IT Systems." At this level, training recognizes the differences between
        beginning, intermediate, and advanced skill requirements.


    •   The "Education and Experience" level focuses on developing the ability and vision to
        perform complex multi-disciplinary activities and the skills needed to further the IT
        security profession and to keep pace with threat and technology changes.


Learning is a continuum in terms of levels of knowledge, but the acquisition or delivery of that
knowledge need not proceed sequentially. Given resource constraints, organizations have a
responsibility to evaluate against the continuum both the scope of their IT security training needs
and the effectiveness of the training provided, to be able to allocate future training resources to
derive the greatest value or return on investment.
