3.5.4.2 Using XACML

XACML does not have the inherent ability to control access to anything. It is used to provide an access
control policy and to determine whether or not a requested action is allowed. The policy and requested
action can be anything from read-access of a particular element in an XML file to a request for entry
through a physical door. When using XACML in a Web service or Web application, it is important to
understand that the application itself must be the PEP. All requests for information from the client or
requester service must be translated into an access request. In many implementations, XACML is used
solely for authentication, in which case only the authentication request needs to be translated while all
subsequent requests would be allowed. As mentioned earlier, the PEP needs to send XACML requests to
the PDP. The PDP will take the XACML request and determine the appropriate XACML response to
send to the PEP, which will then grant or deny the request.

Because there is no mechanism for transmitting XACML over a network in the XACML specification,
SAML is traditionally used to transmit requests, responses, and attributes over a network. SAML was
designed for the secure exchange of authentication and authorization information, but not for performing
the actual decisions. This makes it a perfect match for transmitting XACML information over a network.
The PEP converts the XACML request into a SAML query and sends it to the PDP. The PDP converts
the SAML query into an XACML request and processes the request against the XACML policy. The
XACML response is converted into a SAML response and sent back to the PEP, which converts it back
into an XACML response. SAML does not provide message confidentialityâ€”only message integrity. If
any of the data being transmitted is sensitive, it must be transmitted using SSL/TLS or WS-Security. If
the SAML protocol is being used without SSL/TLS, all SAML messages must be signed appropriately.

The XACML v2.0 specification only supports a configuration where the PDP and PEP are on the same
system. There is no standard specified for transmitting XACML policies, requests, or responses over a
network. SAML is designed for the secure transmission of security attributes, which are used by
XACML to determine whether or not to grant access. To this end, SAML v2.0 includes an XACML
binding.

Because XACML can be used over a variety of languages and platforms, tools for generating XACML
policies can be used for any application and platform that supports XACML, unlike current policy
generators that only work with a specific application.

3.5.5   Role of XML Schema in Implementing Access Control

While not developed specifically for access control, XML schemas can be effective for controlling access
to Web services. XML parsing libraries often support validating XML documents against a defined XML
Schema. Because XML Schemas can rigidly define the types of data and format of XML elements, they
can be used to prevent the Web service from processing invalid requests. For example, the SOAP XML
Schema could be modified by a Web service developer to only allow portTypes that match a particular
regular expression. All other requests would not pass through the XML validator and would not reach the
Web service. In addition, the XML parser could be configured to use a different XML Schema based on
the identity of the remote Web service, which would not require the developer to implement the necessary
authorization functionality in the Web service itself. In fact, use of XML Schema-based access control
could prove to be more powerful than programmatic access control since many malicious SOAP requests
would not reach the application code. One of the drawbacks of using XML Schema validation for access
control is that it could put a heavy load on the system, because Schema validation is processor-intensive;
this could lead to a degradation of service.
