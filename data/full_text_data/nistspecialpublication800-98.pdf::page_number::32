GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



Eavesdropping ranges can be significantly greater than the nominal operating ranges listed in product
literature. For example, ISO/IEC 14443 tags have a typical operating range that is usually between 7 and
15 centimeters. 16 However, security researchers have used a portable, low-power device to demonstrate
that the rogue scanning range of an ISO/IEC 14443 contactless smart card is at least 25 centimeters
(cm). 17 Researchers have also successfully eavesdropped on ISO/IEC 14443 communications from
distances up to 15 meters using fixed antennas and receivers that were tuned to the frequency of
interest. 18

If the potential adversary does not need a reply from a passive tag to achieve its objective, then the
adversary can be much farther away. For instance, for many tags, a reader does not need to receive a
message from the tag before writing to the tag’s memory. This attack is not possible for certain
commands in EPCglobal Class-1 Generation-2 tags, because mandatory cover-coding requires the reader
to receive a key from the tag before issuing a command. 19 Cover-coding is a technique used to obscure
the content of messages from readers to tags and is described in more detail in Section 5.3.2.1.

Similarly, an adversary can be farther away if that adversary obtains information from the mere detection
of the signal, even if the signal is too weak to reliably decode. The presence of a signal indicates that
RFID activity is occurring, which an adversary could use to infer that a shipment has arrived. An
adversary may also be able to determine the number of transactions taking place even if that adversary
cannot identify the nature of those transactions, but this nonetheless could be used infer the level of
business activity. This type of intelligence gathering is called traffic analysis, and it can be performed
over much greater distances than eavesdropping.

2.4     Enterprise Subsystem

The enterprise subsystem connects readers to computers running software that can store, process, and
analyze data acquired from RF subsystem transactions to make the data useful to a supported business
process. For example, an RFID system in a retail clothing store has an RF subsystem that can read the
identifier associated with each tagged garment. The enterprise subsystem matches the identifier to the
garment’s record in a database to determine its price and the number of other items of a similar type that
remain in inventory. Some simple RFID systems consist of an RF subsystem only (e.g., RFID-based key
systems in which a reader can make an access control decision without access to other computers).
However, most RFID systems have both an RF subsystem and an enterprise subsystem.

The enterprise subsystem consists of three major components, which are shown in Figure 2-6, and
described in Sections 2.4.1 through 2.4.3:

 Middleware,
 Analytic systems, and
 Network infrastructure.

      The affected commands are kill, which disables all subsequent tag commands; write, which is used to write information to a
      tag’s memory; and access, which is necessary to lock memory. The technique, in effect, makes the rogue command range
      equivalent to the back channel eavesdropping range, thereby significantly reducing the threat of rogue commands.
