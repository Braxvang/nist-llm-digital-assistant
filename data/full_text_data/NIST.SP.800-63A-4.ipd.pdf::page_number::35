      NIST SP 800-63A-4 ipd                                               Digital Identity Guidelines
      December 2022                                                 Enrollment and Identity Proofing


888   5.1.7. Requirements for Notiﬁcations of Identity Prooﬁng
889   Notifications of proofing are sent to the applicant’s validated address notifying them that
890   they have been successfully identity proofed. These notices provide added assurance that
891   the person who underwent identity proofing is the owner of the claimed identity.
892   The following requirements apply to all CSPs that send notifications of proofing as part of
893   their identity proofing processes at any IAL.
894   Notifications of proofing:
895      1. SHALL be sent to a validated address (e.g., postal address, telephone number, or
896         email address) of record. Whenever possible, CSPs SHOULD send notifications of
897         proofing and enrollment codes to different validated addresses.
898      2. SHALL include details about the identity proofing event, such as the name of the
899         identity service and the date the identity proofing was completed.
900      3. SHALL provide clear instructions, including contact information, on actions to take
901         in the case the recipient repudiates the identity proofing event.
902      4. SHOULD provide additional information, such as how the organization or
903         CSP protects the security and privacy of the information it collects and any
904         responsibilities the recipient has as a subscriber of the identity service.

905   5.1.8. Requirements for Use of Biometrics
906   Biometrics is the automated recognition of individuals based on their biological and
907   behavioral characteristics such as, but not limited to, fingerprints, iris structures, or
908   facial features that can be used to recognize an individual. As used in these guidelines,
909   biometric data refers to any analog or digital representation of biological and behavioral
910   characteristics at any stage of their capture, storage, or processing. This includes live
911   biometric samples from applicants (e.g., facial images, fingerprint), as well as biometric
912   references obtained from evidence (e.g., facial image on a driver’s license, fingerprint
913   minutiae template on identification cards). As applied to the identity proofing process,
914   CSPs may use biometrics to uniquely resolve an individual identity within a given
915   population or context, verify that an individual is the rightful subject of identity evidence,
916   and/or bind that individual to a new piece of identity evidence or credential.
917   The following requirements apply to CSPs that employ biometric mechanisms as part of
918   their identity proofing process:
919      1. CSPs SHALL provide clear, publicly available information about all uses of
920         biometrics, what biometric data is collected, how it is stored, and information
921         on how to remove biometric information consistent with applicable laws and
922         regulations.
923      2. CSPs SHALL collect an explicit biometric consent from all applicants before
924         collecting biometric information.
