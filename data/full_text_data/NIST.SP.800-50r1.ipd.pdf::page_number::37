1008      •   Podcasts: Learning is asynchronous, self-paced, and typically audio based.
1009      •   Animations: Animations can visually represent a process, system, or complex
1010          cybersecurity or privacy concept.
1011      •   Demonstration: The instructor provides the learner with the step-by-step actions of a
1012          process or activity. This can be delivered in-person, recorded, or via other methods.
1013      •   Scenario-based exercise: The facilitator leads discussions on topical, situation-driven
1014          scenarios that may be customized to the organization or to a specific department. These
1015          are also referred to as “table-top” exercises.
1016      •   Self-paced online training: This asynchronous technique is currently popular for
1017          distributed environments. Attendees of a web-based session can study independently and
1018          learn at their own pace. Testing and accountability features can gauge performance. Web-
1019          based training can include video, audio, and interactive techniques, such as drag-and-drop
1020          or fill-in-the-blank exam responses.
1021      •   Onsite instructor-led training: This is one of the oldest and most popular techniques for
1022          delivering training material to an audience. The biggest advantage of the technique is the
1023          interactive nature of the instruction. It can also include peer presentations and mentoring.
1024   Blending various training delivery techniques can be an effective way to present material and
1025   hold an audience’s attention. For example, showing videos during an instructor-led session
1026   allows the audience to focus on a different source of information. The video can also reinforce
1027   what the instructor has been presenting.

1028          Establishing the CPLP Plan Priorities
1029   There are many elements to consider when entering into the planning phase of the CPLP life
1030   cycle. A leading consideration is to evaluate the organization’s critical risk factors to determine
1031   the learning priorities. If a phased approach is necessary, such as due to budget constraints or
1032   resource availability, some factors to consider are:
1033      •   Role and organizational impact – It is very common to address priority in terms of
1034          organizational role and risk. Broad-based awareness initiatives that address the
1035          enterprise-wide mandate may receive high priority because the rules of good
1036          cybersecurity and privacy practices can be delivered to the workforce quickly. It is also
1037          common to look at high trust/high impact positions (see earlier discussions about
1038          cybersecurity and privacy specialist roles) and ensure that they receive high priority in
1039          the rollout strategy. These types of positions are typically commensurate with the type of
1040          access (and to what systems) these users possess or specialized requirements assigned to
1041          their roles and job duties.. In addition, the protection of high value or critical assets or the
1042          deployment of privacy-sensitive products or services can also drive priorities.
1043      •   State of current compliance – This involves looking at major gaps in the CPLP (e.g.,
1044          gap analysis) and targeting deficient areas for attention.
1045      •   Availability of materials and resources – Determine whether appropriate learning
1046          material and necessary resources are readily available for the program element.
1047          Repurpose and utilize existing materials in new ways, when possible.
