                                                                                                                              Components         Should Consider          Status
                                               A firewall can enforce a security policy on the information flow
                                               between the RF subsystem and any attached network, allowing only
                                               authorized protocols and services to traverse this boundary, such as
                                               those needed for readers to communicate with middleware servers
                                               and for management consoles to monitor and configure readers.
                                               This configuration limits the ability of an adversary that compromises

             and the enterprise                                                                                                Subsystem
                                               on the network architecture. For example, if middleware is integrated

                                               into the switches to which the readers connect, the firewall may be
                                               included in the switch or may reside between the middleware and the
                                               enterprise network. On the other hand, if middleware servers are
                                               located inside an enterprise network (e.g., at a remote data center),
                                               then the firewall may reside between the readers and the
                                               middleware.
                                               Audit records are necessary for forensic analysis of security and

                                               captured should include, at a minimum, unsuccessful authentication
                                               attempts.
                                               The password management system should specify how passwords
                                               are generated, assigned, stored, shared, and discarded. Passwords
                                               should be randomly generated. When passwords are written to tags
