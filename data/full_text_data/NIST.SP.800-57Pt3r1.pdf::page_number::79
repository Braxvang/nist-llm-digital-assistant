Confidentiality     The property that sensitive information is not disclosed to
                    unauthorized entities.
Cryptographic key   A parameter used in conjunction with a cryptographic algorithm
(key)               that determines its operation in such a way that an entity with
                    knowledge of the key can reproduce or reverse the operation,
                    while an entity without knowledge of the key cannot. Examples
                    include:
                     1. the transformation of plaintext data into ciphertext data,
                     2. the transformation of ciphertext data into plaintext data,
                     3. the computation of a digital signature from data,
                     4. the verification of a digital signature,
                     5. the computation of an authentication code from data,
                     6. the verification of an authentication code from data and a
                        received authentication code,
                     7. the computation of a shared secret that is used to derive
                        keying material.
Cryptographic       The set of hardware, software, and/or firmware in which
module              approved security functions are implemented
Cryptoperiod        The time span during which a specific key is authorized for use
                    or in which the keys for a given system or application may
                    remain in effect.
Data integrity      A property whereby data has not been altered in an
                    unauthorized manner since it was created, transmitted or stored.
                    In this Recommendation, the statement that a cryptographic
                    algorithm "provides data integrity" means that the algorithm is
                    used to detect unauthorized alterations.
Decryption          The process of changing ciphertext into plaintext using a
                    cryptographic algorithm and key.
DES                 The Data Encryption Standard that was specified in FIPS 46
                    (now withdrawn).
Digital signature   The result of a cryptographic transformation of data that, when
                    properly implemented, provides the services of:
                     1. origin authentication,
                     2. data integrity, and
                     3. signer non-repudiation.
Distribution        See Key distribution.
Encryption          The process of changing plaintext into ciphertext using a
                    cryptographic algorithm and key.
Entity              An individual (person), organization, device or process.
Hash algorithm      See Hash function.
