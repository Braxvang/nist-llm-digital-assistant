APPENDIX B

GLOSSARY
COMMON TERMS AND DEFINITIONS




T       his appendix provides definitions for security terminology used within Special Publication
        800-30. The terms in the glossary are consistent with the terms used in the suite of
        FISMA-related security standards and guidelines developed by NIST. Unless otherwise
stated, all terms used in this publication are also consistent with the definitions contained in the
CNSSI No. 4009, National Information Assurance (IA) Glossary.

 Adequate Security                      Security commensurate with the risk and magnitude of
 [OMB Circular A-130, Appendix III]     harm resulting from the loss, misuse, or unauthorized
                                        access to or modification of information.
 Advanced Persistent Threat             An adversary with sophisticated levels of expertise and
 [NIST SP 800-39]                       significant resources, allowing it through the use of
                                        multiple different attack vectors (e.g., cyber, physical,
                                        and deception), to generate opportunities to achieve its
                                        objectives which are typically to establish and extend its
                                        presence within the information technology infrastructure
                                        of organizations for purposes of continually exfiltrating
                                        information and/or to undermine or impede critical
                                        aspects of a mission, program, or organization, or place
                                        itself in a position to do so in the future; moreover, the
                                        advanced persistent threat pursues its objectives
                                        repeatedly over an extended period of time, adapting to a
                                        defenderâ€™s efforts to resist it, and with determination to
                                        maintain the level of interaction needed to execute its
                                        objectives.
 Adversary                              Individual, group, organization, or government that
 [DHS Risk Lexicon]                     conducts or has the intent to conduct detrimental
                                        activities.
 Agency                                 See Executive Agency.
 Analysis Approach                      The approach used to define the orientation or starting
                                        point of the risk assessment, the level of detail in the
                                        assessment, and how risks due to similar threat scenarios
                                        are treated.
 Assessment                             See Security Control Assessment or Risk Assessment.
 Assessment Approach                    The approach used to assess risk and its contributing risk
                                        factors, including quantitatively, qualitatively, or semi-
                                        quantitatively.
 Assessor                               See Security Control Assessor or Risk Assessor.
 Attack                                 Any kind of malicious activity that attempts to collect,
 [CNSSI No. 4009]                       disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information system
                                        resources or the information itself.
