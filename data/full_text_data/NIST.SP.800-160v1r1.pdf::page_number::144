NIST SP 800-160v1r1                                                  Engineering Trustworthy Secure Systems
November 2022

-   Security aspects of system analysis assumptions and results are validated.
-   System analysis results provided for all decisions or technical assessment needs include
    security aspects.
-   Enabling systems or services for the security aspects of system analysis are available.
-   Traceability of the security aspects of the system analysis results is established.

H.6.3. Security Activities and Tasks
SA-1   PREPARE FOR SYSTEM ANALYSIS
       SA-1.1 Define the security aspects of the system analysis strategy.
       SA-1.2 Identify the security aspects of the problem or question that require system analysis.
       Note: The problem or question may not be driven by or have obvious security considerations or
       aspects.
       SA-1.3 Identify the security-relevant stakeholders of the system analysis.
       SA-1.4 Define the scope, objectives, level of fidelity, level of rigor, and level of assurance for the
              security aspects of system analysis.
       SA-1.5 Select the methods to address the security aspects of system analysis.
       SA-1.6 Identify the security aspects for enabling systems or services needed to support system
              analysis.
       SA-1.7 Identify and plan for enabling systems or services needed to support the security
              aspects of system analysis.
       SA-1.8 Obtain or acquire access to the security aspects of enabling systems or services to be
              used in system analysis.
       SA-1.9 Identify and validate security-relevant assumptions.
       Note 1: This includes assumptions derived from the limits of certainty: what is known, what is
       insufficiently known, and what is unknown.
       Note 2: Assumptions that cannot be validated represent uncertainty and potential risk.
       SA-1.10 Plan for and collect the data and inputs needed for the security aspects of the analysis.

SA-2   PERFORM SYSTEM ANALYSIS
       SA-2.1 Apply the selected analysis methods to perform the required security-relevant aspects
              of system analysis.
       SA-2.2 Review analysis results for security-relevant quality and validity.
       Note: The results are coordinated with associated and previously completed security-relevant
       analyses. Trustworthiness of the results is determined with the review.
       SA-2.3 Establish conclusions and recommendations for the security aspects of the system
              analysis.
