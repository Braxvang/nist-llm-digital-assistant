   policy and architecture; network topology; information flows; security controls in
   terms of management, operational, and technical controls; and physical and
   environmental security mechanisms are described.
Q. Are there common threats to a system?
A. Yes. There are common threat sources that typically apply, regardless of the
   system that should be evaluated. These common threats can be categorized into
   three areas: (1) natural threats (e.g., floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, landslides,
   avalanches, electrical storms), (2) human threats (intentional or unintentional),
   and (3) environmental threats (e.g., power failure).

Q. What is a vulnerability?
A. NIST SP 800-30 defines vulnerability as “a flaw or weakness in system security
   procedures, design, implementation, or internal controls that could be exercised
   (accidentally triggered or intentionally exploited) and result in a security breach
   or a violation of the system’s security policy.”

Q. What are the levels of risk?
A. This risk scale, with its ratings of High, Moderate, and Low, represents the degree
   or level of risk to which an information system, facility, or procedure might be
   exposed if a given vulnerability were exercised. The risk scale also presents
   actions that senior management, the mission owners, must take for each risk
   level. The risk descriptions and associated necessary actions are:
   • High: If an observation or finding is evaluated as a high risk, there is a strong
     need for corrective measures. An existing system may continue to operate, but
     a corrective action plan must be put in place as soon as possible.
   • Moderate: If an observation is rated as moderate risk, corrective actions are
     needed and a plan must be developed to incorporate these actions within a
     reasonable period of time.
   • Low: If an observation is described as low risk, the system’s authorizing official
     must determine whether corrective actions are still required or decide to accept
     the risk.

Q. How often is the risk assessment process conducted?
A. As mandated by OMB Circular A-130, the risk assessment process is usually
   repeated at least every three years for federal agencies. However, risk
   assessments should be conducted and integrated into the SDLC for information
   systems, not because it is required by law or regulation, but because it is a good
   practice and supports the organization’s business objectives or mission.
