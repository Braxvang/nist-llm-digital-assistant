CHAPTER 7                                                                   Performance Measures


       • Inefficient Processes—inefficient planning and communication processes that
         influence the metrics.

7.4.3      Identify Corrective Actions
   Phase 3 of the process, Identify Corrective Actions, involves developing a plan
that will provide the roadmap of how to close the implementation gap identified in
Phase 2. This phase includes the following activities:
       • Determine Range of Corrective Actions. Based on the results and causation
         factors, identify corrective actions that could be applied to each performance
         issue. Corrective actions may include changing system configurations; training
         security staff, system administrator staff, or regular users; purchasing security
         tools; changing system architecture; establishing new processes and
         procedures; and updating security policies.
       • Prioritize Corrective Actions Based on Overall Risk Mitigation Goals.
         Several corrective actions may be applicable to a single performance issue;
         however, some may be inappropriate if they are inconsistent with the
         magnitude of the problem or are too costly. Applicable corrective actions
         should be prioritized for each performance issue in the ascending order of cost
         and descending order of impact. The risk management process, described in
         NIST SP 800-30, Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems,
         should be used for prioritizing corrective actions. 48 If weights were assigned to
         metrics in Phase 1, Prepare for Data Collection, they should be used to
         prioritize corrective actions. Alternatively, weights may be assigned to
         corrective actions in Phase 3, Identify Corrective Actions, based on the
         criticality of implementing specific corrective actions, the cost of corrective
         actions, and the magnitude of corrective actions’ impact on the organization’s
         security posture.
       • Select Most Appropriate Corrective Actions. Up to three corrective actions
         from the top of the list of prioritized corrective actions should be selected for
         conducting a full cost-benefit analysis. These selections should then be
         appropriately reflected in the agency or system POA&Ms.

7.4.4      Develop Business Case and Obtain Resources
    Phases 4 and 5, Develop Business Case and Obtain Resources, respectively,
address the budgeting cycle required for obtaining resources needed for
implementing the remediation actions identified in Phase 3. The steps to develop a
business case are based on industry practices and mandated guidance, including
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-11, the Clinger-Cohen Act, and
GPRA. The results of the prior three phases will be included in the business case as
supporting evidence. NIST SP 800-55 provides guidance on security practitioners’
inputs into the CPIC process and on their role in core development.
   Each agency should follow agency-specific business case guidance during this
phase. Typically, the components and analysis of the business facilitate the
completion of internal and external budget requests. A thorough examination of the
business case will support and facilitate the obtaining resources process.
