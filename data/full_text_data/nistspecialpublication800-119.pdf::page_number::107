                                                                GUIDELINES FOR THE SECURE DEPLOYMENT OF IPV6


IPsec services implemented on individual hosts to provide sufficient protection for all IPv6 network
communications. The security requirements and models that evolve as accepted practices for IPv6
networks are likely to be at least somewhat similar to those currently found in IPv4 networks.

On the other hand, because the transition to IPv6 will last a long time, implementations of IPsec on IPv4
networks are likely to continue to be used indefinitely. It is expected that IPsec will be widely deployed
in mixed IPv4 and IPv6 environments for many years to come.




                               Figure 5-3. IPsec in the TCP/IP Protocol Stack

TCP/IP communications are composed of four layers that work together: application (and session),
transport, network, and data link (see Figure 5-3). Security protocols exist for network communications
at each of the four layers. Data prepared for transport are passed from the highest to the lowest layer,
with each layer adding more information. Because of this, a security control at a higher layer cannot
provide full protection for lower layers, because the lower layers add information to the communications
after the higher layer security controls have been applied. The primary disadvantages of lower layer
security controls is that they are less flexible and granular than higher layer controls and they may not be
able to provide end-to-end protection. Accordingly, network layer security, i.e., IPsec, has become a
popular choice for securing communications. It provides a balanced approach between the highest layer
and lowest layer security protocols and is capable of providing end-to-end protection for all
communications between two points.

  5.3.1   Specification Overview

IPsec is a framework of open standards for ensuring authenticated and private communications over
public networks. It has become the most common network layer security protocol, typically used in IPv4
