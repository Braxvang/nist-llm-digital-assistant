                                                                                                      and Derived PIV Credential Issuers



2.6.8 Role Assignment Policies
Although issuer roles are independent and should be filled by different people if feasible, there
may be a need (e.g., because of availability or economy) to have one person fill more than one
role. Except for the roles of Assessor, Privacy Official and separation of duty provision under
Section 2.6.2, one person may perform more than one role if needed. If an organization has
established multiple issuers, one person may be assigned the same role in several or all of them.
For instance, an Issuing Facility Manager may be responsible for a number of issuing facilities.
Of the roles described, the SAO, DAO, OIMO, AR, Assessor and PO must be employees of the
organization that owns the PCI or DPCI (e.g., Federal employees).

2.6.9 Assessment and Authorization Roles
Figure 2 illustrates a possible role structure when an issuer has multiple issuing facilities. The
SAO has the primary authority and responsibility for the issuing organization. Reporting to the
SAO are the OIMO and the DAO. An Issuing Facility Manager is responsible for managing
operations at each issuing facility and reports to the OIMO. The dotted lines leading to the PO
and the Assessor indicate their independence from the day to day operations of the issuer.

2.7 The Relationship between SP 800-79-2 and SP 800-37-1

While authorization is the major topic of both special publications, the goals of authorization are
different in [SP 800-37-1] and SP 800-79-2. Authorization compliant to [SP 800-37-1], as
mandated by Appendix III of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130,
focuses on “authorizing processing” of information systems based on an assessment of security
at the information system level. Authorization as discussed in this document and as mandated by
[HSPD-12] is concerned with the assessment of the “reliability” of an issuer to perform its
