              The Technical Specification for the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.1



3.2.5   Allowed Check System Usage

The following requirements and recommendations apply to the use of the <xccdf:check> and
<xccdf:complex-check> elements:

   1. The <xccdf:check-content> element SHALL NOT be used to embed check content
      directly into XCCDF content.

   2. At least one <xccdf:check-content-ref> element MUST be provided for each
      <xccdf:check> .

   3. Use of XCCDF check systems as specified in the <xccdf:check> element‘s @system
      attribute SHALL be restricted as follows:

        a. The following check systems are supported by SCAP:

            i. Use of the OVAL check system SHALL be indicated by the
               http://oval.mitre.org/XMLSchema/oval-definitions-5 system
               identifier.

           ii. Use of the OCIL check system SHALL be indicated by the
               http://scap.nist.gov/schema/ocil/2 system identifier.

        b. If a check system is used in XCCDF content that is not supported by SCAP, then this content
           SHALL NOT be considered well-formed with regards to SCAP.

If multiple <xccdf:check-content-ref> elements occur within an <xccdf:check> element,
the <xccdf:check-content-ref> elements are evaluated in the order they appear. The first
resolvable <xccdf:check-content-ref> element is used to determine the <xccdf:Rule>
status. For each <xccdf:check-content-ref> element, an implementation attempts to retrieve the
document referenced by the element‘s @href attribute. If not resolvable, the next available
<xccdf:check-content-ref> element is evaluated. If none of the <xccdf:check-content-
ref> elements are resolvable, then the result of the rule evaluation is the XCCDF ―unchecked‖ status
and processing of the <xccdf:Rule> ends. The @href attribute MAY map a remote URL to a local
copy of the file in cases where remote access is not available, allowed, or practical.

3.2.5.1 OVAL <xccdf:check> Usage

References from SCAP compliant XCCDF to OVAL Definitions SHALL use the form:

   <check-content-ref href="OVAL_Source_URI" [name="OVAL_Definition_Id"]/>

The @href attribute SHALL reference an OVAL source data stream component. When present, the
@name attribute SHALL refer to a specific OVAL Definition in the designated source data stream
component. Use of the @name attribute is REQUIRED except for the patches up-to-date rule, as defined
in Section 3.2.6.4.

In the previous example, the <xccdf:check-content-ref> element‘s @href attribute refers to an
OVAL Definition source data stream component containing one or more OVAL patch definitions. This
<xccdf:check-content-ref> is equivalent to referencing a virtual OVAL Definition of the form:


                                                     13
