assurance_time        The time at which assurance of possession is obtained.

Certificate           A set of data that uniquely identifies a key pair owner that is
                      authorized to use the key pair, contains the owner’s public key and
                      possibly other information, and is digitally signed by a
                      Certification Authority (i.e., a trusted party), thereby binding the
                      public key to the owner.

Certification         The entity in a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) that is responsible
Authority (CA)        for issuing certificates and exacting compliance with a PKI policy.

Claimed signatory     From the verifier’s perspective, the claimed signatory is the entity
                      that purportedly generated a digital signature.

Digital signature     The result of a cryptographic transformation of data that, when
                      properly implemented, provides origin authentication, data
                      integrity and signatory non-repudiation.

Domain parameters     Parameters used with a cryptographic algorithm that are usually
                      common to a domain of users.

Entity                An individual (person), organization, device or process. Used
                      interchangeably with “party”.

Intended owner        An entity that intends to act as a signatory but has not yet obtained
                      a private key that will be used to generate digital signatures.

Intended signatory    An entity that intends to generate digital signatures in the future.
