       were previously accessed from the confines of an organization’s intranet, but moved to a
       public cloud, must now face increased risk from network threats that were previously
       defended against at the perimeter of the organization’s intranet and from new threats that
       target the exposed interfaces. The performance and quality of services delivered over the
       Internet may also be at issue. The effect is somewhat analogous to the inclusion of
       wireless access points into an organization’s intranet at the onset of that technology,
       necessitating additional safeguards for secure use.

       Relying on remote administrative access as the means for the organization to manage
       assets that are held within the cloud also increases risk, compared with a traditional data
       center, where administrative access to platforms can be restricted to direct or internal
       connections (e.g., [Som11]). Similarly, remote administrative access of the cloud
       infrastructure, if done by the cloud provider, is also a concern. When taken together with
       the previous two items, a highly complex, multi-tenanted computing environment, whose
       services are Internet-facing and available to the public, arguably affords a potentially
       attractive attack surface that must be carefully safeguarded.

      Loss of Control. While security and privacy concerns in cloud computing services are
       similar to those of traditional non-cloud services, they are amplified by external control
       over organizational assets and the potential for mismanagement of those assets.
       Transitioning to a public cloud requires a transfer of responsibility and control to the
       cloud provider over information as well as system components that were previously
       under the organization’s direct control. The transition is usually accompanied by the lack
       of a direct point of contact with the management of operations and influence over
       decisions made about the computing environment. This situation makes the organization
       dependent on the cooperation of the cloud provider to carry out activities that span the
       responsibilities of both parties, such as continuous monitoring and incident response.
       Compliance with data protection laws and regulations is another important area of joint
       responsibility that requires coordination with and the cooperation of the cloud provider.

       Loss of control over both the physical and logical aspects of the system and data
       diminishes the organization’s ability to maintain situational awareness, weigh
       alternatives, set priorities, and effect changes in security and privacy that are in the best
       interest of the organization. Legal protections for privacy may also be affected when
       information is stored with a third-party service provider [Cou09, Han06]. Under such
       conditions, maintaining accountability can be more challenging, offsetting some of the
       potential benefits discussed earlier.

A more detailed discussion of the security and privacy issues that stem from these fundamental
concerns is given in the next chapter.


         Other Kinds of Cloud Services. Other kinds of cloud services related to security and
         privacy exist. Besides providing a computing platform or substitute for in-house
         applications, public cloud services such as the following can also be focused on
         augmenting security in other computing environments:
