 XML Signature. For integrity and signatures, XML Signature defines digital signatures and related
  cryptographic integrity and authentication measures for XML.
 XML Encryption. For confidentiality, XML Encryption supports encryption using a variety of both
  symmetric and asymmetric cryptographic algorithms.
 XML Key Management Specification (XKMS). For key management, XKMS addresses PKI and
  key management network services in XML.
Many other confidentiality and integrity technologies, such as SSL/TLS or virtual private networks
(VPN), only provide confidentiality while the information is in transit, not while it is stored at a server.
XML Encryption and XML Signature use the same cryptographic algorithms as other cryptographic
technologies and may be subject to similar attacks. All applications depending on XML Encryption and
XML Signature should follow the guidelines set forth in NIST SP 800-21-1 45, SP 800-32 46, SP 800-57 47,
FIPS 140-2 48 and FIPS 186-2 49.

XKMS defines protocols for Public Key management services. Public Key management includes the
creation of public and private key pairs, the binding of key pairs with identity and other attributes, and the
representation of key pairs in different formats. Public key technology is essential to XML Signature,
XML Encryption, and other security applications. When signing, the private key is used to sign and the
public key is used to verify signatures. When encrypting, the public key is used to encrypt and the private
key is used to decrypt. In both cases, the private key must be maintained under control of the owner and
the public key may be shared with others. XKMS is designed to help manage the sharing of the public
key to enable signature verification and encryption. XKMS enables users to delegate key management
functions to a trust service accessed via SOAP and XML. XKMS enables key management to be
provided as a service to the application, without having to use a PKI toolkit to implement the service.

When using XML Security standards in Web services, both the requester and provider must support the
particular algorithms chosen and must decrypt or verify the SOAP messages before acting upon them.
Also, because the SOAP specification does not provide support for encrypting portions of SOAP
messages, both SOAP endpoints must understand the protocol and tags used to represent encrypted or
signed SOAP elements. To prevent proprietary and incompatible Web service security mechanisms, the
WS-Security standard was developed by Microsoft, IBM, and Verisign to define a unified mechanism for
securing SOAP messages.

3.6.3    WS-Security for SOAP Confidentiality and Integrity

As mentioned earlier, the WS-Security standard was designed to use the XML Encryption and XML
Signature specifications for message-layer confidentiality and integrity. By signing and encrypting at the
message level, senders control whether intermediaries can modify or view the content in transit.
Additionally, the entire message can be stored intact, maintaining integrity or confidentiality while at rest.
Because message integrity is provided by digital signatures, non-repudiation can be achieved by logging
individual messages for later retrieval (Section 3.7.2 describes non-repudiation in more detail). To fully
