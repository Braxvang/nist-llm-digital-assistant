                                                                          CLOUD COMPUTING SYNOPSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



9.        General Recommendations

For Federal information systems and those operated on behalf of the US Government, the Federal
Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002 and the associated NIST standards and special
publications (e.g. FIPS 199, FIPS 200, SP 800-53 etc.) do apply to cloud systems. In the context of cloud
computing, the following are additional general recommendations, broken into five groups for readability:
Management, Data Governance, Security and Reliability, Virtual Machines, and Software and
Applications.

9.1       Management

 Migrating Data to and from Clouds. Consumers should identify the specific resources that are
  suitable for migrating data into and out of clouds. Resources could be services such as: (1) email, (2)
  data repositories such as shared documents, or (3) systems that run in virtualized environments.
  Consumers should develop a plan for both migrating the data to and from the cloud, and for
  interacting with the data once it is resident in the cloud. Consumers should plan also for an eventual
  termination of a provider’s service during the procurement phase of the contract, and should clarify
  how assets are to be returned to consumers. Consumers should also plan for migration between
  clouds.
 Continuity of Operations. If the cost of losing access to an application is severe, it is recommended
  that consumers perform the work locally unless a provider is willing to agree to pay for pre-defined
  damages for specific types of service interruptions. Consumers should review the provider’s business
  continuity plan and redundancy architecture to understand if their stated availability goals are
  supported. Consumers should request assurances that a provider employs established internal
  operating procedures and service management techniques for reliable system updates, data transfers,
  and other site modifications. Consumers should consider that service agreements usually state that
  the provider will reimburse consumers for service outages by only refunding service fees, and not by
  compensating for actual damages arising from service interruptions. The level of availability of a
  cloud service and its capabilities for data backup and disaster recovery should be addressed in the
  organization’s contingency and continuity plan to ensure the recovery and restoration of disrupted
  cloud services and operations, using alternate services, equipment, and locations, if required.
 Compliance. A consumer should: (1) determine whether the capabilities for defining the necessary
  controls exist within a particular provider, (2) determine whether those controls are being
  implemented properly, and (3) ensure that the controls are documented. Traditional forms of direct
  assessment may not be feasible and may require working with the cloud provider to gain needed
  information and system access, or to allow third-party audits to establish a sufficient level of
  assurance. Also, a consumer should scrutinize any certifications (e.g., ISO 27001) or audit statements
  (e.g., SAS 70) available from the cloud provider for their scope of coverage and applicability. 15
 Administrator Staff. Consumers should make sure that processes are in place to compartmentalize
  the job responsibilities of the provider’s administrators from the responsibilities of the consumer’s
  administrators. The insider security threat is a well-known issue for most organizations and extends
  as well to the cloud provider’s staff. Therefore, consumers should make sure that the cloud provider’s
  policy, procedures, and controls to protect against malicious insiders are adequate.

     The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program has been established to provide a standard approach, to assessing
      and authorizing cloud computing services, and products that results in a joint authorization of cloud providers with respect
      to a common security risk model. The joint authorization issued can be reused and leveraged across the Federal Government
      in cloud computing deployments for which the security risk model applies.
