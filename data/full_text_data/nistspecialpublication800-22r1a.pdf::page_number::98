A STATISTICAL TEST SUITE FOR RANDOM AND PSEUDORANDOM NUMBER GENERATORS FOR CRYPTOGRAPHIC APPLICATIONS



fashion, (2) study the harmonics of the bit stream utilizing spectral methods, or (3) attempt to detect
patterns via some generalized pattern matching technique on the basis of probability theory or information
theory.

5.5.2   Global Parameters

In practice, any number of problems can arise if the user executes this software in unchartered domains.
It is plausible that sequence lengths well beyond the testing procedure (i.e., on the order of 106) may be
chosen. If memory is available, there should not be any reason why the software should fail. However,
in many instances, user defined limits are prescribed for data structures and workspace. Under these
conditions, it may be necessary to increase certain parameters, such as the NUMOFTEMPLATES.
Several parameters that may be modified by a user are listed in Table 5-1.

                            Table 5-1 User Prescribed Statistical Test Parameters

      Source Code Parameter                Default Parameter                       Description/Definition
    ALPHA                                         0.01                       Significance Level
    MAXNUMOFTEMPLATES                              40                        Non-overlapping Templates Test
    NUMOFTESTS                                     16                        Max number of tests
    NUMOFGENERATORS                                12                        Max number of PRNGs

The parameter ALPHA denotes the significance level that determines the region of acceptance and
rejection. NIST recommends that ALPHA be in the range [0.001, 0.01].

The parameter MAXNUMOFTEMPLATES indicates the maximum number of non-periodic templates that
may be executed by the Nonoverlapping Template Matchings test. For templates of size m = 9, up to 148
possible non-periodic templates may be applied.

The parameters NUMOFTESTS and NUMOFGENERATORS correspond to the maximum number of tests
that may be defined in the test suite, and the maximum number of generators specified in the test suite,
respectively.

5.5.3   Mathematical Software

Special functions required by the test suite are the incomplete gamma function and the complementary
error function. The cumulative distribution function, also known as the standard normal function, is also
required, but it can be expressed in terms of the error function.

One of the initial concerns regarding the development of the reference implementation was the
dependencies that were required in order to gain reliable mathematical software for the special functions
required in the statistical tests. To resolve this matter, the test suite makes use of the following libraries:

The Fast Fourier Transform routine was obtained at http://www.netlib.org/fftpack/fft.c.
The normal function utilized in this code was expressed in terms of the error function.
