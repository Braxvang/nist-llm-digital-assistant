                                                                              FOCUS AREA 5



Advancing Cybersecurity Usability
ITL’s Visualization and Usability Group performs research to develop user-centered
measurement and evaluation methods, guidelines, and standards by applying human
factors, cognitive science, user-centered designs, and usability principles to improve
interactions between humans and systems. In FY 2019, notable usability projects included:
  •   Human Factors in Smart Home Technologies – NIST conducted a one-day
      workshop entitled “Human Factors in Smart Home Technologies.” Inspired by
      the team’s smart home research, the workshop addressed the human aspects of
      smart home devices, including usability, user perceptions, and end-user privacy
      and security considerations. Invited speakers from industry, academia, and the
      government provided their perspectives via presentations and a moderated
      panel. The attendees also had the opportunity to influence NIST’s future research
      direction in this area by voicing their opinions, challenges, and ideas during
      breakout sessions.
  •   Rating Human Phishing Message Detection Difficulty – NIST also developed the
      “Phish Scale” as a tool to better characterize an organization’s phishing risk.
      The scale considers phishing cues and user context to help Chief Information
      Security Officers and phishing training implementers to rate the difficulty of their
      organization’s phishing exercises and explain associated click rates. Research
      results were shared with industry, academia, and government representatives at
      multiple security forums and will be published in the Journal of Cybersecurity.
  •   Understanding Youth Cybersecurity Practices and Perceptions – Cybersecurity
      for young people remains an important area of study for NIST. In FY 2019, NIST
      completed a study to understand a child’s password practices and perceptions.
      Children use technology from a very young age and often have to authenticate
      themselves. Yet very little attention has been paid to designing authentication
      methods specifically for this particular target group. The usual practice is to
      deploy the ubiquitous password, and this might well be a suboptimal choice.
      Designing authentication for children requires acknowledgement of child-
      specific developmental challenges related to literacy, cognitive abilities, and
      differing developmental stages. Understanding current security practices is
      essential to delivering insights that can inform the development of child-centered
      authentication mechanisms and processes. NIST conducted a systematic review of
      twenty years of research related to children and authentication, noting a research
      gap regarding the creation and use of passwords. This finding led to a survey
      of U.S. school children to gain insights into their current password usage and
      behaviors. The team analyzed password survey responses collected from more
      than 1500 students in grades 3 to 12. The results were published in the Journal
      of Cybersecurity. The ultimate goal of the research is the development of useful
      guidance to help educators, parents, and youth understand the best practices for
      passwords and online security and privacy.
