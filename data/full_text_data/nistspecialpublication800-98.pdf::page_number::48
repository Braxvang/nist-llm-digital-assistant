GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



RFID-enabled transponder within the vehicle. The choice is essentially an application design decision
that may include such factors as cost and convenience.

In other cases, the distance between reader and tag is dictated by the environment in which the RFID
system will be deployed. For example, a toll payment application that identifies vehicles on a highway
may require that readers query tags from a distance of several meters. In this case, the minimum read
distance is a requirement for the design of the RFID system.

3.3.2   Transaction Speed

Transaction speed can be measured in a variety of ways. A common metric is the number of tags read
per second. The main reasons why an application has requirements related to the speed of transactions
are:

 Readers are expected to communicate with multiple tags nearly simultaneously and cannot do so if
  each transaction takes longer than a certain period of time.
 Tagged items are in motion and only reside in a reader’s operating range for a limited period of time.
 The system’s users may perceive the application as a nuisance if transactions take longer than a short
  period of time to complete.
For example, in some inventory applications, operators may need to confirm the entire inventory at the
end of each business day. In this case, each transaction must be completed within a small fraction of a
second or the process may take too long to finish. Similar issues may arise when trying to read the tags of
athletes in a tracking system designed to measure race times. In this case, if the transactions take too
long, there is a chance that some participants in the race may go out of range before the reader identifies
them.

Many security mechanisms introduce latency into RFID transactions. Additional steps are needed to
perform authentication, encryption, cover-coding, and other security-related procedures. Each additional
step takes time. When considering security controls, organizations need to balance the business impact of
each security control’s effect on transaction speed with the protection it provides.

3.3.3   Network Connectivity and Data Storage

Whether or not an RFID system’s readers are networked with database applications has major
implications for the architecture of the RFID system and its security. When an application needs to link
data with tags, the data needs to be stored somewhere. If the readers are networked with databases, then
the data can be stored in the databases. Otherwise, the data must be stored on the tags.

When data is stored centrally on database servers, the tag only needs to contain an identifier, which links
the tag to its associated information. In this architecture, the vast majority of the data processing occurs
on the supporting systems to which the reader is connected. On the other hand, when data is stored on
tags, the tags must have some form of memory and support both write and read transactions.

Regardless of where data is stored, the data’s integrity must be protected. If the data is sensitive, its
confidentiality must also be protected. The methods for achieving this include authentication, access
control, encryption, and physical security. However, database servers and tags implement these methods
in different ways. Nearly all commercial database servers support a wide variety of configurable security
controls, but most tags do not. In general, RFID systems that use networked readers to access database
