5.1.1    Use of the BIA

The BIA is the first source for determining resiliency and contingency planning strategies. BIA results
determine how critical the system is to the supported mission/business processes, what impact the loss of
the system could have on the organization, and the system RTO. The BIA results can help determine the
type and frequency of backup, the need for redundancy or mirroring of data, and the type of alternate site
needed to meet system recovery objectives. Each of these strategy decisions have cost versus availability
or recovery implications. Availability and recovery implications are discussed throughout the rest of this
chapter.

5.1.2    Maintenance of Data Security, Integrity, and Backup

Maintaining the integrity and security of system data and software is a key component in contingency
planning. Data integrity involves keeping data safe and accurate on the system’s primary storage devices.
There are several methods available to maintain the integrity of stored data. These methods use
redundancy and fault tolerance processes to store data on more than one drive and eliminate loss of data
from single drive failures. Data security involves protecting data both onsite and offsite from
unauthorized access or use. Encryption is a common method for securing stored system data. Encryption
is most effective when applied to both the primary data storage device and on backup media going to an
offsite location. 37 If using encryption for offsite data storage, it is important that media readers (e.g., tape
drives, CD or DVD readers) are available at the alternate site location to correctly read the encrypted data
during recovery efforts. A solid key management process must be established so encrypted data is
available as needed. Keying material, which is the data used to establish and maintain the keys, needs to
be managed, ideally at a central location in the organization. These keys should be stored separate from,
but accessible to, the primary encrypted backup data. 38

Keeping backups of data in a secure offsite location allows for a ready access to backups during a
contingency event. An effective data backup process is crucial to an ISCP Coordinator’s overall recovery
strategy. Data backups are done primarily for recovery purposes. Backups can be done through many
different methods and techniques. MTD determinations and security requirements from the BIA help
dictate the best method for backing up a particular system for recovery.

Data backups should be conducted on all systems on a regular basis. Systems can be backed up for
individual computers or on a centralized storage device, such as network attached storage (NAS) or
storage area network (SAN). There are three common methods for performing system backups:

        Full. A full backup captures all files on the disk or within the folder selected for backup.
         Because all backed-up files are recorded to a single media or media set, locating a particular file
         or group of files is simple. However, the time required to perform a full backup can be lengthy.
         In addition, maintaining multiple iterations of full backups of files that do not change frequently
         (such as system files) could lead to excessive, unnecessary media storage requirements.
        Incremental. An incremental backup captures files that were created or changed since the last
         backup, regardless of backup type. Incremental backups afford more efficient use of storage
         media, and backup times are reduced. However, to recover a system from an incremental backup,
         media from different backup operations may be required. For example, consider a case in which
         a directory needs to be recovered. If the last full backup was performed three days prior and one
