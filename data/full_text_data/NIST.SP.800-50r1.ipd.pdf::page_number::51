       NIST SP 800-50r1 ipd                                                       Building a Cybersecurity and
       August 2023                                                                  Privacy Learning Program

1500   authentication token system starting with privileged accounts in the first quarter and all other
1501   accounts in the second quarter. The CPLP Learning Program Manager has been tasked with
1502   helping employees understand their roles in utilizing this new multi-factor authentication system.
1503          Analysis Phase: Identify Knowledge and Skill Gaps
1504          Since this is a new authentication method, both All Users and Privileged Users need
1505          information and training on the new policies, processes, and procedures for accessing the
1506          system. In addition, they need to know why this is important or how it protects the
1507          information and assets on enterprise systems. Privileged Users will also need additional
1508          information focused on the additional privileges they will have once authenticated to the
1509          system.
1510          Design Phase: Create Learning Objectives Based on Knowledge and Skill Gaps
1511          Once the knowledge and skill gaps are identified, the next step is to establish the learning
1512          goals and objectives for the program. In this example, the goals and objectives for the
1513          learning program involve enabling employees to:
1514              •   Understand the vulnerabilities associated with using single-factor authentication
1515                  (e.g., user ID and password)
1516              •   Understand why the organization is using a multi-factor authentication token
1517                  method
1518              •   Identify their role in using multi-factor authentication
1519              •   Install the authentication application and verify that the token is received
1520              •   Utilize the token 100 % of the time for authentication to the system
1521   Scenario 2: A recent external audit of the organization’s system privacy policies and practices
1522   highlighted several concerns. The top issues were that (1) the public privacy notice indicated that
1523   PII was only being shared with certain entities, when in fact it was being shared with other
1524   entities as well; (2) Information System Privacy Officers and Managers (ISPO/ISPMs) had too
1525   many systems to oversee, monthly data processing reports were not reviewed in a timely manner,
1526   and management was not receiving reports of critical problematic data actions; and (3) the
1527   financial office employees were not adequately protecting the privacy of employee bank
1528   information when processing the employees’ travel costs.
1529          Analysis Phase: Identify Knowledge and Skill Gaps
1530          During the analysis phase, the CP Learning Manager determined the following:
1531              •   Systems owners of systems processing PII are designated as employees with
1532                  significant privacy responsibilities and participate in an annual three-hour
1533                  customized seminar that includes new policies, privacy risk briefings, and
1534                  network opportunities. During the next version of the existing training, additional
1535                  content on verifying how PII is being process comports with the public privacy
1536                  notice will be added.
1537              •   While the ability to review monthly data processing reports may be a resource
1538                  issue, no training gap is determined at this time. Further analysis would be needed
1539                  to determine whether ISPO/ISPMs were able to identify critical problematic data
