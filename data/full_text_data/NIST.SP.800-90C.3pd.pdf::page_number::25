      NIST SP 800-90C 3pd (Third Public Draft)                         Recommendation for RBG Constructions
      September 2022

682       1. Shall destroy intermediate values before exiting the function or routine in which they are
683          used,
684       2. Shall employ an “atomic” generate operation whereby a generate request is completed
685          before using any of the requested bits,
686       3. Should consider the threats posed by quantum computers in the future, and
687       4. Should be implemented with the capability to support a security strength of 256 bits or to
688          provide full-entropy output.
689   When using RBGs, the user or application requesting the generation of random or pseudorandom
690   bits should request only the number of bits required for a specific immediate purpose rather than
691   generating bits to be stored for future use. Since, in most cases, the bits are intended to be secret,
692   the stored bits (if not properly protected) are potentially vulnerable to exposure, thus defeating the
693   requirement for secrecy.

694           General Function Calls
695   Functions used within this document for accessing the DRBGs in [SP800-90A], the entropy
696   sources in [SP800-90B], and the RBG3 constructions specified in SP 800-90C are provided below.
697   Each function shall return a status code that shall be checked (e.g., a status of success or failure
698   by the function).
699   If the status code indicates a success, then additional information may also be returned, such as a
700   state handle from an instantiate function or the bits that were requested to be generated during a
701   generate function.
702   If the status code indicates a failure of an RBG component, then see Section 7.1.2 for error-
703   handling guidance. Note that if the status code does not indicate a success, an invalid output (e.g.,
704   a null bitstring) shall be returned with the status code if information other than the status code
705   could be returned.
