inadvertently and which have a considerably longer battery life than active tags, but which still have
effective operating ranges within CRC’s requirements.

The next step was to plan the location of the stationary readers and the frequencies at which they would
operate. In preparation for this exercise, CRC had qualified individuals perform a site survey, which
recommended locations for the readers and identified existing spectrum utilization within the facility.
They found that patient sensors and medical telemetry devices were operating at low frequencies (125
kHz) and at ultra high frequency ranges (915 MHz). Frequencies throughout and above the radio
spectrum were identified in the radiology unit. Based on this information, the design team determined
that the passive RFID system would operate in the high frequency range (13.56 MHz), and the semi-
active RFID system would operate at microwave frequencies (2.45 GHz).

While the risk of eavesdropping from locations outside the facility was considered to be very low, the
design team still thought it would be of value to mitigate the risk to the greatest extent feasible.
Therefore, they ensured that design drawings placed readers away from windows and exterior walls.
Preferred locations were over doorways in rooms and on ceiling mounts in hallways. The devices would
be prohibited in the radiology unit, but would be placed at entries to the unit. Previously installed
shielding in the walls would prevent emissions from impacting the operation of the imaging equipment
inside the unit.

The design team determined that stationary readers would be connected to the RFID middleware
infrastructure using Ethernet, which is also used to network the desktop computers and servers in the
building. To accomplish this, the plan called for the installation of additional network cabling and drops,
and use of the existing Ethernet switches, which had considerable excess capacity. Having the RFID
systems, desktops, and servers all cabled into the same switches created a risk that the RFID system could
be used as a platform to launch an attack on the rest of the network. To mitigate this risk, the design
called for a dedicated VLAN to host the RFID-related network hosts. Traffic could only pass from the
RFID VLAN to other network segments if it traversed the network firewall required by policy in the
initiation phase.

Once the architecture was completed, the CIO assigned two members of the design team to the job of
procuring the system with her review and approval. They paid particular attention to the products’ audit
and management capabilities. Four vendors provided demonstrations of their products and submitted
bids.

8.1.3   Phase 3: Implementation

The various components of the system arrived over a three-week period following the procurement effort.
The implementation team followed the CRC secure configuration guidelines when building all the servers
hosting RFID enterprise software and databases. The implementation team configured all the audit events
and alerts on the RFID systems to be directed to a CRC audit server cluster that supports all of the CRC
IT infrastructure. They also ran a vulnerability scan on all hosts after the installation to identify
remaining weaknesses. Approximately a dozen minor issues were discovered and quickly resolved,
mostly through the application of software patches. The last step in preparing the infrastructure was to
configure the firewall traffic filters and VLAN architecture specified during the acquisition/development
phase.

Applying tags to all the items within the scope of the project was a challenging and time-consuming task.
When possible, tags were positioned on items in such a way as to minimize the probability of tampering,
destruction, or removal. They were also placed where patients are unlikely to experience dermal or
respiratory contact, therefore reducing the probability that a tag’s surface could ever be a mechanism for
