NIST SP 800-85A-4                                          PIV CARD APPLICATION & MIDDLEWARE
                                                                    INTERFACE TEST GUIDELINES

C.1         Card Commands for Data Access

C.1.1           SELECT Card Command

C.1.1.1          Contact Interface
 Purpose                Validates that the PIV Card executes the SELECT card command
                        through the contact interface for the following conditions:
                        1. Long AID.
                        2. Right-truncated short AID.

                        2. AS01.04, AS01.05, AS01.06, AS01.07, AS01.08, AS03.02, AS05.01,
                           AS05.05, AS05.06, AS05.07, AS05.08, AS05.09, AS05.10, AS05.11
 Precondition(s)        1. The IUT (i.e., the PIV Card that is the subject of the test) is
                           inserted into the contact reader.
                        2. There exists a valid PC/SC connection between the test system
                           and the contact reader.
                        3. No application is currently connected to the PIV Card
                           Application.
 Test Scenario          1. Send SELECT card command with
                           • AID == 'A0 00 00 03 08 00 00 10 00 01 00'
                        2. Send SELECT card command without the version number
                           • AID == 'A0 00 00 03 08 00 00 10 00'
 Expected Result(s)     1. The command returns the application property template with the
                            status word '90 00' at the end. Check that the application property
                            template conforms to Table 3 of SP 800-73-4 Part 2.
                        2. The command returns the application property template with the
                            status word '90 00' at the end. Check that the application property
                            template conforms to Table 3 of SP 800-73-4 Part 2.
 Postcondition(s)       PIV Card Application is now the currently selected application. The
                        application security status of the PIV Card Application is
                        established.

C.1.1.2          Error Condition
 Purpose                Validates that the PIV Card Application is not deselected while the
                        currently selected application is the PIV Card Application and the
                        SELECT command is sent with an AID that is not supported by the
                        card.

                        2. AS05.10
 Precondition(s)        1. The IUT is inserted into the contact reader.
                        2. There exists a valid PC/SC connection between the test system
                           and the contact reader.
                        3. No application is currently connected to the PIV Card
                           Application.
