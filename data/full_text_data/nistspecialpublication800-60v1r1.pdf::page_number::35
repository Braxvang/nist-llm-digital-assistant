                                        Implementation Tip
              Agency personnel should be aware that there are several factors that
              should be considered during the aggregation of system information
              types. When considering these factors, previously unforeseen concerns
              may surface affecting the confidentiality, integrity, and/or availability
              impact levels at the system level. These factors include data
              aggregation, critical system functionality, extenuating circumstances,
              and other system factors.

In order to effectively accomplish this step, various stakeholders (e.g., management, operational
personnel, or security experts) may need to be involved in decisions regarding system-level
impact assessments. The following sections provide factors to consider in adjusting the system
security objective impact levels.
4.4.2.1      Aggregation
Some information may have little or no sensitivity in isolation but may be highly sensitive in
aggregation. In some cases, aggregation of large quantities of a single information type can
reveal sensitive patterns and plans, or facilitate access to sensitive or critical systems. In other
cases, aggregation of information of several different and seemingly innocuous types can have
similar effects. In general, the sensitivity of a given data element is likely to be greater in
context than in isolation (e.g., association of an account number with the identity of an individual
and/or institution). The availability, routine operational employment, and sophistication of data
aggregation and inference tools are all increasing rapidly. If review reveals increased sensitivity
or criticality associated with information aggregates, then the system security objective impact
levels may need to be adjusted to a higher level than would be indicated by the security impact
levels associated with any individual information type. This could be implemented by
incorporating a statement that explains the aggregation and potential security objective affected
as well as the modification to impact levels.
4.4.2.2      Critical System Functionality
Compromise of some information types may have low impact in the context of a system’s
primary function but may have much more significance when viewed in the context of the
potential impact of compromising:
   •      Other systems to which the system in question is connected, or
   •      Other systems which are dependent on that system’s information.
Access control information for a system that processes only low impact information might
initially be thought to have only low impact security objectives. However, if access to that
system might result in some form of access to other systems (e.g., over a network), the sensitivity
and criticality attributes of all systems to which such indirect access can result needs to be
considered. Similarly, some information may, in general, have low sensitivity and/or criticality
security objectives. However, that information may be used by other systems to enable
extremely sensitive or critical functions (e.g., air traffic control use of weather information or use
of commercial flight information to identify military combat transport systems). Loss of data
integrity, availability, temporal context, or other context can have catastrophic consequences.
