3.1.9. Mobile Malware
Mobile devices are designed to make it easy for users to find, acquire, and install third-party apps
offered by app stores. Some users may sideload applications onto their device by allowing
installation from untrusted or unknown sources. This accessibility poses significant security
risks, especially for mobile device platforms and app stores that do not place security restrictions
or other limitations on third-party app publishing. Organizations should base their mobile device
security policy on the assumption that all unknown third-party apps downloaded by its
employees to enterprise-accessible mobile devices are untrusted. Any application installed onto a
mobile device can act as a portal for the developer to compromise the device and access sensitive
enterprise information.
Mobile devices have many sensors, like microphones and cameras, to improve user functionality,
such as making phone calls and taking advanced pictures. Most mobile devices have two
cameras (front and back) and have at least one microphone for audio input. Mobile malware on a
mobile device can use these sensors to unknowingly collect information about the user or the
administrator. Microphones and cameras should only be exposed when in use and protected at all
other times.

3.1.10. Information Loss Due to Insecure Lock Screen Configuration
The lock screen is the first barrier that an unauthorized user must pass to gain access to
information stored on a mobile device. The lock screen can be configured with an authentication
factor to restrict access to the device. If poorly protected with a simple password, the lock screen
may be breached through a brute-force attack. An unauthorized user who has compromised the
authentication factor of a mobile device can access all sensitive information, modify the
information, and pretend to be the device’s owner to gain further access to enterprise data.
The lock screen can also be configured to display notifications related to missed calls or
messages, app alerts, emails received, etc. Information shown on the lock screen, such as emails,
may display sensitive enterprise information. These lock screen notifications may provide an
unauthorized user with information without the need to unlock the mobile device.

3.1.11. User Privacy Violations
The collection and monitoring of user or employee data can greatly undermine an individual’s
personal privacy. Many mobile apps collect and monitor user data such as location, contacts,
browsing history, and general system information. This information is commonly used for
marketing purposes to direct specific advertisements to the user. Mobile applications are not the
only systems that collect user information, as most of the business systems (e.g., EMM, MTD)
used for mobility may also have this capability, meaning that an employer may collect sensitive
information about an employee. Under the Privacy Act of 1974, this type of data collection is
