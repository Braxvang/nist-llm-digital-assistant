                                  GUIDE TO MALWARE INCIDENT PREVENTION AND HANDLING FOR DESKTOPS AND LAPTOPS


As described in Section 4, organizations should also make users aware of policies and procedures that
apply to malware incident handling, such as how to identify if a host may be infected, how to report a
suspected incident, and what users might need to do to assist with incident handling (e.g., updating
antivirus software, scanning hosts for malware). Users should be made aware of how the organization will
communicate notices of major malware incidents and given a way to verify the authenticity of all such
notices. In addition, users should be aware of changes that might be temporarily made to the environment
to contain an incident, such as disconnecting infected hosts from networks.

As part of awareness activities, organizations should educate their users on the social engineering
techniques that are employed to trick users into disclosing information. Examples of recommendations for
avoiding phishing attacks and other forms of social engineering include:

       Never reply to email requests for financial or personal information. Instead, contact the person or
        the organization at the legitimate phone number or website. Do not use the contact information
        provided in the email, and do not click on any attachments or hyperlinks in the email.
       Do not provide passwords, PINs, or other access codes in response to emails or unsolicited popup
        windows. Only enter such information into the legitimate website or application.
       Do not open suspicious email file attachments, even if they come from known senders. If an
        unexpected attachment is received, contact the sender (preferably by a method other than email,
        such as phone) to confirm that the attachment is legitimate.
       Do not respond to any suspicious or unwanted emails. (Asking to have an email address removed
        from a malicious party’s mailing list confirms the existence and active use of that email address,
        potentially leading to additional attack attempts.)
Although user awareness programs are increasingly important to help reduce the frequency and severity
of social engineering-driven malware incidents, the impact of these programs is still typically not as great
as that of the technical controls described in Sections 3.3 through 3.5 for malware incident prevention. An
organization should not rely on user awareness as its primary method of preventing malware incidents;
instead, the awareness program should supplement the technical controls to provide additional protection
against incidents.

The awareness program for users should also serve as the foundation for awareness activities for the IT
staff involved in malware incident prevention, such as security, system, and network administrators. All
IT staff members should have some basic level of awareness regarding malware prevention, and
individuals should be trained in the malware prevention–related tasks that pertain to their areas of
responsibility. In addition, on an ongoing basis, some IT staff members (most likely, some members of
the security or incident response teams) should receive and review bulletins on types of new malware
threats, assess the likely risk to the organization, and inform the necessary IT staff members of the new
threat so that incidents can be prevented. IT staff awareness activities related to malware incident
handling are discussed in Section 4.

3.3     Vulnerability Mitigation

As described in Section 2, malware often attacks hosts by exploiting vulnerabilities in operating systems,
services, and applications. Consequently, mitigating vulnerabilities is very important to the prevention of
malware incidents, particularly when malware is released shortly after the announcement of a new
vulnerability, or even before a vulnerability is publicly acknowledged. A vulnerability can usually be
mitigated by one or more methods, such as applying patches to update the software or reconfiguring the
software (e.g., disabling a vulnerable service). Because of the challenges that vulnerability mitigation
