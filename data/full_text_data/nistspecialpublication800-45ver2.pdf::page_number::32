GUIDELINES ON ELECTRONIC MAIL SECURITY



 Scanning for viruses and other malware and filtering email content at the firewall and mail server is
  made significantly more complicated by encryption. If the firewall or mail server does not have a
  method for decrypting the email, it cannot read and act upon the contents. Some malware scanners
  can decrypt emails if the scanner is a recipient of the emails or if the sender specifically encrypts the
  emails for the scanner, but such solutions are technically complex and often hard to enforce. Also,
  giving the malware scanner the ability to decrypt many or all emails could have serious consequences
  if the malware scanner host is itself infected or otherwise compromised. If having the malware
  scanner decrypt emails is not feasible, scanning might have to be performed on the hosts of the mail
  clients that perform decryption.
 Encryption and decryption require processor time. Organizations might need to upgrade or replace
  equipment that is not capable of supporting the load of encryption and decryption.
 Organization-wide use of encryption can require significant ongoing administrative overhead.
  Examples of this include key distribution, key recovery, and revocation of encryption keys.
 Email encryption can complicate the review of email messages by law enforcement and other
  investigative parties.
 Encrypted emails sent to or received from other organizations may be insufficiently protected if those
  organizations do not support the use of strong encryption algorithms and key sizes. Organizations
  should ensure that their usersâ€™ mail applications notify them when they receive a weakly encrypted
  message or when they are attempting to send an encrypted message to a recipient that only supports
  weak encryption methods. Users can then contact the relevant party to notify them of the problem
  and request that they either use a stronger encryption algorithm or transfer the information that needs
  protected through a mechanism other than email.
