FR:11.15 The CKMS design shall specify the scope of incremental security assessments.

11.4 Security Maintenance
While a CKMS may be designed, developed and deployed to provide a specific level of
protection (e.g., low, medium, or high), the protection provided may be reduced as
configuration changes are made and as new threats are found. In order to maintain and
enhance the security of the system, the CKMS should be properly upgraded, reviewed
and tested against hardening guidelines. Examples of hardening activities include
updating the CKMS with the latest security patches, periodic review of the system
configuration against the hardening guidelines, periodic testing of the CKMS against
hardening guidelines, application of revised hardening guidelines, and periodic
penetration testing.

FR:11.16 The CKMS design shall list the hardening activities required to be performed
in order to maintain its security.

12. Technological Challenges
A CKMS should be designed and implemented to have a security lifetime of many years.
Therefore, the designer should consider possible threats resulting from advances in
technology that may render the CKMS insecure. Some examples are discussed below.

   a) New Attacks on Cryptographic Algorithms
      A cryptographic algorithm has an expected security life. However, as time passes,
      new attacks may be found that reduce its security life. This, in turn, is likely to
      reduce the security lifetime of the CKMS that relies on the algorithm to protect its
      keys and metadata. Eventually, the cryptographic algorithm may need to be
      upgraded or replaced altogether.

       Cryptographic algorithms should be implemented within cryptographic modules
       in a manner so that the algorithms can be replaced or updated without
       significantly affecting the rest of the implementation. For example, key lengths
       and block lengths should be variable so that they may be easily increased if and
       when necessary.

   b) New Attacks on Key Establishment Protocols
      Weaknesses are often found in protocols after they have been in use for several
      years. Protocols are seldom evaluated to the same extent as cryptographic
      algorithms, and it is often difficult to upgrade a protocol once it is widely used.
      Therefore, it is important that a CKMS uses evaluated and tested protocols for key
      establishment.

   c) New Attacks on CKMS Devices
      New methods for logically attacking and subverting computer-based systems are
      continuously being discovered. The CKMS designer should prevent, to the
