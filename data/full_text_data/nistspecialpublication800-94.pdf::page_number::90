GUIDE TO INTRUSION DETECTION AND PREVENTION SYSTEMS (IDPS)



     infection, when IDPSs might become overwhelmed with worm alerts and other important events
     occurring at the same time might go unnoticed by IDPS users.
Limitations of antivirus and antispyware software in the context of IDPS include the following:

 Antivirus and antispyware software cannot detect threats other than malware and spyware.
 Network-based IDPS and NBA software are often better able to recognize network service worms
  than antivirus software can because antivirus software often monitors only the most common
  application protocols. Also, antispyware software typically cannot detect network service worms.
  Network-based IDPS and NBA software can typically monitor any protocol.
 For a new threat, antivirus and antispyware software often cannot recognize it until the vendor
  releases new signatures and updates are installed. In some cases, especially for threats with easily
  identifiable characteristics, an IDPS can detect the new threat during this window of time because
  IDPS administrators can write a custom signature for the IDPS. Antivirus and antispyware software
  typically do not permit administrators to write signatures. Also, NBA software can often recognize
  new worms by their anomalous traffic patterns.
8.3.3    Firewalls and Routers

Firewalls (network-based and host-based) and routers filter network traffic based on TCP/IP
characteristics such as the source and destination IP addresses, the transport layer protocol (e.g., TCP,
UDP, ICMP), and basic protocol information (e.g., TCP or UDP port numbers, ICMP type and code).
Most firewalls and routers log which connections or connection attempts they block; the blocked activity
is often generated by unauthorized access attempts from automated attack tools, port scanning, and
malware. Some network-based firewalls also act as proxies. When a proxy is used, each successful
connection attempt actually results in the creation of two separate connections: one between the client and
the proxy server, and another between the proxy server and the true destination. Many proxies are
application-specific, and some actually perform some analysis and validation of common application
protocols, such as HTTP. The proxy may reject client requests that appear to be invalid (which could
include some forms of attacks) and log information regarding these requests.

Ways in which firewalls and routers complement IDPSs include the following: 50

 Network-based firewalls and routers often perform network address translation (NAT), which is the
  process of mapping addresses on one network to addresses on another network. NAT is most often
  accomplished by mapping private addresses from an internal network to one or more public addresses
  on a network that is connected to the Internet. Firewalls and routers that perform NAT typically
  record each NAT address and mapping. IDPS users may need to make use of this mapping
  information to identify the actual IP address of a host behind a device performing NAT.
 If IDPSs and other security controls (e.g., antivirus software) cannot stop a new network-borne threat,
  such as a network service worm or denial of service attack, firewalls or routers might have to be
  temporarily reconfigured to block the threat.
 As mentioned in Sections 4 through 7, many IDPSs can reconfigure firewalls or routers to block
  particular threats.
 Routers are often used as data sources for NBA deployments.

     Some firewalls and routers can run IDPS software. The discussion in this section addresses only the core capabilities of
     firewalls and routers, not add-on IDPS capabilities.
