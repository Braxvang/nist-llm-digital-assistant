    ÔÅÆ   Report conclusions

Digital evidence, as well as the tools, techniques and methodologies used in an examination is
subject to being challenged in a court of law or other formal proceedings. Proper
documentation is essential in providing individuals the ability to re-create the process from
beginning to end. As part of the reporting process, making a copy of the software used and
including it with the output produced is advisable when custom tools are used for examination
or analysis, should it become necessary to reproduce forensic processing results.
