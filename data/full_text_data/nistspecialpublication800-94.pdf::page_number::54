GUIDE TO INTRUSION DETECTION AND PREVENTION SYSTEMS (IDPS)



band is separated into channels. 31 It is not currently possible for a sensor to monitor all traffic on a band
simultaneously; a sensor has to monitor a single channel at a time. When the sensor is ready to monitor a
different channel, the sensor must shut its radio off, change the channel, then turn its radio on. The longer
a single channel is monitored, the more likely it is that the sensor will miss malicious activity occurring
on other channels. To avoid this, sensors typically change channels frequently, which is known as
channel scanning, so that they can monitor each channel a few times per second. To reduce or eliminate
channel scanning, specialized sensors are available that use several radios and high-power antennas, with
each radio/antenna pair monitoring a different channel. Because of their higher sensitivities, the high-
power antennas also have a larger monitoring range than regular antennas. Some implementations
coordinate scanning patterns among sensors with overlapping ranges so that each sensor needs to monitor
fewer channels. 32

Wireless sensors are available in multiple forms:

 Dedicated. A dedicated sensor is a device that performs wireless IDPS functions but does not pass
  network traffic from source to destination. Dedicated sensors are often completely passive,
  functioning in a radio frequency (RF) monitoring mode to sniff wireless network traffic. Some
  dedicated sensors perform analysis of the traffic they monitor, while other sensors forward the
  network traffic to a management server for analysis. The sensor is typically connected to the wired
  network (e.g., Ethernet cable between the sensor and a switch). Dedicated sensors are usually
  designed for one of two deployment types:

     –   Fixed—the sensor is deployed to a particular location. Such sensors are typically dependent on
         the organization’s infrastructure (e.g., power, wired network). 33 Fixed sensors are usually
         appliance-based.

     –   Mobile—the sensor is designed to be used while in motion. For example, a security
         administrator could use a mobile sensor while walking through an organization’s buildings and
         campus to find rogue APs. Mobile sensors are either appliance-based or software-based (e.g.,
         software installed onto a laptop with a wireless NIC capable of doing RF monitoring). 34
 Bundled with an AP. Several vendors have added IDPS capabilities to APs. A bundled AP
  typically provides a less rigorous detection capability than a dedicated sensor because the AP needs to
  divide its time between providing network access and monitoring multiple channels or bands for

     IEEE 802.11b and g support 14 channels: 11 authorized for U.S. use and 3 authorized for international use. IEEE 802.11a
     supports 12 channels authorized for U.S. use and 4 channels authorized for international use. Some attackers use unusual
     channels or non-IEEE 802.11 frequency bands, such as 900 MHz or 4.9 GHz, because their activity is less likely to be
     detected than the use of the typical WLAN frequencies and channels. For example, an attacker who can gain unauthorized
     physical access to a wired network could install a wireless device that can subsequently transmit information from the
     organization to the attacker over an atypical frequency. Spectrum analyzer products can monitor activity on different
     frequency bands to identify attacks and to find benign sources of interference, such as cordless phones and microwaves. As
     of mid-2006, few IDPS products offer any spectrum analysis capabilities. However, several companies offer mobile
     handheld spectrum analyzers that can monitor common bands. A detailed discussion of them is outside the scope of this
     document.
32
     Organizations need to determine which channels should be monitored. As previously explained, attackers often use unusual
     channels, such as IEEE 802.11a, b, or g channels that are not authorized for U.S. use. Although monitoring these channels
     can detect such activity, it could reduce the percentage of time monitoring the channels that are used both by the
     organization’s WLANs and also typical rogue WLANs, such as unauthorized access points. Organizations should consider
     the likelihood of the possible threats and choose a channel scanning plan that best addresses the threats.
33
     Some sensors can use the IEEE 802.3af protocol, also known as Power over Ethernet (PoE). This allows a sensor to receive
     its electrical power through the same Ethernet cable that connects it to the wired network. PoE is implemented in some
     dedicated sensors and access points. More information on PoE is available at http://www.ieee802.org/3/af/index.html

     Mobile sensors may be part of an enterprise wireless IDPS solution or may be standalone devices, managed and monitored
     directly by an administrator.
