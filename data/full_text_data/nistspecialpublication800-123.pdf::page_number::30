                                                                                       GUIDE TO GENERAL SERVER SECURITY



      expensive and difficult to implement, but they may be justified in some circumstances. When such
      authentication mechanisms and devices are used, the organization’s policy should be changed
      accordingly, if necessary. Some organizational policies may already require the use of strong
      authentication mechanisms.

As mentioned earlier, attackers using network sniffers can easily capture passwords passed across a
network in clear text. However, passwords are economical and appropriate if properly protected while in
transit. Organizations should implement authentication and encryption technologies, such as Secure
Sockets Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS), Secure Shell (SSH), or virtual private networks
using IPsec or SSL/TLS, to protect passwords during transmission over untrusted networks. Requiring
server authentication to be used with encryption technologies reduces the likelihood of successful man-in-
the-middle and spoofing attacks.

4.2.3     Configure Resource Controls Appropriately

All commonly used server OSs provide the capability to specify access privileges individually for files,
directories, devices, and other computational resources. By carefully setting access controls and denying
personnel unauthorized access, the server administrator can reduce intentional and unintentional security
breaches. For example, denying read access to files and directories helps to protect confidentiality of
information, and denying unnecessary write (modify) access can help maintain the integrity of
information. Limiting the execution privilege of most system-related tools to authorized system
administrators can prevent users from making configuration changes that could reduce security. It also
can restrict the attacker’s ability to use those tools to attack the server or other hosts on the network.
Auditing should also be enabled as appropriate to monitor attempts to access protected resources.

In some cases, administrators configure the OS so as to provide an isolated virtual environment that the
server software will be run within. This environment, sometimes called a sandbox or a jail, presents a
limited set of real or virtual resources that the server software or its users can access. The OS is
configured so that server processes and user actions cannot “break out” of the environment. A common
example of an isolated virtual environment is the use of the Unix chroot command to contain anonymous
FTP activity. Even if a malicious user exploited a vulnerability in the FTP service, the user would only
gain access to the virtual environment and not to the underlying OS. Details on creating sandbox and jail
environments are OS and server-specific, and therefore are outside the scope of this publication.

4.3     Install and Configure Additional Security Controls

OSs often do not include all of the security controls necessary to secure the OS, services, and applications
adequately. In such cases, administrators need to select, install, configure, and maintain additional
software to provide the missing controls. Commonly needed controls include the following:

 Anti-malware software, such as antivirus software, anti-spyware software, and rootkit detectors, to
  protect the local OS from malware and to detect and eradicate any infections that occur. 20 Examples
  of when anti-malware software would be helpful include a system administrator bringing infected
  media to the server and a network service worm contacting the server and infecting it.

 Host-based intrusion detection and prevention software (IDPS), to detect attacks performed against
  the server, including DoS attacks. For example, one form of host-based IDPS, file integrity checking
  software, can identify changes to critical system files.
