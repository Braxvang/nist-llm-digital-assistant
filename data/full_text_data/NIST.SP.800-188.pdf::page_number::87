Because our understanding of privacy technology and the capabilities of privacy attacks are
rapidly evolving, techniques that have been previously established should be periodically
reviewed. New vulnerabilities may be discovered in techniques that have been previously
accepted. Alternatively, new techniques may be developed that allow agencies to reevaluate
the trade-offs they have made with respect to privacy risk and data usability.

5.2.     De-Identifcation Tools
A de-identifcation tool is a program that is involved in the creation of de-identifed datasets.

5.2.1.    De-Identifcation Tool Features
De-identifcation tools may perform many functions, including:
    • Detecting identifying information
    • Calculating re-identifcation risk
    • Performing de-identifcation
    • Mapping identifers to pseudonyms
    • Providing for the selective revelation of pseudonyms
De-identifcation tools may handle a variety of data modalities. For example, tools may
be designed for tabular data or for multimedia. Tools may attempt to de-identify all data
types or be developed for specifc modalities. A potential risk of using de-identifcation
tools is that a tool could be equipped to handle some but not all of the different modalities
in a dataset. For example, a tool could de-identify the categorical information in a table
according to a de-identifcation standard but might not detect or attempt to address the
presence of identifying information in a text feld. For this reason, de-identifcation tools
should be validated for the specifc kinds of data that the agency intends to use.

5.2.2.    Data Provenance and File Formats
Output fles created by de-identifcation tools and data masking tools can record provenance
information, such as metadata regarding input datasets, the de-identifcation methods used,
and the resulting decrease in data accuracy. Output fles can also be explicitly marked to in-
dicate that they have been de-identifed. For example, de-identifcation profles that are part
of the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) specifcation indicate
which elements are direct versus quasi-identifers and which de-identifcation algorithms
have been employed [43, Appendix E, “Attribute Confdentiality Profles”].

5.2.3.    Data Masking Tools
Data masking tools are programs that can remove or replace designated felds in a dataset
while maintaining relationships between tables. These tools can be used to remove direct
