NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                      Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
December 2023                                                                             and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

     Identifier                          Issuer Control                           Applicability               Source

                            attempts to activate the memorized secret has
                            exceeded that set by the issuer (test, observe).
     AI(DC)-16     This control is withdrawn. Requirements for issuance                 -         -
                   over multiple transactions is covered by AI(DC)-18.
     AI(DC)-17     A derived PIV credential at AAL3 is issued after verifying      PKI-AAL3,      [SP800-157], Sec. 2.2 – Initial
    (UPDATED)      that the applicant is currently eligible to possess a PIV      Non-PKI-AAL3    Issuance
                   Card by (i) performing the PKI-AUTH authentication
                   mechanism described in Sec. 6.2.3.1 of [FIPS201] and
                   (ii) identifying themselves using a biometric sample that
                   can be verified against their PIV Card or the biometric
                   information in their enrollment record.

                   Assessment
                   Determine that:
                        (i) The issuer has a documented process in place to
                            verify the identity of the applicant (review).
                       (ii) Derived PIV credentials at AAL3 are issued in
                            accordance with [SP800-63B]. Sec. 6.1.2.1
                            (review, interview, observe).
     AI(DC)-18     If the issuance of a derived PIV credential at AAL3             PKI-AAL3,      [SP800-157], Sec. 2.2 – Initial
    (UPDATED)      consists of two or more transactions, the applicant            Non-PKI-AAL3    Issuance
                   identifies themselves using a biometric sample that can
                   be verified against either their PIV Card or a biometric
                   sample that was recorded in a previous transaction.

                   Assessment
                   Determine that:
                       (i) The issuer retains the biometric sample for future
                           reference. The retained biometric is used to verify
                           the applicant (review, interview, observe).
                      (ii) The issuing facility verifies the identity of the
                           applicant by using a biometric sample that can be
                           verified against their PIV Card or a biometric that
                           was recorded in a previous transaction (review,
                           observe).
     AI(DC)-19     The issuer notifies the PIV cardholder of the binding of a         DPCI        [SP800-157], Sec. 2.2 – Initial
      (NEW)        derived PIV credential through independent means that                          Issuance
                   would not afford an attacker the opportunity to interfere
                   with the notification.

                   Assessment
                   Determine that:
                      (i) The issuer has a process to notify the PIV
                           cardholder of the binding of a derived PIV
                           credential (review).
                     (ii) The method of notification does not provide an
                           attacker with an opportunity to interfere with the
                           notification (review, observe).
     AI(DC)-20     Activation using a biometric characteristic meets the              DPCI        [SP800-157], Sec. 3.1.4 –
      (NEW)        requirements of [SP800-63B], Sec. 5.2.3.                                       Activation Data

                   Assessment                                                                     [SP800-157], Sec. 3.2.3 –
                   Determine that:                                                                Activation Data
                     (i) Activation of the biometric characteristic meets
                         the requirements of [SP800-63B], Sec. 5.2.3
                         (review, interview).
