       December 2022


2086   Reauthentication
2087   The process of confirming the subscriber’s continued presence and intent to be
2088   authenticated during an extended usage session.

2089   Registration
2090   See Enrollment.

2091   Relying Party (RP)
2092   An entity that relies upon a verifier’s assertion of a subscriber’s identity, typically to
2093   process a transaction or grant access to information or a system.

2094   Remote
2095   (In the context of remote authentication or remote transaction) An information exchange
2096   between network-connected devices where the information cannot be reliably protected
2097   end-to-end by a single organization’s security controls.

2098   Replay Attack
2099   An attack in which the attacker is able to replay previously captured messages (between
2100   a legitimate claimant and a verifier) to masquerade as that claimant to the verifier or vice
2101   versa.

2102   Replay Resistance
2103   The property of an authentication process to resist replay attacks, typically by use of an

2105   Resolution
2106   See Identity Resolution.

2107   Restricted
2108   An authenticator type, class, or instantiation having additional risk of false acceptance

2112   (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), organizational assets, individuals,
2113   and other organizations, resulting from the operation of a system. It is part of risk
2114   management, incorporates threat and vulnerability analyses, and considers mitigations
2115   provided by security controls planned or in place. Synonymous with risk analysis.

2116   Risk Management
2117   The program and supporting processes to manage information security risk to
2118   organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, reputation), organizational
