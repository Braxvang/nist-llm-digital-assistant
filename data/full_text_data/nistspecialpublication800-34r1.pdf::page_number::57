                                                         CONTINGENCY PLANNING GUIDE FOR FEDERAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS



Chapter 5.           Technical Contingency Planning Considerations

This chapter complements the process and framework guidelines presented in earlier sections by
discussing technical contingency planning considerations for specific types of information systems. The
information presented in this section will assist the reader in selecting, developing, and implementing
specific technical contingency strategies based on the type of information system. Because each system is
unique, considerations are provided at a level that may be used by the widest audience. The list of
platforms is not comprehensive, but is representative of commonly found systems in production or
development. Not all of the information presented may apply to a specific information system; the ISCP
Coordinator should draw on the considerations as appropriate and customize them to meet a system’s
particular contingency requirements. The following representative platform types are addressed in this
section:

           Client/server systems;
           Telecommunications systems; and
           Mainframe systems.

For each system type, contingency measures are considered from two perspectives. First, the document
discusses technical requirements or factors that the ISCP Coordinator should consider when planning a
system recovery strategy during the Development/Acquisition Phase of the SDLC. 36 Second, the
document provides technology-based solutions for each type of system.

5.1         Common Considerations

The technical considerations and solutions addressed in this section include preventive measures
discussed in Section 3.3 and recovery measures described in Section 3.4. When developing solutions for
technical contingency plans, there are several areas that should be considered regardless of the platform or
type of system. These considerations provide a common foundation for any type of contingency planning
effort. Several of these contingency measures are common to all information systems. Common
considerations include the following:

           Use of information gathered from the BIA process;
           Development of data security, integrity, and backup policies and procedures;
           Protection of equipment and system resources;
           Adherence and compliance with security controls in NIST SP 800-53;
           Development of primary and alternate sites with appropriately sized and configured power
            management systems and environmental controls; and
           Use of high availability (HA) processes to provide for online real-time resilient access to alternate
            system resources. HA denotes systems that can achieve an uptime of 99.999 percent or better.
            Note that HA is a process for achieving high availability and should not be confused with FIPS
            199 high-impact category systems.
