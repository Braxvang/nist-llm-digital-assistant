      NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                    Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
      December 2023                                                           and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

414           Applicability, Intended Audience, and Usage
415   This document is applicable to and SHALL be used by all federal organizations. It may also be
416   used by any other organization (e.g., state or local government, educational institution, non-profit
417   group) that wishes to align with [FIPS201] and associated PIV credentials.
418   All federal organizations are required to adopt [HSPD-12] and implement [FIPS201]. They must
419   use the methodology and issuer controls outlined in this document to assess the adequacy of their
420   implementations as well as the reliability of the directly controlled and subcontracted services
421   involved in creating and issuing the mandatory PIV Cards and the optional derived PIV
422   credentials (if implemented).
423   This document is consistent and compatible with the control objectives in [HSPD-12],
424   [FIPS201], [SP800-157], and [SP800-37]. It includes the roles, requirements, definitions,
425   specifications, and procedures needed to assess the reliability of an issuing organization. If an
426   issuer fails to meet the prescribed assessment criteria, they must immediately halt operations.
427   Once an issuer is authorized to operate using these guidelines, trust can be established in the
428   issued PIV credentials throughout their life cycles.

429           Requirements, Notations, and Conventions
430   This standard uses the following typographical conventions in text:
431       •   Specific terms in CAPITALS represent normative requirements. When these same terms
432           are not in CAPITALS, the term does not represent a normative requirement.
433                o The terms “SHALL” and “SHALL NOT” indicate requirements to be followed
434                  strictly in order to conform to the publication and from which no deviation is
435                  permitted.
436                o The terms “SHOULD” and “SHOULD NOT” indicate that among several
437                  possibilities, one is recommended as particularly suitable without mentioning or
438                  excluding others, that a certain course of action is preferred but not necessarily
439                  required, or that (in the negative form) a certain possibility or course of action is
440                  discouraged but not prohibited.
441                o The terms “MAY” and “NEED NOT” indicate a course of action that is
442                  permissible within the limits of the publication.
443                o The terms “CAN” and “CANNOT” indicate a material, physical, or causal
444                  possibility or capability or — in the negative — the absence of that possibility or
445                  capability.

449           and authorization methodology as well as the inputs and outputs involved in the
450           assessment of the issuance processes. These include (i) the definition of the target entities
