      NIST SP 800-201 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                     Cloud Computing Forensic
      February 2023                                                                     Reference Architecture

586   When the question is asked: does a forensic challenge affect a functional capability, it is defined
587   to mean: if the challenge were overcome, would that make it easier to conduct a cloud forensic
588   investigation on the considered functional capability? This is the relationship that the mapping
589   between challenges and capabilities is attempting to capture.
590   To help answer this question, the NCC FSWG developed a summary for each of the 62 challenges.
591   This summary answers the following question for each specific challenge: What advantages would
592   be provided to a forensic investigator if this challenge were overcome (or mitigated)? If these
593   advantages imply that the quality of forensics that can be performed on the functional capability
594   could be improved, then the answer is YES, overcoming the challenge could make it easier to
595   perform a forensic investigation on the capability. The summaries for the 62 challenges are found
596   in NIST IR 8006 [1], Annex A, Table 1.
597   The goal was to provide a narrow, precise mapping between challenges and capabilities. A
598   flowchart was developed that was followed to achieve this mapping, as shown in Fig. 2.

602   The flowchart provides users with a uniform method for determining the applicability of a
603   challenge to a particular capability. In conducting the analysis, the NCC FSWG placed each
604   cloud forensic challenge into one of two groups: 1) challenges that are primarily technical in
605   nature (e.g., architecture), or 2) challenges that are primarily non-technical in nature (e.g., legal).
606   This led to the creation of questions Q2-a, Q2-b, Q2-c, and Q2-d in the flowchart, which perform
607   the placement into the two groups. If a challenge deals primarily with standards, legal issues,
608   contracts, service-level agreements, jurisdiction issues, privacy, ethical issues, training,
609   qualifications, or certifications, then the challenge is considered non-technical. Otherwise, it is
