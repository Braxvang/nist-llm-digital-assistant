      NIST SP 800-90C 3pd (Third Public Draft)                       Recommendation for RBG Constructions
      September 2022

109   Note to Reviewers
110   1. This draft of SP800-90C describes three RBG constructions. Note that in this draft, a non-
111      deterministic random bit generator (NRBG) is presented as an RBG3 construction.
112       Question: In a future revision of SP 800-90C, should other constructions be included?
113       This version of SP 800-90C does not address the use of an RBG software implementation in
114       which a) a cryptographic library or an application is loaded into a system and b) the software
115       accesses entropy sources or RBGs already associated with the system for its required
116       randomness. NIST intends to address this situation in the near future.
117   2. The RBG constructions provided in this draft use NIST-approved cryptographic primitives
118      (such as block ciphers and hash functions) as underlying components. Note that non-vetted
119      conditioning components may be used within SP 800-90B entropy sources.
120       Although NIST still allows three-key TDEA as a block-cipher algorithm, Section 4 of [SP800-
121       131A] indicates that its use is deprecated through 2023 and will be disallowed thereafter for
122       applying cryptographic protection. This document (i.e., SP 800-90C) does not approve the
123       use of three-key TDEA in an RBG.
124       Although SHA-1 is still approved by NIST, NIST is planning to remove SHA-1 from a future
125       revision of FIPS 180-4, so the SP 800-90 series will not be including the use of SHA-1.
126       The use of the SHA-3 hash functions are approved in SP 800-90C for Hash_DRBG and
127       HMAC_DRBG but are not currently included in [SP800-90A]. SP 800-90A will be revised to
128       exclude the use of TDEA and SHA-1 and include the use of the SHA-3 family of hash
129       functions.
130   3. Since the projected date for requiring a minimum security strength of 128 bits for U.S.
131      Government applications is 2030 (see [SP800-57Part1]), RBGs are only specified to provide
132      128, 192, and 256 bits of security strength (i.e., the 112-bit security strength has been
133      removed). Note that a consuming application may still request a lower security strength, but
134      the RBG output will be generated at the instantiated security strength.
135   4. Guidance is provided for accessing entropy sources and for obtaining full-entropy bits using
136      the output of an entropy source that does not inherently provide full-entropy output (see
137      Section 3.3).
138   5. SP 800-90A requires that when instantiating a CTR_DRBG without a derivation function, the
139      randomness source needs to provide full-entropy bits (see SP 800-90A). However, this draft
140      (SP 800-90C) relaxes this requirement in the case of an RBG1 construction, as specified in
141      Section 4. In this case, the external randomness source may be another RBG construction. An
142      addendum to SP 800-90A has been prepared as a temporary specification in SP 800-90C, but
143      SP 800-90A will be revised in the future to accommodate this change.
144   6. The DRBG used in RBG3 constructions supports a security strength of 256 bits. The RBG1
145      and RBG2 constructions may support any valid security strength (i.e., 128, 192 or 256 bits).
146   7. SP 800-90A currently allows the acquisition of a nonce (when required) for DRBG
147      instantiation from any randomness source. However, SP 800-90C does not include an explicit
148      requirement for the generation of a nonce when instantiating a DRBG. Instead, additional bits
