      January 2023


141   Call for Patent Claims

142   This public review includes a call for information on essential patent claims (claims
143   whose use would be required for compliance with the guidance or requirements in this
144   Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) draft publication). Such guidance and/or
145   requirements may be directly stated in this ITL Publication or by reference to another
146   publication. This call also includes disclosure, where known, of the existence of pending
147   U.S. or foreign patent applications relating to this ITL draft publication and of any
148   relevant unexpired U.S. or foreign patents.
149   ITL may require from the patent holder, or a party authorized to make assurances on its
150   behalf, in written or electronic form, either:
151      a) assurance in the form of a general disclaimer to the effect that such party does not
152         hold and does not currently intend holding any essential patent claim(s); or
153     b) assurance that a license to such essential patent claim(s) will be made available
154        to applicants desiring to utilize the license for the purpose of complying with the
155        guidance or requirements in this ITL draft publication either:
156            i. under reasonable terms and conditions that are demonstrably free of any unfair
157               discrimination; or
158           ii. without compensation and under reasonable terms and conditions that are
159               demonstrably free of any unfair discrimination.
160   Such assurance shall indicate that the patent holder (or third party authorized to make
161   assurances on its behalf) will include in any documents transferring ownership of patents
162   subject to the assurance, provisions sufficient to ensure that the commitments in the
163   assurance are binding on the transferee, and that the transferee will similarly include
164   appropriate provisions in the event of future transfers with the goal of binding each
165   successor-in-interest.
166   The assurance shall also indicate that it is intended to be binding on successors-in-interest
167   regardless of whether such provisions are included in the relevant transfer documents.
168   Such statements should be addressed to: mailto:piv comments@nist.gov.
