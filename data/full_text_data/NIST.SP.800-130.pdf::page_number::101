   composed, and the criteria for the evaluation of protection profiles and security
   targets.

8. [KERBEROS]
   Various Kerberos RFCs under http://www.ietf.org/dyn/wg/charter/krb-wg-
   charter.html.
   These KERBEROS RFCs describe how KERBEROS authentication, encryption, and
   ticket-granting security services are provided. The RFCs cover the format of the
   security services payload, cipher suites for the security services, and authentication
   using passwords or X.509 certificates.

9. [RFC 6960]
   Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP), http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6960.txt.
   RFC 6960 specifies a protocol that may be used for determining the current status of
   a public key certificate.

10. [RFC 3161]
    Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Time-Stamp Protocol (TSP),
    http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3161.txt.
    RFC 3161 specifies a protocol to request and receive a trusted time stamp from a
    trusted third-party. The document specifies the digital signature-based structure of the
    time stamp token, which can be used to provide the time associated with the existence
    of a datum.

11. [RFC 3279]
    Algorithms and Identifiers for the Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure
    Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile,
    http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3279.txt.
    RFC 3279 specifies OIDs and the structure for storing subject public key information
    for the RSA, DSA, DH and EC algorithms. The RFC also defines object identifiers
    and signature structures for hashing and signing algorithms. RFC 3279 is augmented
    by RFC 4055 and RFC 5480 to accommodate additional signature algorithms and
    schemes.

12. [RFC 3647]
    Public Key Infrastructure Certificate Policy and Certificate Practices Framework,
    http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3647.txt.
    RFC 3647 presents a comprehensive list of topics that potentially need to be
    addressed in a certificate policy or a certification practice statement.

13. [RFC 4055]
    Additional Algorithms and Identifiers for RSA Cryptography for use in the Internet
    X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL)
    Profile, http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4055.txt.
