SP 800-130                                                             August 2013




Penetration testing is a specific type of security testing in which a team of penetration-
testing experts develops penetration scenarios for the system as a whole and then
evaluates the risk of a successful penetration. Note that individual product/device
penetration testing may be conducted as part of the CKMS security assessment (see
Section 11). The scope of penetration testing should include personnel, facilities, and
procedures. The penetration team attempts to bypass the security safeguards with the goal
of defeating CKMS security. Any findings made by the penetration testing team should
be addressed before initial deployment.

FR:9.7 The CKMS design shall specify the functional and security testing that was
performed on the system and the results of the tests.

9.7 Environmental Testing
CKMS designs often assume a particular environment (e.g., temperature range and
voltage range) for their devices or systems. The CKMS devices or systems are then built
for that environment and tested within that environment. If the device or system is used in
a different environment, secure operation could be lost. Military systems are often
ruggedized to handle the extreme conditions under which they may be used. This extra
protection frequently comes at an additional cost.

FR:9.8 The CKMS design shall specify the environmental conditions in which the
CKMS is designed to be used.

FR:9.9 The CKMS design shall specify the results of environmental testing that was
performed on the CKMS devices, including the results of all tests stressing the devices
beyond the conditions for which they were designed.

9.8 Development, Delivery, and Maintenance Assurances
The secure development, delivery, and maintenance of CKMS products can play a
significant role in the security of the CKMS. The following areas should be considered:
    a) Configuration Management,
    b) Secure Delivery,
    c) Development and Maintenance Environmental Security, and
    d) Flaw Remediation.

Each of these areas is described in the following subsections.

9.8.1 Configuration Management
A CKMS should incorporate products that are developed and maintained under an
appropriate configuration management system in order to ensure that security is not
reduced and functional flaws are not introduced due to unauthorized or unintentional
changes to the products.
