880   5.1.3.2. Out-of-Band Veriﬁers
881   For additional verification requirements specific to the PSTN, see Sec. 5.1.3.3.
882   When the out-of-band authenticator is a secure application, such as on a smart phone,
883   the verifier MAY send a push notification to that device. The verifier waits for the
884   establishment of an authenticated protected channel with the out-of-band authenticator
885   and verifies its identifying key. The verifier SHALL NOT store the identifying key
886   itself, but SHALL use a verification method (e.g., an approved hash function or proof
887   of possession of the identifying key) to uniquely identify the authenticator. Once
888   authenticated, the verifier transmits the authentication secret to the authenticator.
889   Depending on the type of out-of-band authenticator, one of the following SHALL take
890   place:
891       • Transfer of secret from the secondary to the primary channel: The verifier MAY
892         signal the device containing the subscriber’s authenticator to indicate readiness
893         to authenticate. It SHALL then transmit a random secret to the out-of-band
894         authenticator. The verifier SHALL then wait for the secret to be returned on the
895         primary communication channel.
896       • Transfer of secret from the primary to the secondary channel: The verifier SHALL
897         display a random authentication secret to the claimant via the primary channel. It
898          SHALL then wait for the secret to be returned on the secondary channel from the
899         claimant’s out-of-band authenticator.
900   In all cases, the authentication SHALL be considered invalid if not completed within 10
901   minutes. In order to provide replay resistance as described in Sec. 5.2.8, verifiers SHALL
902   accept a given authentication secret only once during the validity period.
903   The verifier SHALL generate random authentication secrets with at least 20 bits of
904   entropy using an approved random bit generator [SP800-90Ar1]. If the authentication
905   secret has less than 64 bits of entropy, the verifier SHALL implement a rate-limiting
906   mechanism that effectively limits the number of failed authentication attempts that can be
907   made on the subscriber account as described in Sec. 5.2.2.
908   Out-of-band verifiers SHALL consider all authentication operations to be single-factor
909   unless the CSP has confirmed that the out-of-band authentication meets the requirements
910   of Sec. 5.1.3.4. This requirement MAY be satisfied by issuance of the authenticator by
911   the CSP or a trusted third party or by use of an authentication application known by the
912   CSP to meet these requirements.
913   Out-of-band verifiers that send a push notification to a subscriber device SHOULD
914   implement a reasonable limit on the rate or total number of push notifications that will be
915   sent since the last successful authentication.
