3.           Fingerprint enrollment

3.1          Scope
The specifications in this Section pertain to the production of the mandatory PIV biometric enrollment data. That is,
this Section provides specifications for acquisition, formatting, and storage of fingerprint images and templates. The
following is an overview of the material covered in this Section.
        ―     Sub-Section 3.2.1 gives specifications capture of fingerprints for PIV Registration and background checks;
        ―     Sub-Section 3.2.2 recommends training of enrollment station operators;
        ―     Sub-Section 3.2.3 recommends use of automated means to track fingerprint image quality over time;
        ―     Sub-Section 3.3 gives specifications for how fingerprint images are retained by agencies. [FIPS] gives
              requirements and options for the retention of biometric data. Retention of data supports, for example,
              detection of duplicate identities. When fingerprint images are retained they shall be stored in the format
              specified in sub-Section 3.3. The format specification includes the [CBEFF] header of Section 9 to implement
              the requirement to protect the integrity, and to allow for encryption, of the image records.
        ―     Sub-Section 3.4 specifies the transformation of fingerprints into records suitable for transmission to the FBI
              for the background check.
Although FBI requirements drive the sensor specifications, the permanent electronic storage format specified in sub-
Section 3.3 is an INCITS standard record and is therefore specified independently.
If an agency retains fingerprint templates, in either proprietary or standardized formats, then they shall be embedded
in the [CBEFF] header of Section 9 which requires integrity protection and allows for encryption of the records.

3.2          Fingerprint image acquisition
3.2.1             Fingerprint collection
This Section specifies the capture of a full set of fingerprint images for PIV registration. A subject's fingerprints shall
be collected according to one of the three imaging modes enumerated in Table 2.

                                                  Table 2 − Fingerprint acquisition protocols
              #    Option 1 – Required presentations for plain live scan
              1    Combined plain impression of the four fingers on the right hand (no thumb)
              2    Combined plain impression of the four fingers on the left hand (no thumb)
              3    Combined impression of the two thumbs
                   Option 2 – Required presentations for rolled live scan
              1    10 separately rolled fingers
              2    Combined plain impression of the four fingers on the right hand (no thumb)
              3    Combined plain impression of the four fingers on the left hand (no thumb)
              4    Left thumb plain impression                     These captures may be simultaneous (two thumbs next to
              5    Right thumb plain impression                    each other) or sequential (one thumb at a time)
                   Option 3 – Required presentations for rolled ink on card
              1    10 separately rolled fingers
              2    Combined plain impression of the four fingers on the right hand (no thumb)
              3    Combined plain impression of the four fingers on the left hand (no thumb)
              4    Left thumb plain impression                       These captures may be simultaneous (two thumbs next to
              5    Right thumb plain impression                      each other) or sequential (one thumb at a time)

INFORMATIVE NOTES:
        1.    There is no requirement that the order specified above is the order in which the images should be acquired.
        2.    The combined multi-finger plain-impression images are also referred to as slaps or flats. They are obtained by
              simultaneous placement of multiple fingers on the imaging surface without specific rolling movement.
