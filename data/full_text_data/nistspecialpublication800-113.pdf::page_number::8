Executive Summary

Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) virtual private networks (VPN) provide secure remote access to an
organization’s resources. A VPN is a virtual network, built on top of existing physical networks, that can
provide a secure communications mechanism for data and other information transmitted between two
endpoints. Because a VPN can be used over existing networks such as the Internet, it can facilitate the
secure transfer of sensitive data across public networks. An SSL VPN consists of one or more VPN
devices to which users connect using their Web browsers. The traffic between the Web browser and the
SSL VPN device is encrypted with the SSL protocol or its successor, the Transport Layer Security (TLS)
protocol. This type of VPN may be referred to as either an SSL VPN or a TLS VPN. This guide uses the
term SSL VPN. SSL VPNs provide remote users with access to Web applications and client/server
applications, and connectivity to internal networks. Despite the popularity of SSL VPNs, they are not
intended to replace Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) VPNs. 1 The two VPN technologies are
complementary and address separate network architectures and business needs. SSL VPNs offer
versatility and ease of use because they use the SSL protocol, which is included with all standard Web
browsers, so the client usually does not require configuration by the user. SSL VPNs offer granular
control for a range of users on a variety of computers, accessing resources from many locations. There
are two primary types of SSL VPNs:

 SSL Portal VPNs. This type of SSL VPN allows a user to use a single standard SSL connection to a
  Web site to securely access multiple network services. The site accessed is typically called a portal
  because it is a single page that leads to many other resources. The remote user accesses the SSL VPN
  gateway using any modern Web browser, identifies himself or herself to the gateway using an
  authentication method supported by the gateway, and is then presented with a Web page that acts as
  the portal to the other services.
 SSL Tunnel VPNs. This type of SSL VPN allows a user to use a typical Web browser to securely
  access multiple network services, including applications and protocols that are not web-based,
  through a tunnel that is running under SSL. SSL tunnel VPNs require that the Web browser be able
  to handle active content, which allows them to provide functionality that is not accessible to SSL
  portal VPNs. Examples of active content include Java, JavaScript, Active X, or Flash applications or
  plug-ins.
This publication discusses the fundamental technologies and features of SSL VPNs. It describes SSL and
how it fits within the context of layered network security. It presents a phased approach to SSL VPN
planning and implementation that can help in achieving successful SSL VPN deployments. It also
compares the SSL VPN technology with IPsec VPNs and other VPN solutions. This information is
particularly valuable for helping organizations to determine how best to deploy SSL VPNs within their
specific network environments.

Implementing the following recommendations should assist in facilitating more efficient and effective
SSL VPN use for Federal departments and agencies.

Federal agencies deploying SSL VPNs must configure them to only allow FIPS-compliant
cryptographic algorithms, cipher suites, and versions of SSL.

Some organizations, such as Federal agencies, have strict requirements for encryption and integrity
protection. SSL VPNs should support the required algorithms for symmetric encryption, key exchange,
and hash functions. For government agencies, traffic that requires protection must employ Federal
