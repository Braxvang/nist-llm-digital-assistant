GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



failure. Organizations should also examine each of the “should consider” practices to determine their
applicability to the target environment. A “should consider” practice should be rejected only if it is
infeasible or if the reduction in risk from its implementation does not justify its cost.

Organizations should develop their RFID security controls based not only on the practices in the tables,
but also using other guidelines on security controls. FIPS Publication 199, Standards for Security
Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems, establishes three security categories—
low, moderate, and high—based on the potential impact of a security breach involving a particular
system. NIST Special Publication 800-53 (as amended), Recommended Security Controls for Federal
Information Systems, provides minimum management, operational, and technical security controls for
information systems based on the FIPS Publication 199 impact categories. The information in NIST
Special Publication 800-53 should be helpful to organizations in identifying controls that are needed to
protect networks and systems, which should be used in addition to the specific practices for RFID systems
listed in this document. Federal agencies should also use NIST Special Publication 800-37, Guide for the
Security Certification and Accreditation of Federal Information Systems, to evaluate their RFID system
and select appropriate security controls.

The RFID policies that an organization develops should be consistent with existing IT and operations
policies. However, in some cases, the organization may need to modify the existing policies to
accommodate the introduction of an RFID system.

Some large organizations may divide RFID-related duties among various teams. For example, one group
may be responsible for the RF subsystem, while another might focus on the enterprise subsystem. To
assist with this division of labor, the tables in this section identify the affected subsystem or components
(e.g., tag or reader) for each of the listed practices.

The tables can also serve as checklists. In particular, the status column on the right is blank so that RFID
support staff or auditors can use it to measure progress toward implementation of the practices.
