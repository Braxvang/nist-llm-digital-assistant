      NIST SP 800-73pt2-5 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                            Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification: Part 2
      September 2023                                                               PIV Card Application Card Command Interface



401          PIV Card Application Card Command Interface
402   Table 2 lists the card commands surfaced by the PIV Card Application at the card edge of the
403   ICC when it is the currently selected card application. All PIV Card Application card commands
404   SHALL be supported by a PIV Card Application. Card commands indicated by a “Yes” in the
405   Command Chaining column SHALL support command chaining for transmitting a data string
406   that is too long for a single command, as defined in [ISO7816].

408   The PIV Card Application shall return the status word of '6A 81' (Function not supported) when
409   it receives a card command on the contactless interface marked “No” in the Contactless Interface
410   column in Table 2. The PIV Card Application may return a different status word (e.g., '69 82') if
411   the card command can be performed over the contactless interface in support of card
412   management. The PIV Card Application will only perform the command in support of card
413   management if the requirements specified in Section 2.9.2 of FIPS 201-2 are satisfied.
414   Note 1: For SM, OCC and pairing code alone CAN be submitted via secure messaging (SM)
415   over the contactless interface. All other key references require VCI for communication over the
416   contactless interface.
417               Note 2: Cryptographic protocols using private/secret keys that require the “PIN” or
418               “OCC” security condition SHALL only be used on the contactless interface after a virtual

          The VERIFY command is only required to support command chaining if the PIV Card Application supports OCC.
      3
          The CHANGE REFERENCE DATA command is only required to support command chaining if the PIV Card Application supports OCC.
