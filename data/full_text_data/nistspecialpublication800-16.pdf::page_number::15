Information Technology Security Training Requirements

1.1   Background

Federal agencies and organizations cannot protect the integrity, confidentiality, and availability
of information in today's highly networked systems environment without ensuring that each
person involved understands their roles and responsibilities and is adequately trained to perform
them. The human factor is so critical to success that the Computer Security Act of 1987 (Public
Law [P.L.] 100-235) required that, "Each agency shall provide for the mandatory periodic
training in computer security awareness and accepted computer practices of all employees who
are involved with the management, use, or operation of each Federal computer system within or
under the supervision of that agency."


In accordance with P.L. 100-235, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST),
working with the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), was charged with developing
and issuing guidelines for Federal computer security training. This requirement was satisfied by
NIST's issuance of ''Computer Security Training Guidelines" (Special Publication [SP] 500-
172) in November 1989. In January 1992, OPM issued a revision to the Federal personnel
regulations which made these voluntary guidelines mandatory. This regulation, 5 CFR Part 930,
is entitled ''Employees Responsible for theManagement or Use of Federal Computer Systems"
and requires Federal agencies to provide training as set forth in NIST guidelines.


The OPM regulation requires training: for current employees; new employees within 60 days of
hire; whenever there is a significant change in the agency's IT security environment or
procedures, or when an employee enters a new position which deals with sensitive information;
and periodically as refresher training, based on the sensitivity of the information the employee
handles. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A- 130, "Management of Federal
Information Resources," Appendix HI, "Security of Federal Automated Information Resources,"
re-emphasizes these mandatory training requirements. In addition, it requires that prior to being
granted access to IT applications and systems, all individuals must receive specialized training
focusing on their IT security responsibilities and established system rules.


The NIST guidelines in SP 500-172 provided a framework for determining the training needs of
particular categories of employees (including contractors) involved with sensitive but
unclassified computer systems. The framework reflected the late 1980's when the IT
environment was mainframe oriented. The focal point of SP 500-172 is its Training Matrix,
shown on the following page as Exhibit 1-1.
