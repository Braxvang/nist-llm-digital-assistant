NIST SP 800-219r1                                                      Automated Secure Configuration
July 2023                                                                   Guidance from the mSCP

macOS security. Additionally, vendors of device management, security, configuration
assessment, and compliance tools that support macOS may find this document and the GitHub
site to be helpful.

       Relevance to NIST SP 800-70 and the National Checklist Program
The security baselines from the mSCP GitHub page are included in the National Checklist
Program. NIST SP 800-70, Revision 4 [2], explains that federal agencies are required to use
appropriate security configuration checklists from the National Checklist Program when
available. Part 39 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations, Section 39.101 paragraph (c) states,
            In acquiring information technology, agencies shall include the
            appropriate information technology security policies and requirements,
            including use of common security configurations available from the
            National Institute of Standards and Technology’s website at
            https://checklists.nist.gov. Agency contracting officers should consult
            with the requiring official to ensure the appropriate standards are
            incorporated.
