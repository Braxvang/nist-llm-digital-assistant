D.21.1 Inspections and Auditing Information Type

Inspections and Auditing involves the methodical examination and review of regulated activities
to ensure compliance with standards for regulated activity. The recommended security
categorization for the inspections and auditing information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Moderate), (integrity, Moderate), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of inspections and
auditing information on the ability of responsible agencies to methodically examine and review
regulated activities to ensure compliance with standards for regulated activity. If the inspections
and auditing data belongs to one of the information types described in this guideline, the
confidentiality impact assigned the data and system is dependent on the nature of the regulated
activity.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized disclosure of
inspections and auditing information can alert personnel associated with programs being
monitored to the focus of inspection or auditing activities. With this information, program
personnel may divert attention from questionable program attributes or hide unfavorable
information. Where a major program or human safety is at stake, actions taken based on
unauthorized disclosure of inspections and auditing information can pose a threat to human life
or a loss of major assets. In such cases, the confidentiality impact is high.

National security information and national security systems are outside the scope of this
guideline.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: Although there are many Federal environments in
which unauthorized disclosure will have only a limited adverse effect, there are enough
circumstances in which serious adverse effects on agency operations, agency assets, or
individuals can result to justify recommendation of a moderate provisional confidentiality
impact level for inspections and auditing information.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of inspections and auditing
information can compromise the effectiveness of the program. The damage likely to be caused
by unauthorized modification or destruction may affect inspection or audit results with
subsequent serious adverse effects on agency operations or public confidence in the agency. The
consequences can be particularly serious if the destruction or modification of information
invalidates oversight of major programs or the information threatens human safety. The integrity
impact level depends on the laws or policies with which compliance is being determined and on
the criticality of the processes being monitored (e.g., correctness of contract expenditure
reporting versus safety regulations affecting manned space flight).
