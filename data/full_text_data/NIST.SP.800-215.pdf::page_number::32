   Secure Wide Area Network Infrastructure for an Enterprise Network
The wide area network (WAN) became an integral part of the enterprise network when
organizations needed to connect their local area networks (LANs) across multiple geographically
distributed locations (within the country and, in some cases, globally) starting in the 1980s. The
initial WAN technology involved point-to-point (P2P) leased lines followed by frame relay. The
first IP-based network was multiprotocol label switching (MPLS), which enabled multiple types
of traffic – such as voice, video, and data – to travel on the same line.
With the advent of technologies such as virtualization and increasing enterprise access to cloud
services, enterprises have begun to adopt a new WAN technology called the software-defined
wide area network (SD-WAN). SD-WAN technology removes the tight coupling between the
control plane and data plane functions of the network and enables the centralized specification of
various policies, such as access control, routing, and application traffic prioritization.
Another development integrates all of the point security solutions provided by various network
security appliances (Section 3) into a network security services infrastructure. Industry and
industry consortiums use the term secure access service edge (SASE) [35] to refer to a
comprehensive framework that offers wide area networking and various security services. SASE
can be looked upon as the networking counterpart of the application’s service mesh, which
provides a comprehensive set of application services, including security for cloud-native
applications.
Based on the above discussion, this section will focus on the following topics:
   •   Requirements for a secure SD-WAN
   •   Specific requirements for SD-WANs for cloud access
   •   Requirements for an integrated security services architecture for SD-WAN

       Common Requirements for a Secure SD-WAN
In addition to CSP-provided VPNs, a networking technology that provides network connectivity
for accessing cloud-based services for enterprises is software-defined wide area networking (SD-
WAN).
The design goals and common features in all SD-WAN offerings include:
   •   Extensive connectivity: To securely connect users located anywhere (e.g., home, public
       location, branch office, corporate office) to applications and resources hosted anywhere
       (e.g., data center, single or multiple cloud services) using any WAN transport (e.g.,
       MPLS, Broadband Internet, 4G/LTE, 5G wireless)
   •   Application awareness: To monitor the network traffic and dynamically choose the best
       path available based on (a) the type of network traffic, (b) network load conditions, and
       (c) the application’s business priority. This capability is enabled using techniques such as
       bandwidth utilization, load balancing, and the optimization of speed by reducing jitters,
       latency, and packet loss. Addressing an application’s business priority is only possible if
       the SD-WAN solution has the ability to identify different types of applications (e.g.,
       messaging/email application, social media application, general storage-related
