                                  Determine that:
                                     (i) Remote update for certificate re-key and
                                         modification of the LoA-4 Derived PIV Certificate
                                         meet all required security controls to be
                                         implemented by the issuer and the issuer
                                         information systems (review);.
                                    (ii) the initial issuance process is followed for a re-
                                         key of an expired or compromised Derived PIV
                                         credential or a re-key of a Derived PIV Credential
                                         at LOA-4 to a new hardware token.

                     MP(DC)-12 When password reset is performed in-person at the          DPCI - LOA    [SP 800-157], Section 3.4 –
                     (NEW)     issuer's facility, or at an unattended kiosk operated by   4 Only        Activation Data
                               the issuer, it is implemented through one of the following
                               processes: (i) the Subscriber’s PIV Card is used to
                               authenticate the Subscriber (via PIV-AUTH mechanism
                               as per section 6.2.3.1 of [FIPS 201-2]) prior to password
                               reset, (ii) a 1:1 biometric match is performed against the
                               biometric sample retained during initial issuance of the
                               Derived PIV Credential, against the biometric on the
                               Chain-of-Trust or against the biometric on the PIV Card.

                                  Assessment
                                  Determine that:
                                    (i) the issuer’s performs a password reset using a
                                        conformant process (review, observe).

                     MP(DC)-13 For remote password reset for LOA 4 Derived PIV            DPCI – LOA    [SP 800-157], Section 3.4 –
                     (NEW)     Credentials, the subscriber’s PIV Card is used to          4 Only        Activation Data
                               authenticate the subscriber (via PIV-AUTH
                               authentication mechanism as per Section 6.2.3.1 of
                               [FIPS 201-2]) prior to password reset. If the reset occurs
                               over a session that is separate from the session over
                               which the PIV-AUTH authentication mechanism was
                               completed, strong linkage (e.g., using a temporary
                               authenticator) is established between the two sessions.
                               The remote password reset is completed over a
                               protected session (e.g., using TLS).

                                  Assessment
                                  Determine that:
                                    (i) remote password resets meet all security
                                        requirements to be implemented by the issuer
                                        and the issuer information systems (review,
                                        observe, test).

                     (NEW)     cases of expiration, loss, damage, or compromise, as                     Maintenance
                               well as issuance of a new hardware token is performed
                               in accordance with the initial issuance process.

                                  Assessment
                                  Determine that:
                                    (i) the issuer follows the initial issuance process
                                        while re-keying or re-issuing a Derived PIV
                                        Credential for cases of of expiration, loss,
                                        damage, or compromise Derived PIV Credential,
