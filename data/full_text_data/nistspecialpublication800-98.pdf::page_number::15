1.    Introduction

1.1   Authority

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed this document in furtherance of its
statutory responsibilities under the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002,
Public Law 107-347.

NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements, for
providing adequate information security for all agency operations and assets; but such standards and
guidelines shall not apply to national security systems. This guideline is consistent with the requirements
of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Section 8b(3), “Securing Agency
Information Systems,” as analyzed in A-130, Appendix IV: Analysis of Key Sections. Supplemental
information is provided in A-130, Appendix III.

These guidelines have been prepared for use by Federal agencies. They may be used by nongovernmental
organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright, though attribution is desired.

Nothing in this document should be taken to contradict standards and guidance made mandatory and
binding on Federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory authority, nor should these
guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the Secretary of Commerce,
Director of the OMB, or any other Federal official.

1.2   Purpose and Scope

This publication seeks to assist organizations in understanding the risks of RFID technology and security
measures to mitigate those risks. It provides practical, real-world advice on how to initiate, design,
implement and operate RFID systems in a manner that mitigates security and privacy risks. The
document also provides background information on RFID applications, standards, and system
components to assist in the understanding of RFID security risks and controls.

This document presents information that is independent of particular hardware platforms, operating
systems, and applications. The emphasis is on RFID systems that are based on industry and international
standards, although the existence of proprietary approaches is noted when they offer relevant security
features not found in current standards. Readers are encouraged to supplement this document with vendor
publications and other materials if interested in further pursuing proprietary approaches.

Section 6 provides a brief overview of privacy laws and regulations that pertain to Federal agencies.
Privacy concerns involve legal and policy issues that are addressed more thoroughly in the documents
referenced in that section. Security and privacy concerns are not entirely separable. For instance, security
mechanisms designed to protect data confidentiality also serve privacy interests. On the other hand,
approaches to privacy protection that involve the temporary or permanent disabling of RFID technology
may introduce a security vulnerability because of the potential for these mechanisms to be used in an
unauthorized or unanticipated fashion.

This publication primarily focuses on asset management, tracking, matching, process control, and supply-
chain RFID applications. RFID technology is also used in contactless smart cards that support personal
identification, access control, and automated payment applications. While this document provides
