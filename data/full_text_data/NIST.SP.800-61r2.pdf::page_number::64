                                                                  COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE



    2. How would the handling of this incident change if the team found that the database server had
       been running a packet sniffer and capturing passwords from the network?
    3. How would the handling of this incident change if the team found that the server was running a
       process that would copy a database containing sensitive customer information (including
       personally identifiable information) each night and transfer it to an external address?
    4. How would the handling of this incident change if the team discovered a rootkit on the server?

Scenario 5: Unknown Exfiltration
On a Sunday night, one of the organization’s network intrusion detection sensors alerts on anomalous
outbound network activity involving large file transfers. The intrusion analyst reviews the alerts; it
appears that thousands of .RAR files are being copied from an internal host to an external host, and the
external host is located in another country. The analyst contacts the incident response team so that it can
investigate the activity further. The team is unable to see what the .RAR files hold because their contents
are encrypted. Analysis of the internal host containing the .RAR files shows signs of a bot installation.
The following are additional questions for this scenario:
    1. How would the team determine what was most likely inside the .RAR files? Which other teams
       might assist the incident response team?
    2. If the incident response team determined that the initial compromise had been performed through
       a wireless network card in the internal host, how would the team further investigate this activity?
    3. If the incident response team determined that the internal host was being used to stage sensitive
       files from other hosts within the enterprise, how would the team further investigate this activity?

Scenario 6: Unauthorized Access to Payroll Records
On a Wednesday evening, the organization’s physical security team receives a call from a payroll
administrator who saw an unknown person leave her office, run down the hallway, and exit the building.
The administrator had left her workstation unlocked and unattended for only a few minutes. The payroll
program is still logged in and on the main menu, as it was when she left it, but the administrator notices
that the mouse appears to have been moved. The incident response team has been asked to acquire
evidence related to the incident and to determine what actions were performed.
The following are additional questions for this scenario:
    1. How would the team determine what actions had been performed?
    2. How would the handling of this incident differ if the payroll administrator had recognized the
       person leaving her office as a former payroll department employee?
    3. How would the handling of this incident differ if the team had reason to believe that the person
       was a current employee?
    4. How would the handling of this incident differ if the physical security team determined that the
       person had used social engineering techniques to gain physical access to the building?
    5. How would the handling of this incident differ if logs from the previous week showed an
       unusually large number of failed remote login attempts using the payroll administrator’s user ID?
    6. How would the handling of this incident differ if the incident response team discovered that a
       keystroke logger was installed on the computer two weeks earlier?
