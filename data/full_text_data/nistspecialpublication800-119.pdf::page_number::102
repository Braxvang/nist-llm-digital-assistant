                                                                GUIDELINES FOR THE SECURE DEPLOYMENT OF IPV6


    4.8.4   Unknown Aspects

In spite of all that has been written about IPv6 renumbering, little practical experience exists, although
there are reports covering some controlled experiments. Guidelines, rough lists of steps, and some
warnings exist, but an agreed upon set of best practices has not yet emerged.

Three topics identified as needing more attention are:

    Detailed prefix renumbering procedures for specific products

    A stable method to apply renumbering to BGP without causing route flaps or outages

    Renumbering of DNS across administrative domains, and, in particular, management of the DNS
     reverse zone.
Two potential methods of simplifying renumbering are:

    Assigning well-known anycast addresses for routers and servers that provide important parts of the
     network infrastructure

    Deploying a split identifier-locator technology like SHIM6, in which case renumbering only involves
     the locator part of the address.
