                                               TECHNICAL GUIDE TO INFORMATION SECURITY TESTING AND ASSESSMENT



7.      Security Assessment Execution

During execution of the security assessment, vulnerabilities are identified by the methods and techniques
decided upon in the planning phase and identified in the assessment plan or ROE. It is critical that the
assessment be conducted in accordance with the plan or ROE—and the purpose of this section is to
highlight key points for assessors to consider throughout the execution phase. For example, proper
coordination throughout the assessment facilitates the assessment process and reduces the possibility of
associated risks. Key considerations such as incident handling and the challenges organizations face
when conducting assessments are also highlighted. This section also discusses the analysis process, and
provides recommendations for the collection, storage, transmission, and destruction of assessment-related
data.

7.1     Coordination

Throughout an assessment, it is critical for assessors to coordinate with various entities in the
organization. Coordination requirements are determined by the assessment plan or ROE and should be
followed accordingly. Proper coordination helps to ensure that:

       Stakeholders are aware of the assessment schedule, activities, and potential impacts the
        assessment may have
       The assessment does not take place during upgrades, new technology integration, or other times
        when the system security is being altered (e.g., testing occurs during maintenance windows or
        periods of low utilization)
       Assessors are provided with required levels of access to the facility and systems, as appropriate
       Appropriate personnel such as the CIO, CISO, and ISSO are informed of any critical high-impact
        vulnerabilities as soon as they are discovered
       Appropriate individuals are informed (e.g., assessors, incident response team, senior
        management) in the event of an incident. Should this occur, it is recommended that activities
        cease until the incident is addressed and the assessors are given approval to resume their activities
        in accordance with the assessment plan or ROE. The extent to which assessment activities should
        be suspended varies based on the organization and the type of incident, but in many cases the
        only activities suspended are those involving the systems directly involved in the incident.
The level of coordination between assessors and the organization are driven primarily by the system and
the assessment being conducted. Critical systems generally require more coordination to ensure system
availability throughout the engagement, and assessment techniques pose varying levels of risk to the
target system during execution. Techniques that fall in the review category have minimal risk; target
identification and analysis category have moderate risk; and a high risk is associated with the target
vulnerability validation category. For instance, a critical system undergoing penetration testing generally
requires more coordination than would a document review of a critical system or a penetration test of a
noncritical system. However, organizations may encounter circumstances where the reverse is true, and
in such cases the level of coordination should be commensurate with requirements and organizational
considerations. Assessors and other stakeholders—such as system owners—should remain vigilant
during the execution of assessments. The level of access required by assessors will also drive
coordination to ensure they have appropriate physical and system access (e.g., when testing the insider
threat).
