       NIST SP 800-90C 3pd (Third Public Draft)                                                          Recommendation for RBG Constructions
       September 2022

1582           4. The DRBG shall be instantiated at a security strength of 256 bits before the first use of the
1583              RBG3 construction or direct access of the DRBG.
1584           5. The DRBG shall include a reseed function to support reseed requests.
1585           6. A specific entropy-source output (or portion thereof) shall not be reused (e.g., the same
1586              entropy-source outputs shall not be used for an RBG3 request and a request to a separate
1587              instantiation of a DRBG).
1588           7. If the DRBG is directly accessible, the requirements in Section 5.3 for RBG2(P)
1589              constructions shall apply to the direct access of the DRBG.
1590           8. When health tests detect the failure of a validated physical entropy source, the failure shall
1591              be handled as discussed in Section 7.1.2.1. If a failure is detected in a non-physical entropy
1592              source, the consuming application shall be notified.

1593                RBG3(XOR) Construction
1594   An RBG3(XOR) construction contains one or more validated entropy sources and a DRBG whose
1595   outputs are XORed to produce full-entropy output (see Figure 17). In order to provide the required
1596   full-entropy output, the input to the XOR (shown as “⊕” in the figure) from the entropy-source
1597   side of the figure shall consist of bits with full entropy (see Section 2.1). 29 If the entropy sources
1598   cannot provide full-entropy output, then an external conditioning function shall be used to
1599   condition the output of the entropy sources to a full-entropy bitstring before XORing with the
1600   output of the DRBG (see Section 3.3).




       29
            Note that the DRBGs themselves are not designed to inherently provide full-entropy output.
