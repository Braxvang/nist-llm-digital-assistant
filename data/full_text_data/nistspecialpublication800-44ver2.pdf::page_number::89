                                                                  GUIDELINES ON SECURING PUBLIC WEB SERVERS



A two-firewall DMZ configuration improves protection over a router-firewall DMZ because the dedicated
firewalls can have more complex and powerful security rule sets. In addition, because a dedicated
firewall is often able to analyze incoming and outgoing HTTP traffic, it can detect and defend against
application layer attacks aimed at the Web server. Depending on the rule sets of the firewalls and the
level of traffic the DMZ receives, this type of DMZ may result in some performance degradation.

For organizations that desire the security of the two-firewall DMZ but do not have the resources to
purchase two firewalls, another option exists called the “service leg” DMZ. In this configuration, a
firewall is constructed with three (or more) network interfaces. One network interface attaches to the
border router, another interface attaches to the internal network, and a third network interface connects to
the DMZ (see Figure 8-3).




                                        Figure 8-3. Service Leg DMZ

This configuration subjects the firewall to an increased risk of service degradation during a DoS attack
aimed at the DMZ. In the standard single-firewall DMZ network configuration discussed above, a DoS
attack against the Web server generally affects only the Web server. In a service-leg DMZ network
configuration, the firewall bears the brunt of any DoS attack because it must examine any network traffic
before the traffic reaches the Web server (or any other DMZ or internal network resource) [NIST02a].
However, it is increasingly likely that a DoS attack will take the form of a DDoS attack and consume all
of the incoming network bandwidth and related devices (e.g., Internet border routers) before ever
reaching a DMZ firewall.

The advantages of a DMZ from a security standpoint are as follows:

 The Web server may be better protected, and network traffic to and from the Web server can be
  monitored.

 Compromise of the Web server does not directly threaten the internal production network.

 Greater control can be provided over the security of the Web server because traffic to and from the
  Web server can be controlled.

 The DMZ network configuration can be optimized to support and protect the Web servers.
