      NIST SP 800-63-4 ipd                                               Digital Identity Guidelines

819   in determining the overall security of the system. Well-designed protocols can protect the
820   integrity and confidentiality of communication between the claimant and the verifier both
821   during and after the authentication, and can help limit the damage that can be done by an
822   attacker masquerading as a legitimate verifier.
823   Additionally, mechanisms located at the verifier can mitigate online guessing attacks
824   against lower entropy secrets — like passwords and PINs — by limiting the rate at which
825   an attacker can make authentication attempts, or otherwise delaying incorrect attempts.
826   Generally, this is done by keeping track of and limiting the number of unsuccessful
827   attempts, since the premise of an online guessing attack is that most attempts will fail.

828   4.4. Federation and Assertions
829   Normative requirements can be found in [SP800-63C], Federation and Assertions.
830   In general usage, the term federation can be applied to a number of different approaches
831   involving the sharing of information between different trust domains. These approaches
832   differ based on the kind of information that is being shared between the domains. Some
833   common examples include:
834       • sharing identifiers (e.g., using a driver’s license number or an email address),
835       • sharing authenticators (e.g., using a PKI authenticator for multiple applications),
836       • sharing identity assertions (e.g., a federation protocol like OpenID Connect or
837         SAML),
838       • sharing account attributes (e.g., a provisioning protocol like SCIM), and
839       • sharing authorization decisions (e.g., a policy protocol like XACML).
840   The SP 800-63 guidelines are agnostic to the identity proofing, authentication, and
841   federation architectures an organization selects and they allow organizations to deploy a
842   digital identity scheme according to their own requirements. However, there are scenarios
843   that an organization may encounter that make federation potentially more efficient
844   and effective than establishing identity services local to the organization or individual
845   applications. The following lists detail scenarios where the organization may consider
846   federation a viable option. These lists are provided for consideration and are not intended
847   to be comprehensive.
848   An organization should consider accepting federated identity assertions if any of the
849   following apply:
850      1. Potential users already have an authenticator at or above the required AAL.
851      2. Multiple types of authenticators are required to cover all possible user communities.
852      3. An organization does not have the necessary infrastructure to support management
853         of subscriber accounts (e.g., account recovery, authenticator issuance, help desk).
