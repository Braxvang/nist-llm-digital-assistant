                                                                  GUIDELINES ON SECURING PUBLIC WEB SERVERS



Pharming—Using technical means to redirect users into accessing a fake Web site masquerading as a
legitimate one and divulging personal information.

Phishing—Using social engineering techniques to trick users into accessing a fake Web site and
divulging personal information.

Proxy—A proxy is an application that “breaks” the connection between client and server. The proxy
accepts certain types of traffic entering or leaving a network, processes it, and forwards it. This
effectively closes the straight path between the internal and external networks, making it more difficult
for an attacker to obtain internal addresses and other details of the organization’s internal network. Proxy
servers are available for common Internet services; for example, a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
proxy used for Web access and a Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) proxy used for e-mail.

Service Pack—Microsoft’s term for a collection of patches integrated into a single large update.

SOCKS Protocol—An Internet protocol to allow client applications to form a circuit-level gateway to a
network firewall via a proxy service.

System Administrator—A person who manages a computer system, including its operating system and
applications. A system administrator’s responsibilities are similar to that of a network administrator.

Virtualization—The use of an abstraction layer to simulate computing hardware so that multiple
operating systems can run on a single computer.

Vulnerability—A security exposure in an operating system or other system software or application
software component. A variety of organizations maintain publicly accessible databases of vulnerabilities
based on the version numbers of software. Each vulnerability can potentially compromise the system or
network if exploited.

Web Server—A computer that provides World Wide Web (WWW) services on the Internet. It includes
the hardware, operating system, Web server software, and Web site content (Web pages). If the Web
server is used internally and not by the public, it may be known as an “intranet server.”

Web Server Administrator—The Web server equivalent of a system administrator. Web server
administrators are system architects responsible for the overall design, implementation, and maintenance
of Web servers. They may or may not be responsible for Web content, which is traditionally the
responsibility of the Webmaster.

Webmaster—A person responsible for the implementation of a Web site. Webmasters must be
proficient in HTML and one or more scripting and interface languages, such as JavaScript and Perl. They
may or may not be responsible for the underlying server, which is traditionally the responsibility of the
Web administrator (see above).
