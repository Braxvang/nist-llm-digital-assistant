      NIST SP 800-92r1 ipd                                                       Cybersecurity Log Management
      October 2023                                                                              Planning Guide

294      INV, Update Logging-Related Inventories
295   [Tasks]                                                                                    [Next Play]
296   Summary: Characterize the current state of your organization’s cybersecurity logging through a
297   set of inventories. This is not an assessment, only information gathering. The desired outcome is
298   a reasonably comprehensive, up-to-date snapshot of the people, processes, and technologies that
299   are involved with cybersecurity logging.
300   Tasks to perform include the following (not necessarily in order):
301      1. INV-1, Update the Inventory of Log Source Types
302      2. INV-2, Update the Logging Infrastructure Inventory
303      3. INV-3, Update the Logging Use Case Inventory
304      4. INV-4, Update the Requirements Inventory
305      5. INV-5, Update the Work Role Inventory
306   Supporting information for tasks: There are interdependencies between these tasks, so changes
307   to one inventory may necessitate changes to other inventories.

308             INV-1, Update the Inventory of Log Source Types
309   [Tasks] [Examples]                                                         [Previous Play] [Next Play]
310   Summary: Update the inventory of your organization’s types of log sources. A log source is a
311   computing asset (e.g., operating system, application, cloud-based service, container) that is
312   capable of generating cybersecurity log entries. The desired outcome is a reasonably
313   comprehensive, up-to-date picture of all of the types of cybersecurity log data currently available
314   to your organization.
315   Tasks to perform include the following (not necessarily in order):
316      1. INV-1.1: Determine which characteristics to record in the inventory for each log source
317         type. Basic configuration information is generally the minimum to collect. Examples of
318         additional details include copies of logging procedures and other documentation and the
319         identities of each log source within each log source type (essentially, a log source
320         inventory).
321      2. INV-1.2: Update the inventory to reflect standard configurations for logging and which
322         types of assets use each standard configuration.
323      3. INV-1.3: Update the inventory to reflect exceptions to standard configurations for
324         logging, the nature of each exception, and which types of assets employ each exception.
325      4. INV-1.4: Update the inventory to reflect all other types of assets not included in #2 or #3
326         with representative samples of their logging configurations.
327   Examples of log source types include:
328      •      Networks, including network infrastructure devices and the traffic they carry
329      •      Software (e.g., firmware, operating systems, and applications)
