method shall not be used as a stand-alone authentication method because the method
does not prove the identity of the client.

10.3 Procurement Guidance
The following recommendation is for any individual that makes a purchasing decision for
acquiring SSH client and server implementations.
   1. Ensure that client and server implementations support at least one of these NIST-
      approved encryption algorithms: AES-128-CBC, AES-192-CBC and AES-256-
      CBC, in addition to 3DES-CBC, which is already mandatory to implement for the
      protocol. Implementations that support all of these encryption algorithms should
      be selected.
   2. When AEAD_AES_128_GCM or AEAD_AES_256_GCM is used in a
      negotiating encryption-algorithm list, it must also be in the corresponding MAC-
      algorithm list. Ensure that an implementation either enforces this automatically or
      provides it as a configurable option.
   3. Implementations should be chosen that support Suite B cryptographic algorithms
      as described in Section 10.2.1.1 above.
   4. Ensure that client and server implementations support public-key authentication
      using public-key certificates.
   5. Ensure that client and server implementations allow a protocol to be discontinued
      when the verification of the public-key-certificate fails.
   6. Ensure that client implementations allow preference setting for implemented
      cryptographic algorithms.
   7. Ensure that server implementations allow the configuration of the cryptographic
      algorithms to be used.
   8. Ensure that server implementations are able to disallow the password-
      authentication method when encryption is not used in the client-to-server traffic
      direction.
   9. Ensure that server implementations are able to disallow the “host-based
      authentication method”.

10.4 Recommendations for System Installers
The system installer is the individual(s) that installs the SSH server and client
applications and performs the initial configuration of the system. The system installer
shall:
   1. Install and/or configure the server and client to use only approved cryptographic
      algorithms.
   2. Set the connection to fail when a public-key certificate is not verified at both
      sides: server and client.
   3. Configure preferences in negotiating cryptographic-algorithm lists according to
      the organization’s security guidelines for the client. For example, if the
