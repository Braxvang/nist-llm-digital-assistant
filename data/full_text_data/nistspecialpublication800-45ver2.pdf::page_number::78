GUIDELINES ON ELECTRONIC MAIL SECURITY



day attacks because it is unlikely that an appropriate signature is available. A host-based IDPS may have
a better chance of detecting a zero-day attack since it is better able to detect the actions taken by an
attacker after a successful exploit (e.g., new unauthorized privileged accounts, installation of malicious
software).

File integrity checkers are a simple form of host-based IDPS. A file integrity checker computes and
stores a hash for every guarded file and establishes a database of file hashes. It provides a tool for system
administrators to recognize changes to files, particularly unauthorized changes. File integrity checkers
are available both as standalone products and bundled with other host-based IDPS techniques. Some
host-based IDPSs can monitor file access attempts and stop suspicious attempts to read, modify, delete,
and execute files. A host-based IDPS with this capability could be configured to protect important mail
server files.

To successfully protect a mail server using an IDPS, ensure that the IDPS is capable of and configured to:

 Monitor network traffic to and from the mail server
 Monitor changes to critical files on the mail server (file integrity checking capability) 45
 Monitor the system resources available on the mail server host (host-based)
 Block (in conjunction with the firewall) IP addresses or subnets that are attacking the organizational
  network
 Notify the necessary parties (e.g., IDPS administrator, mail server administrator, incident response
  team) of suspected attacks through appropriate means according to the organizational incident
  response policy and procedures
 Detect as wide a variety of scanning and attacks as possible with an acceptable level of false positives
 Log events, including the following details:

     –    Time/date

     –    Sensor IP address

     –    Manufacturer-specific attack name

     –    Standard attack name (if one exists)

     –    Source and destination IP addresses

     –    Source and destination port numbers

     –    Network protocol.
 For network events, packet header information should be captured to assist with the analysis and
  forensics process
 Update with new attack signatures frequently (e.g., on a daily to weekly basis, typically after testing
  the updates).

     Certain critical files, such as files storing user passwords and log files, will change regularly and thus should not be
     protected by a file integrity checker. This will vary depending on the mail server and operating system employed.
