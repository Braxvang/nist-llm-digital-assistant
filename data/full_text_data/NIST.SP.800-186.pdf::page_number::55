NIST SP 800-186                                               Discrete Logarithm-based Cryptography:
February 2023                                                       Elliptic Curve Domain Parameters

   3. Otherwise, output ACCEPT.

D.1.3.2.          Full Public Key Validation
Inputs:
   1. Edwards curve Ea,d defined over the prime field GF(p)
   2. Point Q

Output: ACCEPT or REJECT Q as a point on Ea,d of order n.

Process:

   1. Perform partial public key validation on Q using the procedure of Appendix D.1.3.1.
      Output REJECT if this procedure outputs REJECT.
   2. If Q = (0,1), output REJECT.
   3. Verify that n Q = (0,1). Output REJECT if verification fails.
   4. Otherwise, output ACCEPT.

D.1.4. Binary Curves in Short-Weierstrass Form

D.1.4.1.          Partial Public Key Validation
Inputs:
   1. Weierstrass curve Ba,b defined over the binary field GF(2m)
   2. Point Q

Output: ACCEPT or REJECT Q as an affine point on Ba,b.

Process:

   1. If Q is the point at infinity âˆ…, output REJECT.
   2. Let Q = (x, y). Verify that both x and y are binary polynomials in GF(2m) according to the
      field representation indicated by the parameter FR. Output REJECT if verification fails.
   3. Verify that (x, y) is a point on the Ba,b by checking that (x, y) satisfies the defining
      equation y2 + x y = x3 + a x2 + b, where computations are carried out in GF(2m) according
      to the field representation indicated by the parameter FR. Output REJECT if verification
      fails.
   4. Otherwise, output ACCEPT.

D.1.4.2.          Full Public Key Validation
Inputs:
   1. Weierstrass curve Ba,b defined over the binary field GF(2m)
   2. Point Q
