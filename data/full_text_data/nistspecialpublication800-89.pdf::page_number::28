6.4 Assurance of Possession for Signatures of Generic Messages
During normal operations, parties may need to determine a level of assurance of private
key possession by the (claimed) signatory at the (apparent) time of generation of the
signature of a generic message, i.e., a message that does not fulfill the requirements of an
assurance message (see Section 6.3.1.1).
In the following, the signature of a particular generic message will be referred to as the
signature-in-question. The signature-in-question may have been generated either before,
concurrently with, or after some assurance_time (tA) that was established when assurance
of possession by the (claimed) signatory was explicitly provided for the private key
corresponding to the public key used for verification of the signature-in-question. The
assurance_time and the initial assurance level associated with that provision of assurance
may be used to assess a level of assurance that the (claimed) signatory also possessed the
private key at the time that the signature-in-question was generated.
It is assumed that tA and the initial level of assurance have been established as specified
in either Section 6.3.1 or Section 6.3.2. Let the time that the signature-in-question was
generated be denoted as ts. This ts may have a known value6, may only be known to
belong to a certain interval of time7, or it may be completely unknown.
When ts is known with sufficient accuracy, the level of assurance of private key
possession by the (claimed) signatory at the time of generation of the signature-in-
question may be assigned as follows (in accordance with the assurance of possession
model described in Section 6.2, using values for a, b, c and d that are known and have
been agreed upon by the relying parties):
       •   If (tA – (a – d)) ≤ ts ≤ (tA + (b – d)), then the level of assurance associated with the
           signature-in-question is equal to the initial assurance level.
       •   The level of assurance gradually degrades from the initial level to LOW for
           (tA + (b – d)) ≤ ts ≤ (tA + (b – d) + c), and
       •   If ts > (tA + (b – d) + c), then the level of assurance associated with the signature-
           in-question is LOW.
In cases where the generation time for the signature-in-question is not known relative to
the assurance_time, the level of assurance is LOW (at best).

    For example, the time ts could be provided within the generic message as a transmission time, as is
    commonly done in email messages.
7
    For example, suppose that the generic message MR corresponding to the signature-in-question is a
    response to a previous message MP, and that message MR contains information provided in message MP
    that could not have been determined prior to receiving MP. It follows that ts occurred between the time MP
    was sent and the time MR was received (along with the signature-in-question).
