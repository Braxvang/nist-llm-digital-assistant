4.2.3    Hash Functions Used by SSL

SSL VPN devices that are to be used in FIPS-compliant applications must also use FIPS-compliant hash
functions. Plain SHA-1 can only be used until the end of 2010 in FIPS-compliant systems 13 . The keyed-
hash message authentication code (HMAC) form of SHA-1 is still considered secure, and can be used
after 2010. Since SSL VPN devices use HMAC-SHA-1, those suites that employ this hash function will
remain acceptable beyond 2010.

4.2.4    SSL Encryption

SSL VPN devices that are to be used in FIPS-compliant applications must use FIPS-compliant
encryption. Fortunately, virtually all SSL VPN devices can do this. Further, those systems must be able
to be configured to only use cipher suites with FIPS-compliant encryption; otherwise, a client that is
offering a cipher suite with non-compliant encryption might use the SSL negotiation to cause the SSL
VPN gateway to create an SSL session that is inappropriate for the security level of the organization.

Some SSL VPN devices can be configured to only allow certain cipher suites, or at least to only allow
cipher suites with certain types of encryption. Other SSL VPN devices do not allow such configuration.
NIST SP 800-52 lists the types of encryption that satisfied FIPS requirements when it was published
(June 2005); additional encryption algorithms meeting FIPS requirements may become available in the
future.

4.2.5    Certificates Used During SSL Negotiations

Finally, FIPS compliance for SSL VPNs requires the use of FIPS-compliant key sizes and hash functions
for signatures in the certificates used for authentication. Fortunately, virtually all SSL VPN devices are
able to do this today. Further, those systems must be able to be configured to only use FIPS-compliant
key sizes and hash functions in these certificates; otherwise, a client or server whose certificate uses a
non-compliant key size or hash function might use the SSL negotiation to cause the SSL VPN gateway to
create an SSL session that is inappropriate for the security level of the organization.

Note that the list of allowed hash functions will change at the end of 2010. After that time, server
certificates that use the SHA-1 hash function will no longer be allowed, and all FIPS-compliant SSL VPN
devices will need to use certificates that use the SHA-256 hash function. Some SSL VPN devices today
cannot use such certificates as the server authenticating certificate. Further, not all Web browsers today
support certificates that use the SHA-256 hash function for authentication.

SSL server authentication certificates can use either the RSA or DSS signature schemes, although many
SSL VPN systems and most Web browsers only support RSA. Note that if a server authenticates itself
with a Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) certificate, the key negotiation must use the ephemeral Diffie-
Hellman method. That method is not allowed to be used after the end of 2010, and therefore SSL VPN
systems that use DSA certificates cannot be used after the end of 2010 unless the special exception
allowing the use of ephemeral Diffie-Hellman for SSL key establishment is extended. For DSA, a FIPS
186-3 14 compliant digital signature is required for the larger key sizes.

At the current time, few (if any) SSL VPN gateways can be configured to reject certificates based on the
size of the key used and therefore most can be used in FIPS-noncompliant modes without any way to
prevent such use. Worse, few (if any) SSL VPN gateways even log the size of the key used in certificate
