NIST SP 800-82r3                                         Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security

6.2.5. Maintenance (PR.MA)
The outcomes that fall within the CSF Maintenance Category provide guidance for performing
routine and preventative maintenance on the components of an information system. This includes
the usage of local and remote maintenance tools and the management of maintenance personnel.
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Maintenance tracking solutions enable an organization to schedule, track,
            authorize, monitor, and audit maintenance and repair activities to OT and
            ensure that maintenance logs or changes are properly documented.
            Documenting these events provides an audit trail that can aid in
            cybersecurity-related troubleshooting, response, and recovery activities.
            Maintenance tracking can also provide visibility into scheduled
            maintenance for OT devices and help inform end-of-life decisions.
            The software used for OT maintenance activities should be approved and
            controlled by the organization. Approved software should be obtained
            directly from vendors and its authenticity verified (e.g., by validating
            certificates or comparing the hashes of installers).
            Any maintenance performed on an OT device can inadvertently modify
            its configuration and result in an increased attack surface. The hardened
            state of the OT device should be maintained regardless of the
            maintenance performed. Device configuration should be verified after
            maintenance and software patching, as some features may have
            inadvertently been reenabled or new features installed. Best practices and
            other supporting documents should be obtained from the device vendor
            to guide and inform maintenance activities.
            Limiting the use of certain devices for maintenance activities can help
            reduce the chances of device compromise by exposure to external
            networks, unauthorized users, or theft. Maintenance devices that remain
            secure within the OT environment reduce their exposure. Using
            maintenance devices outside of the OT environment or connecting the
            devices to non-OT networks should be restricted or minimized.
            Any device connected to the OT system should be disconnected after the
            maintenance activities are completed, and any temporary connections
            should be removed.
            The operation, capabilities, and features of the devices used for
            maintenance activities should be well understood. Devices may contain
            wireless radios and other communications devices that may be
            vulnerable to side-channel attacks or may allow simultaneous
            connections between networks (i.e., dual-homed). Vendor documentation
            should be thoroughly reviewed to understand these capabilities.
