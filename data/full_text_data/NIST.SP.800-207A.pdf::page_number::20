      Implementing Multi-Tier Policies for ZTA for Cloud-Native Application
Environments
This section will consider the implementation of multi-tier policies for realizing an enterprise
ZTA using a reference enterprise scenario in which an enterprise hosts microservices
applications in several clusters. Each cluster is serviced with a service mesh instance, and
clusters are spread out both on-premises and in multiple clouds.
Section 4.1 outlines a simple application infrastructure scenario, and Section 4.2 presents a
sample set of associated policies that is relevant for that context. Section 4.3 shows how the same
set of policies can be defined and deployed for a realistic application infrastructure scenario in
which the incoming traffic comes through a demilitarized zone (DMZ).

       Reference Application Infrastructure Scenario
Consider an application infrastructure of an enterprise where the application topology spans a
cloud and on-premises environment. The applications are implemented as microservices with a
service mesh instance for each cluster. Hence, a sidecar proxy is associated with each service. At
the entry and exit points of each cluster are ingress and egress gateways, respectively. The same
data plane (e.g., open-source Envoy) can be used to implement both the sidecar proxy and the
transit gateways.
Next, consider establishing policies for a scenario that involves two services — Service 1 and
Service 2 — that reside in clusters in a cloud and on-premises, respectively. Service 1 in the
cloud cluster can interact with services outside of the cluster through an egress gateway.
Similarly, all services that attempt to access Service 2 from outside of the cluster have to go
through an ingress gateway. All traffic coming out of the cloud has to go through an outbound
firewall, and all traffic coming on-premises has to come through an inbound firewall. The paired
egress-ingress proxies and the firewall rules that allow them connectivity are collectively
referred to as a “transit gateway”. Each network location for the two services is designated by a
subnet address. The application topology and policies described so far are shown in Fig. 3.
