In [RFC 4835] and [RFC 2410], ESP provides options for NULL integrity protection or
NULL encryption, which means that either no integrity protection would be applied or no
encryption would be used, respectively; however, [RFC 4835] specifies that at least one
of them MUST be applied. In the RFCs, NULL integrity protection (often referred to as
NULL authentication) is intended for use in situations where confidentiality is required
without the need for integrity protection. NULL integrity protection shall not, and in fact
cannot, be used with NULL encryption. ESP, for example, could send unencrypted
packets, (encryption set to NULL), but would be required to integrity-protect them, for
example, by using HMAC-SHA1. On the other hand, ESP could send packets encrypted
with AES-128 in CBC mode, but omit the integrity check (integrity protection set to
NULL).
