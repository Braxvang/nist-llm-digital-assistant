                                                                            GUIDE TO COMPUTER SECURITY LOG MANAGEMENT



serious security events and helps to minimize the impact of security incidents. Typically, the log data
most likely to record important events should be analyzed on an ongoing basis, consistent with the
monitoring of other key centralized security controls such as network intrusion detection systems,
antivirus software, and network firewalls. 40 Also, analysis at the infrastructure level can find patterns of
events across multiple systems, such as coordinated or widespread attacks (e.g., malware, distributed
denial of service), and attacks that go between the organization’s systems. Another reason, as mentioned
earlier, is the separation of duties between system-level administrators and infrastructure administrators.

In general, when determining how to divide analysis responsibilities, organizations should focus on the
relative importance of different types of entries and the context necessary to understand each log entry’s
true meaning. Organizations should think carefully about possible sources of context, such as change
management information, that infrastructure administrators might be able to use. For entry types that
generally do not require context, organizations should consider automating and centralizing the analysis
as much as possible. For entry types that do require context, organizations should either rely on system-
level administrators or ensure that the necessary context is available to infrastructure administrators
through supporting log entries, change management program data, or other sources.

To ensure that log management at the system level is performed effectively throughout the organization,
the administrators of those systems need to receive adequate support from the organization. Assuming
that the system-level administrators have typical responsibilities, an organization’s support for them
should encompass the following actions:

       Disseminating information and providing training on the roles that individual systems and their
        administrators play in the log management infrastructure
       Providing points of contact who can answer administrators’ questions on logging
       Encouraging administrators to submit their lessons learned, and providing a mechanism to
        disseminate their ideas (e.g., mailing list, internal Web forum, workshop)
       Providing specific technical guidance on integrating system log data with the log management
        infrastructure, such as implementing SIEM agents or establishing local syslog implementations
       Considering establishing a test environment for logging. The organization could test various
        configurations for common logging sources, document recommendations and instructions, and
        disseminate them to administrators for their use. This information should help them configure
        their logging more effectively and consistently, and also save them time.
       Making tools such as log rotation scripts and log analysis software available to administrators,
        along with documentation. Organizations should consider implementing these in a test
        environment and documenting recommendations and instructions for using them.
Organizations should also provide similar support for infrastructure administrators, with an emphasis on
training and tools.

4.2     Establish Logging Policies

An organization should define its requirements and goals for performing logging and monitoring logs, as
described in Section 2.2. The requirements should include all applicable laws, regulations, and existing

      In many organizations, the same group of security administrators monitors most or all of the major centralized security
      controls. For more information on monitoring security controls as part of an incident response program, see NIST SP 800-
