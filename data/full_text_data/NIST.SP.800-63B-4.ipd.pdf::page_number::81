       NIST SP 800-63B-4 ipd                                                Digital Identity Guidelines

2332         cryptographic keys on smaller mobile devices may be particularly problematic if
2333         the names of the cryptographic keys areas shortened due to reduced screen size.

2334   10.2.9. Multi-Factor Cryptographic Device
2335   Typical Usage
2336   Users authenticate by proving possession of the multi-factor cryptographic device
2337   and control of the protected cryptographic key. The device is activated by a second
2338   authentication factor, either a memorized secret or a biometric. Usability considerations
2339   for the additional factor apply as well — see Sec. 10.2.1 for memorized secrets and
2340   Sec. 10.4 for biometrics used in multi-factor authenticators.
2341   Usability considerations for typical usage include:
2342       • Do not require users to keep multi-factor cryptographic devices connected
2343         following authentication. Users may forget to disconnect the multi-factor
2344         cryptographic device when they are done with it (e.g., forgetting a smartcard in
2345         the smartcard reader and walking away from the computer).
2346            – Users need to be informed regarding whether the multi-factor cryptographic
2347              device is required to stay connected or not.
2348       • Give cryptographic keys appropriately descriptive names that are meaningful to
2349         users since users have to recognize and recall which cryptographic key to use
2350         for which authentication task. This prevents users being faced with multiple
2351         similarly and ambiguously named cryptographic keys. Selecting from multiple
2352         cryptographic keys on smaller mobile devices (such as smartphones) may be
2353         particularly problematic if the names of the cryptographic keys are shortened due to
2354         reduced screen size.
2355       • Limited availability of a direct computer interface like a USB port could pose
2356         usability difficulties. For example, laptop computers often have a limited number
2357         of USB ports, which may force users to unplug other USB peripherals to use the
2358         multi-factor cryptographic device.

2359   10.3. Summary of Usability Considerations
2360   Figure 3 summarizes the usability considerations for typical usage and intermittent
2361   events for each authenticator type. Many of the usability considerations for typical
2362   usage apply to most of the authenticator types, as demonstrated in the rows. The table
2363   highlights common and divergent usability characteristics across the authenticator types.
2364   Each column allows readers to easily identify the usability attributes to address for each
2365   authenticator. Depending on users’ goals and context of use, certain attributes may be
2366   valued over others. Whenever possible, provide alternative authenticator types and allow
2367   users to choose between them.
