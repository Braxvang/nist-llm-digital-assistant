key input in decision-making about investments to protect an asset (Section 3.6). For those cases
where an asset is associated with multiple stakeholders, there may be differing, contradictory,
competing, or conflicting views about the valuation that must be resolved.

             The Concepts of Loss and Loss Control
Loss is the experience of having an asset taken away or destroyed or the failure to keep or to
continue to have an asset in a desired state or form. 32 A loss typically results from an adverse
event or condition that causes unacceptable ramifications, consequences, or impacts. A specific
loss is determined and assessed independent of the causal events and conditions necessary to
produce the loss (i.e., the triggering event, such as an error of omission, or the exploitation event,
such as an attack). Examples of resultant adverse events or conditions and their ramifications,
impacts, or consequences include:
•       Adverse event or condition: Data is stolen or inadvertently disclosed on a public website and
        is no longer solely in the possession of the owner or entities authorized by the owner.
•       Ramification, impact, or consequence: Market share and competitive advantage is taken
        away because the data that was lost or stolen provided detailed instructions for a precision
        machining method that no other company possessed.
•       Adverse event or condition: A vehicle gets a flat tire, which no longer supports the vehicle
        weight.
•       Ramification, impact, or consequence: One cannot drive the vehicle and needs alternate
        transportation to get to work, the store, or go on vacation.
•       Adverse event or condition: Confidence in the system of interest operating correctly is lost or
        questioned.
•       Ramification, impact, or consequence: Trust in the system and its outputs is lost, whether the
        loss of confidence is justified or not.

While the loss condition or event is negative relative to the intended norm, the effect of the loss
can be either neutral/inconsequential or negative/consequential. For example, a flat tire on a
vehicle that is used only for off-road excursion is neutral/inconsequential if no such excursion is
planned or affected.

Loss may occur because of a single or combination of intentional or unintentional causes, events,
and conditions. These may include the authorized or unauthorized use of the system; intentional
acts of disruption or subversion; human and machine faults, errors, and failures; human acts of
misuse and abuse; and the by-product of emergence, side effects, and feature interaction. These
losses may be inconsequential to the mission or business objectives that the system supports. The
objectives may still be achieved despite suffering an immediate or eventual loss that impacts
other stakeholder objectives.

The potential to experience loss suggests the need for loss control objectives that serve as the
basis for judgments about effectively addressing the prevention and limiting of loss. This
