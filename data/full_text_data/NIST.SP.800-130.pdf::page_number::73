SP 800-130                                                               August 2013



If passwords are compromised, the passwords should be replaced. The users may require
further training in selecting the password, in understanding password entropy, in
changing passwords frequently, and in maintaining the confidentiality of written-down
passwords. An examination should also be made of the authentication protocols to
determine if password sniffing, online dictionary attacks or offline dictionary attacks are
feasible.

If the platform operating system is compromised, one or more of the following actions
should be considered and appropriate corrective measures taken:
    a) Make sure that all the latest operating system security patches are installed,
    b) Ask the operating system vendor if there is a patch for the compromise, or
    c) Determine if a device configuration change or the blocking of some protocols will
        prevent future attacks of the same nature as the one that caused the compromise.

If the network security application is compromised, one or more of the following actions
should be considered, and appropriate corrective measures should be taken:
     a) Make sure that all the latest network security patches are installed,
     b) Ask the application vendor if there is a patch for the compromise, or
     c) Determine if a device change, an application configuration change, or the
        blocking of certain protocols will prevent future attacks that allowed or caused the
        compromise.

If the compromise is due to an inadequate network security protocol, one or more of the
following actions should be considered, and appropriate corrective measures should be
taken:
     a) Ask the network security application vendor if there is a patch for the
        compromise, or
     b) Determine if a device configuration change or the blocking of certain protocols
        will prevent future attacks of the same nature as the one that caused the
        compromise.

In all of these situations, the incident should be fully investigated to determine what other
systems and keys may have been compromised due to a compromise of network security
controls. This damage assessment could lead to additional compromise declarations and
additional compromise recovery procedures.

FR:6.116 The CKMS design shall specify how to recover from the compromise of the
network security control used by the system. Specifically,
   a) The CKMS design shall specify the compromise scenarios considered for each
      network security control device,
   b) The CKMS design shall specify which of the mitigation techniques specified in
      this section are to be employed for each envisioned compromise scenario, and
   c) The CKMS design shall specify any additional or alternative mitigation
      techniques that are to be employed.
