           evidence to system vulnerabilities, inductive reasoning
           and abductive reasoning to reconstruct attack scenarios.
           The goal of this work is to reduce the investigators’ time
           and effort in reaching a definite conclusion about how
           an attack occurred. Our results indicate that such a
           reasoning system can be useful for network forensics
           analysis.

                Cyber attacks inevitably have negative impacts
           on relevant missions. However, concrete methods to
           accurately evaluate such impacts are rare. In this paper,
           we propose a probabilistic approach based on Bayesian
           networks for quantitative mission impact assessment.
           A System Object Dependency Graph (SODG) is first
           built to capture the intrusion propagation process at
           the low operating system level. On top of the SODG,
           a mission-task-asset (MTA) map can be established
           to associate the system objects with corresponding
           tasks and missions. Based on the MTA map, a Bayesian
           network can be constructed to leverage the collected
           intrusion evidence and infer the probabilities of tasks
           and missions being tainted. This approach is promising
           for effective quantitative mission impact assessment.
