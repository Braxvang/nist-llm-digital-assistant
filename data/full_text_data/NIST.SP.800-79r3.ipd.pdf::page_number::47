       NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                   Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
       December 2023                                                          and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

1448                    organization if those deficiencies are not corrected or mitigated. The assessment
1449                    report is the assessor’s statement of the results of analyzing and evaluating the
1450                    issuer’s implementation of controls. The sample assessment report in Appendix E
1451                    provides a template for documenting the results after assessing the issuer controls.
1452           Task 5: Assessment Documentation
1453           This task consists of the assessor submitting the assessment report to the EIMO, who then
1454           adds the issuer’s operations plan (revised, if necessary) and the CAP to generate an
1455           authorization submission package for the DAO. If the assessment report contains
1456           deficiencies, the EIMO might choose to address some deficiencies based on the
1457           assessor’s recommendations and revise the operations plan (if needed) before submitting
1458           the package for authorization.
1459                    Subtask 5.1: Provide the EIMO with the assessment report.
1460                    Responsibility: Assessor
1461                    Guidance: The EIMO relies on the expertise, experience, and judgment of the
1462                    assessor to (i) provide recommendations on how to correct deficiencies in the
1463                    planned or performed operations and (ii) understand the potential impacts of those
1464                    deficiencies. The EIMO can choose to act on selected recommendations of the
1465                    assessor before the authorization package is finalized. Any actions taken by the
1466                    EIMO prior to the final authorization decision need to be coordinated with the
1467                    DAO to optimize the utilization of resources across the organization. The assessor
1468                    reviews any changes made in response to the corrective actions and revises the
1469                    assessment report, as appropriate.
1470                    Subtask 5.2: Revise the operations plan (if necessary), and implement its new
1471                    provisions.
1472                    Responsibility: EIMO
1473                    Guidance: The revised operations plan includes all of the changes made in
1474                    response to the assessor’s recommendations for corrective actions.
1475                    Subtask 5.3: Prepare the CAP.
1476                    Responsibility: EIMO
1477                    Guidance: The CAP is one of the three primary documents in the authorization
1478                    submission package and describes actions that need to be taken by the EIMO to
1479                    correct the deficiencies identified in Task 4, Issuer Control Assessment. The CAP
1480                    identifies (i) the tasks to be accomplished, (ii) the resources required to
1481                    accomplish the tasks, (iii) scheduled completion dates for the tasks, and (iv) the
1482                    person responsible for completing each of the tasks.
1483                    Subtask 5.4: Assemble the authorization submission package, and submit it to the
1484                    DAO.
1485                    Responsibility: EIMO
1486                    Guidance: The EIMO is responsible for the assembly and compilation of the
1487                    authorization submission package. The authorization submission package contains
