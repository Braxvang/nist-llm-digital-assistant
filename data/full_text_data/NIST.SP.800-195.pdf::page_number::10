                                                                     WE LCOME LE T T E R

         Identity Guideline (Special Publication 800-63), which provides technical guidelines to agencies for the implementation
         of digital authentication. Building from these foundational resources, NIST’s efforts will focus on strengthening the
         security, privacy, usability and interoperability of digital identity solutions that meet an organization’s identity and access
         management needs throughout the system lifecycle.

              During 2016, NIST’s National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) moved into a new permanent facility that

                   Center’s workspace from four to 23 separate, flexible laboratories—including two larger areas capable of
         safely hosting large equipment, such as automobiles. This additional space allows NCCoE to increase its collaborations
         and projects. In 2016, the Center published draft practice guides to support industry sectors, including healthcare, financial
         services, and energy; these guides are now beginning to be put to productive use. NCCoE also published draft documents
         to support security in key technology areas, such as cloud computing and mobile applications.

              The National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE), led by NIST, is a partnership between government, academia,
         and the private sector that is focused on promoting a robust network and an ecosystem of cybersecurity education,
         training, and workforce development. In 2016, NIST released an update to the NICE Cybersecurity Workforce Framework
         (NCWF); it already is being used in the private and public sectors to more effectively identify, recruit, develop and maintain
         cybersecurity talent. The NICE framework provides a common language to categorize and describe cybersecurity work that
         helps organizations to build a strong staff to protect systems and data.

              Our dedicated staff has accomplished a great deal in 2016, developing standards and working closely with scores
         of partners and drawing upon hundreds of private and public sector organizations and individuals. This is not a static
         endeavor. For example, NIST is fully aware of the urgent need to more aggressively address the security challenges of the
         Internet of Things and, more broadly, our connected world.

             We welcome any and all suggestions about where and how we can better provide the nation with the kind of
         cybersecurity information and tools that it needs in order to advance and protect our economy and our country.
