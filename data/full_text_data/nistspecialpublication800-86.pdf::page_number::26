GUIDE TO INTEGRATING FORENSIC TECHNIQUES INTO INCIDENT RESPONSE



through analysis. Finally, the information transformation into evidence is analogous to transferring
knowledge into action—using the information produced by the analysis in one or more ways during the
reporting phase. For example, it could be used as evidence to help prosecute a specific individual,
actionable information to help stop or mitigate some activity, or knowledge in the generation of new leads
for a case.

3.1     Data Collection

The first step in the forensic process is to identify potential sources of data and acquire data from them.
Section 3.1.1 describes the variety of data sources available and discusses actions that organizations can
take to support the ongoing collection of data for forensic purposes. Section 3.1.2 describes the
recommended steps for collecting data, including additional actions necessary to support legal or internal
disciplinary proceedings. Section 3.1.3 discusses incident response considerations, emphasizing the need
to weigh the value of collected data against the costs and impact to the organization of the collection
process.

3.1.1     Identifying Possible Sources of Data

The increasingly widespread use of digital technology for both professional and personal purposes has led
to an abundance of data sources. The most obvious and common sources of data are desktop computers,
servers, network storage devices, and laptops. These systems typically have internal drives that accept
media, such as CDs and DVDs, and also have several types of ports (e.g., Universal Serial Bus [USB],
Firewire, Personal Computer Memory Card International Association [PCMCIA]) to which external data
storage media and devices can be attached. Examples of external storage forms that might be sources of
data are thumb drives, memory and flash cards, optical discs, and magnetic disks. Standard computer
systems also contain volatile data that is available temporarily (i.e., until the system is shut down or
rebooted). In addition to computer-related devices, many types of portable digital devices (e.g., PDAs,
cell phones, digital cameras, digital recorders, audio players) may also contain data. Analysts should be
able to survey a physical area, such as an office, and recognize the possible sources of data.11

Analysts should also think of possible data sources located in other places. For example, as described in
Sections 6 and 7, there are usually many sources of information within an organization regarding network
activity and application usage. Information may also be recorded by other organizations, such as logs of
network activity for an Internet service provider (ISP). Analysts should be mindful of the owner of each
data source and the effect that this might have on collecting data. For example, getting copies of ISP
records typically requires a court order. Analysts should also be aware of the organization’s policies, as
well as legal considerations, regarding externally owned property at the organization’s facilities (for
example, an employee’s personal laptop or a contractor’s laptop). The situation can become even more
complicated if locations outside the organization’s control are involved, such as an incident involving a
computer at a telecommuter’s home office. Sometimes it is simply not feasible to collect data from a
primary data source; therefore, analysts should be aware of alternate data sources that might contain some
or all of the same data, and should use those sources instead of the unattainable source.

Organizations can take ongoing proactive measures to collect data that may be useful for forensic
purposes. For example, as described in Section 5.1.1, most OSs can be configured to audit and record
certain types of events, such as authentication attempts and security policy changes, as part of normal
operations. Audit records can provide valuable information, including the time that an event occurred and

      Because forensic actions can be performed by people in various roles within an organization, this document typically uses
      the word “analyst” as a generic term for individuals performing forensic actions.
