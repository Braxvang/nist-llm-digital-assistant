sources. The following are some important points to consider when contemplating the deployment of
ASP.NET [Ziri02]:

 ASP.NET relies heavily on the host OS and Web server application for security.

 Client security is well integrated with Web server and host OS authentication services.

 ASP.NET supports Microsoft Code Access Security, which provides methods for the content
  developer or administrator to constrain privileges.

 ASP.NET is relatively immune to buffer overflows.

 ASP.NET is a well-documented and mature technology.

Java EE is based on Java technology (see Section 6.4.1) and provides a type of server-side applet called a
servlet. The Web server first determines whether the browser’s request requires dynamically generated
information from a servlet, which processes the request and generates an HTTP response, a Java Server
Page (JSP), or a static HTML page. If a servlet is required, the Web server can then locate or instantiate a
servlet object corresponding to the request and invoke it to obtain the needed results. If a JSP is
requested, Java EE compiles the JSP into a servlet, then instantiates and invokes it to obtain a response.
If a static HTML page is requested, Java EE simply returns the HTML content like a traditional Web
server.

The Java EE server typically populates itself with the servlet objects, which remain inactive until invoked.
Thus, little or no startup overhead is associated with execution of the servlet objects. A Web server may
also offload the handling of servlets to another server. By relying on Java portability and observing a
common API, servlet objects can run in nearly any server environment. Servlets allow developers to take
advantage of an object-oriented environment on the Web server, which is flexible and extendible.
Moreover, untrusted servlet objects can be executed in a secure area, with the dynamically generated
information being passed from the secure area into the remaining server environment [NIST01].

Some important points to consider when contemplating the deployment of Java servlets [Ziri02]:

 Java EE is tightly integrated with host OS security and Web server authentication for strong security.

 Java EE facilitates secure programming by—

     Leveraging security of Java language

     Using a strong security model supporting constraints by developers and server administrators

     Employing secure error handling.

 Java EE is a well-documented and mature technology.

 A large amount of robust third-party code from IBM, Sun, Apache Foundation, and other developers
  is available for use with Java EE.

PHP is a scripting language used to create dynamic Web pages. With syntax from C, Java, and Perl, PHP
code is embedded within HTML pages for server-side execution. PHP is commonly used to extract data
from a database and present it on a Web page. Most major Windows and Unix Web servers support the
