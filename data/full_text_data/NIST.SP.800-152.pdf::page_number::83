SP 800-152                                                 A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


                          If the network security is compromised, a Federal CKMS
PR:6.86
                          shall:
                              a) Investigate the cause of the compromise,
                              b) Report the compromise to the system administrator,
                                 the CKMS designer, and/or the vendor of the
                                 compromised product,
                              c) Determine the extent to which keys and metadata have
                                 been compromised (if possible),
                              d) Install appropriate fixes so that the compromise will
                                 not reoccur, and
                              e) Replace all compromised keys and sensitive metadata.

                          A Federal CKMS should take corrective measures for
PA:6.26
                          network security compromises, including:
                           a) Installing the latest network security patches,
                           b) Changing network security devices if improved ones are
                              available,
                           c) Upgrading network security configurations, and
                           d) Disabling obsolete or unused protocols.

6.8.7 Personnel Security Compromise Recovery
Anyone that is responsible for the secure operation of an FCKMS might have the capability
to compromise its security. An FCKMS should be designed and operated with capabilities
that minimize the likelihood of any successful human-initiated compromises, detect and
minimize the negative consequences of the compromises, and efficiently recover from such
compromises.

Any detected security failure should result in the initiation of recovery procedures, based
upon the Information Security Policy and the FCKMS capabilities.

FR:6.117 The CKMS design shall specify any personnel compromise detection features that
are provided for each supported role.

FR:6.118 The CKMS design shall specify any personnel compromise minimization features
that are provided for each supported role.

FR:6.119 The CKMS design shall specify the CKMS compromise recovery capabilities that
are provided for each supported role.

               PS-3       A Federal CKMS shall support the evaluation of each new
PR:6.87
                          individual before being authorized to perform any role
                          involving FCKMS security.
               PS-2       A Federal CKMS shall perform an assessment of the
PR:6.88
                          potential consequences of personnel security compromises
                          before the FKCMS initially becomes operational.
