                          Test the security of the operating system
                          Test operating system after initial install to determine vulnerabilities
                          Test operating system periodically to determine new vulnerabilities



Securing Mail Servers and Content

          Completed                                              Action

                          Create a dedicated physical disk or logical partition (separate from operating
