NIST SP 800-90A Rev. 1                                             Recommendation for Random Number
                                                                    Generation Using Deterministic RBGs


The personalization string may contain secret information, but shall not include secret
information that requires protection at a higher security strength than the DRBG being
instantiated will support. For example, a personalization string to be used to instantiate a DRBG
at 112 bits of security strength shall not include information requiring 128 bits of protection. A
given implementation of a DRBG may support the use of a personalization string, but is not
required to do so.
The intent of a personalization string is to introduce additional input into the instantiation of a
DRBG. This personalization string might contain values unknown to an attacker, or values that
tend to differentiate this DRBG instantiation from all others. Ideally, a personalization string will
be set to some bitstring that is as unique as possible. Good sources for the personalization string
contents include:
          •    Application identifiers,                   •   Special key values for this specific
          •    Device serial numbers,                         DRBG instantiation,
          •    User identification,                       •   Protocol version identifiers,
          •    Per-module or per-device values,           •   Random numbers,
          •    Timestamps,                                •   Nonces, and
          •    Network addresses,                         •   Outputs from other approved or non-
                                                              approved random bit generators.
8.7.2         Additional Input

Additional input may optionally be provided to the reseed and generate functions during
requests. The additional input may be obtained from inside or outside a cryptographic module,
and may include secret or public information. Note that a DRBG does not rely on additional
input to provide entropy, even though entropy could be provided in the additional input, and
knowledge of the additional input by an adversary does not degrade the security strength of a
DRBG. However, if the additional input contains secret/private information (e.g., a social
security number), that information shall not require protection at a higher security strength than
the security strength supported by the DRBG. A given implementation of a DRBG may include
the additional input, but is not required to do so. When used within a cryptographic module, the
additional input used in DRBG requests is not considered to be a critical security parameter
unless any secret information included in the additional input qualifies as a critical security
parameter.
Additional input is optional for both the DRBG and the consuming application, and the ability to
enter additional input may or may not be included in an implementation. The value of the
additional input may be either secret or publicly known; its value is arbitrary, although its length
may be restricted, depending on the implementation and the DRBG mechanism. The use of
additional input may be a means of providing more entropy for the DRBG internal state that will
increase assurance that the entropy requirements are met. If the additional input is kept secret and
has sufficient entropy, the input can provide more assurance when recovering from the
compromise of the entropy input, the seed or one or more DRBG internal states.
