                                                            CLOUD COMPUTING SYNOPSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



1.    Introduction

1.1   Authority

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed this document in furtherance of its
statutory responsibilities under the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002,
Public Law 107-347.

NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements, for
providing adequate information security for all agency operations and assets; but such standards and
guidelines shall not apply to national security systems. This guideline is consistent with the requirements
of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Section 8b(3), “Securing Agency
Information Systems,” as analyzed in A-130, Appendix IV: Analysis of Key Sections. Supplemental
information is provided in A-130, Appendix III.

This guideline has been prepared for use by Federal agencies. It may be used by nongovernmental
organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright, though attribution is desired.

Nothing in this document should be taken to contradict standards and guidelines made mandatory and
binding on Federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory authority, nor should these
guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the Secretary of Commerce,
Director of the OMB, or any other Federal official.

1.2   Purpose and Scope

The purpose of this document is to explain the cloud computing technology area in plain terms, and to
provide recommendations for information technology decision makers.

Cloud computing is a developing area and its ultimate strengths and weakness are not yet fully
researched, documented and tested. This document gives recommendations on how and when cloud
computing is an appropriate tool, and indicates the limits of current knowledge and areas for future
analysis.

1.3   Audience

This publication is intended to serve a diverse enterprise audience of information systems professionals
including chief information officers, information systems developers, project managers, system designers,
systems programmers, application programmers, system and network administrators, information system
security officers, and system owners.

1.4   Document Structure

The remainder of this document is organized into the following major sections:

 Section 2 reprises the NIST definition of cloud computing.
 Section 3 surveys typical commercial terms of usage for cloud computing systems.
 Section 4 provides a breakdown of how cloud computing solutions may be deployed and describes
  general implications for different deployment options.
 Section 5 provides a high-level view of how Software as a Service (SaaS) clouds work.
