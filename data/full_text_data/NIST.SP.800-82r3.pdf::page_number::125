NIST SP 800-82r3                                             Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security

                       compromised or an individual with access leaves the
                       organization.
                   •   Privileged (administrative) account passwords require additional
                       protection, such as stronger password requirements, more
                       frequent changing, and additional physical safeguards.
                   •   Passwords should not be sent across any network unless they are
                       protected by some form of FIPS-approved encryption or salted
                       cryptographic hash that is specifically designed to prevent replay
                       attacks.

6.2.2. Awareness and Training (PR.AT)
The Awareness and Training category provides policies and procedures for ensuring that all
users are given basic cybersecurity awareness and training.
Supplemental guidance can be found in the following documents:
   •   NIST SP 800-50, Building an Information Technology Security Awareness and Training
       Program
   •   NIST SP 800-100, Information Security Handbook: A Guide for Managers
   •   NIST SP 800-181, Rev. 1, Workforce Framework for Cybersecurity (NICE Framework)
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Personnel should receive security awareness and training for the OT
            environment and specific applications. In addition, organizations should
            identify, document, and train all personnel who have significant OT roles
            and responsibilities. Awareness and training should cover the physical
            process being controlled as well as the OT system.
            Security awareness is a critical part of OT incident prevention,
            particularly when it comes to social engineering threats. Social
            engineering is a technique used to manipulate individuals into giving
            away private information, such as passwords. This information can then
            be used to compromise otherwise secure systems.
            OT security-specific awareness and training programs could include a
            basic understanding of social engineering techniques, how to identify
            anomalous behavior in the OT environment, when and how to connect
            and disconnect the OT environment from external security domains,
            password complexity and management requirements, and reporting
            practices. All personnel with OT responsibilities should be provided with
            training, which may be tailored based on roles and responsibilities. Roles
            to consider in the training program could include senior executives,
            privileged account users, third-party providers, physical security
            personnel, control engineers, operators, and maintainers.
