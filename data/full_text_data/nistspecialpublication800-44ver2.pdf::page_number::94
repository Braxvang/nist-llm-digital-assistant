                                                                  GUIDELINES ON SECURING PUBLIC WEB SERVERS



 Block all inbound traffic to the Web server except traffic which is required, such as TCP ports 80
  (HTTP) and/or 443 (HTTPS)

 Block all inbound traffic with an internal IP address (to prevent IP spoofing attacks)

 Block client connections from the Web server to the Internet and the organization’s internal network
  (this will reduce the impact of some successful compromises)

 Block (in conjunction with the intrusion detection or prevention system [see Section 8.2.2]) IP
  addresses or subnets that the IDS or IPS reports are attacking the organizational network

 Notify the network or Web server administrator or appropriate security personnel of suspicious
  activity through an appropriate means (e.g., page, e-mail, network trap)

 Provide content filtering

 Protect against DoS attacks

 Detect malformed or known attack URL requests

 Log critical events, including the following details:

     Time/date

     Interface IP address

     Manufacturer-specific event name

     Standard attack event (if one exists)

     Source and destination IP addresses

     Source and destination port numbers

     Network protocol.

Most firewalls perform some type of logging of the traffic they receive. For most firewalls, the default
logging configuration is suitable, provided logging is enabled. Administrators should consult the
manufacturer’s documentation if they believe they require additional information to be logged. Certain
firewalls include an ability to track and log information for each rule, which enables accountability to a
very specific extent.

Many firewalls support the ability to selectively decide what information to log. If a firewall receives a
series of similar packets from the same location, it may decide not to log any additional packets after the
first one. Although this is a valuable feature, consider the consequences: each packet that is dropped and
not logged is potential evidence of malicious intent. The principle of logging, a fundamental aspect of
accountability, is discussed in detail in Section 9.1.

As with OSs and other security-enforcing elements, a firewall requires updates. This includes updating
firmware for hardware and router-based firewalls. Specific instructions on how to update a firewall are
found in the manufacturer’s documentation. Administrators should check for firewall updates frequently.
