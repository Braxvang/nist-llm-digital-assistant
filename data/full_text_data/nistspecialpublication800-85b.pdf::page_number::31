Special Publication 800-85B                               PIV Data Model Testing Specification


AS06.02.12: The signedAttrs of the SignerInfo shall include the MessageDigest (OID =
1.2.840.113549.1.9.4) attribute containing the hash of the concatenated CBEFF_HEADER
and the STD_BIOMETRIC_RECORD.
No requirement for vendor.
TE06.02.12.01: The tester shall validate the presence of a MessageDigest attribute in the signed
attributes.
TE06.02.12.02: The tester shall validate the value of the MessageDigest attribute against the
hash of the concatenated CBEFF_HEADER and the STD_BIOMETRIC_RECORD.

AS06.02.13: The signedAttrs of the SignerInfo shall include the pivSigner-DN (OID =
2.16.840.1.101.3.6.5) attribute containing the subject name that appears in the X.509
certificate for the entity that signed the fingerprint biometric data.
No requirement for vendor.
TE06.02.13.01: The tester shall validate the presence of a pivSigner-DN attribute in the signed
attributes.
TE06.02.13.02: The tester shall validate the value of the pivSigner-DN attribute is the same as
the subject name that appears in the certificate that signed the biometric data.

AS06.02.14: The signedAttrs of the SignerInfo shall include the pivFASC-N (OID =
2.16.840.1.101.3.6.6) attribute containing the FASC-N of the PIV card.
No requirement for vendor.
TE06.02.14.01: The tester shall validate the presence of a pivFASC-N attribute in the signed
attributes.
TE06.02.14.02: The tester shall validate the value of the pivFASC-N attribute is the same as the
FASC-N that is present in the CHUID.

AS06.02.15: The signatureAlgorithm field specified in the SignerInfo field shall be in
accordance with Table 3-4 of SP 800-78 and based on the PIV card expiration date in
accordance with Table 3-3 of SP 800-78.
No requirement for vendor.
TE06.02.15.01: The tester shall validate that the signature algorithm is based on the expiration
date of the PIV card and is in accordance with Table 3-4 of SP80078.

AS06.02.16: The SignedData content type shall include the digital signature.
No requirement for vendor.
TE06.02.16.01: The tester shall validate that the SignedData content type includes the digital
signature corresponding to the signed biometric data.
