FAMILY: MEDIA PROTECTION                                                              CLASS: OPERATIONAL


MP-1      MEDIA PROTECTION POLICY AND PROCEDURES

          Control: The organization develops, disseminates, and periodically reviews/updates: (i) a formal,
          documented, media protection policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities,
          management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and (ii)
          formal, documented procedures to facilitate the implementation of the media protection policy and
          associated media protection controls.
          Supplemental Guidance: The media protection policy and procedures are consistent with applicable
          laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. The media
          protection policy can be included as part of the general information security policy for the
          organization. Media protection procedures can be developed for the security program in general,
          and for a particular information system, when required. NIST Special Publication 800-12
          provides guidance on security policies and procedures.
          Control Enhancements: None.

MP-2      MEDIA ACCESS

          Control: The organization restricts access to information system media to authorized individuals.

          Supplemental Guidance: Information system media includes both digital media (e.g., diskettes,
          magnetic tapes, external/removable hard drives, flash/thumb drives, compact disks, digital video
          disks) and non-digital media (e.g., paper, microfilm). This control also applies to portable and
          mobile computing and communications devices with information storage capability (e.g.,
          notebook computers, personal digital assistants, cellular telephones).
          An organizational assessment of risk guides the selection of media and associated information
          contained on that media requiring restricted access. Organizations document in policy and
          procedures, the media requiring restricted access, individuals authorized to access the media, and
          the specific measures taken to restrict access. The rigor with which this control is applied is
          commensurate with the FIPS 199 security categorization of the information contained on the
          media. For example, fewer protection measures are needed for media containing information
          determined by the organization to be in the public domain, to be publicly releasable, or to have
          limited or no adverse impact on the organization or individuals if accessed by other than
          authorized personnel. In these situations, it is assumed that the physical access controls where the
          media resides provide adequate protection.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization employs automated mechanisms to restrict access to media storage areas and to
                audit access attempts and access granted.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement is primarily applicable to
                designated media storage areas within an organization where a significant volume of media is
                stored and is not intended to apply to every location where some media is stored (e.g., in
                individual offices).
