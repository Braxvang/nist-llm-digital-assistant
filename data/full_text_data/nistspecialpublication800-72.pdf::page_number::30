                                                                           Guidelines on PDA Forensics


4.2   Evidential Principles

       As a backdrop to any investigation basic principals have been proposed for dealing with digital
       evidence. Digital evidence has both physical and logical aspects. The physical side of it
       involves hardware components, peripherals, and media, which may contain data or the means
       to access it, while the logical side deals with the raw data extracted from a relevant information
       source. The Good Practice Guide for Computer based Electronic Evidence [ACPO2] suggests
       four principles when dealing with digital evidence.

               No actions performed by investigators should change data contained on digital
               devices or storage media.

               Individuals accessing original data must be competent to do so and have the ability to
               explain their actions.

               An audit trail or other record of applied processes, suitable for independent third-party
               review, must be created and preserved, accurately documenting each investigative
               step.

               The person in charge of the investigation has overall responsibility for ensuring the
               above-mentioned procedures are followed and in compliance with governing laws.

       The Proposed Standards for the Exchange of Digital Evidence [IOCE], suggest a similar set of
       principals for the standardized recovery of computer-based evidence:

               Upon seizing digital evidence, actions taken should not change that evidence.

               When it is necessary for a person to access original digital evidence, that person must
               be forensically competent.

               All activity relating to the seizure, access, storage, or transfer of digital evidence must
               be fully documented, preserved, and available for review.

               An individual is responsible for all actions taken with respect to digital evidence while
               the digital evidence is in their possession.

               Any agency that is responsible for seizing, accessing, storing, or transferring digital
               evidence is responsible for compliance with these principles.

       The above sets of principles aim to ensure the integrity and accountability of digital evidence
       through its entire life cycle. Proper handling of evidence is always vital for it to be admissible
       in judicial proceedings. However, different standards may apply to different types of
       investigations. The degree of training and expertise required to execute a forensic task largely
       depends on the level of evidence required in the case [Pur].

       The Daubert method, a set of standards that serve as a guide when dealing with evidence in a
       court of law, proposes several reliability factors, which should be kept in mind when applying
       and reporting on a scientific technique being used in a forensic examination [Oco04]:
