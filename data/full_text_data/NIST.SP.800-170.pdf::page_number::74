 integrity, isolation, and protected storage features that are
 supported by roots of trust. Draft SP 800-164, Guidelines on
 Hardware-Rooted Security in Mobile Devices, was released for
 public comment in October 2012.
   In FY 2014, CSD will release a revised draft of SP 800-
 164, based on the feedback received during the public
 comment period. In addition, CSD is working with the National
 Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) to encourage the
 adoption of stronger security technologies in mobile devices.
 Using draft SP 800-164 as a basis for an NCCoE building block
 activity, CSD and the NCCoE will invite mobile device, operating
 system, management software vendors, and application
 developers to study, demonstrate, and document how to use
 hardware-backed security solutions.
   In FY 2013, CSD continued its work to protect fundamental
 system firmware, commonly known as Basic Input/Output
 System (BIOS). CSD has been working with key members of the
 computer industry on the use of roots of trust to improve the
 security of BIOS.
    CSD will continue its efforts to secure BIOS and other critical
 firmware in FY 2014 and will finalize a Special Publication
 covering BIOS protections for server-class systems. CSD will
 also release an updated draft of SP 800-155, BIOS Integrity
 Measurement Guidelines, which will include additional
 guidelines for server-class systems and other boot firmware. In
 order to encourage the continued adoption of BIOS protections,
 CSD also plans to submit SP 800-147, BIOS Protection
 Guidelines, to ISO for standardization.
