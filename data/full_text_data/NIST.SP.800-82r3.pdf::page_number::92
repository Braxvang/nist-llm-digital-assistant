NIST SP 800-82r3                                         Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security

            Organizations should consider the impact that automated responses
            associated with IPS may have on the OT environment before deploying.
            In some cases, organizations may consider placing IPS units at higher
            levels in the environment (e.g., the DMZ interfaces) to minimize
            potential issues with automated responses impacting OT.
            In OT environments, network-based monitoring capabilities are typically
            deployed on boundary protection devices using switched port analyzer
            (SPAN) ports or passive network taps. Organizations should also
            consider deploying host-based monitoring capabilities on compatible OT
            devices – such as HMIs, SCADA servers, and engineering workstations
            – to improve monitoring capabilities, provided that the addition of the
            tools does not adversely impact operational performance or safety.

5.2.3.4.       Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA)
A ZTA is a cybersecurity paradigm that focuses on protecting resources (e.g., information
services, data) based on the premise that authorization decisions are made closer to the resource
being requested and are continuously evaluated rather than implicitly granted [SP800-207].
Conventional network security focuses on segmentation and perimeter defenses. Once inside the
network perimeter, users are typically considered “trusted” and often given broad access to
accessible resources. As a result, boundary protection devices between zones do not mitigate
lateral movement risks within a zone. Additionally, with the growing prevalence of distributed
computing, wireless and cellular communications, and cloud and hybrid-cloud environments,
traditional network perimeters and boundaries are becoming less defined. For these situations,
organizations might consider incorporating the principles of zero trust into their security
architecture.
Some challenges to implementing a ZTA include:
   •   Organizations may not find a suitable single solution for a ZTA and may instead need to
       integrate several technologies with varying maturity levels to support their environment.
   •   Implementing zero trust principles into an existing environment may require more
       investments in time, resources, and technical ability.
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Some OT components (e.g., PLCs, controllers, HMI) may not support
            the technologies or protocols required to fully integrate with a ZTA
            implementation. As a result, a ZTA implementation might not be
            practical for some OT devices. Instead, organizations should consider
            applying a ZTA to compatible devices, such as those typically found at
            the functionally higher levels of the OT architecture (e.g., Purdue model
            Levels 3, 4, 5, and the OT DMZ).
            Organizations may also want to consider whether any adverse impacts
            might occur, such as if the ZTA solution increases the latency to respond
            to resource requests or if one or more ZTA components become
            unavailable. Based on this analysis, organizations should consider
