896           a. Identify software programs authorized to execute on the system.
897           b. Implement a deny-all, allow-by-exception policy for the execution of software programs on the
898              system.
899           c.     Review and update the list of authorized software programs periodically.

900           DISCUSSION
901           If provided with the necessary privileges, users can install software in organizational systems. To
902           maintain control over the software installed, organizations identify permitted and prohibited
903           actions regarding software installation. Permitted software installations include updates and
904           security patches to existing software and downloading new applications from organization-
905           approved “app stores.” Prohibited software installations include software with unknown or
906           suspect pedigrees or software that organizations consider potentially malicious. The policies
907           selected for governing user-installed software are organization-developed or provided by some
908           external entity. Policy enforcement methods can include procedural methods and automated
909           methods.
910           Authorized software programs can be limited to specific versions or from a specific source. To
911           facilitate a comprehensive authorized software process and increase the strength of protection
912           against attacks that bypass application-level authorized software, software programs may be
913           decomposed into and monitored at different levels of detail. These levels include applications,
914           application programming interfaces, application modules, scripts, system processes, system
915           services, kernel functions, registries, drivers, and dynamic link libraries. Organizations consider
916           verifying the integrity of authorized software programs using digital signatures, cryptographic
917           checksums, or hash functions. The verification of authorized software can occur either prior to
918           execution or at system startup.

924   3.4.10. System Component Inventory
925             REQUIREMENT: 03.04.10
926             a. Develop and document an inventory of system components.
927             b. Review and update the system component inventory periodically.
928             c.    Update the system component inventory as part of installations, removals, and system
929                   updates.

930             DISCUSSION
931             System components are discrete, identifiable assets (i.e., hardware, software, and firmware
932             elements) that compose a system. Organizations may implement centralized system component
933             inventories that include components from all systems. In such situations, organizations ensure
934             that the inventories include system-specific information required for component accountability.
935             The information necessary for effective accountability of system components includes the
