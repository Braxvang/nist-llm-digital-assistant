                                                                                              the system. Therefore, it is essential that software function correctly and be protected from
                                                                                              corruption. There are many elements of software support.
                                                                                              The first element is controlling what software is used on a system. If users or systems personnel
                                                                                              can install and execute any software on a system, the system is more vulnerable to viruses,
                                                                                              unexpected software interactions, and software that may subvert or bypass security controls. One

                                                                                              compatibility with custom applications, identify other unforeseen interactions). This can apply to
                                                                                              new software packages, upgrades, off-the-shelf products, or to custom software, as deemed
                                                                                              appropriate. In addition to controlling the installation and execution of new software,
                                                                                              organizations also oversee the configuration and use of powerful system utilities. System utilities

                                                                                              The second element in software support can be to ensure that software has not been modified
                                                                                              without proper authorization. This involves the protection of software and backup copies and can
                                                                                              be done with a combination of logical and physical access controls.
                                                                                              Many organizations also include a program to ensure that software is properly licensed, as
                                                                                              required. For example, an organization may audit systems for illegal copies of copyrighted
                                                                                              software. This problem is primarily associated with user systems (or devices), but can apply to
                                                                                              any type of system.

                                                                                              Closely related to software support is configuration management—the process of tracking and
                                                                                              approving changes to the system. Configuration management can be formal or informal and
                                                                                              normally addresses hardware, software, networking, and other changes. The primary security
                                                                                              goal of configuration management is to ensure that changes to the system do not unintentionally
                                                                                              or unknowingly diminish security. Some of the methods discussed under software support (e.g.,
                                                                                              such as inspecting and testing software changes) can be used. Chapter 7 discusses other methods.
                                                                                              Note that the security goal is to know what changes occur, not to prevent security from being
                                                                                              changed. There may be circumstances under which reducing security is deemed an acceptable
                                                                                              risk due to the need to accomplish the mission. In such cases, the decrease in security is based on
                                                                                              a decision by the authorizing official who considered all appropriate factors. Furthermore, the
