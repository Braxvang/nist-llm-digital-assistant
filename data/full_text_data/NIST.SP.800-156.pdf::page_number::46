NIST SP 800-156                                   REPRESENTATION OF PIV CHAIN-OF-TRUST
                                                                FOR IMPORT AND EXPORT


Appendix D—Glossary of Terms

Biometric         The stored electronic information pertaining to a biometric. This
                  information can be in terms of compressed pixels or in terms of
                  some characteristic (e.g., patterns).

Cardholder        An individual possessing an issued PIV Card.

Chain-of-trust    The chain-of-trust is a sequence of related enrollment data sets that
                  is created and maintained by PIV Card issuers

FASC-N            Federal Agency Smart Credential Number (FASC-N): As required
                  by [FIPS201], one of the primary identifiers on the PIV Card. The
                  FASC-N is a fixed length (25-byte) data object, specified in [SP800-
                  73-4], and included in several data objects on a PIV Card.

Issuer            An agency or service provider that issues PIV credentials in
                  accordance with [FIPS201] and NIST [SP 800-79-2].

Off-Card          A cardholder’s biometric reference data stored on the PIV Card that
                  is matched against the cardholder’s life-scan biometrics Off-Card
                  during authentication.
                  A cardholder’s biometric reference data stored on the PIV Card that
On-Card
                  is matched against the cardholder’s life-scan biometrics On-Card
                  during authentication.
