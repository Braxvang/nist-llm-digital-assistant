process level. An adverse event can have multiple consequences and different types of impact, at different levels, and
in different time frames. For example, the exposure of sensitive information (e.g., personally identifiable information)
by a particular mission/business area (e.g., human resources) can have organization-wide consequences and adverse
impact with regard to reputation damage; the information system consequence/impact for multiple systems of an
attacker more easily overcoming identification and authentication security controls; and the mission/business process
consequence/impact (for one or more mission/business areas) of an attacker falsifying information on which future
decisions are based. To ensure consistency, organizations determine at Tier 1, how consequences/impacts experienced
in different time frames are to be assessed. At Tier 2, mission/business owners may amplify organizational guidance, as
appropriate. The types of consequences and impact considered in risk determinations are identified to provide a basis
for determining, aggregating, and/or consolidating risk results and to facilitate risk communication. Organizations also
provide guidance to Tier 2 and Tier 3 with regard to the extent that risk assessments are to consider the risk to other
organizations and the Nation. Organization make explicit any assumptions about the degree of impact/consequences
related to specific threat sources (by name or by type) or through specific vulnerabilities (individually or by type).
Likelihood
Organizations can employ a variety of approaches for determining the likelihood of threat events. Some organizations
treat the likelihood that a threat event will occur and the likelihood that, if it occurs, it will result in adverse effects as
separate factors, while other organizations assess threat likelihood as a combination of these factors. In addition, some
organizations prefer quantitative risk assessments while other organizations, particularly when the assessment involves
a high degree of uncertainty, prefer qualitative risk assessments. Likelihood determinations can be based on either
threat assumptions or actual threat data (e.g., historical data on cyber attacks, historical data on earthquakes, or specific
information on adversary capabilities, intentions, and targeting). When specific and credible threat data is available
(e.g., types of cyber attacks, cyber attack trends, frequencies of attacks), organizations can use the empirical data and
statistical analyses to determine more specific probabilities of threat events occurring. Organizations select a method
consistent with organizational culture and risk tolerance. Organizations can also make explicit assumptions concerning
the likelihood that a threat event will result in adverse effects as follows: (i) worst case (i.e., attack will be successful
unless strong, objective reasons to presume otherwise); (ii) best case (i.e., attack will not be successful unless specific,
credible information to the contrary); or (iii) something in between best and worst cases (e.g., the most probable case).
Organizations document any overarching assumptions. Organizations can use empirical data and statistical analyses to
help inform any of the approaches used to determine the likelihood of threat events occurring. Organizations select a
method consistent with organizational culture, understanding of the operational environment, and risk tolerance.

RISK CONSTRAINTS

TASK 1-2: Identify constraints on the conduct of risk assessment, risk response, and risk monitoring
activities within the organization.
Supplemental Guidance: The execution of the risk management process can be constrained in various ways, some of
which are direct and obvious, while others are indirect. Financial limitations can constrain the set of risk management
activities directly (e.g., by limiting the total resources available for investments in risk assessments or in safeguards or
countermeasures) or indirectly (e.g., by eliminating activities which, while involving relatively small investments in
risk response, entail curtailing or discarding investments in legacy information systems or information technology).
Organizations might also discover that the need to continue to depend on legacy information systems may constrain the
risk management options available to the organization. Constraints can also include legal, regulatory, and/or contractual
requirements. Such constraints can be reflected in organizational policies (e.g., restrictions on outsourcing, restrictions
on and/or requirements for information to be gathered as part of risk monitoring). Organizational culture can impose
indirect constraints on governance changes (e.g., precluding a shift from decentralized to hybrid governance structures)
and which security controls are considered by organizations as potential common controls. In particular, organizational
attitudes toward information technology risk that, for example, favor extensive automation and early adoption of new
technologies can constrain the degree of risk avoidance and perhaps risk mitigation that can be achieved. Any cultural
constraints that limit senior leader/executive (e.g., chief information officer) visibility into organizational information
systems that are beyond their formal authority (e.g. mission-related systems) may impede overall understanding of the
complexity of information systems environment and the related risks to the organization. At Tier 2, mission/business
owners interpret constraints in light of organizational missions/business functions. Some regulatory constraints may not
apply to particular missions/business functions (e.g., regulations that apply to international operations, when
mission/business areas are restricted to the United States). Alternately, additional requirements may apply (e.g.,
mission/business processes performed jointly with another organization, which imposes contractual constraints). At
Tier 3, information system owners, common control providers, and/or program managers interpret the organization-
wide and mission/business function-specific constraints with respect to their systems and environments of operation
(e.g., requirements to provide specific security controls are satisfied through common controls).
