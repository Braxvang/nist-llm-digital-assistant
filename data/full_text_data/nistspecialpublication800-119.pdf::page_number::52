having to fragment packets, and destinations receive fewer packets requiring reassembly. Since
originating nodes know the PMTU, they can in most cases ensure that traffic is sent with no
fragmentation at all.

The PMTU of any given network path is equal to the smallest MTU along that path. For example, Figure
3-13 depicts two nodes establishing a communications session across three intermediate nodes. The links
to the two end nodes (A and B) have MTUs of 1500, whereas the links connecting the three intermediary
nodes (1 and 2; 2 and 3) have MTUs of 1300 and 1800, respectively. The PMTU of the network path
between nodes A and B is 1300 bytes. This is because the MTU from node 1 to node 2 is only 1300
bytes, the smallest of the four hops.

In this example, ICMPv6 is employed by all nodes to recognize and configure the PMTU automatically.
The two endpoints of the path set the PMTU to 1300 without administrative intervention. The size of an
IPv6 packet traversing this path for this session needs to conform to the PMTU for the path; otherwise it
is dropped and the sender receives an ICMPv6 error message requesting it to retransmit using a smaller
packet size.

The PMTU protocol is detailed in RFC 1981.

  3.5.6   Security Ramifications

This section describes security considerations for ICMPv6. Examples include denial of ICMPv6 traffic
that can effectively result in a denial of service condition for a given network. The functions of Neighbor
Discovery and PMTU discovery are entirely dependent upon the proper functioning of ICMPv6. Not
only is proper Neighbor Discovery configuration essential to a functional IPv6 network, but
misconfiguration of RA and RS parameters can compromise the security of the network.

Rogue routers or misconfigured nodes may be inserted on a local network segment and configured to
propagate false or inaccurate RA messages. Network nodes on this segment might then learn false
routing information that would result in network traffic being sent through the rogue router. Further,
forged RA messages may be sent from legitimate hosts on an IPv6 network segment, possibly causing
