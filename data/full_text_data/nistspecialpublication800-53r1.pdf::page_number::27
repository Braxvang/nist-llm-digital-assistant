Special Publication 800-53, Revision 1                  Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________


Scalability-related considerations—

•    Security controls are scalable with regard to the extent and rigor of the control
     implementation. Scalability is guided by the FIPS 199 security categorization of the
     information system being protected. For example, a contingency plan for a FIPS 199 high-
     impact information system may be quite lengthy and contain a significant amount of
     implementation detail. In contrast, a contingency plan for a FIPS 199 low-impact
     information system may be considerably shorter and contain much less implementation
     detail. Organizations should use discretion in applying the security controls to information
     systems, giving consideration to the scalability factors in particular environments. This
     approach facilitates a cost-effective, risk-based approach to security control implementation
     that expends no more resources than necessary, yet achieves sufficient risk mitigation and
     adequate security.

Security objective-related considerations—
•    Security controls that uniquely support the confidentiality, integrity, or availability security
     objectives may be downgraded to the corresponding control in a lower baseline (or
     appropriately modified or eliminated if not defined in a lower baseline) if, and only if, the
     downgrading action: (i) is consistent with the FIPS 199 security categorization for the
     corresponding security objectives of confidentiality, integrity, or availability before moving
     to the high water mark; 40 (ii) is supported by an organizational assessment of risk; and (iii)
     does not affect the security-relevant information within the information system. 41 The
     following security controls are recommended candidates for downgrading: (i) confidentiality
     [AC-15, MA-3 (3), MP-2 (1), MP-3, MP-4, MP-5 (1) (2) (3), MP-6, PE-5, SC-4, SC-9]; (ii)
     integrity [SC-8]; and (iii) availability [CP-2, CP-3, CP-4, CP-6, CP-7, CP-8, MA-6, PE-9,
     PE-10, PE-11, PE-13, PE-15, SC-6]. 42




40
   When applying the “high water mark” process in Section 3.2, some of the original FIPS 199 confidentiality, integrity,
or availability security objectives may have been upgraded to a higher baseline of security controls. As part of this
process, security controls that uniquely support the confidentiality, integrity, or availability security objectives may
have been upgraded unnecessarily. Consequently, it is recommended that organizations consider appropriate and
allowable downgrading actions to ensure cost-effective, risk-based application of security controls.
41
   Information that is security-relevant at the system level (e.g., password files, network routing tables, cryptographic
key management information) is distinguished from user-level information within an information system. Certain
security controls within an information system are used to support the security objectives of confidentiality and
integrity for both user-level and system-level information. Caution should be exercised in downgrading confidentiality
or integrity-related security controls to ensure that the downgrading action does not result in insufficient protection for
the security-relevant information within the information system. Security-relevant information must be protected at the
high water mark in order to achieve that level of protection for any of the security objectives related to user-level
information.
42
   Certain security controls that are uniquely attributable to confidentiality, integrity, or availability that would
ordinarily be considered as potential candidates for downgrading (e.g., AC-16, AU-10, CP-5, IA-7, PE-12, PE-14, PL-
5, SC-5, SC-13, SC-14, SC-16) are eliminated from consideration because the controls are either selected for use in all
baselines and have no enhancements that could be downgraded, or the controls are optional and not selected for use in
any baseline. Organizations should exercise extreme caution when considering downgrading actions on any security
controls that do not appear in the list in Section 3.3 to ensure that the downgrading action does not affect security
objectives other than the objectives targeted for downgrading.
