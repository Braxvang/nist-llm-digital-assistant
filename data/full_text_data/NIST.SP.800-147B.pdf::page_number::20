5.    Guidelines for Service Processors

A key distinction between servers and clients is the inclusion of a Service Processor in the system. The
Service Processor plays a critical role in managing and monitoring the server, and may have a role in
updating the system BIOS. This section describes the Service Processor and provides more detailed
security requirements for systems that contain a Service Processor.

5.1   Service Processor as a Root of Trust
Service Processors in managed and blade servers might have the ability to directly update the BIOS flash
memory, the BIOS execution memory, or their own flash or other storage media. In these cases, some or
all of the Service Processor environment may be employed as an RTU for the system BIOS. This applies
to Service Processors that are capable of updating BIOS flash on systems that use BIOS flash protection
mechanisms to prevent unauthorized modifications to BIOS code (e.g., those that employ update
mechanism 1 or 2, as described in Section 4). It also applies to Service Processors that are capable of
modifying the RTU used to verify BIOS code in systems that verify BIOS code prior to execution (e.g.,
those that employ update mechanism 3).

In these situations, the execution environment of the Service Processor (SP) must be protected from
malicious code that could update the BIOS or the SP flash. To comply with the BIOS security principles
in Section 3, Service Processors employed as a Root of Trust to protect BIOS shall meet the following
guidelines:
     1. Updates to the SP code, cryptographic keys, and static data stored on the SP flash shall be by way
         of an authenticating update mechanism.
     2. The SP environment shall be controlled such that only authenticated code can be executed on the
         SP.
     3. Authorization should be required for user interaction with the Service Processor.

5.2   Non-Bypassability of BIOS Protections by Service Processor
Some servers with Service Processors might not employ the Service Processor as an RTU for BIOS
updates. To ensure the SP environment cannot bypass BIOS protections, Service Processors in these
systems shall not have direct write access to the BIOS flash memory from which the BIOS code is
verified or executed. Furthermore, the Service Processor shall be restricted such that is not capable of
interfering with BIOS update processes, nor the memory from which the BIOS or RTU code is executed.

Service Processors that do not implement these restrictions may be capable of bypassing the BIOS
protections outlined in this document. As such, they must be trusted to protect BIOS, even if in their
normal operation they are not used for BIOS update. Such Service Processors shall be considered Roots
of Trust and meet the requirements in Section 5.1.
