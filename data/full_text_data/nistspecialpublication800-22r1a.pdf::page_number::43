A STATISTICAL TEST SUITE FOR RANDOM AND PSEUDORANDOM NUMBER GENERATORS FOR CRYPTOGRAPHIC APPLICATIONS



        For example, if ε = 01011010011101010111, then n = 20. If L = 2 and Q = 4, then K = n/L -
        Q = 20/2 - 4 = 6 . The initialization segment is 01011010; the test segment is 011101010111.
        The L-bit blocks are shown in the following table:

                                    Block         Type          Contents
                                      1                           01
                                      2       Initialization      01
                                      3         Segment           10
                                      4                           10
                                      5                           01
                                      6       Test Segment        11
                                      7                           01
                                      8                           01
                                      9                           01
                                     10                           11


(2)     Using the initialization segment, a table is created for each possible L-bit value (i.e., the L-bit
        value is used as an index into the table). The block number of the last occurrence of each L-bit
        block is noted in the table (i.e., For i from 1 to Q, Tj= i, where j is the decimal representation of
        the contents of the ith L-bit block).

        For the example in this section, the following table is created using the 4 initialization blocks.


                                                     Possible L-bit Value
                                   00                 01              10                  11
                              (saved in T0)      (saved in T1)   (saved in T2)       (saved in T3)
           Initialization          0                  2                4                  0


(3)     Examine each of the K blocks in the test segment and determine the number of blocks since the
        last occurrence of the same L-bit block (i.e., i – Tj). Replace the value in the table with the
        location of the current block (i.e., Tj= i). Add the calculated distance between re-occurrences of
        the same L-bit block to an accumulating log2 sum of all the differences detected in the K blocks
        (i.e., sum = sum + log2(i – Tj)).

        For the example in this section, the table and the cumulative sum are developed as follows:

                For block 5 (the 1st test block): 5 is placed in the “01” row of the table (i.e., T1), and
                     sum=log2(5-2) = 1.584962501.
                For block 6: 6 is placed in the “11” row of the table (i.e., T3), and sum = 1.584962501 +
                     log2(6-0) = 1.584962501 + 2.584962501 = 4.169925002.
                For block 7: 7 is placed in the “01” row of the table (i.e., T1), and sum = 4.169925002 +
                     log2(7-5) = 4.169925002 + 1 = 5.169925002.
                For block 8: 8 is placed in the “01” row of the table (i.e., T1), and sum = 5.169925002 +
                     log2(8-7) = 5.169925002 + 0 = 5.169925002.
                For block 9: 9 is placed in the “01” row of the table (i.e., T1), and sum = 5.169925002 +
                     log2(9-8) = 5.169925002 + 0 = 5.169925002.
