                                                    GUIDE TO INTRUSION DETECTION AND PREVENTION SYSTEMS (IDPS)



Ways in which NFAT software complements IDPSs include the following:

 NFAT software is often more valuable for network forensics than IDPS software because of its
  extensive packet logging.
 Having NFAT software perform packet logging can reduce the load on network-based IDPS sensors.
 NFAT software might be better-suited to customization, especially for content searches (e.g.,
  keywords), than some IDPS technologies.
 Some NFAT graphical user interfaces (GUI) may offer analysis, visualization, and reporting
  capabilities that IDPS consoles do not.
Limitations of NFAT software in the context of IDPS include the following:

 NFAT software usually does not have the intrusion detection capabilities of network-based IDPSs.
 NFAT software typically offers no intrusion prevention capabilities.
8.3.2   Anti-Malware Technologies

The most commonly used technical control for malware threat mitigation is antivirus software. Types of
malware that it can detect include viruses, worms, Trojan horses, malicious mobile code, and blended
threats, as well as attacker tools such as keystroke loggers and backdoors. Antivirus software typically
monitors critical OS components, filesystems, and application activity for signs of malware, and attempts
to disinfect or quarantine files that contain malware. Most organizations deploy antivirus software both
centrally (e.g., e-mail servers, firewalls) and locally (e.g., file servers, desktops, laptops) so that all major
malware entry vectors can be monitored.

Another commonly used control for malware threat mitigation is spyware detection and removal utilities,
also known as antispyware software. They are similar to antivirus software, but they focus on detecting
both malware and non-malware forms of spyware, such as malicious mobile code and tracking cookies,
and spyware installation techniques such as unauthorized Web browser plug-in installations, popup ads,
and Web browser hijacking.

Both antivirus and antispyware products detect threats primarily through signature-based analysis. To
identify previously unknown threats, they also use heuristic techniques that examine activity for certain
suspicious characteristics. The product vendors create and release additional signatures when new threats
emerge, so that the products can detect them.

Ways in which antivirus and antispyware software complements IDPSs include the following:

 IDPSs usually have limited malware and spyware detection capabilities (often only for the most
  common threats, such as widespread worms), so antivirus and antispyware software can detect many
  threats that IDPSs cannot.
 NBA technology might identify that a worm is spreading based on unusual traffic flows, but it
  probably could not identify which worm it is. Antivirus software should be able to determine which
  worm it is, if the threat is not a new one for which the antivirus software does not yet have signatures.
 Antivirus software, and to a lesser extent antispyware software, can take some load from IDPSs, such
  as having antivirus software identify instances of a particular worm and disabling the wormâ€™s
  signatures on the IDPS sensors. This is particularly important during a widespread malware
