The series is designed to help business process owners and privacy program personnel understand
basic concepts on how to implement the tools. Anticipated to be completed in early FY 2022,
the series will serve as a foundation for the development of a technical guideline for deploying
differential privacy.
Privacy-Enhancing Cryptography
The Privacy-Enhancing Cryptography project promotes the use of cryptographic protocols that
enable parties to interact meaningfully without revealing private information to one another or to
third parties. Toward this end, NIST has been engaged with various stakeholders, researchers,
and developers. In FY 2021, motivated by the need to conduct automated exposure notification
related to the current pandemic, NIST developed a privacy-protecting method to measure levels
of interaction within a population. NIST also launched a quarterly series of talks on topics related
to privacy and public auditability.
