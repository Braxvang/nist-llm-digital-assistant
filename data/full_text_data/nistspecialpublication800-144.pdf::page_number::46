Areas                 Recommendations

                      Understand the underlying technologies that the cloud provider uses to provision
                      services, including the implications that the technical controls involved have on the
Architecture
                      security and privacy of the system, over the full system lifecycle and across all system
                      components.
                      Ensure that adequate safeguards are in place to secure authentication, authorization,
Identity and Access
                      and other identity and access management functions, and are suitable for the
Management
                      organization.
                      Understand virtualization and other logical isolation techniques that the cloud provider
Software Isolation    employs in its multi-tenant software architecture, and assess the risks involved for the
                      organization.

                      Evaluate the suitability of the cloud provider’s data management solutions for the
                      organizational data concerned and the ability to control access to data, to secure data
                      while at rest, in transit, and in use, and to sanitize data.
                      Take into consideration the risk of collating organizational data with that of other
Data Protection       organizations whose threat profiles are high or whose data collectively represent
                      significant concentrated value.
                      Fully understand and weigh the risks involved in cryptographic key management with the
                      facilities available in the cloud environment and the processes established by the cloud
                      provider.

                      Understand the contract provisions and procedures for availability, data backup and
                      recovery, and disaster recovery, and ensure that they meet the organization’s continuity
                      and contingency planning requirements.
Availability
                      Ensure that during an intermediate or prolonged disruption or a serious disaster, critical
                      operations can be immediately resumed, and that all operations can be eventually
                      reinstituted in a timely and organized manner.

                      Understand the contract provisions and procedures for incident response and ensure
                      that they meet the requirements of the organization.
                      Ensure that the cloud provider has a transparent response process in place and sufficient
Incident Response     mechanisms to share information during and after an incident.
                      Ensure that the organization can respond to incidents in a coordinated fashion with the
                      cloud provider in accordance with their respective roles and responsibilities for the
                      computing environment.
