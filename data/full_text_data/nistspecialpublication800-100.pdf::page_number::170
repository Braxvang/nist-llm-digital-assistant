Q. What is security certification?
A. Security certification is a comprehensive assessment of the management,
   operational, and technical security controls in an information system, made in
   support of security accreditation, to determine the extent to which the controls
   are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired
   outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the system. The
   results of a security certification are used to reassess the risks and update the
   system security plan, thus providing the factual basis for an authorizing official to
   render a security accreditation decision.
Q. What is security accreditation?
A. Security accreditation is the official management decision given by a senior
   agency official to authorize operation of an information system and to explicitly
   accept the risk to agency operations, agency assets, or individuals based on the
   implementation of an agreed-upon set of security controls. By accrediting an
   information system, an agency official accepts responsibility for the security of
   the system and is fully accountable for any adverse impacts to the agency if a
   breach of security occurs. Thus, responsibility and accountability are core
   principles that characterize security accreditation.

Q. Are there any necessary activities to support security accreditation?
A. Yes. The assessment of risk and the development of system security plans are
   two important activities in an agency’s information security program that directly
   support security accreditation and are required by FISMA and OMB Circular
   A-130, Appendix III.
   Risk assessments influence the development of the security controls for
   information systems and generate much of the information needed for the
   associated system security plans. Risk assessments can be accomplished in a
   variety of ways depending on the specific needs of the agency. The assessment
   of risk is a process that should be incorporated into the SDLC. At a minimum,
   documentation should be produced that describes the process used and the
   results obtained.
