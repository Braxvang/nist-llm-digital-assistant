 Data import/export, and performance limitations (general). Because consumers access a cloud
  over a network, on-demand bulk data import or export may exceed the network's ability to carry the
  data in a timely manner. Additionally, real-time or critical processing may be problematic because of
  networking latency or other limitations.
Organizations contemplating the use of cloud computing should consider these general statements and
their possible consequences for an organization's mission and business model. Considering only the
general statements, however, is not sufficient. Clouds are also described by one or more of the other (i.e.,
not "general") scopes listed in Table 1; organizations contemplating the use of cloud computing should
consider the detailed statements made for the kinds of clouds they contemplate using. Each of the
alternatives is broken out below in a separate section focusing on a specific scope. 7

4.1     Understanding Who Controls Resources in a Cloud

It is sometimes asserted that when compared to traditional on premises computing, cloud computing
requires consumers to give up (to providers) two important capabilities:

 Control: the ability to decide, with high confidence, who and what is allowed to access consumer
  data and programs, and the ability to perform actions (such as erasing data or disconnecting a
  network) with high confidence both that the actions have been taken and that no additional actions
  were taken that would subvert the consumer's intent (e.g., a consumer request to erase a data object
  should not be subverted by the silent generation of a copy).
 Visibility: the ability to monitor, with high confidence, the status of a consumer's data and programs
  and how consumer data and programs are being accessed by others.
The extent, however, to which consumers may need to relinquish control or visibility depends on a
number of factors including physical possession and the ability to configure (with high confidence)
protective access boundary mechanisms around a consumer’s computing resources.

This document uses the concept of access boundaries to organize and characterize the different cloud
deployment models. Figure 2 illustrates a key concept from computer security relating to boundaries and
control, the security perimeter [TIS94, Gas88]. As shown in the figure, a security perimeter is a barrier to
access: entities that are inside the perimeter may freely access resources inside the perimeter; however
entities that are located outside the perimeter may access the resources inside only if allowed by a
boundary controller that enforces a policy over access. Although the term is often used to discuss
firewalls and networks, the concept of the security perimeter is actually more generic and can be used, for
instance, to describe the boundaries between different privilege levels of running software, e.g., between
applications and operating systems. By itself, a security perimeter is NOT an adequate security
mechanism; however, perimeter controls are an important building block for secure systems.

Typical boundary controllers include firewalls [TIS94, Che94], guards [Eps99], and Virtual Private
Networks [Ros99]. By implementing a security perimeter around its important resources, an organization
can achieve both a measure of control over the use of those resources and a means for monitoring access
to them. 8 Furthermore, via reconfiguration, an organization can adapt a security perimeter to changing
needs (e.g., blocking or allowing protocols or data formats based on changing business circumstances).

  This document does not generally repeat text. However, for specific types of clouds, more can be said about them; in this case,
     the name of a general statement may be used again but with an explanation specific to that type of cloud.

  When uncontrolled paths to computing resources exist, a security perimeter is weakened or may not even exist. Pervasive
     wireless communications, e.g., are a threat to security perimeters since there may be no reliable way to interpose a boundary
     controller between external entities and internal entities. Similarly, many organizations use mobile devices that are
     sometimes connected within an organization's security perimeter, and sometimes exposed directly, e.g., when on travel.
