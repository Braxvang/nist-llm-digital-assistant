    SP 800-53A: Guide for Assessing Security Controls in Federal Information Systems â€“
    Building Effective Security Assessment Plans, June 2010,
    http://www.csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html.
    SP 800-53A is intended to facilitate security control assessments conducted within an
    effective risk management framework. The assessment results provide organizational
    officials:
       a) Evidence about the effectiveness of security controls in organizational
          information systems;
       b) An indication of the quality of the risk management processes employed
          within the organization; and
       c) Information about the strengths and weaknesses of information systems that
          are supporting critical Federal missions and applications in a global
          environment of sophisticated threats.

   SP 800-56A: Recommendation for Pair-Wise Key Establishment Schemes Using
   Discrete Logarithm Cryptography (Revised), May 2013,
   http://www.csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html.
   SP 800-56A specifies key establishment schemes using discrete logarithm
   cryptography, based on standards developed by the Accredited Standards Committee
   (ASC) X9, Inc.: ANS X9.42 (Agreement of Symmetric Keys Using Discrete
   Logarithm Cryptography) and ANS X9.63 (Key Agreement and Key Transport Using
   Elliptic Curve Cryptography). Compliance with this Standard is validated under the
   NIST Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP).

    SP 800-56B: Recommendation for Pair-Wise Key Establishment Using Integer
    Factorization Cryptography, August 2009,
    http://www.csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html.
    SP 800-56B specifies key establishment schemes using integer factorization
    cryptography, based on ANS X9.44, Key Establishment using Integer Factorization
    Cryptography, which was developed by the Accredited Standards Committee (ASC)
    X9, Inc. Compliance with this Standard is validated under the NIST Cryptographic
    Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP).

    SP 800-56C: Recommendation for Key Derivation through Extraction-then-
    Expansion, November 2011, http://www.csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html.
    SP 800-56C specifies a two-step derivation procedure that employs an extraction-
    then-expansion technique for deriving keying material from a shared secret generated
    during a establishment scheme specified in [SP 800-56A] or [SP 800-56B]. Several
