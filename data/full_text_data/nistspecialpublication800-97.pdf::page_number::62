                                             Figure 5-7. Discovery Phase Frame Flows



As an alternative to the frame flow depicted in Figure 5-7, the Probe Request-Response pair may be
absent. If the STA had monitored one of the periodic Beacon frames from the AP, it would not have
needed to request the parameters from the AP through a Probe Request. Therefore, a STA can discover
an APâ€™s security policy through either or both of two methods: passively monitoring for AP Beacon
frames, and actively probing for all APs within range.

Figure 5-8 depicts an example of security policy negotiation. As shown, the AP advertises its capabilities
to the STA in a periodic Beacon frame, as set by the WLAN security policy. In this example, the AP
informs the STA that it is capable of performing IEEE 802.1X authentication, CCMP for unicast traffic
protection, and CCMP for broadcast traffic protection. 55 The STA also indicates that it is capable of
performing IEEE 802.1X authentication and CCMP for both types of traffic. At this point, the AP
accepts the IEEE 802.1X and CCMP request, then self-configures these capabilities. It confirms its
declaration with an Association Response frame, indicating the completion of security policy negotiation
and the end of the discovery phase.

     The IEEE 802.11i amendment states that if CCMP is used for broadcast traffic protection, then TKIP cannot be used for
     unicast traffic.
