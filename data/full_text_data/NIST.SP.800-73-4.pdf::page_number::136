1.      Introduction

Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) called for a common identification standard to
be adopted governing the interoperable use of identity credentials to allow physical and logical access to
Federally controlled facilities and information systems. Federal Information Processing Standard 201
[FIPS201], Personal Identity Verification (PIV) of Federal Employees and Contractors, was developed to
establish standards for identity credentials. Special Publication 800-73-4 (SP 800-73-4) contains technical
specifications to interface with the smart card (PIV Card 1) to retrieve and use the identity credentials.

1.1     Purpose

FIPS 201 defines procedures for the PIV lifecycle activities including identity proofing, registration, PIV
Card issuance, and PIV Card usage. FIPS 201 also specifies that the identity credentials must be stored on
a smart card. SP 800-73-4 contains the technical specifications to interface with the smart card to retrieve
and use the identity credentials. The specifications reflect the design goals of interoperability and PIV
Card functions. The goals are addressed by specifying a PIV data model, card edge interface, and
application programming interface (API). Moreover, SP 800-73-4 enumerates requirements where the
international integrated circuit card (ICC) standards [ISO7816] include options and branches. The
specifications go further by constraining implementers’ interpretations of the normative standards. Such
restrictions are designed to ease implementation, facilitate interoperability, and ensure performance in a
manner tailored for PIV applications.

1.2     Scope

SP 800-73-4 specifies the PIV data model, application programming interface (API), and card interface
requirements necessary to comply with the use cases, as defined in Section 6 of FIPS 201 and further
described in Appendix B of SP 800-73-4 Part 1. Interoperability is defined as the use of PIV identity
credentials such that client-application programs, compliant card applications, and compliant ICCs can be
used interchangeably by all information processing systems across Federal agencies. SP 800-73-4 defines
the PIV data elements’ identifiers, structure, and format. SP 800-73-4 also describes the client API and
card command interface for use with the PIV Card.

This part, SP 800-73-4 Part 3: PIV Client Application Programming Interface, contains technical
specifications of the PIV client application programming interface to the PIV Card.

1.3     Audience and Assumptions

This document is targeted at Federal agencies and implementers of PIV systems. Readers are assumed to
have a working knowledge of smart card standards and applications.

Readers should also be aware of SP 800-73-4 Part 1, Section I, which details the revision history of
SP800-73, Section II, which contains configuration management recommendations, and Section III,
which specifies NPIVP conformance testing procedures.




1
  A physical artifact (e.g., identity card, “smart” card) issued to an individual that contains a PIV Card Application which stores
identity credentials (e.g., photograph, cryptographic keys, digitized fingerprint representation) so that the claimed identity of the
cardholder can be verified against the stored credentials by an automated process (computer readable and verifiable) or by
another person (human readable and verifiable).
