                       Table 2. Measures Template and Instructions
         Field                                                Data
Measure ID       State the unique identifier used for measure tracking and sorting. The unique identifier
                 can be from an organization-specific naming convention or can directly reference another
                 source.
Goal             Statement of strategic goal and/or information security goal. For system-level security
                 control measures, the goal would guide security control implementation for that
                 information system. For program-level measures, both strategic goals and information
                 security goals can be included. For example, information security goals can be derived
                 from enterprise-level goals in support of the organization’s mission. These goals are
                 usually articulated in strategic and performance plans. When possible, include both the
                 enterprise-level goal and the specific information security goal extracted from agency
                 documentation, or identify an information security program goal that would contribute to
                 the accomplishment of the selected strategic goal.
Measure          Statement of measurement. Use a numeric statement that begins with the word
                 “percentage,” “number,” “frequency,” “average,” or a similar term.
                 If applicable, list the NIST SP 800-53 security control(s) being measured. Security
                 controls that provide supporting data should be stated in Implementation Evidence. If the
                 measure is applicable to a specific FIPS 199 impact level (high, moderate, or low), state
                 this level within the measure.
Type             Statement of whether the measure is implementation, effectiveness/efficiency, or impact.
Formula          Calculation to be performed that results in a numeric expression of a measure. The
                 information gathered through listing implementation evidence serves as an input into the
                 formula for calculating the measure.
Target           Threshold for a satisfactory rating for the measure, such as milestone completion or a
                 statistical measure. Target can be expressed in percentages, time, dollars, or other
                 appropriate units of measure. Target may be tied to a required completion time frame.
                 Select final and interim target to enable tracking of progress toward stated goal.
Implementation   Implementation evidence is used to compute the measure, validate that the activity is
Evidence         performed, and identify probable causes of unsatisfactory results for a specific measure.
                 •   For manual data collection, identify questions and data elements that would provide
                     the data inputs necessary to calculate the measure’s formula, qualify the measure for
                     acceptance, and validate provided information.
                 •   For each question or query, state the security control number from NIST SP 800-53
                     that provides information, if applicable.
                 •   If the measure is applicable to a specific FIPS 199 impact level, questions should
                     state the impact level.
                 •   For automated data collection, identify data elements that would be required for the
                     formula, qualify the measure for acceptance, and validate the information provided.
Frequency        Indication of how often the data is collected and analyzed, and how often the data is
                 reported. Select the frequency of data collection based on a rate of change in a particular
                 security control that is being evaluated. Select the frequency of data reporting based on
                 external reporting requirements and internal customer preferences.
