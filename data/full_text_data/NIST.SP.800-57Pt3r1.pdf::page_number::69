2. Ensure that any EFS system that derives keys from passwords has the capability of
   enforcing the use of strong passwords.
3. To increase the security of encrypted file systems, the system should use a hardware
   token or a TPM for the storage of the keys.

9.4 Recommendations for System Installers
The system installer is the individual(s) that installs EFS components and performs the
initial configuration of the components.

1. When an EFS system that utilizes passwords for security is installed, the installer
   shall require that strong passwords be enforced by the EFS. This maximizes the
   difficulty of an off-line exhaustion attack.
2. The system installer should ensure that the database of keys is protected by
   encryption to ensure the security of the system. In addition, if the key is split by the
   EFS system, the key component stored on a hardware token should be protected.

9.5 Recommendations for System Administrators
The system administrator is the individual that manages the EFS on a day-to-day basis
and interacts with the end user.

1. The system administrator shall ensure that the organization’s security policy is
   enforced.
2. Key recovery procedures shall be in place to ensure that users can recover their data
   if they lose their authentication information (password, token data, etc). A method for
   data recovery personnel to authenticate these users should be in place prior to the
   recovery of the user’s keys or files.
3. If the EFS includes a master administrator password for use in data recovery by the
   system administrator, the system administrator shall utilize a strong password.
4. System administrators shall provide training and security guidance to the end users of
   the system that, at a minimum, focuses on passwords, data-recovery procedures, and
   user configuration of their system to utilize the authentication features within the
   system.

9.6 Recommendations for End Users
An end user is the individual that uses the EFS to secure and share their information.

1. If user-selected passwords are used within the product, end users shall utilize strong
   passwords to maximize the difficulty of an off-line exhaustion attack.
2. End users shall follow guidance provided by the system administrator regarding the
   use of an Encrypted File System product.
3. End users shall inform a system administrator if they have lost their hardware token
   or forgotten their password.
