the arguments relating the evidence to the claims. Assurance cases must be maintained in
response to variances throughout the engineering effort.

The specific form of an assurance case and the level of rigor and formality in acquiring the
evidence required is a trade space consideration. It involves the target (i.e., desired) level of
assurance, the nature of the consequences for which assurance is sought, and the size and
complexity of the dimensions that factor into determining trustworthiness. The assurance case is
an engineering construct and must be managed to ensure that the expended effort is justified by
the need for the evidence in determining trustworthiness. The assurance claims are the key
trustworthiness factor and are developed from the security objectives and associated measures of
success independent of the system realization and its supporting evidence. Trustworthiness and
assurance are discussed further in Appendix F.


             SYSTEMS SECURITY ENGINEERING FRAMEWORK – WHY IT MATTERS
         Establishing the problem, solution, and trustworthiness contexts as key components
         of a systems security engineering framework helps ensure that the security of a system
         is based on achieving a sufficiently complete understanding of the problem as defined
         by a set of stakeholder security objectives, security concerns, protection needs, and
         security requirements. This understanding is essential to developing effective security
         solutions – that is, a system that is sufficiently trustworthy and adequately secure to
         protect stakeholder’s assets in terms of loss and the associated consequences.
