                                                                                                        GUIDE TO SSL VPNS



One of the primary strengths of an SSL VPN architecture is its granularity of access control. An
organization should leverage this feature by being specific in its identification of resources, the users who
can access them, and other security requirements. It is helpful to begin this process by articulating a set
of organizational requirements for remote access. These requirements are not strictly technical but are
dictated by the needs of the organization. Here are a few examples of organizational requirements:

 All employees should be able to access the main corporate applications and a set of Web-based
  applications such as email that are all hosted on the intranet servers.
 A small group of executives should be able to access the executive file share on the administrative
  server.
 The sales team should have access to the sales database and the sales file share on the sales server.
 Business partners should be able to access the extranet partner server.
 Network administrators should have full access to routers, switches, and other network infrastructure
  (network management devices, etc.)
The next step is to determine other requirements such as anticipated performance requirements (normal
and peak loads), service level agreement (SLA) guarantees, and the use of multiple languages.

The organization should consider the best possible technical solution once its requirements are identified.
It is possible that other protocols such as SSH or IPsec provide a better technical solution than SSL. This
is especially pertinent if a VPN solution already exists, because it could potentially be leveraged to meet
the identified requirements. See Section 6 for descriptions of such protocols and guidance on when a
particular protocol may be a viable alternative to SSL. SSL may be the only option in some cases, such as
when granularity on a per-application basis is required for remote access or if the VPN needs to be
available to remote users without any software or hardware installation.

4.2     SSL VPNs and FIPS 140-2 Approval

Federal agencies are required to use cryptographic algorithms that are NIST-approved and contained in
FIPS-validated modules. The FIPS 140-2 7 specification defines how cryptographic modules will be
validated. One requirement of FIPS 140 is that the module be capable of operating in a mode where all
algorithms are NIST-approved. NIST-approved algorithms are specified in a FIPS (e.g., FIPS 180,
Secure Hash Standard 8 ) or in a NIST Recommendation (e.g., SP 800-56A, Recommendation for Pair-
Wise Key Establishment Schemes Using Discrete Logarithm Cryptography 9 ). Where there are no NIST-
approved algorithms in a specific class, such as key transport, the Cryptographic Module Validation
Program (CMVP) Implementation Guidance may specify additional constraints. Because SSL VPN
technology employs a number of cryptographic algorithms, Federal agencies must be aware of whether
their chosen SSL VPN technology is FIPS-compliant now and whether it is expected to be FIPS-
compliant during the entire expected lifetime of the system.

Many of the cryptographic algorithms used in some SSL cipher suites are not FIPS-approved, and
therefore are not allowed for use in SSL VPNs that are to be used in applications that must conform to
