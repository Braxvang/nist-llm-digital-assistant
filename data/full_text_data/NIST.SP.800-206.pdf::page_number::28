IMPERATIVE 6
Enhancing Identity and Access Management

Properly managing access to IT systems, processes, and information is central to managing
cybersecurity risks and a priority for NIST’s cybersecurity program. NIST engages and
collaborates with standards bodies and consortia such as the International Organization
for Standardization (ISO),46 the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF),47 the Fast IDentity
Online (FIDO) Alliance,48 the Open Identity Federation (OIF), and the Kantara Initiative.49


       MOVING AWAY FROM PASSWORDS
       In response to a widely recognized need, NIST continued to advance the
       challenge of moving away from passwords and plans to publish a key report in
       2019 with its latest research findings and recommendations. In 2018, NIST:
       •   Continued to investigate Authentication for Law Enforcement Vehicle
           Systems50 project requirements and
       •   Revised high visibility publications, including: the Attribute Based Access Control
           (SP 1800-3)51 guide that shows how to manage access to networked resources
           more securely and efficiently; the Mobile Application Single Sign-on: Improving
           Authentication for Public Safety and First Responders (SP 1800-13)52 guide
           that shows how single sign-on can be used efficiently and securely on mobile
           devices to access restricted information; and the Multifactor Authentication for
           E-Commerce (SP 1800-17)53 guide that shows how organizations can efficiently
           implement multi-factor authentication in a user-friendly manner to protect
           customers’ information from being used for fraudulent purchases.
       In FY19, NIST intends to finalize SP 1800-3, SP 1800-13, and SP 1800-17 based on
       comments from industry and the public.
