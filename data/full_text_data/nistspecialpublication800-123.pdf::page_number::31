                                                                                         GUIDE TO GENERAL SERVER SECURITY



 Host-based firewalls, to protect the server from unauthorized access. 21

 Patch management or vulnerability management software to ensure that vulnerabilities are addressed
  promptly. Patch management and vulnerability management software can be used only to apply
  patches or also to identify new vulnerabilities in the server’s OSs, services, and applications.

Some servers also use disk encryption technologies to protect their stored data from attackers who gain
physical access to the servers. Disk encryption technologies are built into some operating systems, and
third-party disk encryption products are also available.

When planning security controls, server administrators should consider the resources that the security
controls will consume. A server’s performance could degrade if it does not have enough memory and
processing capacity for the controls. Server administrators should also consider any network-based
security controls, such as network firewalls and intrusion detection systems, that could provide additional
protection for the server. If host-based security controls are too resource-intensive for a server or are
otherwise infeasible, server administrators may need to compensate by using additional network-based
security controls to protect the server’s OS, services, and applications. For many servers, network-based
security controls are used in addition to host-based security controls to provide additional layers of
security.

4.4     Security Testing the Operating System

Periodic security testing of the OS is a vital way to identify vulnerabilities and to ensure that the existing
security precautions are effective and that security controls are configured properly (for example, the
required cryptographic algorithms are in use to protect network communications). Common methods for
testing OSs include vulnerability scanning and penetration testing. Vulnerability scanning usually entails
using an automated vulnerability scanner to scan a host or group of hosts on a network for application,
network, and OS vulnerabilities. Penetration testing is a testing process designed to compromise a
network using the tools and methodologies of an attacker. It involves iteratively identifying and
exploiting the weakest areas of the network to gain access to the remainder of the network, eventually
compromising the overall security of the network. Vulnerability scanning should be conducted
periodically, at least weekly to monthly, and penetration testing should be conducted at least annually.
Because both of these testing techniques are also applicable to testing the server application, they are
discussed in detail in Section 6.4. 22

Factors to be considered when deciding whether to test the production server or a similarly configured
non-production server include the following:

 The possible impact to the production server. For example, if a certain test technique is likely to
  cause a denial of service, then that technique should probably be used against the non-production
  server.
 The presence of sensitive personally identifiable information (PII). If testing could expose sensitive
  PII, such as Social Security Numbers (SSN) or credit card information, to people without
  authorization to see it, then organizations should consider performing the testing on a non-production
  server that holds a false version of the PII (e.g., test data instead of actual sensitive PII).
