10 Disaster Recovery
An FCKMS failure could hamper or prevent access to an organization’s information. For
example, the inability to decipher information because the key is destroyed or
unrecoverable will prevent access to the plaintext data because the information cannot be
decrypted. This section describes how operational continuity can be achieved in the event
of device failures or the corruption of keys and metadata.

Disaster recovery requires having procedures and sufficient backup capability to recover
from facility damage, utility service outages, communication and computation outages,
hardware and software failures, and other failures that result in the corruption of keys and
metadata.

Several of the PRs and PAs in this section include a specific time frame for recovery.
Alternatively, recovery could be in accordance with a Service Level Agreement (SLA)
between a service provider and a service-using organization; the SLA is a service
contract where the service is formally defined. The specific times provided in the PRs
and PAs can be used to determine whether recovery times specified in the SLA are
reasonable for the FCKMS and its associated applications. Note that the required
recovery times may not be the same for all applications, so the time frames provided in
an SLA can be customized.

PR:10.1         CP-6         A Federal CKMS shall be installed and operated with
               CP-9 (6)      sufficient backup capability to ensure operational continuity.

              CP-2 (3, 4)    A Federal CKMS should have procedures and sufficient

                             backup capability to recover to a secure state following a
                             detected failure within 24 hours or a time period specified in
                             a Service Level Agreement (SLA).

                             backup capability to recover to a secure state within one hour
                             following a detected failure.

10.1 Facility Damage

FCKMS components should be located in physically secure and environmentally
protected facilities. Facilities may be either fixed or mobile.

For an FCKMS module in a fixed facility, wind, water and fire damage are common
risks. For mobile facilities, risks also include physical damage, accidental loss, theft,
destruction, and a higher probability of use by unauthorized entities than is the case for a
fixed facility. For mobile devices that contain FCKMS capabilities, the enclosure is
considered to be the facility (see Section 8.1) and should have physical protection against
unauthorized access to the device’s electronics. Mobile devices could be provided with
waterproof containers and owner-identity verification mechanisms (e.g., fingerprint
