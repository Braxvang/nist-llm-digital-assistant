                                                                         System as a National Security System




3.0 Method for Identifying National Security Systems
3.1 Determination of Responsibilities

The head of each agency is responsible for designating an agency information security
official to determine which, if any, agency systems are national security systems.

Each agency is responsible for identification of all national security systems under its
ownership or control. Answering each of the questions stated in the National Security
System Identification Checklist, provided as Appendix A to this guideline, is one method
for documenting the basis for determination. If the answer to any of the questions is
affirmative, the system is designated a national security system. Note that use of the
specific form provided in Appendix A is not mandatory. Agencies may develop and use
an alternate methodology. It is anticipated that some agencies will require answers to
additio nal questions. However, each of the questions listed on the sample checklist
should be answered and recorded.

Ideally, a national security system should be designated as early as possible in its life
cycle. The set of certification and accreditation standards, policies, procedures,
guidelines, and instructions that apply to each system depend on whether or not the
system is a national security system. For systems that are currently in operation, and for
which no national security determination has been made, such determination should be
accomplished as soon as possible.

Under the provisions of Title 44 United States Code ยง 3542(b)(2)(A)(i)(V), it is possible
that some systems not originally established as national security systems may become
national security systems as a result of being designated as critical to the direct
fulfillment of military or intelligence missions. 2 If the manager of a military or
intelligence mission determines that a system is critical to that mission, and the system
has not previously been identified as a national security system, the manager responsible
for that mission must so identify the system to the responsible entity designated by the
head of the agency that owns and/or operates the system (see Appendix A, Section
A.1.5).

When the manager of a military or intelligence mission determines that a system is no
longer critical to that mission, or when the mission is terminated, the manager responsible
for that mission must so notify the responsible entity designated by the head of the
agency that owns and/or operates the system, and the system ceases to be designated a
national security system. [Note that if a system is designated as a national security
system and then removed from that designation (and possibly be moved back at a later
time), it may prove very difficult to satisfy the changing security requirements on the
system. Therefore, such actions should not be taken casually.]

 Subparagraph (A)(i)(V) does not include a system that is to be used for routine administrative and
business applications (including payroll, finance, logistics, and personnel management applications.
