SC-16     TRANSMISSION OF SECURITY PARAMETERS

                 The information system reliably associates security parameters with information
          Control:
          exchanged between information systems.
          Supplemental Guidance: Security parameters include, for example, security labels and markings.
          Security parameters may be explicitly or implicitly associated with the information contained
          within the information system.
          Control Enhancements: None.


           LOW Not Selected              MOD Not Selected         HIGH Not Selected



SC-17     PUBLIC KEY INFRASTRUCTURE CERTIFICATES

          Control: The organization issues public key certificates under an appropriate certificate policy or
          obtains public key certificates under an appropriate certificate policy from an approved service
          provider.
          Supplemental Guidance: For user certificates, each agency either establishes an agency certification
          authority cross-certified with the Federal Bridge Certification Authority at medium assurance or
          higher or uses certificates from an approved, shared service provider, as required by OMB
          Memorandum 05-24. NIST Special Publication 800-32 provides guidance on public key
          technology. NIST Special Publication 800-63 provides guidance on remote electronic
          authentication.
          Control Enhancements: None.


           LOW Not Selected              MOD SC-17                HIGH SC-17



SC-18     MOBILE CODE

          Control:The organization: (i) establishes usage restrictions and implementation guidance for
          mobile code technologies based on the potential to cause damage to the information system if used
          maliciously; and (ii) authorizes, monitors, and controls the use of mobile code within the
          information system.
          Supplemental Guidance: Mobile code technologies include, for example, Java, JavaScript, ActiveX,
          PDF, Postscript, Shockwave movies, Flash animations, and VBScript. Usage restrictions and
          implementation guidance apply to both the selection and use of mobile code installed on
          organizational servers and mobile code downloaded and executed on individual workstations.
          Control procedures prevent the development, acquisition, or introduction of unacceptable mobile
          code within the information system. NIST Special Publication 800-28 provides guidance on
          active content and mobile code.
          Control Enhancements: None.


           LOW Not Selected              MOD SC-18                HIGH SC-18
