KSK to keep the DNSKEY RRset response size from growing too large for a UDP packet. This triggers
the use of TCP, which is requires more network resources for the server to respond to clients.

11.2.5 KSK Key Rollover in a Chained Secure Zone (using the Revoke Bit)

There is a standardized method developed in the IETF to provide a stable means to updating a KSK that
may or may not be installed in clients as a trust anchor [RFC5011]. Since it is impossible to know if a
server’s KSK is a trust anchor for a client, it is recommended to use this method to insure that clients
update their trust anchors.

This KSK rollover method involves a series of timed steps and changing of flag bits in the KSK
DNSKEY RR, which may be difficult to perform manually. There have been several tools developed to
automate this process, but the steps are presented below to help administrators understand the process:

    1. The administrator adds the new KSK but does not use it to generate any signatures (similar to
       pre-publishing during a ZSK rollover.

    2. Wait a pre-calculated time (recommended – 30 days)

    3. Set the Revoke bit (flag) in the outgoing KSK and sign the DNSKEY RRset with both old and
       new KSK’s. The old key is now revoked and will not be used by clients who understand the
       revoked bit and the process described in RFC 5011. Have the delegating parent add a new DS
       with the hash of the new KSK.

    4. Wait a pre-calculated time (recommended – 30 days)

    5. Remove the old KSK and resign using the new KSK only. Contact the delegating parent (if the
       parent is signed) to delete the corresponding DS RR for the old KSK.



11.3 Emergency Key Rollovers

An emergency key rollover occurs when one or more of the keys in the zone (ZSK or KSK) have become
compromised or the private component has been lost and a re-signing needs to occur. These types of
rollovers are not planned, so there is a greater chance of a break in the chain of authentication if the zone
administrator needs to perform this type of rollover.

11.3.1 Emergency ZSK Rollover

A DNS administrator needs to perform multiple steps to perform an emergency ZSK rollover in the event
one (or more) ZSK’s are compromised. This multi-step recovery process is another reason for a zone
administrator to perform a ZSK rollover continuously. If a zone administrator has the new DNSKEY RR
already published in the zone as part of the zone key set (the first three steps in the process listed in
Section 11.1.1), the next step depends on the key that has been compromised.

If the ZSK currently in use has been compromised, the zone administrators can immediately rollover to
the new key. There is no need to wait for the TTL value to expire because the new key has already been
published for a period of time. The administrator can simply strip the old RRSIGs from the zone and re-
sign with the new ZSK earlier than the planned rollover. DNS operation should continue normally after
this re-signing, with no breaks in the authentication chain.
