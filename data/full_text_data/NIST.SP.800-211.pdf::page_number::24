     FOCUS AREA 3



     Security techniques—Security requirements for cryptographic modules, and ISO/
     IEC 24759:2017, Information technology—Security techniques—Test requirements for
     cryptographic modules.
     In support of this update, NIST developed a series of draft NIST Special Publications (the
     SP 800-140x “subseries”) for public comment. They directly support FIPS 140-3 and its
     associated program, the Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP):
       •    Draft SP 800-140, FIPS 140-3 Derived Test Requirements (DTR)
       •    Draft SP 800-140A, CMVP Documentation Requirements
       •    Draft SP 800-140B, CMVP Security Policy Requirements
       •    Draft SP 800-140C, CMVP Approved Security Functions
       •    Draft SP 800-140D, CMVP Approved Sensitive Parameter Generation and
            Establishment Methods
       •    Draft SP 800-140E, CMVP Approved Authentication Mechanisms
       •    Draft SP 800-140F, CMVP Approved Non-Invasive Attack Mitigation Test Metrics
     NIST has determined a transition timeline for the implementation of the new standard, as
     described in Table 1: Timeline for Implementation of FIPS 140-3 Submissions.
