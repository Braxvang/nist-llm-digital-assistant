                                  GUIDE TO PROTECTING THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION (PII)



3.2.6      Access to and Location of PII

Organizations may choose to take into consideration the nature of authorized access to PII. When PII is
accessed more often or by more people and systems, there are more opportunities for the confidentiality
of the PII to be compromised. Another aspect of the nature of access to PII is whether PII is being stored
on or accessed from teleworkers‘ devices or other systems and other systems, such as web applications,
outside the direct control of the organization. 41 These considerations could cause an organization to
assign a higher impact level to widely-accessed PII than would otherwise be assigned to help mitigate the
increased risk caused by the nature of the access.

Additionally, organizations may choose to consider whether PII that is stored or regularly transported off-
site by employees should be assigned a higher PII confidentiality impact level. For example, surveyors,
researchers, and other field employees often need to store PII on laptops or removable media as part of
their jobs. Another example is the offsite storage of backup and archive data. PII located offsite could be
more vulnerable to unauthorized access or disclosure because it is more likely to be lost or stolen than PII
stored within the physical boundaries of the organization.

3.3      PII Confidentiality Impact Level Examples

The following examples illustrate how an organization might assign PII confidentiality impact levels to
specific instances of PII. The examples are intended to help organizations better understand the process
of considering the various impact level factors, and they are not a substitute for organizations analyzing
their own situations. Certain circumstances within any organization or specific system, such as the
context of use or obligation to protect, may cause different outcomes.

Obligation to protect is a particularly important factor that should be determined early in the
categorization process. Since obligation to protect confidentiality should always be made in consultation
with an organization‘s legal counsel and privacy officer, it is not addressed in the following examples.

3.3.1      Example 1: Incident Response Roster

A Federal government agency maintains an electronic roster of its computer incident response team
members. In the event that an IT staff member detects any kind of security breach, standard practice
requires that the staff member contact the appropriate people listed on the roster. Because this team may
need to coordinate closely in the event of an incident, the contact information includes names,
professional titles, office and work cell phone numbers, and work email addresses. The agency makes the
same types of contact information available to the public for all of its employees on its main web site.

Identifiability: The information directly identifies a small number of individuals using names, phone
numbers, and email addresses.

Quantity of PII: The information directly identifies fewer than twenty individuals.

Data field sensitivity: Although the roster is intended to be made available only to the team members,
the individuals‘ information included in the roster is already available to the public on the agency‘s web
site.

      Systems containing PII that are owned and/or maintained at contractor site for a Federal agency are subject to same controls
      and authorization requirements as if the systems were located at a Federal agency site. See NIST SP 800-37 Revision 1,
      Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems: A Security Life Cycle Approach,
