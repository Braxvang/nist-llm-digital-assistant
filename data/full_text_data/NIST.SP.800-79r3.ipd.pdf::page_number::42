       NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
       December 2023                                                                       and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

1263       Assessment and Authorization Life Cycle
1264   The authorization of a PCI or DPCI consists of four phases: (i) Initiation, (ii) Assessment, (iii)
1265   Authorization, and (iv) Monitoring. Each phase consists of tasks and subtasks to be carried out
1266   by the responsible officials (e.g., the DAO, assessor, EIMO, and issuing facility managers).
1267   Figure 5 provides a view of the authorization phases, including the tasks associated with each
1268   phase. A table of authorization phases, tasks, subtasks, and the official responsible for each is
1269   provided in Appendix H.

1272           Initiation Phase
1273   The initiation phase consists of three tasks: (i) preparation, (ii) resource identification, and (iii)
1274   operations plan analysis and acceptance. The primary purpose of this phase is to ensure that the
1275   issuer is prepared for the assessment, including having all resources and documentation in place.
1276   The other purpose of this phase is to include the DAO early in the process to ensure the success
1277   of the assessment and authorization.
1278           Task 1: Preparation
1279           The objectives of this task are to prepare for authorization by reviewing the operations
1280           plan and confirm that the plan is consistent with [FIPS201] and the template provided in
1281           Appendix D.
1282                    Subtask 1.1: Confirm that the operations of the issuer are fully described and
1283                    documented in their operations plan.
