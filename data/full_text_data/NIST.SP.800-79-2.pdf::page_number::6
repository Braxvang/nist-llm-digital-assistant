Special Publication 800-79-2                              Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card Issuers
                                                                           and Derived PIV Credential Issuers


This SP provides an assessment and authorization methodology for verifying that issuers are
adhering to standards and implementation directives developed under [HSPD-12]. The salient
features of the methodology are:

    (i)       Controls derived from specific requirements in FIPS 201-2 and relevant documents
              for PIV Card issuer (PCI) and Derived PIV Credential issuer (DPCI);
    (ii)      Procedures for verifying and monitoring adherence to the requirements through an
              assessment of the implementation of the controls (control assessment); and
    (iii)     Guidance for evaluating the result of an assessment in order to arrive at the
              accreditation decision.

Authorizing an issuer based on the assessment and authorization methodology in this document
establishes the reliability of the issuer.

Authorization is the basis for establishing trust in an issuer and requires that the assessment be
thorough and comprehensive. Careful planning, preparation, and commitment of time, energy,
and resources are required. These guidelines are designed to assist agencies in creating the
needed roles, assigning responsibilities, developing an acceptable operations plan, drawing the
issuer’s authorization boundary, evaluating the findings of all control assessments, and making a
proper authorization decision. Realizing that organizations may vary significantly in how they
choose to structure their operations, these guidelines have been developed to support
organizational flexibility, and are designed to minimize the effort needed to assess, authorize,
and monitor the reliability of the issuer.

In addition to flexibility and efficiency, the authorization methodology defined in these
guidelines generates assessment findings and resulting authorization decisions that are consistent
and repeatable. These characteristics provide assurance to an organization’s management that
when an issuer has been authorized based on these guidelines they can be trusted as a provider of
secure and reliable identification credentials as required by [HSPD-12].

This document shall be used by both small and large organizations and can be applied whether
issuance processes are:
          Centrally located;
          Geographically dispersed; or
          Outsourced in varying degrees to another organization(s) or service provider(s).
