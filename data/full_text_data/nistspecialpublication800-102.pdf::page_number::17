           •   Verifies SIGA(M) using entity A’s public signature verification key
               (SIGA(M) was received in the TSP within D),
           •   Verifies timestamp_signatureTTA using the TTA’s public signature
               verification key, and
           •   Verifies SIGA(M, TSP) using entity A’s public signature verification key.
       Note that the order of performing these steps is irrelevant; it is only important that
       all verifications are successful.
Because of the verifications performed in step 4, entity B knows (and/or has assurance
of) the following:
   a. M and SIGA (M) were generated before the time indicated by the TSP’s
      timestamp, and SIGA(M) was included in the timestamped_data that was signed
      by the TTA.
   b. M has remained unchanged since the time indicated by the timestamp in the TSP.
   c. SIGA(M, TSP) was generated at some time after the time indicated by the
      timestamp in the TSP.
   d. D was assembled after the time indicated by the timestamp in the TSP.
If a more precise time is required for the generation of SIGA(M, TSP), a second trusted
timestamp may be acquired (as specified in Section 4.4) that will provide assurance that
SIGA(M, TSP) was generated by (at least) the time indicated in the second timestamp.

4.3.4 A Digital Signature on M is Provided to the TTA by Entity B
Entity B may provide a digital signature to the TTA that was received from entity A as
shown in Figure 4.
   1. Entity A signs M, assembles D and                                                          TTA
      sends it to Entity B:
                                                                                  2. SIGA(M), other_info

                 D = M, SIGA(M)
       Entity B may verify SIGA(M) upon
       receipt using entity A’s public
       signature verification key, and may
                                                                                                           3. TSP




       record the (approximate) time that the
       signature was received from Entity A
       for his or her own purposes.
   2. Entity B sends SIGA(M) (and possibly
      other information) to the TTA in a
      timestamp request, i.e.,                              1. D = M, SIGA(M)
                                                     A                                                     B
      user_supplied_info = SIGA(M),
      other_info. Note that the other_info
      may be Null.                                       Figure 4: Entity B Provides a
