Information Technology Security Training Requirements




          INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SECURITY TRAINING MATRIX                                — Cell 3.1 C
 Training Area: System Life Cycle Security                       —   Initiation
 Functional Specialty: Design & Develop

 Definition      —         The system life cycle is a model for building and operating an IT system
                           from its initial inception to its termination and disposal of assets. The
                           model includes six phases: Initiation, Development, Test and Evaluation,
                           Implementation, Operations, and Termination. Life cycle security is the
                           ensemble of processes and procedures which ensures data confidentiality, as
                           needed, as well as data and system integrity, and availability.


                           The initiation phase is the series of steps followed to ensure that security
                           requirements are considered and resolved as new information systems and
                           technologies are planned.

 Behavioral Outcome             —     Individuals responsible for the design and development of IT
                                      systems are able to translate IT security requirements into system-
                                      level security specifications.
