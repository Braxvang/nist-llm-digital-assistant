5.1.1. Impacts of Choosing a Cybersecurity Strategy
By consciously choosing to develop and implement a cybersecurity strategy, an organization
establishes a disciplined approach that considers all aspects of the system life cycle – from
procurement to decommissioning – with cybersecurity in mind. As a result, the organization can
ensure that cybersecurity goals are realized in its systems.
Decisions on cybersecurity strategy should flow from a high-level understanding of the
operations, objectives, and cybersecurity goals of the organization. For example, the organization
may want its systems to display certain characteristics, such as resiliency or trustworthiness. The
strategy provides a framework for incorporating those characteristics into the final systems. The
strategy can also include additional considerations, such as the flexibility to adopt new
technologies (e.g., crypto agility, artificial intelligence [AI] and machine learning [ML]
technologies, digital twins). Finally, the strategy can state the need for sound cybersecurity
practices, such as patching or monitoring.
The cybersecurity strategy should directly impact the architectural decisions made for systems.
The existence of an architecture informed by a cybersecurity strategy increases the likelihood
that high-level cybersecurity goals will be reflected in the cybersecurity of individual systems.
The strategy provides a document and reminder of those goals when decisions are being made at
the system level.
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            OT assets often have long life cycles and reflect massive investments in
            operational, reliability, and safety testing. It is sometimes neither
            economically nor technically feasible to replace existing equipment and
            applications wholesale with newer alternatives in the short- or medium-
            term. Such equipment is at greater risk of attacks than equipment with
            the latest versions of security features and security updates. The adoption
            of a cybersecurity strategy can assist an organization in understanding
            the life cycle of its OT systems and adjusting its approaches to
            maintaining security.

5.1.2. Defense-in-Depth Strategy
Defense in depth is a multifaceted strategy that integrates people, technology, and operational
capabilities to establish variable barriers across multiple layers and dimensions of the
organization. Many cybersecurity architectures incorporate the principles of defense in depth. It
is considered best practice and integrates into numerous standards and regulatory frameworks.
The basic concepts are to prevent single points of failure in cybersecurity defenses and to assume
no single origin of threats. From this position, cybersecurity controls are organized to provide
layers of protection around the critical system and system components.
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            A defense-in-depth strategy is particularly useful in OT environments
            because it can focus attention and defensive mechanisms on critical
            functions. Additionally, the principles of defense in depth are flexible
