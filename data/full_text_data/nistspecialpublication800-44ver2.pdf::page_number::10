development, documentation, and implementation of policies, standards, procedures, and guidelines that
help to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information system resources. To ensure
the security of a Web server and the supporting network infrastructure, the following practices should be
implemented:

 Organization-wide information system security policy

 Configuration/change control and management

 Risk assessment and management

 Standardized software configurations that satisfy the information system security policy

 Security awareness and training

 Contingency planning, continuity of operations, and disaster recovery planning

 Certification and accreditation.

Organizations should ensure that Web server operating systems are deployed, configured, and
managed to meet the security requirements of the organization.

The first step in securing a Web server is securing the underlying operating system. Most commonly
available Web servers operate on a general-purpose operating system. Many security issues can be
avoided if the operating systems underlying Web servers are configured appropriately. Default hardware
and software configurations are typically set by manufacturers to emphasize features, functions, and ease
of use, at the expense of security. Because manufacturers are not aware of each organization’s security
needs, each Web server administrator must configure new servers to reflect their organization’s security
requirements and reconfigure them as those requirements change. Using security configuration guides or
checklists can assist administrators in securing systems consistently and efficiently. Securing an
operating system initially would generally include the following steps:

 Patch and upgrade the operating system

 Remove or disable unnecessary services and applications

 Configure operating system user authentication

 Configure resource controls

 Install and configure additional security controls

 Perform security testing of the operating system.

Organizations should ensure that the Web server application is deployed, configured, and managed
to meet the security requirements of the organization.

In many respects, the secure installation and configuration of the Web server application will mirror the
operating system process discussed above. The overarching principle is to install the minimal amount of
Web server services required and eliminate any known vulnerabilities through patches or upgrades. If the
installation program installs any unnecessary applications, services, or scripts, they should be removed
