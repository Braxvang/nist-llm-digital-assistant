       of Service (ToS) bits to send VOIP traffic through before less time urgent data
       traffic. VOIP phones often also include QoS features [13].

       Not only is the available bandwidth of the system affected by the introduction of
       security measures, but in addition the effective bandwidth of the VOIP system is
       significantly depreciated. Effective bandwidth is defined by Barbieri et al. [8] as
       “the percentage of bandwidth carrying actual data with regard to the total
       bandwidth used.” The introduction of IPsec or other forms of encryption results
       in a much larger header to payload ratio for each packet, and this reduces the
       effective bandwidth as the same number of packets (but larger sized) are used to
       transport the same amount of data. The consequences of this reduction include
       decreased throughput and increased latency.


 3.5   The Need for Speed

       The key to conquering QoS issues like latency and bandwidth congestion is
       speed. By definition, faster throughput means reduced latency and
       probabilistically reduces the chances of severe bandwidth congestion. Thus every
       facet of network traversal must be completed quickly in VOIP. The latency often
       associated with tasks in data networks will not be tolerated. Chief among these
       latency producers that must improve performance are firewall/NAT traversal and
       traffic encryption/decryption. Traditionally, these are two of the most effective
       ways for administrators to secure their networks. However, they are also two of
       the greatest contributors to network congestion and throughput delay. Inserting
       traditional firewall and encryption products into a VOIP network is not feasible,
       particularly when VOIP is integrated into existing data networks. Instead, these
       data-network solutions must be adapted to support security in the new fast paced
       world of VOIP. The next several chapters explore the resolution of the conflict
       between the speed demands of QoS and the slowdown associated with these
       traditional security measures.

 3.6   Power Failure and Backup Systems

       Conventional telephones operate on 48 volts supplied by the telephone line itself.
       This is why home telephones continue to work even during a power failure. Most
       offices use PBX systems with their conventional telephones, and PBXs require
       backup power systems so that they continue to operate during a power failure.
       These backup systems will continue to be required with VOIP, and in many cases
       will need to be expanded. An organization that provides uninterruptible power
       systems for its data network and desktop computers may have much of the power
       infrastructure needed to continue communication functions during power outages,
       but a careful assessment must be conducted to ensure that sufficient backup power
       is available for the office VOIP switch, as well as each desktop instrument.
       Costs may include electrical power to maintain UPS battery charge, periodic
       maintenance costs for backup power generation systems, and cost of UPS battery
       replacement. If emergency/backup power is required for more than a few hours,
