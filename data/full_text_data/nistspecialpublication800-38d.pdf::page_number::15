5     Elements of GCM

The elements of GCM and the associated notation and requirements are introduced in the three
sections below. The underlying block cipher and key are discussed in Sec. 5.1. The data
elements of the authenticated encryption and authenticated decryption functions of GCM are
discussed in Sec. 5.2. The cryptographic primitives for confidentiality and authentication within
these two functions are discussed in Sec. 5.3.

5.1   Block Cipher

The operations of GCM depend on the choice of an underlying symmetric key block cipher and
thus can be considered a mode of operation (mode, for short) of the block cipher. The GCM key
is the block cipher key (the key, for short).

For any given key, the underlying block cipher of the mode consists of two functions that are
inverses of each other. The choice of the block cipher includes the designation of one of the two
functions of the block cipher as the forward cipher function, as in the specification of the AES
algorithm in Ref. [2]. GCM does not employ the inverse cipher function.

The forward cipher function is a permutation on bit strings of a fixed length; the strings are
called blocks. The length of a block is called the block size. The key is denoted K, and the
resulting forward cipher function of the block cipher is denoted CIPHK.

The underlying block cipher shall be approved, the block size shall be 128 bits, and the key size
shall be at least 128 bits. The key shall be generated uniformly at random, or close to uniformly
at random, i.e., so that each possible key is (nearly) equally likely to be generated.
Consequently, the key will be fresh, i.e., unequal to any previous key, with high probability. The
key shall be secret and shall be used exclusively for GCM with the chosen block cipher.
Additional requirements on the establishment and management of keys are discussed in Sec. 8.1.

5.2   Two GCM Functions

The two functions that comprise GCM are called authenticated encryption and authenticated
decryption. The authenticated encryption function encrypts the confidential data and computes
an authentication tag on both the confidential data and any additional, non-confidential data. The
authenticated decryption function decrypts the confidential data, contingent on the verification of
the tag.

An implementation may restrict the input to the non-confidential data, i.e., without any
confidential data. The resulting variant of GCM is called GMAC. For GMAC, the authenticated
encryption and decryption functions become the functions for generating and verifying an
authentication tag on the non-confidential data.

The requirements and notation for the input and output data of these functions are discussed in
Secs. 5.2.1 and 5.2.2. Algorithms for computing these functions are given in Sec. 7.
