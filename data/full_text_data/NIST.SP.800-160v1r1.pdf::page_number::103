translate into an increase in the cost of personnel, methods, and tools required to complete rigorous
engineering activities or an increase in schedule to accomplish the activities with the expected rigor. Any
increased cost that may occur can be justified by acquiring confidence about system performance to limit
loss while also addressing the systemâ€™s ability to deliver the capability. Therefore, the rigor associated
with an engineering activity should be commensurate with the significance of the most adverse effect
associated with the activity.

E.6.    Commensurate Trustworthiness
Principle: A system element is trustworthy to a level commensurate with the most significant
adverse effect that results from a failure of that element.
Note: A trusted element continuously exhibits properties of trust during the time that it is depended upon
by other system elements. The degree of trustworthiness needed for a trusted element is determined by
those entities that depend on the element. Some basis is required to support decisions about trust and
trustworthiness. The basis includes expressing the trust that is to be placed in a system element,
expressing the trustworthiness that is exhibited by the element, and comparing the trustworthiness of
different system elements. This principle is particularly relevant when considering systems and elements
with complex chains of trust dependencies.

E.7.    Compositional Trustworthiness
Principle: The system design is trustworthy for each aggregate composition of interacting
system elements.
Note: The trustworthiness of an aggregate of composed system elements cannot be assumed based on the
trustworthiness assertions of each individual element in the aggregate. Further, the trustworthiness of an
aggregate of composed trustworthy system elements cannot be assumed to be equal to the trustworthiness
of the least trustworthy element in the aggregate. By definition, a system is a combination of interacting
system elements. Each system function results from the emergent behavior of a composed set of system
elements. Similarly, the trustworthiness of a composed set of system elements is an emergent property of
the composition. Therefore, the trustworthiness of the composed set of system elements (i.e., aggregate)
for a given system function must be determined by treating the aggregate as a single discrete element. The
compositional trustworthiness principle addresses how an argument can be made for system-level
trustworthiness given how the constituent elements of the system compose to form the system and do so
by adhering to the composition principles.

E.8.    Continuous Protection
Principle: The protection provided for a system element must be effective and uninterrupted
during the time that the protection is required.
Note: The protection capability must be uninterrupted across all relevant system states, modes, and
transitions for there to be assurance that the system can be effective in delivering the required capability
while controlling loss. Continuous protection requires adherence to the following principles:
