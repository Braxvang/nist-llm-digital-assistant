Mediated access is based on the interaction between an entity and a target system element and has two
aspects:
-   Access to the System Element: The requesting entity only has authorized access to a target system
    element.
-   Use of the System Element: The requesting entity is only allowed to perform authorized operations on
    the target system element.
Mediated access has two parts: (1) a policy-based access mediation decision and (2) the enforcement of
the access mediation decision. The access mediation decision may include conditional constraints that
further restrict access (e.g., role, time of day, system state or mode, or duration of operation). If access is
not sufficiently mediated, there is no possibility of limiting how system elements (including human and
machine elements) interact to ensure that only authorized behaviors and intended outcomes result.
Mediated access is achieved by an access mediation control mechanism. Seminal computer security work
has defined the reference validation mechanism as the generalized form of any mechanism that is an
implementation of the reference monitor concept (Section D.4.2). The reference monitor provides the
design assurance basis for demonstrating the trustworthiness of a mediated access control mechanism.
The essential design criteria (Section D.4.2) provide a refinement to extend the generalized reference
monitor concept. Mediated access may enforce the constraints described in the principles of Distributed
Privilege, Least Privilege, and Least Sharing.
As a predominant security function, mediating access may result in performance bottlenecks if not
designed and implemented correctly. The use of a least common mechanism is one means to help reduce
bottlenecks, an approach referred to as efficiently mediated access [21].

E.20. Minimal Trusted Elements
Principle: A system has as few trusted system elements as practicable.
Note: Minimizing trusted system elements is a cost-benefit trade space consideration employed for the
functional allocation of trust within the system. The need for trust is tied to the function provided by a
system element, and that need is independent of any distribution of trust across multiple elements in the
architecture. The trade decision is, therefore, how best to allocate trust to system elements given the
functions they provide and how the elements are best distributed throughout the architecture where
distribution is a justified need. Minimizing trusted system elements is one consideration in making that
decision.
Trusted elements are generally costlier to construct due to increased rigor in engineering processes and
activities. They also require more analysis to qualify their trustworthiness. Minimizing the number of
trusted system elements reduces the cost of analysis (i.e., decreases the size, scope, and complexity of the
analysis). When the minimization of trusted system elements considers the principle of Commensurate
Protection, the cost-effectiveness of the analysis is also ensured (i.e., cost of the analysis is justified by
the extent of trust required).
Historically, the analysis of interactions between trusted system elements and untrusted system elements
is one of the most important aspects of the trust-based verification of system security performance. If
these interactions are unnecessarily complex, the security of the system will also be more difficult to
ascertain than one whose internal trust relationships are simple and elegantly constructed. In general,
fewer trusted components will result in fewer internal trust relationships and a simpler system.
