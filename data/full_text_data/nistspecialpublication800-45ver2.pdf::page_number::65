The first two problems were addressed in Section 3, which discussed ways to protect messages. The third
problem can be resolved by applying the same method normally used to secure World Wide Web
(WWW) traffic â€“ the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol.

TLS is similar to the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol, upon which it is based, and can be used in
combination with POP, IMAP, and SMTP to encrypt communication between mail clients and servers.
RFC 2595 defines how to use TLS to combat communications eavesdropping, to implement secure
mailbox access and to further strengthen SMTP MTAs that incorporate SMTP AUTH. Figure 6.4 shows
a sample configuration that enables TLS support for newer versions of sendmail.

6.6     Enabling Web Access

Increasingly, organizations are providing Web browser-based access to their messaging systems.
Enabling this type of access could introduce security issues at both the client (see Section 8.4) and server.
Although Web site security is outside the scope of this document, there are several key concepts that
should be followed:

 Avoid placing the Web server on the same machine as the mail server.
 The authentication mechanism of the Web front-end should employ encryption.
 The Web server should use SSL/TLS to encrypt all communications with clients.
 As with any public server, the Web server should be hardened before connecting it to the network. 41
For some organizations, the processing requirements of dedicating a Web server to SSL/TLS
communication may not be possible to accommodate. In cases such as this, the initial authentication
should be encrypted.

Some organizations choose to use hardware appliances for their Web access solution. These appliances
not only provide secure Web-based access to mail servers, but they also provide firewall, content filtering,
and malware protection capabilities. The appliances typically are easier and faster to install and maintain
than creating Web servers, and they often use hardened operating systems with all non-essential
components disabled or removed, which limits the possible vulnerabilities the appliances might have.
Some appliances offer additional capabilities, such as offering administrators granular control over user
groups and access, performing SSL encryption for sessions, and terminating user sessions automatically
