         3.    Options 2 and 3 represent existing agency practice. Although Option 1 is now acceptable to the FBI, agencies
               may still need to implement Options 2 or 3 for transmission via the Office of Personnel Management.
For Options 1 and 2 the devices used for capture of the fingerprints shall have been certified by the FBI to conform to
Appendix F of the FBI’s Electronic Biometric Transmission Specification [EBTS, Appendix F]. For Option 3, a scan of
the inked card shall be performed to effect conversion to electronic form. The scanner shall be certified by the FBI as
being compliant with [EBTS, Appendix F]. The scanning is needed to produce fingerprints in the digital formats of
Sub-sections 3.3 and 3.4. The FBI specifications include width and height specifications for the imaging surface. The
native scanning resolution of the device shall be 197 pixels per centimeter (500 pixels per inch) in both the horizontal
and vertical directions. These specifications comply with the FBI submission requirements and with the Image
Acquisition Setting Level 31 of the Finger Image-Based Data Interchange Format standard, INCITS 381 [FINGSTD].
For live-scan acquisition i.e., options 1 and 2, the enrollment client software should display the images to the attending
operator. The operator should repeat acquisition if the ridge structure is not clear, broken, or incomplete in the
displayed images.
The procedure for the collection of fingerprints, presented in Table 3, shall be followed. The procedure shall employ
                                                        4
the NIST Fingerprint Image Quality [NFIQ] algorithm to initiate any needed reacquisition of the images. An attending
official shall be present at the time of fingerprint capture. The agency shall employ measures to ensure the quality of
acquisition and guard against faulty presentation, whether malicious or unintentional. Quality assessment might be
an integral function of the acquisition device or might be implemented by the attending official. In any case, the
agency shall ensure that the applicant does not swap finger positions or hands, occlude fingers, or misalign or
misplace the fingers. Particularly, because it is common during collection of multi-finger plain impressions for little
fingers (i.e., positions 05 and 10) to not be long enough to reach the imaging platen, it is accepted practice for the
hand to be placed at an angle to the horizontal to ensure imaging of all four fingers. Although this is not needed with
newer large-platen devices the official shall in all cases take care to image all fingers completely. The procedure
requires segmentation of the multi-finger plain impressions; this operation may be assisted by the attending official.

    Step Action
    1.   Attending official should start by inspecting fingers and require absence of dirt, coatings, gels, and other foreign material.
    2.        Official should ensure imaging surface of the sensor or the paper card is clean.
              Acquire fingerprints according to Option 1, 2, or 3 in Table 2. For Option 3, scan the inked card using [EBTS, Appendix F]
    3.
              certified scanner.
              Segment the multi-finger plain impression images into single-finger images. Automated segmentation is recommended.
    4.        Attending official should inspect the boundaries of the automatic segmentation and correct any failures, perhaps via an
              interactive graphical user interface.
                                   5
    5.        Compute NFIQ value for thumbs and index fingers. If all have NFIQ values 1, 2, or 3 (i.e., , good quality) then go to step 8.
    6.        Repeat steps 2-5 up to three more times.
              If after four acquisitions the index fingers and thumbs do not all have NFIQ values of 1, 2 or 3 then select that set, acquired
              in step 3 and segmented in step 4, for which the mean of the NFIQ values of the left index, right index, left thumb, and
    7.        right thumb is minimum (i.e., of best quality). If all of the index finger and thumb quality values are unavailable (perhaps
              because of injury to one or more of those fingers) then use the last set from step 3 of those fingers that are available,
              without any application of NFIQ.
    8.        Prepare and store the final records per Sub-sections 3.3 and 3.4


Ordinarily, all ten fingerprints shall be imaged in this process; however, if one or more fingers are not available (for
instance, because of amputation) then as many fingers as are available shall be imaged. When fewer than ten fingers
are collected, the FBI background transaction of Sub-section 3.4 requires field AMP 2.084 of the accompanying Type 2
record [see EBTS, Appendix C] to have labels indicating fingers that are amputated or otherwise not imaged.

    A second version of the NFIQ algorithm is expected 9/13. This should a) produce quality values that better predict accuracy, b)
    offer finer control of quality thresholds and c) offer additional capabilities. http://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/ig/development_nfiq_2.cfm

    Given an input image, NFIQ (version 1) returns a value from 1 (excellent) to 5 (bad).
