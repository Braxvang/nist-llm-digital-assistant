environment, individual tests may have additional logistical requirements such as submitting a visit
request for an external test team, shipping equipment to a facility to enable testing, and planning for local
or long-distance travel. These needs should be addressed on a case-by-case basis during the planning
process.

6.4.1   Assessor Selection and Skills

Assessors conduct examinations and tests using technical methods and techniques, such as those
described in this guide. Organizations should take care when selecting assessors, because properly vetted,
skilled, and experienced assessors will lower the risks involved in conducting security tests. Because
assessors may also require access to sensitive information on network architecture, security posture, and
weaknesses, some organizations may require background checks or security clearances. Organizations
should also be mindful of possible conflicts of interest, such as a single individual conducting a formal
assessment and being responsible for addressing the findings of that assessment.

Many organizations have dedicated internal assessment teams. Depending on an organization’s structure,
size, location, and available resources, these teams may be divided by geographical location or centralized
and deployed to various sites to conduct their assessments. Some teams address specific technical
competencies, such as wireless security testing, while other teams can address many areas of security in
varying levels of depth. For instance, a team may have among its members some individuals who are
capable of reviewing a system configuration, others who can use automated assessment tools to identify
known vulnerabilities, and still others who are able to actively exploit vulnerabilities to demonstrate
ineffective security measures.

Assessors should have significant security and networking knowledge, including expertise in network
security, firewalls, intrusion detection systems, operating systems, programming, and networking
protocols (such as TCP/IP). A wide range of technical skill sets is required to conduct testing in an
effective and efficient manner while ensuring minimal risk. Assessors should also be skilled in the
specific types of techniques being executed, such as vulnerability identification and verification, security
configuration, vulnerability management, and penetration testing. Operational experience is preferred to
classroom or laboratory training. Allowing inexperienced or untrained staff to conduct technical tests can
negatively affect an organization’s systems and networks, potentially hindering its mission and damaging
the credibility of its security program management office and assessors. It is also beneficial to have a
technical writer or other individual on the team with strong technical writing skills. This helps the team
to effectively convey the results of the assessment, particularly to less technical readers.

When assessments are performed by a team, the team leader facilitates the assessment process;
demonstrates an understanding of the organization’s environment and requirements; and (if applicable)
eases communication between the assessors and the organization’s security group. The team’s leader
should be selected based on overall technical knowledge and experience with the type of techniques being
executed, and knowledge of the assets being assessed. Team leaders should also have strong
communication, organization, planning, and conflict resolution skills.

The skills possessed by an assessment team should be balanced to provide a well-rounded view of the
organization’s security posture. For example, having an individual that specializes in perimeter defense is
helpful, but having a team full of people that specialize in perimeter defense is likely to be redundant
unless the testing’s sole focus is to determine the perimeter’s security posture. Ideally, a team is
assembled based on the individual requirements of the examinations and tests being conducted. System
characteristics may also be important—for instance, supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)
systems have a number of unique components with which a traditional security assessor may not be
familiar, reducing the assessor’s ability to safely and adequately test the security posture of those systems.
