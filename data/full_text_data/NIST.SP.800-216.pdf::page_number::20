       Determine Whether to Publish an Advisory
For every verified vulnerability, a determination must be made as to whether to issue an
advisory, the target audience of that advisory, and which advisory service should be used. An
advisory is typically issued when a remediation has been developed and deployed (e.g., when a
patch is released). However, extenuating circumstances may require more than one advisory. If a
temporary mitigation will prevent a vulnerability from being exploited, then an advisory
describing the mitigating steps should be issued with appropriate notation. When the
vulnerability can be remediated, an additional advisory should be issued.

2.7.1. Determine Whether Public Disclosure is Warranted
For each vulnerability identified in government systems, the VDPO in whose system the
vulnerability exists should determine whether or not public disclosure is warranted. If the
vulnerability exists in multiple agency systems, the FCB should coordinate the response and
publication with the stakeholders.
Public disclosure may be considered if:
   •   The specific vulnerability is not publicly known (i.e., does not have a CVE number);
   •   The vulnerable system is used by the public (i.e., outside of the Government);
   •   There is a risk that personally identifiable information (PII) or other sensitive information
       has been exposed;
   •   The specific vulnerability relates to a defect or flaw in the affected product, which could
       impact the security of users outside of the VDPO’s agency (especially if code is
       vulnerable); or
   •   The public is at risk of harm in some way or needs to take some action to secure
       themselves (e.g., install a patch, update software, or change their passwords).
Public disclosure may not be necessary or recommended if the vulnerability does not affect the
public. For example, publication is likely unnecessary if government staff have already fixed the
vulnerable system and have found no evidence that the vulnerability was exploited. Advisory
systems can then focus on vulnerabilities that require user action for continued security and
privacy.
If the use of commercial or open-source software is responsible for a vulnerability within
government systems, then the FCB should work toward the creation of a public advisory for the
vulnerable software. This advisory may not be published using a specific government system
advisory service but rather one that addresses software industry vulnerabilities (e.g., the CVE
list). The FCB should consider releasing a separate government advisory if the public was
affected by the existence of the vulnerabilities in government systems (e.g., sensitive information
was leaked, or a patch needs to be applied).
In some cases, a reporter will advise the Government about a vulnerability for which it is not
appropriate to create an official advisory. This may preclude them from receiving public credit
for the service provided. In these rare cases, a bug bounty program with publicly accessible logs
