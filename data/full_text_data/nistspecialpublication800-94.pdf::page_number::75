                                                  GUIDE TO INTRUSION DETECTION AND PREVENTION SYSTEMS (IDPS)



7.1.3    Agent Locations

Host-based IDPS agents are most commonly deployed to critical hosts such as publicly accessible servers
and servers containing sensitive information. However, because agents are available for various server
and desktop/laptop operating systems, as well as specific server applications, organizations could
potentially deploy agents to most of their servers and desktops/laptops. Some organizations use host-
based IDPS agents primarily to analyze activity that cannot be monitored by other security controls. For
example, network-based IDPS sensors cannot analyze the activity within encrypted network
communications, but host-based IDPS agents installed on endpoints can see the unencrypted activity.
Organizations should consider the following additional criteria when selecting agent locations:

 The cost to deploy, maintain, and monitor the agents
 The OSs and applications supported by the agents
 The importance of the host’s data or services
 The ability of the infrastructure to support the agents (e.g., sufficient network bandwidth to transfer
  alert data from the agents to centralized servers and to transfer software and policy updates from the
  centralized servers to the agents).
7.1.4    Host Architectures

To provide intrusion prevention capabilities, most IDPS agents alter the internal architecture of the hosts
on which they are installed. This is typically done through a shim, which is a layer of code placed
between existing layers of code. A shim intercepts data at a point where it would normally be passed
from one piece of code to another. The shim can then analyze the data and determine whether or not it
should be allowed or denied. Host-based IDPS agents may use shims for several types of resources,
including network traffic, filesystem activity, system calls, Windows registry activity, and common
applications (e.g., e-mail, Web).

Some host-based IDPS agents do not alter the host architecture. Instead, they monitor activity without
shims, or they analyze the artifacts of activity, such as log entries and file modifications. Although less
intrusive to the host, reducing the possibility of the IDPS interfering with the host’s normal operations,
these methods are also generally less effective at detecting threats and often cannot perform any
prevention actions.

One of the important decisions in selecting a host-based IDPS solution is whether to install agents on
hosts or use agent-based appliances. From a detection and prevention perspective, installing agents on
hosts is generally preferable because the agents have direct access to the hosts’ characteristics, often
allowing them to perform more comprehensive and accurate detection and prevention. However, agents
often support only a few common OSs; if a host does not use a supported OS, an appliance can be
deployed instead. Another reason to use an appliance instead of installing an agent on a host is
performance; if an agent would negatively impact the performance of the monitored host too much, it
might be necessary to offload the agent’s functions to an appliance.

7.2     Security Capabilities

Host-based IDPSs provide a variety of security capabilities. Sections 7.2.1 through 7.2.4 describe
common security capabilities, divided into four categories: logging, detection, prevention, and other,
respectively.
