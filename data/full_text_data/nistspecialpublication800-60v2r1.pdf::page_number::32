C.2 Rationale and Factors for Services Delivery Support Information
Services delivery support functions provide the critical policy, programmatic, and managerial
foundation to support Federal government operations. Security objectives and impact levels for
service delivery support information and systems are generally determined by the natures of the
supported direct services and constituencies being supported. If a system stores, processes, or
communicates national security information, it is defined as a national security system, and is
outside the scope of this guideline. 12 Service delivery support activities are defined in this
section.

C.2.1 Controls and Oversight

Controls and Oversight information is used to ensure that the operations and programs of the
Federal government and its external business partners comply with applicable laws and
regulations and prevent waste, fraud, and abuse.
C.2.1.1 Corrective Action Information Type

Corrective Action involves the enforcement functions necessary to remedy programs that have
been found non-compliant with a given law, regulation, or policy. The recommended security
categorization for the corrective action information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of corrective action
information on the ability of responsible agencies to remedy internal or external programs that
have been found non-compliant with a given law, regulation, or policy. Unauthorized disclosure
of most corrective action information should have only a limited adverse effect on agency
operations, assets, or individuals.


11
   The confidentiality impact assigned to the Information Management Information Type may necessitate the highest
   confidentiality impact of the information types processed by the system.
12
    A national security system is any information system (including any telecommunications system) used or
operated by an agency or by a contractor on behalf of an agency, or any other organization on behalf of an agency â€“
(i) the function, operation, or use of which: involves intelligence activities; involves cryptologic activities related to
national security; involves command and control of military forces; involves equipment that is an integral part of a
weapon or weapon system; or is critical to the direct fulfillment of military or intelligence missions (excluding a
routine administrative or business applications system used for applications such as payroll, finance, logistics, and
personnel management); or (ii) that processes classified information.
