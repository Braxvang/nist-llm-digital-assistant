                                     Table B-2 Mapping of Key Types

The key reference specifications in Section 5.1 of [SP800-73Part1] are applicable to the corresponding
keys included in the Derived PIV Application (mapped per the table above) except for the following:

       References to “PIV Card Application” are replaced by “Derived PIV Application”

       References in the “Security Conditions for Use” column to “PIN or OCC” are replaced by
        “Derived PIV Application Password”

B.1.4.2      Derived PIV Application Cryptographic Algorithm and Mechanism Identifiers

The algorithm identifiers for the cryptographic algorithms that may be recognized on the Derived PIV
Application interfaces are the asymmetric and symmetric identifiers specified in Table 6-2 and Table 6-3
of [SP800-78]. The cryptographic mechanism identifiers that may be recognized on the Derived PIV
Application interfaces are those specified in Table 5 of [SP800-73Part1] .

B.1.4.3      Derived PIV Application Status Words

The status words that may be returned on the Derived PIV Application command interface are as
specified in Section 5.6 of [SP800-73Part1] .

B.1.5     Derived PIV Authentication Mechanisms

The Derived PIV Application supports the following validation steps:

       Credential Validation (CredV) through verification of the certificates retrieved from the Derived
        PIV Application and checking of the revocation status of these certificates.

       Derived PIV Application Holder Validation (HolderV) through matching the password provided
        by the token holder with the password within the Derived PIV Application.

The Derived PIV Application facilitates a single authentication mechanism, which is a cryptographic
challenge and response authentication protocol using the Derived PIV Authentication private key as
described in Appendix B.1.2 of [SP800-73Part1] with the following translations:

       References to “PIV Application” are replaced by “Derived PIV Application.”

       References to “PIV Auth Certificate” are replaced by “Derived PIV Authentication Certificate.”

       References to “PIV Card App ID” are replaced with “Derived PIV Application ID.”
