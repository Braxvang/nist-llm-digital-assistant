NIST SP 800-85A-4                                       PIV CARD APPLICATION & MIDDLEWARE
                                                                 INTERFACE TEST GUIDELINES

                      14. If the card supports the Cardholder Iris Images data
                          object, repeat step 1 with
                          • Data field in the command is to include the tag of the
                             Cardholder Iris Images data object
                          • Data field in the command is to include the data
                             content that will replace the Cardholder Iris Images
                             data object
                      15. If the card supports secure messaging for non-card-
                          management operations, repeat step 1 with
                          • Data field in the command is to include the tag of the
                             Secure Messaging Certificate Signer data object
                          • Data field in the command is to include the data
                             content that will replace the Secure Messaging
                             Certificate Signer object
                      16. If the card supports the virtual contact interface,
                          repeat step 1 with
                          • CLA = '00'
                          • Data field in the command is to include the tag of the
                             Pairing Code Reference Data Container data object
                          • Data field in the command is to include the data
                             content that will replace the Code Reference Data
                             Container data object
                      17. If the card supports OCC, repeat step 1 with
                          • CLA = '00'
                          • Data field in the command is to include the tag of the
                             Biometric Information Templates Group Template object
                          • Data field in the command is to include the data
                             content that will replace the Biometric Information
                             Templates Group Template data object
                      NOTE: The following tests are to be performed only if the PIV
                      Card Application supports the use of the '9B' key
                      18. Perform mutual authentication of PIV Card Application and
                          the Test Toolkit Application using steps 5a and 5b of
                          C.2.4.1 (GENERAL AUTHENTICATE)
                      19. Repeat steps 1-16 with GET DATA command immediately
                          following each PUT DATA and verifying whether the same
                          data that is input with PUT DATA command is returned by
                          GET DATA command
 Expected Result(s)   1. In steps 1 through 16, commands return '69 82' (security status
                         not satisfied).
                      2. The two test invocations referred to in step 18 should return the
                         same responses as 5a and 5b of Expected Results under test
                         C.2.4.1.
                      3. In step 19, all commands return '90 00', and input and output
                         data strings match.
 Postcondition(s)     The contents of each object have been overwritten with the new
                      values provided in step 19.
