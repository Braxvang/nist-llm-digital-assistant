                           IT Security ABC's       — Terms and Concepts
   •   Assets   — Assets
                       are something of value that requires protection. The value of an asset may be
       monetary or non-monetary. For example, a computer system clearly has a monetary value that
       may be expressed in terms of its cost of acquisition or replacement. Data, however, is an asset
       that may have a monetary value (the cost to acquire), a non-monetary value (loss of public
       confidence regarding data accuracy), or both.

   •   Backup   — Backup     for data and/or processes are critical safeguards in any IT security
       environment. The concept of backup includes creation and testing of disaster recovery and
       continuity of operations plans as well as preparation of copies of data files that are stored "out
       of harm's way."
   •   Countermeasures and Controls      — Countermeasures,     controls, and safeguards are terms that are
       often used synonymously.      They refer to the procedures and techniques used to prevent the
       occurrence of a security incident, detect when an incident is occurring or has occurred, and
       provide the capability to respond to or recover from a security incident.     A safeguard may be a
       password for a user identifier, a backup plan that provides for offsite storage of copies of
       critical files, audit trails that allow association of specific actions to individuals, or any of a
       number of other technical or procedural techniques. Basically, a safeguard is intended to
       protect the assets and availability of IT systems.

   •   DAA and Other Officials — Individuals are responsible for allocating resources. Resources             •




       may be allocated to address IT security issues or any of a number of other competing
       organizational needs. The individual who has such authority for a specific IT system may be
       termed a Designated Accrediting Authority (DAA), Approving Authority, Authorizing Official,
       Recommending Official, or other titles specific to an organization. Whatever the title, the
       individual who has the authority to allocate resources is also responsible for balancing risks and
       costs and accepting any residual risks in making those decisions.       The accrediting authorities
       are often helped in these decisions by certifying authorities who provide assessments of the
       technical adequacy of the current security environment and recommendations for resolving
       deficiencies or weaknesses.

   •   Ethics   —   the body of rules that governs an individual's behavior.   It is a product of that

       individual's life experiences and forms a basis for deciding what is right and wrong when
       making decisions. In today's environment, ethics are, unfortunately, situational (i.e., an
       individual's definition of what is right and wrong changes depending on the nature of a
       particular situation). For example, an individual may believe that it is wrong to break into
       someone's house, but does not think that it is wrong to break into someone's computer system.
