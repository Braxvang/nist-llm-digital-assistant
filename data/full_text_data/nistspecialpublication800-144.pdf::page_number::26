            1974, the E-Government Act of 2002 and its accompanying OMB guidance, and the
            Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002. 11 Also of importance
            are National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) statutes, including the
            Federal Records Act (44 U.S.C. Chapters 21, 29, 31, 33) and NARA regulations (Title 36
            of the Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter XII, Subchapter B).

            The Clinger-Cohen Act assigns responsibilities for the efficiency, security, and privacy of
            computer systems within the federal government and establishes a comprehensive
            approach for executive agencies to improve the acquisition and management of their
            information resources. As part of OMBâ€™s responsibilities under the Clinger-Cohen act,
            various circulars have been issued. Circular A-130 establishes policy for the
            management of Federal information resources, including procedural and analytic
            guidelines for implementing specific aspects of these policies. Appendix III of A-130
            requires that adequate security is provided for all agency information that is collected,
            processed, transmitted, stored, or disseminated in general support systems and major
            applications.

            The Privacy Act governs the collection, maintenance, use, and dissemination of
            information about individuals that is maintained in systems of records by federal agencies
            and can be retrieved by a personal identifier (e.g., name). It requires each agency to
            publish notice of its systems of records (i.e., a system of records notice (SORN)) in the
            Federal Register and to allow individuals to request access to and correction of their
            records and information. The E-Government Act of 2002, among other things, requires
            federal agencies to complete a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) on all new or
            substantially changed technology that collects, maintains, or disseminates PII, and to
            make the results publicly available. M-03-22, OMB Guidance for Implementing the
            Privacy Provisions of the E-Government Act of 2002, provides direction to agencies on
            conducting PIAs. A PIA is a structured review of an information system to identify and
            mitigate privacy risks, including risks to confidentiality, at every stage of the system
            lifecycle. It can also serve as a tool for individuals working on a program or accessing a
            system to understand how to best integrate privacy protections when working with PII.

            FISMA requires federal agencies to adequately protect their information and information
            systems against unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or
            destruction [HR2458]. That mandate includes protecting information systems used or
            operated by an agency or by a contractor of an agency or other organization on behalf of
            an agency. That is, any external provider handling federal information or operating
            information systems on behalf of the federal government must meet the same security
            requirements as the source federal agency. The security requirements also apply to
            external subsystems storing, processing, or transmitting federal information and any
            services provided by, or associated with, the subsystem.
