     NIST SP 800-171r3 fpd (Final Public Draft)                                          Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information
     November 2023

31   The security requirements in this publication are only applicable to components of nonfederal
32   systems that process, store, or transmit CUI or that provide protection for such components. 9 The
33   requirements are intended for use by federal agencies in contractual vehicles or other agreements
34   that are established between those agencies and nonfederal organizations.

35   Appropriately scoping requirements is an important factor in determining protection-related
36   investment decisions and managing security risks for nonfederal organizations. If nonfederal
37   organizations designate specific system components for the processing, storage, or transmission
38   of CUI, those organizations may limit the scope of the security requirements by isolating the
39   designated system components in a separate CUI security domain. Isolation can be achieved by
40   applying architectural and design concepts (e.g., implementing subnetworks with firewalls or
41   other boundary protection devices and using information flow control mechanisms). Security
42   domains may employ physical separation, logical separation, or a combination of both. This
43   approach can provide adequate security for CUI and avoid increasing the organization’s security
44   posture beyond what it requires for protecting its missions, operations, and assets.

45            Organization of This Publication
46   The remainder of this special publication is organized as follows:
47        •    Section 2 describes the assumptions and methodology used to develop the security
48             requirements for protecting the confidentiality of CUI, the format of the requirements,
49             and the tailoring criteria applied to the NIST standards and guidelines to obtain the
50             requirements.
51        •    Section 3 lists the security requirements for protecting the confidentiality of CUI in
52             nonfederal systems and organizations.

53   The following sections provide additional information to support the protection of CUI in
54   nonfederal systems and organizations:
