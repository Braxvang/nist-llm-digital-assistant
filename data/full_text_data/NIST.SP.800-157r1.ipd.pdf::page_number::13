      NIST SP 800-157r1 ipd                             Derived PIV Credentials (Initial Public Draft)
      January 2023


303       • Represented in the PIV identity account at the home agency, and
304       • Issued in accordance with this document.
305   This document provides technical guidelines on:
306       • The primary lifecycle activities for the derived PIV credential — initial issuance,
307         maintenance, and termination — and the requirements for each activity to ensure
308         security and
309       • The derived PIV credential, including cryptographic specifications, types of
310         implementation that are permitted, mechanisms for activation and use of the
311         credential, and certificate policies if applicable.
312   This publication also includes an informative annex that provides recommendations for
313   the inclusion of digital signature and key management keys on devices that host a derived
314   PIV credential.

315   1.3. Audience
316   This document is intended for stakeholders who will be responsible for procuring,
317   designing, implementing, and managing deployments of derived PIV credentials for
318   mobile devices and other endpoints.

319   1.4. Requirements Notation and Conventions
320   This standard uses the following typographical conventions in text:
321       • Specific terms in CAPITALS represent normative requirements. When these same
322         terms are not in CAPITALS , the term does not represent a normative requirement.
323            – The terms “ SHALL ” and “ SHALL NOT ” indicate requirements to be strictly
324              followed in order to conform to the publication and from which no deviation is
325              permitted.
326            – The terms “ SHOULD ” and “ SHOULD NOT ” indicate that among several
327              possibilities, one is recommended as particularly suitable without mentioning
328              or excluding others, that a certain course of action is preferred but not
329              necessarily required, or that (in the negative form) a certain possibility or
330              course of action is discouraged but not prohibited.
331            – The terms “ MAY ” and “ NEED NOT ” indicate a course of action permissible
332              within the limits of the publication.
333            – The terms “ CAN ” and “ CANNOT ” indicate a possibility and capability —
334              whether material, physical, or causal — or, in the negative, the absence of that
335              possibility or capability.
