                                                            CLOUD COMPUTING SYNOPSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



 Network dependency (public). In the public scenario, consumers connect to providers via the public
  Internet. The dependability of connections thus depends on the Internet's infrastructure of Domain
  Name System (DNS) servers, the router infrastructure, and the inter-router links. The reliability of
  connections can thus be affected by misconfiguration [Opp03] or failure of these components as well
  as network congestion or attack. Additionally, consumers require a connection via an Internet
  Service Provider, often designated the "last mile." This connection must also be functional for the
  cloud to be accessible.
 Workload locations are hidden from clients (public). In the public scenario, a provider may
  migrate a consumer's workload, whether processing or data, at any time. One of the central
  arguments for cost efficiency in public cloud computing is that data centers (and hence workloads)
  can be located where costs are low. Generally, workloads in a public cloud may be relocated
  anywhere at any time unless the provider has offered (optional) location restriction policies and the
  consumer has configured their account to request specific location restrictions. Generally, location
  restrictions in a public cloud are somewhat coarse grained (e.g., the east coast of the US). The
  confidence that restrictions are actually enforced rests upon protection of consumer credentials (e.g.,
  that the account has not been hijacked and had its location preferences changed) and the faithfulness
  with which the provider implements the advertised policies. Generally, consumers are not in a
  position to verify that location restrictions have been enforced.
 Risks from multi-tenancy (public). In a public cloud, a single machine may be shared by the
  workloads of any combination of consumers. In practice, this means that a consumer's workload may
  be co-resident with the workloads of competitors or adversaries. As summarized in the general case,
  this introduces both reliability and security risk. A failure could occur or an attack could be
  perpetrated by any consumer. Scaling to larger sets of consumers and resources is one of the
  important strategies for public clouds to achieve low costs and elasticity; if this scaling is achieved,
  however, it also implies a large collection of potential attackers.
 Limited visibility and control over data regarding security (public). The details of provider
  system operation are usually considered proprietary information and are not divulged to consumers.
  In many cases, the software employed by a provider is proprietary and likely not available for
  examination by consumers. Consequently, consumers do not (at the time of this writing) have a
  guaranteed way to monitor or authorize access to their resources in the cloud. Although providers
  may make strong efforts to carry out the requests of consumers and some may provide monitoring
  services, consumers must either trust that the provider is performing operations with fidelity or, if the
  provider has contracted with a third party auditing organization, trust that the auditing is accurate and
  timely. As an example of this limitation, a consumer cannot currently verify that data has been
  completely deleted from a provider's systems.
 Low up-front costs to migrate into the cloud (public). The implications appear to be the same as
  for the outsourced private cloud scenario.
 Elasticity: illusion of unlimited resource availability (public). Public clouds are generally
  unrestricted in their location or size. Additionally, they can generally use multi-tenancy without
  being limited by static security perimeters, which allows a potentially high degree of flexibility in the
  movement of consumer workloads to correspond with available resources. As a consequence, public
  clouds have unique advantages in achieving elasticity, or the illusion (to consumers) of unlimited
  resource availability.
 Restrictive default service level agreements (public). The default service level agreements of
  public clouds specify limited promises that providers make to subscribers, limit the remedies
  available to subscribers, and outline subscriber obligations in obtaining such remedies.
