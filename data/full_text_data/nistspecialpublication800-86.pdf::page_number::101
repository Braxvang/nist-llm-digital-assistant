                                              GUIDE TO INTEGRATING FORENSIC TECHNIQUES INTO INCIDENT RESPONSE



Appendix B—Scenarios

Tabletop exercises that focus on how forensic tools and techniques can be used in various scenarios
provide an inexpensive and effective way of building and maintaining skills and identifying problems
with guidelines, procedures, and policies. The exercise participants review a brief scenario and are then
asked several questions related to the scenario. The participants discuss each question and formulate an
answer based on what they would really do in the situation. The response is then compared with the
organization’s policies, procedures, and guidelines to identify any discrepancies or deficiencies. For
example, the answer to one question might indicate that forensic actions would be delayed because a
participant lacked a particular piece of software and a particular team within the organization did not
provide off-hours support.

Section B.1 contains a list of general questions that could be applied to almost any scenario. Section B.2
contains several sample scenarios, some of which are followed by additional scenario-specific questions.
Organizations are encouraged to adapt these questions and scenarios for use in their own exercises.

B.1       Scenario Questions

      1. What are the potential sources of data?

      2. Of the potential sources of data, which are the most likely to contain helpful information and
         why?

      3. Which data source would be checked first and why?

      4. Which forensic tools and techniques would most likely be used? Which other tools and
         techniques might also be used?

      5. Which groups and individuals within the organization would probably be involved in the forensic
         activities?

      6. What communications with external parties might occur, if any?

      7. From a forensic standpoint, what would be done differently if the scenario had occurred on a
         different day or at a different time (regular hours versus off-hours)?

      8. From a forensic standpoint, what would be done differently if the scenario had occurred at a
         different physical location (onsite versus offsite)?

B.2       Scenarios

Scenario 1: Possible DDoS Attack

On a Saturday afternoon, external users start having problems accessing the organization’s public Web
sites. Over the next hour, the problem worsens to the point where nearly every attempt to access any of
the organization’s public Web sites fails. Meanwhile, a member of the organization’s networking staff
responds to automatically generated alerts from an Internet border router and determines that much of the
organization’s Internet bandwidth is being consumed by an unusually large volume of User Datagram
Protocol (UDP) packets to and from both of the organization’s public Domain Name System (DNS)
servers.
