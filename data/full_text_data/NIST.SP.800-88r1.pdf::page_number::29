NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1                                                Guidelines for Media Sanitization


           addressing is one thousand. Select at least two non-overlapping pseudorandom
           locations from within each subsection. For example, if one thousand conceptual
           subsections are chosen, at least two pseudorandom locations in the first thousandth
           of the media addressing space would be read and verified, at least two pseudorandom
           locations in the second thousandth of the media addressing space would be read and
           verified, and so on.

               a. In addition to the locations already identified, include the first and last
                  addressable location on the storage device.

       3. Each consecutive sample location (except the ones for the first and last addressable
          location) should cover at least 5 % of the subsection and not overlap the other sample
          in the subsection. Given two non-overlapping samples, the resulting verification
          should cover at least 10 % of the media once all subsections have had two samples
          taken.

    Cryptographic Erase has different verification considerations than procedures such as
    rewriting or block erasing, because the contents of the physical media following
    Cryptographic Erase may not be known and therefore cannot be compared to a given value.
    When Cryptographic Erase is leveraged, there are multiple options for verification, and each
    uses a quick review of a subset of the media. Each involves a selection of pseudorandom
    locations to be sampled from across the media.

    The first option is to read the pseudorandom locations prior to Cryptographic Erase, and
    then again following Cryptographic Erase to compare the results. This is likely the most
    effective verification technique. Another option is to search for strings across the media or
    looking for files that are in known locations, such as operating system files likely to be
    stored in a specific area.

    The number of locations and size of each sample should take into consideration the risks in
    transferring the Target Data to the storage media of the machine hosting the sanitization
    application. As a result, the proportion of the media covered by verification for the
    Cryptographic Erase technique may be relatively small (or at least lower than the above
    guidance of 10 % for verification of non-cryptographic sanitization techniques), but should
    still be applied across a wide range of the addressable area.

    However, these techniques may not always be available because the individual performing
    the sanitization may not have the authentication token needed to access and read the data
    stored on the drive. If an organization cannot verify that CE effectively sanitized storage
    media, organizations should employ an alternative sanitization method that can be verified,
    either in combination with CE or in place of CE.

    As part of the sanitization process, in addition to the verification performed on each piece of
    media following the sanitization operation, a subset of media items should be selected at
    random for secondary verification using a different verification tool. The secondary
    verification tool should be from a separate developer. For the secondary verification, a full
    verification should be performed. At least 20 % of sanitized media (by number of media
