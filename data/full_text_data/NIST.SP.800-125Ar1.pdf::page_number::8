1. INTRODUCTION, SCOPE, AND TARGET AUDIENCE

 The Hypervisor is the core software that provides server virtualization. Along with its supporting modules,
 it enables virtualization of all hardware resources (e.g., CPU, Memory, Network, and Storage) and thus
 enables multiple computing stacks (basically made of an OS and application programs) to be run on a
 single physical host. Such a physical host is called a Virtualized Host (also referred to as a Hypervisor
 Host in this document), and the individual computing stacks are encapsulated in an artifact called Virtual
 Machines (VMs). To be an independent executable entity, the definition of a VM should include resources
 (e.g., CPU, Memory, etc.) allocated to it. The VMs are also called “Guests,” and the operating system
 (OS) running inside each of them is called “Guest OS.” The resources associated with a VM are virtual
 resources as opposed to physical resources associated with a physical host. The hypervisor together with
 these supporting modules and the hosting hardware constitute the hypervisor platform.

The primary function of the hypervisor is to enforce guest OS isolation as well as controlled resource sharing
among guest VMs. Thus, it plays many of the roles a conventional OS does on a non-virtualized host (server).
Just as a conventional OS provides isolation between the various applications (or processes) running on a
server, the hypervisor provides isolation between one or more VMs running on it. Also, similar to an OS, the
hypervisor mediates access to physical resources (devices) across multiple VMs. While access to CPU and
memory (to ensure process isolation) are handled directly by the hypervisor (through instruction set (CPU)
virtualization and memory virtualization respectively with or without assistance from hardware), it handles
the mediation of access to devices (devices virtualization) by calling on software modules running either
in the kernel or in dedicated VMs called Device-driver VMs. The hypervisor can be installed either directly
on the hardware or bare metal (Type 1 Hypervisor) or on top of a full-fledged conventional OS called Host
OS (Type 2 Hypervisor).

At first glance, it might appear that all activities related to the secure management of a hypervisor and its
hardware host (collectively called Hypervisor Platform) should consist of just the established state of the art
practices for any server class software and its hosting environment. However, closer examination reveals that
the functions for supporting hardware virtualization that a hypervisor provides have extensive security
ramifications and therefore require a focused set of security recommendations based on an analysis of threats
to the integrity of these functions. In this document, these functions are called hypervisor baseline functions.

The hypervisor baseline functions consist of:
     • VM Process Isolation
     • Devices Mediation and Access Control
     • Direct Execution of commands from Guest VMs
     • VM Lifecycle Management
     • Management of hypervisor platform

A brief description of the above functions is given in section 1.1 below.

1.1 Hypervisor Baseline Functions (HY-BF)

While the basic function of a hypervisor is to virtualize hardware (a physical host) to enable the operation
of multiple virtual hosts (popularly known as VMs), commercial hypervisor offerings come with differing
feature sets. The modules that provide the same set of features are given different names in different product
offerings. Hence, for accomplishing the goals of this document, it is necessary to identify a set of baseline
features of a hypervisor that covers all functions for supporting hardware virtualization. In some instances,
the module that just presents a set of virtualized resources to the VMs is called the Virtual Machine Manager
