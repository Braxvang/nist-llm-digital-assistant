then able to connect to the AP by associating with it. STA 1 and STA 2 perform the Association Request-
Response frame exchange with the AP to accomplish the STA registration for later frame delivery from
the DS. STA 3 joins the network after the beacon was transmitted. As a result, it sends a Probe Request
frame—an active request for WLANs in the area—to determine the capabilities of the AP, and receives a
Probe Response frame containing the requested information. Section 5.2 provides additional descriptions
of the Beacon, Association, and Probe frames.

5.1.2   IEEE 802.11 Data Frame Structure

Figure 5-3 depicts the IEEE 802.11 data frame structure. As shown, the data frame begins with a MAC
header, which contains numerous fields for the transport of data in a WLAN. Most importantly, the
header provides the MAC addresses of the source and destination, as well as the transmitter address,
which identifies the address of the wireless network interface card that transmitted the frame onto the
wireless medium, and the receiver address, which identifies the wireless station or group address that
should process the frame. For example, when APs bridge wired LANs, a STA can send a message to a
wired LAN end station connected to the AP, in which case the receiver address is the AP’s address, and
the destination address is the end station’s address. Each STA and AP processes frames with a receiver
address that matches its MAC address. Each AP also forwards frames to an attached LAN when a
frame’s destination address is different than the receiver address. In addition to the MAC addresses and
other header fields, a data frame also contains a frame body, which is the encapsulated data from the
higher layer protocol, and a frame check sequence (FCS), which is provided for error detection purposes.
