            such as that of storage administrators, can be similarly affected. Management and
            operational controls may be needed to compensate a lack of technical controls in virtual
            environments for maintaining separation of duty.

            Virtual Machine Images. IaaS cloud providers and manufacturers of virtual machine
            products maintain repositories of virtual machine images. A virtual machine image
            entails the software stack, including installed and configured applications, used to boot
            the virtual machine into an initial state or the state of some previous checkpoint. Sharing
            virtual machine images is a common practice in some cloud computing environments as a
            quick way to get started. Virtual machine images created by the organization must be
            carefully managed and controlled to avoid problems. For instance, images need to be
            kept up-to-date with the latest security patches. Caution must be taken to avoid using
            images that have not been vetted or releasing images in a haphazard fashion.

            The provider of an image faces risks, since an image can contain proprietary code and
            data and embody vulnerabilities. An attacker may attempt to examine images to
            determine whether they leak information or provide an avenue for attack [Wei09]. This
            is especially true of development images that are accidentally released. The reverse may
            also occur—an attacker may attempt to supply a virtual machine image containing
            malware to consumers of a cloud computing system [Jen09, Wei09].13 For example,
            researchers demonstrated that by manipulating the registration process to gain a first-page
            listing, they could readily entice cloud consumers to run virtual machine images they
            contributed to the image repository of a popular cloud provider [Mee09, Sla09]. The
            risks for consumers running tainted images include theft and corruption of data.
            Organizations should consider implementing a formal image management process to
            govern the creation, storage, and use of virtual machine images [Sca11].

           Client-Side Protection. A successful defense against attacks requires securing both the
            client and server side of cloud computing. With emphasis typically placed on the latter,
            the former can be easily overlooked. Services from different cloud providers, as well as
            cloud-based applications developed by the organization, can impose more exacting
            demands on the client, which may have implications for security and privacy that need to
            be taken into consideration. Web browsers, a key element for many cloud computing
            services, and the various plug-ins and extensions available for them are notorious for
            their security problems [Jen09, Ker10, Pro07, Pro09]. Moreover, many browser add-ons
            do not provide automatic updates, increasing the persistence of any existing
            vulnerabilities.

            Maintaining physical and logical security over clients can be troublesome, especially with
            embedded mobile devices such as smart phones. Their size and portability can result in
            the loss of physical control. Built-in security mechanisms often go unused or can be
            overcome or circumvented without difficulty by a knowledgeable party to gain control
