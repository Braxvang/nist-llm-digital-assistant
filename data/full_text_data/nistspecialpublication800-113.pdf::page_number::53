                                                                                         GUIDE TO SSL VPNS



 Users can authenticate to all sites simultaneously. Each user’s routing table is configured so that
  packets destined for a specific site’s addresses will take that site’s VPN connection. If a user creates
  VPNs to Sites A and B simultaneously, then packets destined for a Site A subnet traverse the VPN to
  Site A, with the same applying to packets destined for a Site B subnet.
Note that the routing issues mentioned earlier in this section are also relevant for an architecture with
multiple sites. Each site must be sure to correctly route and to not block VPN packets with addresses
assigned at other sites. If the VPN devices have multiple interfaces, the packets destined for the external
interface may have to be routed differently from packets destined for the internal interface. This depends
on how the internal connectivity between sites is configured.

4.3.4.4 High Availability or Load Balancing Support

An organization may decide to implement high availability or load balancing. High availability may be
required so the organization can meet service level agreements (SLA) for guaranteed uptime, or load
balancing may be required to support a large number of users. SSL VPN products vary widely in how
they support high availability and load balancing. For this reason, an organization with a need for high
availability or load balancing should answer at least these questions about each device under evaluation,
with testing possibly being required to receive detailed answers.

 Does the device employ an active/passive or an active/active mode architecture? An active/passive
  architecture only supports one active device at a time, while an active/active architecture supports two
  devices simultaneously. Active/passive systems are much easier to design and are therefore usually
  less expensive than active/active systems. Active/active systems are mostly useful in architectures
  where a very high load is expected, so more than one device needs to be active under normal
  circumstances.
 How is state information maintained across devices in a failure scenario? How long does the failover
  process take for proxying, translation, and network extension?
 In an active/active mode architecture, is state information for all sessions mirrored across all devices
  so a device failure will not disrupt any user sessions? Or does each device track state information
  (such as user authentication status) only for its own sessions so a device failure may require re-
  authentication?
 If an external load balancing solution is used, how is state information maintained throughout the
  architecture?
Configuration and upgrading pose additional issues. Some devices mirror configuration settings across
devices, so only the active devices should be configured. Any altered settings on the passive devices will
quickly be overwritten by the active device’s settings. If configuration settings are not mirrored, all
devices should be configured with identical settings at the same time.

For upgrades, the vendor’s instructions for upgrading should be followed. Some vendors require the
passive device in an active/passive mode architecture to be upgraded first. After this upgrade is complete,
the newly upgraded device becomes active and the newly passive device can then be upgraded. Other
vendors require the active device to be upgraded first. The active device is still handling VPN traffic
while it is being upgraded and only fails over to the passive device when it is ready to reboot with the new
upgrade in place. Upgrading the active device first avoids a scenario where the passive device is being
upgraded and receives mirrored configuration changes from the active device in the middle of the upgrade
process.
