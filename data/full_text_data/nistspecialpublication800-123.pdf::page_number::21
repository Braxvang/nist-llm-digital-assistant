                                                                            GUIDE TO GENERAL SERVER SECURITY



3.2.4    Server, Network, and Security Administrators

Server administrators are system architects responsible for the overall design, implementation, and
maintenance of a server. Network administrators are responsible for the overall design, implementation,
and maintenance of a network. Security administrators are dedicated to performing information security
functions for servers and other hosts, as well as networks. Organizations that have a dedicated
information security team usually have security administrators. On a daily basis, server, network, and
security administrators contend with the security requirements of the specific systems for which they are
responsible. Security issues and solutions can originate from either outside (e.g., security patches and
fixes from the manufacturer or computer security incident response teams) or within the organization
(e.g., the security office). The administrators are responsible for the following activities associated with
servers:

 Installing and configuring systems in compliance with the organizational security policies and
  standard system and network configurations

 Maintaining systems in a secure manner, including frequent backups and timely application of
  patches

 Monitoring system integrity, protection levels, and security-related events

 Following up on detected security anomalies associated with their information system resources

 Conducting security tests as required.

3.3     Management Practices

Appropriate management practices are critical to operating and maintaining a secure server. Security
practices entail the identification of an organization’s information system assets and the development,
documentation, and implementation of policies, standards, procedures, and guidelines that ensure
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information system resources.

To ensure the security of a server and the supporting network infrastructure, organizations should
implement the following practices:

 Organizational Information System Security Policy—A security policy should specify the basic
  information system security tenets and rules, and their intended internal purpose. The policy should
  also outline who in the organization is responsible for particular areas of information security (e.g.,
  implementation, enforcement, audit, review). The policy must be enforced consistently throughout
  the organization to be effective. Generally, the CIO is responsible for drafting the organization’s
  security policy.

 Configuration/Change Control and Management—The process of controlling modification to a
  system’s design, hardware, firmware, and software provides sufficient assurance that the system is
  protected against the introduction of an improper modification before, during, and after system
  implementation. Configuration control leads to consistency with the organization’s information
  system security policy. Configuration control is traditionally overseen by a configuration control
  board that is the final authority on all proposed changes to an information system. If resources allow,
  consider the use of development, quality assurance, and/or test environments so that changes can be
  vetted and tested before deployment in production.
