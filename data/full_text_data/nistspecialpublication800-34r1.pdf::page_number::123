Appendix C—Frequently Asked Questions

1. What is Information System Contingency Planning?

   Information system contingency planning refers to the dynamic development of a coordinated
   recovery strategy for information systems, operations, and data after a disruption. The planning
   process requires seven steps: develop contingency planning policy statement; conduct the business
   impact analysis (BIA); identify preventive controls; develop recovery strategies; develop the
   Information System Contingency Plan (ISCP); test and exercise the plan and train personnel; and
   maintain the plan.

2. What are the differences among a Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP), a Business
   Continuity Plan (BCP), a Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) Plan, a Disaster Recovery
   Plan (DRP), an Information System Contingency Plan (ISCP), a Cyber Incident Response Plan,
   and an Occupant Emergency Plan (OEP)?

   Organizations require a suite of plans to prepare themselves for response, continuity, recovery, and
   resumption of mission/business processes and information systems in the event of a disruption. Each
   plan has a specific purpose and scope; however, because of the lack of standard definitions for these
   types of plans, in some cases, the scope of actual plans developed by organizations may vary from the
   following basic descriptions.

   A COOP is required by Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD) - 20/National Security
   Presidential Directive (NSPD) - 51, National Continuity Policy and Federal Continuity Directive
   (FCD) - 1, Federal Executive Branch National Continuity Program and Requirements for sustaining
   an organization’s (usually a headquarters element) mission essential functions (MEF) at an alternate
   site and performing those functions for up to 30 days before returning to normal operations. A BCP
   addresses sustaining mission/business processes and the information systems that support those
   mission/business processes during and after a significant disruption. BCPs are often developed at the
   organization’s field level or for mission/business processes that are not prioritized as mission
   essential. A CIP plan is a set of policies and procedures that serve to protect and recover those
   components of the national infrastructure that are deemed so vital that their loss would have a
   debilitating effect of the safety, security, economy, and/or health of the United States. A DRP refers
   to an information system-focused plan designed to restore operability of one or more information
   systems at an alternate site after a major disruption usually causing physical damage to the original
   data center. An ISCP provides recovery and resumption procedures for a single information system
   resulting from disruptions that do not necessarily require relocation to an alternate site. A Cyber
   Incident Response Plan establishes procedures to enable security personnel to identify, mitigate, and
   recover from cyber attacks against an organization’s information system(s). An OEP provides
   directions for facility occupants to follow in the event of an emergency situation that threatens the
   health and safety of personnel, the environment, or property.

   Careful coordination must be maintained between plan developers to ensure that their respective
   policies and procedures complement one another. Any changes in one plan, system, or process must
   be communicated to plan developers of associated systems and functions.

3. What is the difference between mission/business processes supported by an information system
   and a COOP MEF?

   Information systems are designed and developed to support mission/business processes (or functions).
   When conducting a BIA, the mission/business processes are identified and prioritized in terms of
