GUIDE TO TEST, TRAINING, AND EXERCISE PROGRAMS FOR IT PLANS AND CAPABILITIES



     Training. For the purposes of this publication, training refers only to informing personnel of
      their roles and responsibilities within a particular IT plan and teaching them skills related to those
      roles and responsibilities, thereby preparing them for participation in exercises, tests, and actual
      emergency situations related to the IT plan. Training personnel on their roles and responsibilities
      before an exercise or test event is typically split between a presentation on their roles and
      responsibilities, and activities that allow personnel to demonstrate their understanding of the
      subject matter.
     Exercises. An exercise is a simulation of an emergency designed to validate the viability of one
      or more aspects of an IT plan. In an exercise, personnel with roles and responsibilities in a
      particular IT plan meet to validate the content of a plan through discussion of their roles and their
      responses to emergency situations, execution of responses in a simulated operational
      environment, or other means of validating responses that does not involve using the actual
      operational environment. Exercises are scenario-driven, such as a power failure in one of the
      organization’s data centers or a fire causing certain systems to be damaged, with additional
      situations often being presented during the course of an exercise. There are several types of
      exercises, and this publication focuses on the following two types that are widely used in TT&E
      programs by single organizations:

        –   Tabletop Exercises. Tabletop exercises are discussion-based exercises where personnel
            meet in a classroom setting or in breakout groups to discuss their roles during an emergency
            and their responses to a particular emergency situation. A facilitator presents a scenario and
            asks the exercise participants questions related to the scenario, which initiates a discussion
            among the participants of roles, responsibilities, coordination, and decision-making. A
            tabletop exercise is discussion-based only and does not involve deploying equipment or other
            resources.

        –   Functional Exercises. Functional exercises allow personnel to validate their operational
            readiness for emergencies by performing their duties in a simulated operational environment.
            Functional exercises are designed to exercise the roles and responsibilities of specific team
            members, procedures, and assets involved in one or more functional aspects of a plan (e.g.,
            communications, emergency notifications, IT equipment setup). Functional exercises vary in
            complexity and scope, from validating specific aspects of a plan to full-scale exercises that
            address all plan elements. Functional exercises allow staff to execute their roles and
            responsibilities as they would in an actual emergency situation, but in a simulated manner.
Organizations should conduct TT&E events periodically; following organizational changes, updates to an
IT plan, or the issuance of new TT&E guidance; or as otherwise needed. This assists organizations in
ensuring that their IT plans are reasonable, effective, and complete, and that all personnel know what their
roles are in the conduct of each IT plan. TT&E event schedules are often dictated in part by
organizational requirements. For example, NIST Special Publication 800-53 requires Federal agencies to
conduct exercises or tests for their systems’ contingency plans and incident response capabilities at least
annually.
