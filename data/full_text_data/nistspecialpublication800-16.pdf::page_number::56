Information Technology Security Training Requirements

   •         System Life Cycle Security       — KS As         relative to the nature of IT security needed
             throughout each phase of a given system's life cycle. In this instance, a six-phased
             system life cycle model was used (Initiation, Development, Test and Evaluation,
             Implementation, Operations, and Termination).


Combining the six role categories and the three training areas (with a fourth area, "Other," added
as a place holder for future use) yields the following Information Technology Security Training
Matrix, Exhibit 4-1, shown below.               This matrix is, in effect, a "pull-down menu" of the Training
level in the Learning Continuum.

This chapter presents the training requirements for each of the 46 cells, i.e., 1 A through 3.6E.
(Bricked cells - particularly 3. ID, 3.3A, 3.3B, 3.6B, and 3.6C - are place holders, or cells that
may be used later.) This approach will enable course developers to create a block or module of
instructional material relative to the requirements defined in a specific cell with confidence that it
will complement and augment training material developed for the other cells. Further,
individuals or supervisors will be able to select that training needed to satisfy an individual's
organizational role at a specific point in time, with assurance that such training will contribute to
his or her career progression, or to other assigned duties. Finally, trainers will have the flexibility
to combine modules (horizontally or vertically) into a comprehensive FT security course or to
