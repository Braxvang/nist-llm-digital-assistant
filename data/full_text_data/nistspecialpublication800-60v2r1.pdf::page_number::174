Authentication information type. Another exception might be unauthorized disclosure of
information that gives an individual or corporate entity an unfair competitive advantage in
obtaining contracts or other funding for development activities. This can result in assignment of
a moderate impact level to such information.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for community and regional development information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of community and regional
development information would have, at most, a limited adverse effect on agency operations,
agency assets, or individuals.

Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external communications
(e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect operations and/or public confidence in the
agency, but the damage to the mission would usually be limited

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
most community and regional development information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to community and regional
development information. The effects of disruption of access to most community and
regional development information or information systems would have a limited adverse
effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
community and regional development information is low.

D.10.3 Social Services Information Type

Social Services are designed to provide meaningful opportunities for social and economic growth
of the disadvantaged sector of the population in order to develop individuals into productive and
self-reliant citizens and promote social equity. Included in this category are social welfare
services extended to children and adults with special needs, such as the orphaned, neglected,
abandoned, disabled, etc. Such services include family life education and counseling, adoption,
guardianship, foster family care, rehabilitation services, etc. Note: This mission does not include
services that are primarily for income support (Income Security) or are an integral part of some
other mission area (e.g., Health, Workforce Management, etc.). The recommended provisional
categorization of the social services information type follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}
