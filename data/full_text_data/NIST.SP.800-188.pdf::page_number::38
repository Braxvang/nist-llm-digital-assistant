leased fle. Therefore, de-identifcation requirements should be gauged using a risk assess-
ment [97]. More information on conducting risk assessments can be found in NIST SP
800-30, Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments [149], in NISTIR 8062 [22], and using the
NIST PRAM [20] discussed in Sec. 3.2.
Members of at-risk and vulnerable populations19 may be more susceptible to having their
identities disclosed by de-identifed data than other populations because the characteristic
that makes these individuals vulnerable may also make them stand out in the dataset. Like-
wise, residents of areas with small populations may be more susceptible to having their
identities disclosed than residents of areas with large populations. Individuals with multi-
ple traits will generally be more identifable if the individual’s location is geographically
restricted. For example, data belonging to a person who is labeled as a pregnant, unem-
ployed veteran will be more identifable if restricted to Baltimore County, Maryland, than
to all of North America.
If agencies determine that the potential for harm is large in a contemplated data release,
one way to manage the risk is by increasing the level of de-identifcation and accepting a
lower data accuracy level. This lower level should be communicated to users of the dataset.
Other options include data controls, such as restricting the availability of data to qualifed
researchers in a data enclave.

3.2.2.    Adverse Impacts of Re-Identifcation
As part of a risk analysis, agencies should attempt to enumerate the specifc kinds of ad-
verse impacts that can result from the re-identifcation of de-identifed information. These
can include potential impacts on individuals, the agency, and society.
Potential adverse impacts on individuals include:
    • Increased availability of personal information that leads to an increased risk of fraud,
      identity theft, discrimination, or abuse
    • Increased availability of an individual’s location that puts that person at risk for bur-
      glary, property crime, assault, or other kinds of violence


19 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention describe six categories to consider when identifying at-

 risk groups that could be disproportionately affected by disasters: socioeconomic status, age, gender, race
 and ethnicity, English language profciency, and medical issues and disability [110]. Frohlich and Potvin
 note, “The notion of vulnerable populations differs from that of populations at risk. A population at risk is
 defned by a higher measured exposure to a specifc risk factor. All individuals in a population at risk show a
 higher risk exposure. A vulnerable population is a subgroup or subpopulation who, because of shared social
 characteristics, is at higher risk of risks. The notion of vulnerable populations refers to groups who, because
 of their position in the social strata, are commonly exposed to contextual conditions that distinguish them
 from the rest of the population. As a consequence, a vulnerable population’s distribution of risk exposure
 has a higher mean than that of the rest of the population” [64]. The characteristics that distinguish at-risk
 and vulnerable populations may also place them at higher risk of having their data re-identifed.
