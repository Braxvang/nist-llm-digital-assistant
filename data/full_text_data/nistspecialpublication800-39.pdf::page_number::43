STEP 1: RISK FRAMING

Inputs and Preconditions
Risk framing is the set of assumptions, constraints, risk tolerances, and priorities/trade-offs that shape an organization’s
approach for managing risk. Risk framing is informed by the organizational governance structure, financial posture,
legal/regulatory environment, investment strategy, culture, and trust relationships established within and among
organizations. Inputs to the risk framing step include, for example, laws, policies, directives, regulations, contractual
relationships, and financial limitations which impose constraints on potential risk decisions by organizations. Other
inputs to risk framing can include, for example, specific information from organizations to make explicit: (i) the
identification of trust relationships and trust models (see Appendix G) that derive from existing memoranda of
understanding or agreement (MOUs or MOAs); and (ii) the identification of the governance structures and processes
that indicate the extent of or limits on decision-making authority for risk decisions that can be delegated to mission or
business owners. The key precondition for risk framing is senior leadership commitment to defining an explicit risk
management strategy and holding mission/business owners responsible and accountable for implementing the strategy.
The guidance produced by the risk framing step, and the underlying assumptions, constraints, risk tolerances, and
priorities/trade-offs used to develop that guidance, may be inappropriate to one or more organizational missions or
business functions. In addition, the risk environment has the potential to change over time. Thus, the risk management
process allows for feedback to the risk framing step from the other steps in the process, as follows:
•    Risk assessment: Information generated during the risk assessment may influence the original assumptions, change
     the constraints regarding appropriate risk responses, identify additional tradeoffs, or shift priorities. For example,
     the characterization of adversaries (including representative tactics, techniques, and procedures), or sources of
     vulnerability information may not be consistent with how some organizations conduct their missions/business
     functions; a source of threat/vulnerability information that is useful for one mission/business function could, in
     fact, be useful for others; or organizational guidance on assessing risk under uncertainty may be too onerous, or
     insufficiently defined, to be useful for one or more mission/business functions.
•    Risk response: Information uncovered during the development of alternative courses of action could reveal that
     risk framing has removed or failed to uncover some potentially high-payoff alternatives from consideration. This
     situation may challenge organizations to revisit original assumptions or investigate ways to change established
     constraints.
•    Risk monitoring: Security control monitoring by organizations could indicate that a class of controls, or a specific
     implementation of a control, is relatively ineffective, given investments in people, processes, or technology. This
     situation could lead to changes in assumptions about which types of risk responses are preferred by organizations.
     Monitoring of the operational environment could reveal changes in the threat landscape (e.g., changes in the
     tactics, techniques, and procedures observed across all organizational information systems; increasing frequency
     and/or intensity of attacks against specific missions/business functions) that cause organizations to revisit original
     threat assumptions and/or to seek different sources of threat information. Significant advances in defensive or
     proactive operational and technical solutions could generate the need to revisit the investment strategy identified
     during the framing step. Monitoring of legal/regulatory environments could also influence changes in assumptions
     or constraints. Also, monitoring of risk being incurred might result in the need to reconsider the organizational risk
     tolerance if the existing statement of risk tolerance does not appear to match the operational realities.

Activities
RISK ASSUMPTIONS
TASK 1-1: Identify assumptions that affect how risk is assessed, responded to, and monitored within the
organization.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations that identify, characterize, and provide representative examples of threat
sources, vulnerabilities, consequences/impacts, and likelihood determinations promote a common terminology and
frame of reference for comparing and addressing risks across disparate mission/business areas. Organizations can also
select appropriate risk assessment methodologies, depending on organizational governance, culture, and how divergent
the missions/business functions are within the respective organizations. For example, organizations with highly
centralized governance structures might elect to use a single risk assessment methodology. Organizations with hybrid
governance structures might select multiple risk assessment methodologies for Tier 2, and an additional risk assessment
methodology for Tier 1 that assimilates and harmonizes the findings, results, and observations of the Tier 2 risk
assessments. Alternatively, when autonomy and diversity are central to the organizational culture, organizations could
define requirements for the degree of rigor and the form of results, leaving the choice of specific risk assessment
methodologies to mission/business owners.
