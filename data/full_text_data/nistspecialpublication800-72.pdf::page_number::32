                                                                  Guidelines on PDA Forensics


        Detection of incidents – Develop techniques on how to detect suspect activities.

        Initial Response – Confirm that an incident has occurred and obtain volatile
        evidence.

        Response strategy formulation – Respond to incident based upon knowledge of all
        known facts collected from the Initial Response phase.

        Duplication (forensic backups) – Based upon the scenario, either create a physical
        forensic image or do a live retrieval of evidence.

        Investigation – Determine what happened, who did it and how the incident can be
        prevented in the future.

        Security measure implementation – Apply security measures to isolate and contain
        infected systems.

        Network monitoring – Monitor network traffic for ongoing or additional attacks.

        Recovery – Restore the affected system to a secure, operational state.

        Reporting – Document all of the details and investigative steps taken throughout the
        incident.

        Follow-up – Learn from the incident by reviewing how and why it happened and
        make necessary adjustments.

Research conducted at the U.S. Air Force proposes the following steps when dealing with a
forensic investigation [Rei02].

        Identification – Recognize and determine the type of incident.

        Preparation – Prepare tools, techniques, search warrants, authorizations, and
        management approval.

        Approach Strategy – Maximize untainted evidence collection while minimizing the
        impact upon the victim.

        Preservation – Isolate, secure, and preserve the state of physical and digital evidence.

        Collection – Record the physical scene and duplicate digital evidence.

        Examination – Search for evidence relating to the suspected crime.

        Analysis – Determine significance, reconstruct fragments of data, and draw
        conclusions based on the evidence found. The Analysis phase may go through
        numerous iterations until a theory has been supported.

        Presentation – Summarize and provide an explanation of conclusions.
