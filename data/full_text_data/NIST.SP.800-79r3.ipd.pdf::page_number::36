       NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                  Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
       December 2023                                                         and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

1099   3.2.1. Issuer Controls Implemented at the Organizational or Facility Level
1100   The nature of each issuer control dictates where it is implemented. Controls are generally
1101   considered organizational level controls if they apply to the entire organization, regardless of the
1102   structure of the issuer and its issuing facilities, or are common to or impact multiple PIV
1103   processes. The development of the operations plan is an example of an issuer control
1104   implemented at the organizational level. Generally, controls that are specific to a process are
1105   implemented at the issuing facility where that process or function is carried out. For example, the
1106   control that states, “The issuer advises applicants that the PIN on the PIV Card should not be
1107   easily guessable or otherwise individually identifiable in nature,” is implemented at an
1108   activation/issuance facility.
1109   Derived PIV credentials MAY be issued remotely. In such cases, the issuer MAY NOT need to
1110   use an issuing facility, and issuing facility-specific controls may not be applicable. Regardless of
1111   the system and process architecture on how PIV Cards and derived PIV credentials are issued, it
1112   is the responsibility of the issuer organization to ensure that all applicable controls are
1113   implemented.
