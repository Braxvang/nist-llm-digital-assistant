                                                        GUIDE TO INTEGRATING FORENSIC TECHNIQUES INTO INCIDENT RESPONSE



2.2      Forensic Staffing

Practically every organization needs to have some capability to perform computer and network forensics.
Without such a capability, an organization will have difficulty determining what events have occurred
within its systems and networks, such as exposures of protected, sensitive data. Although the extent of
this need varies, the primary users of forensic tools and techniques within an organization usually can be
divided into the following three groups:5

      ! Investigators. Investigators within an organization are most often from the Office of Inspector
        General (OIG), and they are responsible for investigating allegations of misconduct. For some
        organizations, the OIG immediately takes over the investigation of any event that is suspected to
        involve criminal activity. The OIG typically uses many forensic techniques and tools. Other
        investigators within an organization might include legal advisors and members of the human
        resources department. Law enforcement officials and others outside the organization that might
        perform criminal investigations are not considered part of an organizationâ€™s internal group of
        investigators.
      ! IT Professionals. This group includes technical support staff and system, network, and security
        administrators. They use a small number of forensic techniques and tools specific to their area of
        expertise during their routine work (e.g., monitoring, troubleshooting, data recovery).
      ! Incident Handlers. This group responds to a variety of computer security incidents, such as
        unauthorized data access, inappropriate system usage, malicious code infections, and denial of
        service attacks. Incident handlers typically use a wide variety of forensic techniques and tools
        during their investigations.
Many organizations rely on a combination of their own staff and external parties to perform forensic
tasks. For example, some organizations perform standard tasks themselves and use outside parties only
when specialized assistance is needed. Even organizations that want to perform all forensic tasks
themselves usually outsource the most demanding ones, such as sending physically damaged media to a
data recovery firm for reconstruction, or having specially trained law enforcement personnel or
consultants collect data from an unusual source (e.g., cell phone). Such tasks typically require the use of
specialized software, equipment, facilities, and technical expertise that most organizations cannot justify
the high expense of acquiring and maintaining. As described in Section 3.1.2, organizations should
determine in advance which actions should be performed by law enforcement officials. Also, when
expert testimony is needed for legal proceedings, organizations might seek external assistance.

When deciding which internal or external parties should handle each aspect of forensics, organizations
should keep the following factors in mind:

      ! Cost. There are many potential costs. Software, hardware, and equipment used to collect and
        examine data may carry significant costs (e.g., purchase price, software updates and upgrades,
        maintenance), and may also require additional physical security measures to safeguard them from
        tampering. Other significant expenses involve staff training and labor costs, which are
        particularly significant for dedicated forensic specialists. In general, forensic actions that are
        needed rarely might be more cost-effectively performed by an external party, whereas actions that
        are needed frequently might be more cost-effectively performed internally.

      An individual performing forensic activities needs to understand forensic principles and practices, and follow the correct
      procedures for each activity, regardless of which group he or she is a member.
