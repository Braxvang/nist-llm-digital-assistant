Special Publication 800-53, Revision 1               Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________

AC-11     SESSION LOCK

          Control: The information system prevents further access to the system by initiating a session lock
          after [Assignment: organization-defined time period] of inactivity, and the session lock remains in
          effect until the user reestablishes access using appropriate identification and authentication
          procedures.
          Supplemental Guidance: Users can directly initiate session lock mechanisms. A session lock is not a
          substitute for logging out of the information system. Organization-defined time periods of
          inactivity comply with federal policy; for example, in accordance with OMB Memorandum 06-16,
          the organization-defined time period is no greater than thirty minutes for remote access and
          portable devices.
          Control Enhancements: None.


           LOW Not Selected              MOD AC-11                  HIGH AC-11



AC-12     SESSION TERMINATION

          Control: The information system automatically terminates a remote session after [Assignment:
          organization-defined time period] of inactivity.
          Supplemental Guidance: A remote session is initiated whenever an organizational information
          system is accessed by a user (or an information system) communicating through an external, non-
          organization-controlled network (e.g., the Internet).
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   Automatic session termination applies to local and remote sessions.


           LOW Not Selected              MOD AC-12                  HIGH AC-12 (1)



AC-13     SUPERVISION AND REVIEW â€” ACCESS CONTROL

          Control: The organization supervises and reviews the activities of users with respect to the
          enforcement and usage of information system access controls.
          Supplemental Guidance: The organization reviews audit records (e.g., user activity logs) for
          inappropriate activities in accordance with organizational procedures. The organization
          investigates any unusual information system-related activities and periodically reviews changes to
          access authorizations. The organization reviews more frequently the activities of users with
          significant information system roles and responsibilities. The extent of the audit record reviews is
          based on the FIPS 199 impact level of the information system. For example, for low-impact
          systems, it is not intended that security logs be reviewed frequently for every workstation, but
          rather at central points such as a web proxy or email servers and when specific circumstances
          warrant review of other audit records. NIST Special Publication 800-92 provides guidance on
          computer security log management.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization employs automated mechanisms to facilitate the review of user activities.


           LOW AC-13                     MOD AC-13 (1)              HIGH AC-13 (1)
