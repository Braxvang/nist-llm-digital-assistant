SP 800-152                                                    A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


FR:6.7 For each cryptographic mechanism used in the Trusted Association Protections
metadata element (item u above), the CKMS design shall specify the following:
   i. The cryptographic algorithm,
   ii. The parameters for the key,
   iii. The key identifier,
   iv. The protection value (e.g., MAC, digital signature),
   v. When the protection was applied, and
   vi. When the protection was verified.

FR:6.8 For each non-cryptographic trusted process used in the Trusted Association
Protections metadata element (item u above), the CKMS design shall specify the following:
   i. The identifier that is used to distinguish this process from other processes, and
   ii. A description of the process or a pointer to a description of the process.

FR:6.9 The CKMS design shall specify the accuracy and precision required for dates and
times used by the system.

FR:6.10 The CKMS design shall specify what authoritative time sources are used to achieve
the required accuracy.

FR:6.11 The CKMS design shall specify how authoritative time sources are used to achieve
the required accuracy.

FR:6.12 The CKMS design shall specify which dates, times, and functions require a trusted
third-party time stamp.

                           A Federal CKMS shall support all metadata elements that are
PR:6.9
                           required to support its FCKMS Security Policy.
                           A Federal CKMS shall specify which metadata elements are
PR:6.10
                           sensitive.
               SC-8        A Federal CKMS shall physically or logically protect all
PR:6.11
               SC-11       sensitive metadata from unauthorized disclosure, use, and
               SC-12       modification.
               SC-28
                           A Federal CKMS shall support the protection of sensitive
PR:6.12
                           metadata at the same or a higher impact-level than the impact-
                           level of the data to be protected by the associated key.
                SI-7       A Federal CKMS shall apply integrity protection to all
PR:6.13
                           metadata before transmission and storage, and verify the
                           integrity of all metadata when received or before the initial
                           use of the metadata.
                           A Federal CKMS shall maintain the association between a
PR:6.14
                           key and its metadata.
