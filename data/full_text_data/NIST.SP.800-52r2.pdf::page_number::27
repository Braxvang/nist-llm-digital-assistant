NIST SP 800-52 REV. 2                                         GUIDELINES FOR TLS IMPLEMENTATIONS


   •   TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA256 (0x00, 0x6A)

TLS servers may be configured to support the following cipher suites when DSA certificates are
used with TLS versions 1.2, 1.1, or 1.0:
   •   TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA (0x00, 0x32)
   •   TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA (0x00, 0x38)

3.3.1.1.4 Cipher Suites for DH Certificates

DH certificates contain a static key and are signed using either DSA or RSA. Unlike cipher
suites that use ephemeral DH, these cipher suites contain static DH parameters. While the use of
static keys is technically acceptable, the use of ephemeral key cipher suites is encouraged and
preferred over the use of the cipher suites listed in this section.

TLS 1.2 servers that are configured with DSA-signed DH certificates may be configured to
support the following cipher suites:

   •   TLS_DH_DSS_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 (0x00, 0xA4)
   •   TLS_DH_DSS_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 (0x00, 0xA5)
   •   TLS_DH_DSS_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256 (0x00, 0x3E)
   •   TLS_DH_DSS_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA256 (0x00, 0x68)

TLS servers may be configured to support the following cipher suites when DSA-signed DH
certificates are used with TLS versions 1.2, 1.1, or 1.0:

   •   TLS_DH_DSS_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA (0x00, 0x30)
   •   TLS_DH_DSS_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA (0x00, 0x36)

TLS 1.2 servers that are configured with RSA-signed DH certificates may be configured to
support the following cipher suites:

   •   TLS_DH_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 (0x00, 0xA0)
   •   TLS_DH_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 (0x00, 0xA1)
   •   TLS_DH_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256 (0x00, 0x3F)
   •   TLS_DH_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA256 (0x00, 0x69)

TLS servers may be configured to support the following cipher suites when RSA-signed DH
certificates are used with TLS versions 1.2, 1.1, or 1.0:

   •   TLS_DH_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA (0x00, 0x31)
   •   TLS_DH_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA (0x00, 0x37)

3.3.1.1.5 Cipher Suites for ECDH Certificates

ECDH certificates contain a static key and are signed using either ECDSA or RSA. Unlike
cipher suites that use ephemeral ECDH, these cipher suites contain static ECDH parameters. The
