      November 2023

608           A.03.01.07.a: non-privileged users are prevented from executing privileged functions.
609           A.03.01.07.b: the execution of privileged functions is logged.

610           ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS
611           Examine
612           [SELECT FROM: access control policy and procedures; procedures for least privilege; system
613           design documentation; system configuration settings; system audit records; list of audited events;
614           list of privileged functions to be audited and associated user account assignments; system
615           security plan; other relevant documents or records]
616           Interview
617           [SELECT FROM: personnel with responsibilities for reviewing least privileges; personnel with
618           information security responsibilities; system developers; system administrators]

624   3.1.8. Unsuccessful Logon Attempts
625           REQUIREMENT: 03.01.08

626           ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE
627           Determine if:
628           A.03.01.08.ODP[01]: the number of consecutive invalid logon attempts by a user allowed
629           during a time period is defined.
630           A.03.01.08.ODP[02]: the time period to which the number of consecutive invalid logon
631           attempts by a user is limited is defined.
632           A.03.01.08: the number of consecutive invalid logon attempts by a user during
633           <03.01.08.ODP[02]: time period> is limited to <A.03.01.08.ODP[01]: number>.

634           ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS
635           Examine
636           [SELECT FROM: access control policy and procedures; procedures for unsuccessful logon
637           attempts; system design documentation; system audit records; system configuration settings;
638           system security plan; other relevant documents or records]
639           Interview
640           [SELECT FROM: personnel with information security responsibilities; system developers; system
641           administrators]
642           Test
643           [SELECT FROM: mechanisms for implementing the access control policy for unsuccessful logon
644           attempts]
