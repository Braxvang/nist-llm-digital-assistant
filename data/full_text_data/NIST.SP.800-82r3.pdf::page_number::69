                   •    Ensuring that physical security personnel are aware of areas in an
                        OT system production environment that house data acquisition
                        and operate in sensitive spaces
                   •    Mitigating business continuity risks by specifying immediate
                        response plans if physical safety is jeopardized
Risk assessments also require reviewing the digital and non-digital mechanisms that are
implemented to minimize adverse event impacts. OT systems often incorporate non-digital
mechanisms to provide fault tolerance and prevent the OT from acting outside of acceptable
parameters. These non-digital mechanisms may help reduce the negative impacts that a digital
incident on the OT might have and should be incorporated into the risk assessment process. For
example, OT often have non-digital control mechanisms that can prevent it from operating
outside of a safe boundary and thereby limit the impact of an attack (e.g., a mechanical relief
pressure valve). Analog mechanisms (e.g., meters, alarms) can also be used to observe the
physical system state and provide operators with reliable data if digital readings are unavailable
or corrupted. Table 5 categorizes non-digital control mechanisms that could reduce the impact of
an OT incident.

  Control Type                                                  Description
                       Non-digital mechanisms measure and display the state of the physical system (e.g.,
                       temperature, pressure, voltage, current) and can provide the operator with accurate
 Analog displays
                       information when digital displays are unavailable or corrupted. The information may be
 or alarms
                       provided to the operator on some non-digital display (e.g., thermometers, pressure gauges)
                       and through audible alarms.
                       Manual control mechanisms (e.g., manual valve controls, physical breaker switches) allow
 Manual control        operators to manually control an actuator without relying on the digital OT system. This
 mechanisms            ensures that an actuator can be controlled even if the OT system is unavailable or
                       compromised.
                       Analog control systems use non-digital sensors and actuators to monitor and control a
                       physical process. These may prevent the physical process from entering an undesired state
                       when the digital OT system is unavailable or corrupted. Analog controls include devices such
                       as regulators, governors, and electromechanical relays. An example is a device that is
 Analog control
                       designed to open during emergency or abnormal conditions to prevent the rise of internal
 systems
                       fluid pressure in excess of a specified value, thus bringing the process to a safer state. The
                       device may also be designed to prevent an excessive internal vacuum, such as a pressure
                       relief valve, a non-reclosing pressure relief device (e.g., rupture disc), or a vacuum relief
                       valve.


             OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
             Organizations should analyze all digital and non-digital control
             mechanisms and the extent to which they can mitigate potential negative
             impacts to the OT. For example, non-digital control mechanisms may
             require additional time and human involvement, such as operators
             travelling to a remote site to perform certain control functions. Such
             mechanisms may also depend on human response times, which may be
             slower than automated controls.
