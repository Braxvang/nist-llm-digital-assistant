668      •   All personnel, contractors, or others who work on behalf of [organization] with
669          responsibilities for processing PII receive specialized training prior to obtaining access to
670          the systems that contain PII and will be required to complete refresher training each fiscal
671          year.
672      •   User accounts and access privileges, including access to email, are disabled for
673          employees who have not completed annual refresher training unless a waiver is granted
674          by the CISO or information systems security manager (ISSM).
675      •   Privacy managers, the CISO, and ISSMs prepare and submit annual awareness and role-
676          based training plans.
677      •   Privacy managers, the CISO, and ISSMs prepare and submit cybersecurity awareness
678          reports with content, frequency, format, and distribution at the request of the CPO and
679          CIO.
680      •   The CISO reviews information security awareness and role-based training programs
681          annually.

683   programs can be found in NIST SP 800-53 control AT-1 [8].

684          Aligning Strategies, Goals, Objectives, and Tactics
685   Organizations can utilize a variety of techniques for identifying and describing the steps needed
686   to implement a program. One method is to begin by identifying the organization’s goals, the
687   objectives to meet those goals, and the operational tactics to meet those objectives. Each goal
688   should have objectives that will often include measurable targets, such as identifying who needs
689   role-based training or training a percentage of the organization by a specified date. Each program
690   objective will have tactics associated with them. Tactics are tools, methods, or mechanisms that
691   enable the program to pursue the objective identified in the plan’s strategy. Ultimately, every
692   individual item in the plan – down to the most detailed tactical level – can be traced back to
693   where it originates in the overall strategy. It is important that every activity support the overall
694   CPLP strategy. Managing the steps to implement CPLPs and ensure that the program meets
695   organizational learning needs requires discipline on the part of the team.
696   Table 1 outlines a model for the strategy that includes goals, objectives, and tactics.

       Strategy         Learning Program Managers meet to set or reset priorities and develop the
       Plan             CPLP Strategic Plan.

       Strategic        Define distinct elements of the Strategic Plan around which to organize the
       Goals            program. Examples of these include goals such as decreasing susceptibility to
                        social engineering attacks, identifying when to apply privacy risk management
                        measures, increasing the adoption of multi-factor authentication, or including
                        scenario-based training activities.
