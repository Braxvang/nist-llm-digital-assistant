                                                                    GUIDELINES ON ELECTRONIC MAIL SECURITY



 Offers no protection to internal users once malware is on the organization’s internal network, unless
  the network is configured so that SMTP traffic gets routed through a dedicated scanner before
  reaching the mail server
 May require powerful (expensive) servers or appliances to handle the load of a large organization.
6.2.1.2 Scanning on the Mail Server Itself

The second option for placement of a mail malware scanner is on the mail server itself (see Figure 6.2).
Many third-party applications are available to scan the contents of the message stores for most popular
mail servers. These applications inspect the email sent between internal users, which normally do not
pass through the organization’s firewall/mail relay/mail gateway. Performing scanning on the mail server
also provides an additional layer of protection against malware, and also helps to stop internal malware
outbreaks. Some mail servers offer application programming interfaces (API) that support the integration
of malware scanning, content filtering, attachment blocking, and other security services within the MTA.




                        Figure 6.2: Malware Scanning Implemented on Mail Server

The major disadvantage of implementing malware scanning on the mail server is the negative effect on
the performance of the mail server caused by the requirement to scan all messages. Also disadvantageous
is that malware scanning on the mail server often requires significant modifications to the existing mail
server configuration. However, this option provides a number of advantages:

 Can scan email in both directions (inbound and outbound)
 Can be centrally managed to ensure compliance with the organization’s security policy and that
  updates are applied regularly
 Offers protection to internal users once malware is on the organization’s internal network.
Scanning for malware at the mail server has a number of weaknesses:

 May require significant modification of the existing mail server configuration (less true for most
  newer mail servers)
