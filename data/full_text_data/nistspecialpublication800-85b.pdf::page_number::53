Precondition(s)           1. A valid PIV card is inserted into the contact reader.
                          2. A valid PC/SC connection exists between the test application and the
                              contact reader.
                          3. The test application is currently connected to the card application
                              which is accessible through card handle.
                          4. A valid X.509 certificate for key management object is present on the
                              PIV card.
Test Scenario             1. Set cardHandle := <<valid card handle>>
                          2. Set OID := <<Key Management Certificate
                              (2.16.840.1.101.3.7.2.1.2)>>
                          3. Call pivGetData w/
                              • (IN) cardHandle
                              • (IN) OID
                              • (OUT) data
                          4. Read and parse the byte array in accordance with BER-TLV
                              format.
Expected Result(s)        1. The size of the byte array does not exceed 1905 bytes.
                          2. All mandatory tags in “X.509 Certificate for Key Management”
                             table are present.
