Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of continuity of
operations information on the ability of responsible agencies to identify critical systems and
processes, and to conduct the planning and preparation required to ensure that these systems and
processes will be available in the event of a catastrophic event. Unauthorized disclosure of the
entire plan to malicious entities may have serious effects. As a result, the consequence of loss of
confidentiality of most continuity of operations plans (and comprehensive continuity of
operations plans) is likely to do serious harm to government assets, personnel, or missions.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized disclosure of
background information that supports development of Federal continuity of operations plans can
reveal sensitive vulnerabilities, capabilities, intelligence assessments, intelligence sources, or
methods employed in anti-terrorism, law enforcement, or national security activities. Depending
on the information in question, the confidentiality impact can be moderate, high, or involve
national security information (outside the scope of this guideline). Unauthorized disclosure of
continuity of operations information for critical infrastructures and key national assets may
require a high impact level. However, the purpose of most continuity of operations information
is to protect against inadvertent or accidental damaging events rather than against malicious
attacks. Even so, in the case of Federal government systems, hostile attacks on systems must be
considered.

The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of extracts from continuity of operations plans are
likely to have negligible to limited adverse effects on agency operations. In such cases, the
confidentiality impact would be, at most, low. Unauthorized disclosure of continuity of
operations information may inform an adversary regarding what facilities and processes are
considered to be critical. Such unauthorized disclosure may also equip an adversary with the
information necessary to attack a system so that operations are disrupted, and that recovery is
impaired. In such cases, the confidentiality impact would be, at least, moderate.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for continuity of operations information is moderate.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Errors in
continuity of operations plans that result from integrity compromise can result in serious
consequences to system recovery capabilities. These can range from incorrect telephone
numbers and e-mail addresses on notification lists to erroneous version numbers for database
back-ups and archives or software baselines, updates, and patches.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
continuity of operations information is moderate.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the continuity of operations
information.
