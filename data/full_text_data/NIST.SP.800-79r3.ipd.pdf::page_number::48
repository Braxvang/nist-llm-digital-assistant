       NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                    Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
       December 2023                                                           and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

1488                    (i) the final assessment report, (ii) the CAP, (iii) the revised operations plan, and
1489                    (iv) the [SP800-37] authorization letters for all information systems used by the
1490                    issuer. The EIMO may wish to consult other key organization participants (e.g.,
1491                    the assessor, PO) prior to submitting the authorization submission package to the
1492                    DAO. The authorization submission package can be submitted in either paper or
1493                    electronic form. The contents of the authorization submission package need to be
1494                    protected in accordance with organization policy.

1495           Authorization Phase
1496   The authorization phase consists of two tasks: (i) making an appropriate authorization decision
1497   and (ii) completing the authorization documentation. Upon completion of this phase, the EIMO
1498   will have one of the following: (i) an authorization to operate the issuer’s services, as defined in
1499   its operations plan; (ii) an interim authorization to operate under specific terms and conditions; or
1500   (iii) a denial of authorization to operate.
1501           Task 6: Authorization Decision
1502           The authorization decision task determines whether the assessment phase has been
1503           satisfactorily completed so that a recommendation on the operation of the issuer can be
1504           made with assurance. The DAO works with the assessor to review the contents of the
1505           assessment submission package, the identified and uncorrected or uncorrectable
1506           deficiencies, the potential impacts of using the issuer’s services, and the CAP to
1507           determine the final risk to the organization and the acceptability of that risk in light of the
1508           organization’s mission.
1509                    Subtask 6.1: Review the authorization decision package to see if it is complete and
1510                    if all applicable issuer controls are fully assessed using the designated assessment
1511                    procedures.
1512                    Responsibility: DAO
1513                    Guidance: Coverage for all issuer controls and proper adherence to assessment
1514                    procedures and appropriate assessment methods help create confidence in
1515                    assessment findings and is the main objective of the assessment review. Part of
1516                    the assessment review also includes understanding the impacts of the identified
1517                    deficiencies on the organization’s operations, assets, and individuals.
1518                    Subtask 6.2: Determine whether the risk to the organization’s operations, assets,
1519                    or potentially affected individuals is acceptable.
1520                    Responsibility: DAO
1521                    Guidance: After the completion of the assessment review, the DAO has a clear
1522                    understanding of the impacts of deficiencies. This helps the DAO judge which
1523                    deficiencies are of greatest concern to the organization and which can be tolerated
1524                    without creating unreasonable organization-level risk. The CAP is also considered
1525                    when determining the risk to the organization in terms of when and how the
1526                    EIMO intends to address the known deficiencies. The DAO may consult the
1527                    EIMO, assessor, or other organization officials before completing the final risk
1528                    evaluation. This risk evaluation then determines the degree of acceptability of
