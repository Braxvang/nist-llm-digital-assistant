                                                 Federal Information Systems and Organizations




 Security Automation          An information security area that includes a grouping of tools,
 Domain                       technologies, and data.

 Security Categorization      The process of determining the security category for information
 [CNSSI 1253, FIPS 199]       or an information system. Security categorization methodologies
                              are described in CNSS Instruction 1253 for national security
                              systems and in FIPS 199 for other than national security systems.

 Security Control             The testing and/or evaluation of the management, operational,
 Assessment                   and technical security controls in an information system to
 [CNSSI 4009, Adapted]        determine the extent to which the controls are implemented
                              correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired
                              outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the
                              system.

 Security Control Assessor    The individual, group, or organization responsible for conducting
 [NISTIR 7298]                a security control assessment.

 Security Control Baseline    One of the sets of minimum security controls defined for federal
 [FIPS 200, Adapted]          information systems in NIST Special Publication 800-53 and
                              CNSS Instruction 1253.

 Security Control             The measure of correctness of implementation (i.e., how
 Effectiveness                consistently the control implementation complies with the
                              security plan) and how well the security plan meets
                              organizational needs in accordance with current risk tolerance.

 Security Control             A situation in which an information system or application
 Inheritance                  receives protection from security controls (or portions of security
 [CNSSI 4009]                 controls) that are developed, implemented, assessed, authorized,
                              and monitored by entities other than those responsible for the
                              system or application; entities either internal or external to the
                              organization where the system or application resides. See
                              Common Control.

 Security Controls            The management, operational, and technical controls (i.e.,
 [FIPS 199]                   safeguards or countermeasures) prescribed for an information
                              system to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of
                              the system and its information.

 Security Domain              A domain that implements a security policy and is administered
 [CNSSI 4009]                 by a single authority.

 Security Impact Analysis     The analysis conducted by an organizational official to determine
 [NIST SP 800-53]             the extent to which changes to the information system have
                              affected the security state of the system.

 Security Incident            See Incident.
