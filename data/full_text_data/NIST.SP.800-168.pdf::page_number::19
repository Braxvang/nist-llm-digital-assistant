    .01s1, .015s1, .02s1, .025s1}, where s1 is the size of f1 in bytes and the values of X are
    rounded to the nearest whole number.

For every choice of file size and modification method, each test has two additional
parameters: file count and number of runs. The former specifies the number of files in
the test set; the latter specifies the number of independent test runs to be executed
(where each run creates its own new test set).
Testing with real data. As already mentioned, two of the main challenges in testing
with real data are the choice of representative samples, and the establishment of ground
truth. In respect to the former the choice depends, to some degree, on the expected
characteristics of the target data. For example, for general evaluation of artifacts found
on the Internet, the govdocs-corpus is a good starting point.

The focus of this section is to provide an approach for establishing ground truth using
automated means. The proposed approach is to use the longest common substring (LCS)
as the reference metric and to characterize the behavior of bytewise approximate
matching algorithms with respect to this metric.

Using a string comparison algorithm as a reference is a natural choice given that the
algorithms treat the data objects as plain strings with no attempt to parse or interpret
them. LCS should be considered a first-order approximation; two objects may have a lot
more in common than what the LCS result suggests, so further refinements are to be
expected at a later stage.

Given an unordered pair of files (f1, f2), define the absolute (La) and relative (Lr) results
as follows:

                    La = alcsa(f1, f2), where 0 ≤ La ≤ min(|f1 |, |f2 |).                       (2)

                    Lr =                      , where 0 ≤ Lr ≤ 1.                               (3)

where |f | denotes the file size in bytes.

Broadly, any two strings sharing a substring are related; however, we suggest a more practical
lower bound on the minimum amount of commonality to declare two files related.
Specifically, we require that the absolute size La is at least 100 (bytes) and that the relative
result Lr exceeds 0.5% of the size of the smaller file. More formally, the true positive function
T Plcs ( f1 , f2 ) is defined as

                    T Plcs (f1, f2) ≡ La ≥ 100 ∧ Lr ≥ .01                                        (4)

(Note: result of Lr is rounded and thus 0.5 is equal to 1.)
Clearly, the true negative function T Nlcs (f1, f2) = ¬T Plcs (f1, f2).

Approximate ground truth LCS is a well-studied problem and has known solutions of
quadratic time complexity–O(mn), where m and n are the string lengths. Given that files can be
large, the exact solution quickly becomes too burdensome to be practical. Therefore, we
suggest an approximation of the longest common substring which, by design, provides a lower
bound on LCS; details are given in Appendix 2.
