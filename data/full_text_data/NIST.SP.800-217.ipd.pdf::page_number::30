      NIST SP 800-217 ipd                          Guidelines for PIV Federation (Initial Public Draft)
      January 2023


758   5.   Requirements of IdPs and RPs
759   This section is normative.
760   This section details the requirements for IdPs and RPs in a PIV federation context.

761   5.1. IdP Requirements
762   PIV IdPs SHALL follow all requirements for IdPs enumerated in [SP800-63C] in
763   addition to the applicable requirements in this section.
764   All assertions generated by a PIV IdP SHALL follow the requirements enumerated
765   in [SP800-63C]. In addition, all assertions for PIV federation need to follow the
766   requirements in Sec. 6.2.

767   5.1.1. Authentication Requirements
768   The PIV IdP SHALL authenticate the subscriber using a valid and current PIV credential,
769   which can be a PIV Card or derived PIV credential bound to the PIV identity account.
770   Note that [FIPS201] specifies that derived PIV credentials must only be bound to a PIV
771   identity account by the issuing department or agency responsible for managing that PIV
772   identity account. By implication, PIV IdPs operated by third parties must still be in a
773   position to verify the validity and currency of PIV credentials issued by the home agency.
774   For PKI-based authenticators, this could be accomplished using PIV authentication
775   certificates and the accompanying certificate status infrastructure. However, because
776   non-PKI-based derived PIV credentials can on be verified by the issuing home agency,
777   PIV IdPs operated by third parties would need close integration with those issuing home
778   agencies to capable of verifying those authenticators.
779   The IdP SHALL issue an assertion within a valid session lifetime at the IdP. The IdP
780   SHOULD require a recent successful authentication with a PIV credential.

781   If the RP requests a maximum authentication age, the IdP SHALL reauthenticate the
782   subscriber if the requested authentication age from the RP is not met by the subscriber’s
783   current session at the IdP.
784   The IdP SHALL issue assertions only for PIV identity accounts that the IdP knows to be
785   valid and current (e.g., the PIV identity account and associated PIV card have not been
786   terminated). To provide timely and accurate status information, home IdPs SHOULD
787   derive this directly from the issuing agency’s authoritative records, such as its enterprise
788   identity management system. For other PIV IdPs using PKI-based PIV credentials as
789   the only authenticators, the status of the PIV identity account could be inferred from the
790   validity of the certificate used for authentication, including revocation and expiration
791   checks. Note that certificate status does not necessarily reflect the status of the associated
792   PIV identity account. A PIV certificate could be expired, or revoked due to compromise,
793   for a cardholder whose PIV identity account remains in good standing. Similarly, a

                                                   20
