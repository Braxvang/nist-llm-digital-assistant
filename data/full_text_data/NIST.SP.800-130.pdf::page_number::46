SP 800-130                                                              August 2013



    vi. When the protection was verified.

FR:6.8 For each non-cryptographic trusted process used in the Trusted Association
Protections metadata element (item u above), the CKMS design shall specify the
following:
    i. The identifier that is used to distinguish this process from other processes, and
    ii. A description of the process or a pointer to a description of the process.

FR:6.9 The CKMS design shall specify the accuracy and precision required for dates and
times used by the system.

FR:6.10 The CKMS design shall specify what authoritative time sources are used to
achieve the required accuracy.

FR:6.11 The CKMS design shall specify how authoritative time sources are used to
achieve the required accuracy8.

FR:6.12 The CKMS design shall specify which dates, times, and functions require a
trusted third-party time stamp.

6.2.2 Required Key and Metadata Information
A CKMS design needs to make certain information clear regarding how keys and
metadata are managed.

FR:6.13 For each key type, the CKMS design shall specify the following information
regarding keys and metadata elements:
    a) The key type
    b) The cryptoperiod (for static keys)
    c) The method of generation
       i. The RNG used
       ii. A key generation specification (e.g., [FIPS 186] for signature keys, [SP 800-
            56A] for Diffie-Hellman key establishment keys)
    d) For each metadata element, include
       i. The source of the metadata
       ii. How the metadata is vetted
    e) The method of key establishment
       i. The key transport scheme (if used)
       ii. The key agreement scheme (if used)
       iii. The protocol name (if a named protocol is used)
    f) The disclosure protections (e.g., key confidentiality, physical security)
    g) The modification protections (e.g., a MAC or a digital signature)

 For example, the use of an NTP server and an NTP protocol to synchronize with the
authoritative time source.
