4. [FIPS 197]
   FIPS 197: Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), November 2001,
   www.csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsFIPS.html.
   FIPS 197 specifies a symmetric key block cipher encryption/decryption algorithm.
   The standard supports key sizes of 128, 192, and 256 bits and a block size of 128 bits.
   Compliance with this Standard is validated under the NIST Cryptographic Algorithm
   Validation Program (CAVP).

5. [FIPS 198]
   FIPS 198-1: The Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code (HMAC), July 2008,
   www.csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsFIPS.html.
   FIPS 198-1 describes a keyed-hash message authentication code (HMAC), a
   mechanism for message authentication using cryptographic hash functions. HMAC
   can be used with a NIST-approved cryptographic hash function, in combination with
   a shared secret key. Compliance with this Standard is validated under the NIST
   Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP).

6. [IPSEC]
   Various IPSEC RFCs under http://www.ietf.org/dyn/wg/charter/ipsecme-charter.html.
   These IPSEC RFCs describe how authentication, encryption, and integrity security
   services are provided for the IP packets. The RFCs cover the format of the security
   services payload for the packets, cipher suites for the security services, and key
   management techniques for the cryptographic algorithms used to provide the security
   services.

7. [ISO/IEC 15408 Parts 1-3]
   Information technology – Security techniques – Evaluation criteria for IT security,
   Part 1: Introduction and general model
   Part 2: Security functional requirements
   Part 3: Security assurance components
   http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue.
   ISO/IEC 15408-1:2009 establishes the general concepts and principles of an IT
   security evaluation and specifies the general model of evaluation given by various
   parts of ISO/IEC 15408, which in its entirety is meant to be used as the basis for the
   evaluation of the security properties of IT products.
   ISO/IEC 15408-2:2005 defines the required structure and content of security
   functional components for the purpose of a security evaluation. It includes a
   catalogue of functional components that will meet the common security functionality
   requirements of many IT products and systems.
   ISO/IEC 15408-3:2008 defines the assurance requirements of the evaluation criteria.
   It includes the evaluation assurance levels that define a scale for measuring the
   assurance for component targets of evaluation (TOEs), the composed assurance
   packages that define a scale for measuring the assurance for composed TOEs, the
   individual assurance components from which the assurance levels and packages are
