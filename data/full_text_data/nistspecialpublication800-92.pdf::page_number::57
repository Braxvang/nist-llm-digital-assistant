5.4     Manage Long-Term Log Data Storage

Administrators typically are responsible for managing the storage of their logs. They should be aware of
the organization’s requirements and guidelines for log data storage, so that logs are retained for the
required period of time. If log data has already been transferred to the log management infrastructure,
system-level administrators might not need to do any long-term storage of log data. If administrators
need to store the log data for a retention period, and this period is relatively short (days or weeks), it
might be adequate to keep them online and capture them in regular system backups. If the retention
period is relatively long (months or years), administrators typically need to do the following:

       Choose a log format for the data to be archived. If the logs are in a proprietary format,
        administrators should determine whether the logs should be archived in that format, in a standard
        format, or both. It might be difficult to read a proprietary format log years later (e.g., the
        software that generated it is no longer available or no longer supports the format). However,
        proprietary format logs might contain additional and more detailed information not present in
        standard format logs, so it might be valuable to archive such logs in both proprietary and standard
        formats, if sufficient archival storage space is available.
       Archive the log data. Possible media format choices include backup tapes, CDs, DVDs, storage
        area networks (SAN), and specialized log archival appliances or servers. When selecting a media
        format, administrators should be mindful of the retention period for the data. If a particular type
        of media is only intended to last for five years, and the log data needs to be retained for longer
        than that, either another type of media should be chosen or plans should be made to transfer the
        data from one media to another within the next five years. Administrators should also consider
        whether the hardware and software needed to access the media are likely to still be available at
        the end of the retention period. Administrators should periodically review the formats of
        archived media to determine if any are at risk of becoming inaccessible, then transfer any such
        data from one media to another.
       Verify the integrity of the transferred logs. As described in Section 3.1, this is typically done
        through the creation of message digests for each log file. If a log file is changed and its message
        digest recalculated, the new message digest will not match the old message digest.
        Administrators should compare the message digest for each original log with the message digest
        for each copy of the log file to ensure that the file has not been changed during transfer.
       Store the media securely. Administrators are responsible for ensuring that the media receives
        adequate physical protection. The first component of this is preventing unauthorized physical
        access, which typically involves keeping the media in a secure area and monitoring access to the
        secure area. The second component of physical protection is ensuring that the proper
        environmental controls are in place, such as humidity and temperature controls, and protection
        from water, magnetism, and other things that might damage media. Also, archival media is often
        stored at an offsite facility.
Administrators are also responsible for ensuring that the archived logs are destroyed properly when the
required data retention period has ended. This includes logs stored on systems, regular backups, and
archival media. Administrators should follow their organization’s media sanitization policies and
procedures when destroying the logs. Examples of how logs might be destroyed include logical
