                                               TECHNICAL GUIDE TO INFORMATION SECURITY TESTING AND ASSESSMENT



The following examples show how multiple technical techniques can complement one another and how
selection of techniques can relate to risk concerns. These examples are intended as illustrations rather
than as recommended combinations of techniques for organizations’ assessments. Each case is different,
and organizations should evaluate the requirements and objectives of each assessment when determining
an appropriate combination of techniques.

       Identify technical weaknesses in a system’s security architecture and security configuration while
        minimizing risk from the assessment itself.

          –   Step 1. Documentation Review. Identify policy and procedure weaknesses and security
              architecture flaws.

          –   Step 2. Ruleset and Security Configuration Review. Identify deviations from
              organizational security policies in the forms of the system’s network security architecture and
              system security flaws.

          –   Step 3. Wireless Scanning. Identify rogue wireless devices within proximity of the system,
              and additional security architecture weaknesses related to the wireless networks used by the
              system.

          –   Step 4. Network Discovery and Vulnerability Scanning. Identify all active hosts within
              the system and their known vulnerabilities.
       Identify and validate technical weaknesses in a system’s security architecture and security
        configuration—validation will include attempts to exploit selected vulnerabilities.

          –   Step 1. Ruleset and Security Configuration Review. Identify deviations from
              organizational security policies in the forms of the system’s network security architecture and
              system security flaws.

          –   Step 2. Network Discovery and Vulnerability Scanning. Identify all active hosts within
              the system and their known vulnerabilities.

          –   Step 3. Penetration Test with Social Engineering. Validate vulnerabilities in the system.
       Identify and validate technical weaknesses in a system’s security architecture and security
        configuration from an external attacker’s viewpoint—validation will include attempting to exploit
        some or all vulnerabilities. Evaluate the effectiveness of the organization’s audit capabilities for
        attacks against the system.

          –   Step 1. External Penetration Testing. Perform external network discovery, port scanning,
              vulnerability scanning, and attacks to identify and validate system vulnerabilities.

          –   Step 2. Log Review. Review security control audit logs for the system to determine their
              effectiveness in capturing information relating to external penetration testing activities.
6.4     Assessment Logistics

Addressing logistics for technical assessments includes identifying all resources required for conducting
the assessment; the environment from which to test; and required hardware and software testing tools.
These are addressed in the subsections below.

In addition to the standard logistical requirements discussed below, it is equally important to identify
logistical requirements for each test during the planning phase. Depending on the scope and the
