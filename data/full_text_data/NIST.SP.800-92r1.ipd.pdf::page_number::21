      NIST SP 800-92r1 ipd                                                     Cybersecurity Log Management
      October 2023                                                                            Planning Guide

545      10. TS-2.10: Determine how log generation should or must be protected.
546      11. TS-2.11: Define how the protection of log generation should or must be monitored and
547          validated to ensure that logging is enabled and functioning normally.
548   Supporting information for tasks: Recording more log data is not necessarily better. Generally,
549   organizations should only require logging the necessary data and also have recommendations for
550   which other types and sources of data should be logged if resources permit. Some organizations
551   choose to have all or nearly all log data generated and stored for at least a short period of time in
552   case it is needed; this approach favors security considerations over usability and resource usage.
553   When establishing requirements and recommendations, organizations should be flexible since
554   each host is different and will log different amounts of data than other hosts. The logging
555   behavior of a host may also change rapidly due to an upgrade, patch, or configuration change.
556   Organizations may permit administrators to temporarily reconfigure log sources during adverse
557   conditions, such as unsuccessful malware attacks that cause the same type of log entry to be
558   generated many times. These configuration changes should be performed as a last resort and be
559   as precise as possible. Log source administrators should inform logging infrastructure
560   administrators of such configuration changes to ensure that log management processes are
561   modified if needed.
562   In some cases, software licenses may need to be upgraded in order to generate the required or
563   desired information for logs.

565   Rev. 2, Computer Security Incident Handling Guide [SP800-61r2].

566             TS-3, Define Target State for Log Storage and Transfer
567   [Tasks]                                                                 [Previous Play] [Next Play]
568   Summary: Define your organization’s log storage and transfer-related requirements and goals.
569   This should take log source types, log event types, system locations, and any other pertinent
570   attributes into account. The desired outcome is a comprehensive set of prioritized requirements
571   and goals for cybersecurity log storage and transfer that help define your organization’s target
572   state.
573   Tasks to perform include the following (not necessarily in order):
574      1. TS-3.1: Determine how long each log event should or must be preserved at the log
575         source.
576      2. TS-3.2: Determine which events, if any, should or must be transferred to a log
577         infrastructure from log sources, which log infrastructure systems should receive the
578         transferred event data, and which data characteristics should or must be transferred for
579         each event. This may necessitate estimating network bandwidth needs for log transfers.
580      3. TS-3.3: Determine how event correlation across log sources should or must be performed
581         within the log infrastructure.
