E.1.    Anomaly Detection
Principle: Any salient anomaly in the system or its environment is detected in a timely manner
that enables effective response action.
Note: The purpose of anomaly detection is to identify the need to take corrective action to address a loss
condition that has occurred or that will occur if conditions that affect the system behavior are allowed to
persist. Anomaly detection is critical to achieving loss control objectives to prevent and limit loss and its
adverse effects. The detection of such anomalies requires monitoring system behaviors and outcomes to
determine when any deviations from the design intent occur. It also requires monitoring conditions in the
environment to identify or forecast those conditions that can cause an anomaly in the system if corrective
action is not taken.
The “timely manner” aspect of anomaly detection reflects the urgency to detect emerging loss conditions
as early as possible. Early detection increases response action options, such as graduated response
options, and ensures that response actions have sufficient time to have an effect. When the determination
of response involves humans in the loop, early detection enables a more reasoned judgment of proper
response.
Anomaly detection can be implemented at varying levels of abstraction (e.g., system, sub-system,
assembly, function, mechanism) and may occur in periodic, aperiodic, or event-driven manners. The basis
for anomaly detection within the system is the expectation that the system behaviors, outcomes, and
interactions produced are expected to remain consistent, adhere to some norm, or are deterministic across
all system states and modes. The types of anomalies include those associated with the results of system
behavior; state consistency; continuity of function; integrity, correctness, and trustworthiness of system
elements; system configuration; and the abuse or misuse of the system.
The basis for anomaly detection in the environment differs from that in the system because the
environment is not under the control of the system. The environment presents a wide range of adversity to
the system, and the system is designed to achieve its design intent within defined bounds of
