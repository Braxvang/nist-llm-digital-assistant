                                                                                        GUIDE TO SSL VPNS



 All employees should be able to access the main enterprise applications on the intranet servers from
  organization-managed hosts. An organization-managed host has a firewall, antivirus software, and a
  registry key indicating that it is managed by the organization.
 When these same users log in from any other host such as a PC at a kiosk or in an Internet café, they
  should be able to access only a limited set of Web-based applications such as email and calendaring.
  The only condition for any host is that, if it is running a Windows operating system, it must be using
  one or more specific versions of Windows, with each specific version using the most current set of
  updates.
 Executives have the same access rights as other employees, as well as access to the executive file
  share on the administrative server. The executives are only given this access from organization-
  managed hosts.
 Members of the sales group have the same access rights as other employees. In addition, they should
  have full access to the sales database and the sales file share on the sales server when they are using
  their own organization-managed hosts; from other hosts, they can only access the sales file share on
  the sales folder.
 Business partners should be able to access the extranet partner server from specified IP addresses only
  Monday to Friday between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. Eastern time.
 In addition to all other resources, network administrators should have access to a range of subnets that
  are assigned to network infrastructure devices. They only have this access if they are using their
  organization-managed hosts.
Note that these conditions are not mutually exclusive and can be fulfilled simultaneously. So a user who
logs in from an organization-managed host also satisfies the any host condition.

The organization has decided to use the following access types for the various resources:

 The corporate applications are accessible by network extension because there are a broad number of
  them on multiple servers. Access to routers, switches, and other network infrastructure are also
  accessible through network extension. Packet filtering is used to limit access to the specific
  application servers.
 The Web applications are accessible by proxy because they are already available by Web browser.
 The executive file share is accessible by proxying so that executives can use the file share in the same
  fashion whether connecting remotely or internally.
 The sales database is accessible by proxying because database administrators require direct access to
  the database server. The application is therefore not able to be translated.
 Both the sales file share and file shares on the extranet partner server are made accessible by
  translation, where all file sharing takes place in a Web browser.
Table 4-1 shows the resources and groups listed with conditions for access.
