 1   Certain commercial entities, equipment, or materials may be identified in this document in order to describe an
 2   experimental procedure or concept adequately. Such identification is not intended to imply recommendation or
 3   endorsement by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), nor is it intended to imply that the
 4   entities, materials, or equipment are necessarily the best available for the purpose.

 5   There may be references in this publication to other publications currently under development by NIST in
 6   accordance with its assigned statutory responsibilities. The information in this publication, including concepts and
 7   methodologies, may be used by federal agencies even before the completion of such companion publications. Thus,
 8   until each publication is completed, current requirements, guidelines, and procedures, where they exist, remain
 9   operative. For planning and transition purposes, federal agencies may wish to closely follow the development of
10   these new publications by NIST.

11   Organizations are encouraged to review all draft publications during public comment periods and provide feedback
12   to NIST. Many NIST cybersecurity publications, other than the ones noted above, are available at
