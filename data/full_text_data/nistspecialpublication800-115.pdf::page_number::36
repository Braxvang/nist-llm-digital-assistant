salted password hashing mechanisms to reduce the effectiveness of rainbow tables and other forms of
password cracking.

Password crackers can be run during an assessment to ensure policy compliance by verifying acceptable
password composition. For example, if the organization has a password expiration policy, then password
crackers can be run at intervals that coincide with the intended password lifetime. Password cracking that
is performed offline produces little or no impact on the system or network, and the benefits of this
operation include validating the organization’s password policy and verifying policy compliance.

5.2     Penetration Testing

Penetration testing is security testing in which assessors mimic real-world attacks to identify methods for
circumventing the security features of an application, system, or network. It often involves launching real
attacks on real systems and data that use tools and techniques commonly used by attackers. Most
penetration tests involve looking for combinations of vulnerabilities on one or more systems that can be
used to gain more access than could be achieved through a single vulnerability. Penetration testing can
also be useful for determining:

       How well the system tolerates real world-style attack patterns
       The likely level of sophistication an attacker needs to successfully compromise the system
       Additional countermeasures that could mitigate threats against the system
       Defenders’ ability to detect attacks and respond appropriately.
Penetration testing can be invaluable, but it is labor-intensive and requires great expertise to minimize the
risk to targeted systems. Systems may be damaged or otherwise rendered inoperable during the course of
penetration testing, even though the organization benefits in knowing how a system could be rendered
inoperable by an intruder. Although experienced penetration testers can mitigate this risk, it can never be
fully eliminated. Penetration testing should be performed only after careful consideration, notification,
and planning.

Penetration testing often includes non-technical methods of attack. For example, a penetration tester
could breach physical security controls and procedures to connect to a network, steal equipment, capture
sensitive information (possibly by installing keylogging devices), or disrupt communications. Caution
should be exercised when performing physical security testing—security guards should be made aware of
how to verify the validity of tester activity, such as via a point of contact or documentation. Another non-
technical means of attack is the use of social engineering, such as posing as a help desk agent and calling
to request a user’s passwords, or calling the help desk posing as a user and asking for a password to be
reset. Additional information on physical security testing, social engineering techniques, and other non-
technical means of attack included in penetration testing lies outside the scope of this publication.

5.2.1     Penetration Testing Phases

Figure 5-1 represents the four phases of penetration testing. 18 In the planning phase, rules are identified,
management approval is finalized and documented, and testing goals are set. The planning phase sets the
groundwork for a successful penetration test. No actual testing occurs in this phase.

      This is an example of how the penetration process can be divided into phases. There are many acceptable ways of grouping
      the actions involved in performing penetration testing.
