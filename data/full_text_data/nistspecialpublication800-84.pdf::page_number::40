GUIDE TO TEST, TRAINING, AND EXERCISE PROGRAMS FOR IT PLANS AND CAPABILITIES



safety of an individual is at stake or the security of the organization or its data is in question, the test
director and any member of the test team should have the ability to terminate the test immediately.

Following the conclusion of the test, the test director and data collectors should conduct an informal test
debrief with participants, often referred to as a hotwash. The test director leads the hotwash and requests
feedback from the participants and data collectors. Immediately following the test, the data collectors and
participants should be asked to provide the test director with their notes or any forms completed during
the course of the test and the hotwash session.

6.5    Evaluate the Test

During the evaluation phase, a member of the design team or another selected staff member should
develop an after action report that determines how well the tested systems or components functioned.
The introduction to the after action report should document background information about the test such as
the scope, objectives, and tests. The after action report should also document observations made by the
test team during the test and recommendations for enhancing the IT plan that had its components or
systems tested, along with associated procedures and components. The after action report should also
include a list of test participants and may provide information from any participant surveys that were
distributed during the hotwash to solicit feedback.

The after action report typically takes a few days to prepare. In the event that critical lapses in security or
safety are noted, the test director should not wait until the final report is created to notify management.
An informal report should be generated immediately with any critical changes that should be made, with
the full report following in a reasonable amount of time. A formal debrief is sometimes conducted after a
test so that the test director, plan coordinator, and other management staff can discuss the results of the
test. Stakeholders typically review the report and may provide suggestions for minor wording changes,
such as strengthening a recommendation to ensure that its importance is clear.

Following the development of the after action report, the plan coordinator might assign action items to
select personnel to update the IT plan that had its components or systems tested. The plan coordinator
should then update the plan, if appropriate, by implementing recommendations made in the after action
report. It may also be necessary to brief additional managers on the results of the test, update other
security-related documents, and perform other actions based on the test.

6.6    Summary

Tests are evaluation tools that use quantifiable metrics or expected outcomes to validate the operability of
one or more IT systems or system components that are identified as critical in an IT plan. Tests can take
several forms, including component testing (testing individual hardware or software components, or
groups of related components), system testing (testing complete systems), and comprehensive testing
(testing all systems and components that support an IT plan). A test is conducted in as close to an
operational environment as possible, which means that the test should be conducted in a manner that
resembles the everyday work environment in which the system or component is found. If possible, an
actual test of the components or systems used to conduct daily operations for the organization should be
used. Tests can potentially be disruptive to an organizationâ€™s operations, so tests are sometimes
performed on systems that mimic the actual operational systems, especially if there is not strong
confidence that the tests will be completely successful.

One commonly used methodology for planning and performing test events has the following phases:
