Special Publication 800-85B                                       PIV Data Model Testing Specification


The PIV data model test includes the testing of the following aspects of PIV Data:

Basic Encoding Rules Tag-Length-Value (BER-TLV) Format Conformance as per Appendix A
of SP80073 for all objects.
Conformance of the Signature Block to Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) Signature format
for all signed objects.
Conformance to Common Biometric Exchange Formats Framework (CBEFF) Profile and
American National Standards Institute (ANSI) International Committee for Information
Technology Standards (INCITS) 378 and 385 Profiles respectively for Card Holder Fingerprint
and Facial Image objects respectively.
Conformance to Federal Identity Credentialing Committee (FICC) profiles for all Public Key
Infrastructure (PKI) Certificates.

2.2       Test Methodology
The data model testing was developed through the following two-step process:

Create derived test requirements (DTRs) — These are constructed from the data format and
content requirements in FIPS201, SP80073, SP80076, and SP80078 specifications.
      +    Develop test assertions — These provide the tests that need to be performed to test each
           of the DTRs. The test assertions will include testing of data formats, values in the
           individual fields, relationship among values in multiple fields and validate the
           computations. Also, the test assertions include testing of the optional fields when they
           are present.
Figure 2 depicts the test methodology adopted to provide complete guidance for testing PIV
conformant products. SP80085A provides the DTRs and test assertions for the interfaces to the
PIV smart card and the PIV middleware. This document provides DTRs and test assertions for
the identity credentials stored on the PIV card.
