Special Publication 800-73-4          Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification – Part 1: PIV
                                   Card Application Namespace, Data Model and Representation



1.      Introduction

Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) called for a common identification
standard to be adopted governing the interoperable use of identity credentials to allow physical
and logical access to Federally controlled facilities and information systems. Federal Information
Processing Standard 201 [FIPS201], Personal Identity Verification (PIV) of Federal Employees
and Contractors, was developed to establish standards for identity credentials. Special Publication
800-73-4 (SP 800-73-4) contains technical specifications to interface with the smart card (PIV
Card 2) to retrieve and use the identity credentials.

1.1     Purpose

FIPS 201 defines procedures for the PIV lifecycle activities including identity proofing,
registration, PIV Card issuance, and PIV Card usage. FIPS 201 also specifies that the identity
credentials must be stored on a smart card. SP 800-73-4 contains the technical specifications to
interface with the smart card to retrieve and use the identity credentials. The specifications reflect
the design goals of interoperability and PIV Card functions. The goals are addressed by
specifying a PIV data model, card edge interface, and application programming interface.
Moreover, this document enumerates requirements where the international integrated circuit card
standards [ISO7816] include options and branches. The specifications go further by constraining
implementers’ interpretations of the normative standards. Such restrictions are designed to ease
implementation, facilitate interoperability, and ensure performance, in a manner tailored for PIV
applications.

1.2     Scope

SP 800-73-4 specifies the PIV data model, application programming interface (API), and card
interface requirements necessary to comply with the use cases, as defined in Section 6 of FIPS
201 and further described in this document. Interoperability is defined as the use of PIV identity
credentials such that client-application programs, compliant card applications, and compliant
integrated circuits cards (ICC) can be used interchangeably by all information processing systems
across Federal agencies. SP 800-73-4 defines the PIV data elements’ identifiers, structure, and
format. SP 800-73-4 also describes the client application programming interface and card
command interface for use with the PIV Card.

This part, SP 800-73-4, Part 1 – PIV Card Application Namespace, Data Model and
Representation, specifies the PIV Card Application Namespace, the PIV Data Model and its
logical representation on the PIV Card, and is a companion document to FIPS 201.

1.3     Effective Date

In order to comply with the implementation schedule in FIPS 201-2, Federal departments and
agencies shall implement these recommendations immediately upon publication, with the


2 A physical artifact (e.g., identity card, “smart” card) issued to an individual that contains a PIV Card Application

which stores identity credentials (e.g., photograph, cryptographic keys, digitized fingerprint representation) so that the
claimed identity of the cardholder can be verified against the stored credentials by an automated process (computer
readable and verifiable) or by another person (human readable and verifiable).
