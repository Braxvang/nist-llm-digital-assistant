SP 800-89                                                                                November 2006



     1. t1 is a time that either precedes or is equal to the time at which the owner’s
        currently held keys – along with any other required data – were made available to
        the (trusted) party performing the regeneration5;
     2. tG is the time that the regenerated key(s) were actually compared to those
        currently held by the owner; and
     3. t2 is a time that either follows or is equal to the time at which the regenerated
        key(s) were actually compared to those currently held by the owner.
The entity that regenerates the key(s) is encouraged to do so as soon after t1 as possible,
and t2 should be acquired as soon after regeneration and comparison as possible.
Assuming that the regenerated key(s) have been successfully compared to the keys
currently held by the owner, and that an acceptable degree of accuracy (d) has been
selected by the relying parties, the estimated assurance_time (tA) shall be determined as
follows:
    a. If t2 – t1 ≤ d units, and the source of t1 is at least as trustworthy as the source of t2,
       then time t1 shall be used as the assurance_time.
    b. If t2 – t1 ≤ d units, and the source of t1 is less trustworthy than t2, then time t2 shall
       be used as the assurance_time.
    c. If t2 – t1 > d units, then assurance of possession has not been provided, and there
       is no value assigned to assurance_time.
If the regenerated key(s) do not match those currently held by the owner, then assurance
of private key possession has not been provided, and there is no value assigned to
assurance_time.
6.3.2.2    Assigning the Initial Assurance Level for the Regeneration of Keys
If the regenerated key(s) have been successfully compared to the keys currently held by
the owner, and the assurance_time (tA) is assigned as in Section 6.3.2.1, then the initial
assurance level should be assigned as follows:
    a. If the time used to determine the assurance_time was obtained from a timestamp
       token provided by a TTA that is trusted by the relying parties, then the initial
       assurance level is HIGH.
    b. If the time used to determine the assurance_time was not obtained from a TTA,
       but was obtained from a source whose accuracy is trusted by the relying parties,
       then the initial assurance level is MEDIUM.
    c. If the time used to determine the assurance_time was obtained from a source of
       unknown accuracy, then the initial assurance level is LOW.

  For example, t1 is the time that the owner provides the keys to its own regeneration process, or the time
that a TTP that will be performing the regeneration is provided with the keys by the owner.
