NIST SP 800-219r1                                                     Automated Secure Configuration

   mSCP Components
This section provides an overview of several components of the mSCP: security baseline files,
configuration profiles and scripts, content generation scripts, customization capabilities, and
directories. More information about all of these is available at the GitHub wiki.

       Baselines and Benchmarks
The mSCP includes both baselines and benchmarks. A baseline is a catalog of recommended
configuration settings, not a checklist or benchmark, and should be customized based on the
organization’s risk profile. Implementing every item is not likely to be possible or sensible in
many operational scenarios. Baselines can be used to assist in the creation of security
benchmarks. A benchmark differs from a baseline in that it defines values in addition to a set of
controls. Benchmarks are published by organizations that have made risk-based decisions, such
as DISA and CIS. Organizations can also define their own benchmark. These values are called
Organization-Defined Values (ODVs), and they exist throughout the baselines and can be set
during customization.

       Security Baseline Files
In the mSCP, a security baseline is defined in a Yet Another Markup Language (YAML) file. A
YAML file is a human-readable file format commonly used by configuration files where data are
stored and/or transmitted. A baseline YAML file consists of the following required fields:
   •   title – A human-readable name for the baseline

   •   description – A short description of the baseline, including its use case and target
       operating system (OS) version
   •   authors – Developers of the baseline

   •   profile – The security content portion of the baseline
           o section – A keyword for organizing settings
           o rules – The names of the rule files that are a part of this baseline
The following code provides a partial example of a YAML file that illustrates the use of these
fields (with field names bolded):
