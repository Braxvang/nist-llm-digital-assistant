ESTABLISHING WIRELESS ROBUST SECURITY NETWORKS: A GUIDE TO IEEE 802.11I



     Data frames, which encapsulate packets from upper layer protocols, such as IP, which in turn
      might contain application data (e.g., e-mail, Web pages).
     Management frames, which include informational probes and beacons, and messages related to
      the management of association and authentication events.
     Control frames, which are used for requesting and controlling access to the wireless media, such
      as sending an acknowledgement after receiving a data frame.
By grouping the IEEE 802.11 frame exchanges by function, IEEE 802.11 operation may be thought of as
occurring in the following five distinct phases:

     Phase 1: Discovery. The STA identifies an AP for a WLAN with which it wishes to
      communicate. The STA locates an AP either by receiving one of the APâ€™s periodic transmissions
      of Beacon frames, or by sending a Probe Request to solicit a Probe Response from an AP. After
      the STA has identified an AP, the STA and the AP exchange frames to negotiate various
      parameters for their communications. By the end of the phase, the STA and AP have established
      a security policy that specifies several key security capabilities, such as data confidentiality and
      integrity protocols for protecting traffic, an authentication method, and a key distribution
      approach.
     Phase 2: Authentication. During this phase, the STA and AS prove their identities to each
      other. The authentication frames pass through the AP, which also blocks non-authentication
      traffic from the STA using IEEE 802.1X port-based access control. The actual authentication
      mechanism is implemented by the STA and AS using EAP, which provides a framework that
      allows the use of multiple methods for achieving authentication, including static passwords,
      dynamic passwords, and public key cryptography certificates. After authentication has been
      completed, the AAA key is installed in the STA and AS; it serves as a root key to enable the
      generation of other keys used to secure communications between the STA and AP.
     Phase 3: Key Generation and Distribution (KGD). During the KGD phase, the AP and the
      STA perform several operations that cause cryptographic keys to be generated and placed on the
      AP and the STA. The KGD phase employs two types of handshakes: a 4-Way Handshake and a
      Group Key Handshake. Both employ message encryption and integrity checking, using one of
      two confidentiality and integrity algorithms. For both types of handshakes, NIST requires the use
      of AES Key Wrap with HMAC-SHA-1-128 instead of RC4 encryption with HMAC-MD5
      because AES and SHA-1 are FIPS-approved algorithms, and RC4 and MD5 are not.
     Phase 4: Protected Data Transfer. The STA and AP share data securely, using the security
      policy and cryptographic keys established during the first three phases. Because secure data
      transfer occurs between the STA and the AP only, organizations need to consider carefully the
      security of the data during the rest of its transit (e.g., on the DS).
     Phase 5: Connection Termination. During this phase, the STA and AP tear down their secure
      connection and delete their association, thereby terminating their wireless connection.
The RSN framework introduces the authentication phase, the key generation and distribution phase, and
the connection termination phase into IEEE 802.11 operation. Before the IEEE 802.11i amendment,
IEEE 802.11 operation involved rudimentary authentication, but only as part of the discovery phase. The
RSN framework also introduces new elements and techniques into the other phases, but the basic nature
of the dialog remains the same.
