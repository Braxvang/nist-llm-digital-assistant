                                    ORGANIZATION-DEFINED PARAMETERS
       Organization-defined parameters are an important part of a security requirement specification.
       ODPs provide the flexibility and specificity needed by organizations to clearly define their CUI
       security requirements, given the diverse nature of their missions, business functions, technologies,
       operational environments, and risk tolerance. ODPs also support consistent security assessments
       in determining whether specified security requirements have been satisfied.

116
117   The term organization is used in many security requirements. The meaning of the term is context
118   dependent. For example, in a security requirement with an ODP, an organization can refer to
119   either the federal agency or the nonfederal organization establishing the parameter values for the
120   requirement.

121   Appendix C describes the security control tailoring criteria used to develop the CUI security
122   requirements and the results of the tailoring process. The appendix provides a list of controls
123   from NIST SP 800-53 that support the requirements and the controls that have been eliminated
124   from the moderate baseline in accordance with the tailoring criteria.
