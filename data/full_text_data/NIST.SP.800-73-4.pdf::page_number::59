 B.1.6 Authentication Using PIV CHUID

 The PIV CHUID may be used for authentication in several variations. The use of the PIV Card to
 implement the CHUID authentication mechanism is illustrated in Figure B-8. The minimum set of
 data that must be transmitted from the PIV Application on the Local System to the host is application
 dependent and therefore not defined in this Specification.
