4.      Key Security and Privacy Issues
Although the emergence of cloud computing is a recent development, insights into critical
aspects of security can be gleaned from reported experiences of early adopters and also from
researchers analyzing and experimenting with available cloud provider platforms and associated
technologies. The sections below highlight privacy and security-related issues that are believed
to have long-term significance for public cloud computing and, in many cases, for other cloud
computing service models. Where possible, examples of previously exhibited or identified
problems are provided to illustrate an issue. The examples are not exhaustive and may cover
only one aspect of a more general issue. For many of the issues, the specific problems discussed
have been resolved. Nevertheless, the broader issue persists in most cases and has the potential
to be expressed again in other ways among the various service models. Security and privacy
considerations that stem from information technology outsourcing also exist; they are covered in
the next chapter and complement the material below.

Because cloud computing has grown out of an amalgamation of technologies, including service
oriented architecture, virtualization, Web 2.0, and utility computing, many of the privacy and
security issues involved can be viewed as known problems cast in a new setting. The importance
of their combined effect in this setting, however, should not be discounted. Public cloud
computing does represent a thought-provoking paradigm shift from conventional norms to an
open deperimeterized organizational infrastructure—at the extreme, displacing applications from
one organization’s infrastructure to the infrastructure of another organization, where the
applications of potential adversaries may also operate.

4.1     Governance
Governance implies control and oversight by the organization over policies, procedures, and
standards for application development and information technology service acquisition, as well as
the design, implementation, testing, use, and monitoring of deployed or engaged services. With
the wide availability of cloud computing services, lack of organizational controls over employees
engaging such services arbitrarily can be a source of problems. While cloud computing
simplifies platform acquisition, it doesn't alleviate the need for governance; instead, it has the
opposite effect, amplifying that need.

The ability to reduce capital investment for computing resources, and instead, satisfy
computational needs through operational expenses is an advantage of cloud computing. Cloud
computing can lower the initial cost of deploying new services and shorten the time required to
gain a tangible benefit from the investment (i.e., accelerate the time-to-value), thus better
aligning expense with actual use.8 However, the normal processes and procedures an
organization uses to acquire computational resources as capital expenditures may be easily
bypassed by a department or an individual, and the procuration obscured under day-to-day

  Many businesses also prefer operational expenses over capital expenditures, because of tax and other financial considerations
(e.g., the ability to manage the cost of capital better and deduct operational expenses in the accounting period in which they are
incurred versus depreciating the capital expenditure over time).
