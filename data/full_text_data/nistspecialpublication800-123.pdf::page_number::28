                                                                                      GUIDE TO GENERAL SERVER SECURITY



4.2.2    Configure OS User Authentication

For servers, the authorized users who can configure the OS are limited to a small number of designated
server administrators. The users who can access the server, however, may range from a few authorized
employees to the entire Internet community. To enforce policy restrictions, if required, the server
administrator should configure the OS to authenticate a prospective user by requiring proof that the user is
authorized for such access. Even if a server allows unauthenticated access to most of its services,
administrative and other types of specialized access should be limited to specific individuals and groups.

Enabling authentication by the host computer involves configuring parts of the OS, firmware, and
applications on the server, such as the software that implements a network service. In special situations,
such as high-value/high-risk servers, organizations may also use authentication hardware, such as tokens
or one-time password devices. Use of authentication mechanisms where authentication information is
reusable (e.g., passwords) and transmitted in the clear over an untrusted network is strongly discouraged
because the information can be intercepted and used by an attacker to masquerade as an authorized user.

To ensure the appropriate user authentication is in place, take the following steps: 19

 Remove or Disable Unneeded Default Accounts—The default configuration of the OS often
  includes guest accounts (with and without passwords), administrator or root level accounts, and
  accounts associated with local and network services. The names and passwords for those accounts
  are well known. Remove (whenever possible) or disable unnecessary accounts to eliminate their use
  by attackers, including guest accounts on computers containing sensitive information. For default
  accounts that need to be retained, including guest accounts, severely restrict access to the accounts,
  including changing the names (where possible and particularly for administrator or root level
  accounts) and passwords to be consistent with the organizational password policy. Default account
  names and passwords are commonly known in the attacker community.

 Disable Non-Interactive Accounts—Disable accounts (and the associated passwords) that need to
  exist but do not require an interactive login. For Unix systems, disable the login shell or provide a
  login shell with NULL functionality (e.g., /bin/false).

 Create the User Groups—Assign users to the appropriate groups. Then assign rights to the groups,
  as documented in the deployment plan. This approach is preferable to assigning rights to individual
  users, which becomes unwieldy with large numbers of users.

 Create the User Accounts—The deployment plan identifies who will be authorized to use each
  computer and its services. Create only the necessary accounts. Permit the use of shared accounts
  only when no viable alternatives exist. Have ordinary user accounts for server administrators that are
  also users of the server.

 Configure Automated Time Synchronization—Some authentication protocols, such as Kerberos,
  will not function if the time differential between the client host and the authenticating server is
  significant, so servers using such protocols should be configured to automatically synchronize system
  time with a reliable time server. Typically the time server is internal to the organization and uses the
  Network Time Protocol (NTP) for synchronization; publicly available NTP servers are also available
  on the Internet.
