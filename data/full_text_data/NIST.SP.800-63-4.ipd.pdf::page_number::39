       NIST SP 800-63-4 ipd                                              Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022


1063         Note: If a failure in the identity system causes no measurable consequences
1064         for a category, there is no impact.
1065   Each assurance level, IAL, AAL, and FAL (if accepting or asserting a federated identity)
1066    SHALL be evaluated separately. Ideally, any evaluation will include different viewpoints
1067   such as harm to individuals, the organization, other organizations, and the nation as
1068   applicable to successful delivery of the organization’s mission. Examples of potential
1069   impacts in each of the categories include:
1070   Damage to mission delivery:
1071      • Low: at worst, slight outcome disparities exist between individuals that participate
1072        in federally funded programs and those that are eligible but unable to participate, or
1073        a limited adverse effect on organizational operations or assets, or public interests.
1074        Examples of limited adverse effects are: mission capability degradation to the
1075        extent and duration that the organization is able to perform its primary functions
1076        with noticeably reduced effectiveness, or minor damage to organizational assets or
1077        public interests.
1078      • Moderate: at worst, outcome disparities are evident between individuals that
1079        participate in federally funded programs and those that are eligible but unable
1080        to participate, or a serious adverse effect on organizational operations or assets,
1081        or public interests. Examples of serious adverse effects are: significant mission
1082        capability degradation to the extent and duration that the organization is able
1083        to perform its primary functions with significantly reduced effectiveness; or
1084        significant damage to organizational assets or public interests.
1085      • High: outcome disparities endure across communities, indicating a systemic
1086        pattern of exclusion, avoidance, or other barriers to participation in federally
1087        funded programs, or a severe or catastrophic adverse effect on organizational
1088        operations or assets, or public interests. Examples of severe or catastrophic effects
1089        are: severe mission capability degradation or loss to the extent and duration that the
1090        organization is unable to perform one or more of its primary functions; or major
1091        damage to organizational assets or public interests.
1092   Damage to trust and reputation:
1093      • Low: at worst, limited, short-term inconvenience, distress, or embarrassment to any
1094        party.
1095      • Moderate: at worst, serious short-term or limited long-term inconvenience, distress,
1096        or damage to the standing or reputation of any party.
1097      • High: severe or serious long-term inconvenience, distress, or damage to the
1098        standing or reputation of any party. This is ordinarily reserved for situations with
1099        particularly severe effects or which potentially affect many individuals.
