A STATISTICAL TEST SUITE FOR RANDOM AND PSEUDORANDOM NUMBER GENERATORS FOR CRYPTOGRAPHIC APPLICATIONS




        (c) An improper implementation of a random number generator.

            It might be plausible that a hardware RNG or a software RNG has failed due to a flaw in the
            design or due to a coding implementation error. In each case, careful review must be made to
            rule out this possibility.

        (d) Improperly written codes to harness test input data.

            Another area that needs to be scrutinized is the harnessing of test data. The test data
            produced by a (P)RNG must be processed before being used by a statistical test. For
            example, processing might include dividing the output stream from the (P)RNG into
            appropriate sized blocks, and translating the 0’s to negative ones. On occasion, it was
            determined that the failures from a statistical test were due to errors in the code used to
            process the data.



        (e) Poor mathematical routines for computing P-values

            Quality math software must be used to ensure excellent approximations whenever possible.
            In particular, the incomplete gamma function is more difficult to approximate for larger
            values of the constant a. Eventually, P-value formulas will result in bogus values due to
            difficulties arising from numerical approximations. To reduce the likelihood of this event,
            NIST has prescribed preferred input parameters.

        (f) Incorrect choices for input parameters.

            In practice, a statistical test will not provide reliable results for all seemingly valid input
            parameters. It is important to recognize that constraints are made upon tests on a test-by-test
            basis. Take the Approximate Entropy Test, for example. For a sequence length on the order
            of 106, one would expect that block lengths approaching log2 n would be acceptable.
            Unfortunately, this is not the case. Empirical evidence suggests that beyond m = 14, the
            observed test statistic will begin to disagree with the expected value (in particular, for known
            good generators, such as SHA-1). Hence, certain statistical tests may be sensitive to input
            parameters.

            Considerations must often be made regarding the numerical experimentation input
            parameters, namely: sequence length, sample size, block size and template.

            Sequence Length

            The determination as to how long sequences should be taken for the purposes of statistical
            testing is difficult to address. If one examines the FIPS 140-1 statistical tests, it is evident
            that sequences should be about 20,000 bits long.

            However, the difficulty with taking relatively short sequence lengths is problematic in the
            sense that some statistical tests, such as Maurer’s Universal Statistical Test, require extremely
            long sequence lengths. One of the reasons is the realization that asymptotic approximations
            are used in determining the limiting distribution. Statements regarding the distribution for
