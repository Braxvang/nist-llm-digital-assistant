2.     Overview of Firewall Technologies

Firewalls are devices or programs that control the flow of network traffic between networks or hosts that
employ differing security postures. While firewalls are often discussed in the context of Internet
connectivity, they may also have applicability in other network environments. For example, many
enterprise networks employ firewalls to restrict connectivity to and from the internal networks used to
service more sensitive functions, such as accounting or personnel. By employing firewalls to control
connectivity to these areas, an organization can prevent unauthorized access to its systems and resources.
Inclusion of a proper firewall provides an additional layer of security. Organizations often need to use
firewalls to meet security requirements from mandates (e.g., FISMA); some mandates, such as the
Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard, 1 specifically require firewalling.

Several types of firewall technologies are available. One way of comparing their capabilities is to look at
the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) layers that each is able to examine. TCP/IP
communications are composed of four layers that work together to transfer data between hosts. When a
user wants to transfer data across networks, the data is passed from the highest layer through intermediate
layers to the lowest layer, with each layer adding more information. The lowest layer sends the
accumulated data through the physical network, with the data then passed upwards through the layers to
its destination. Simply put, the data produced by a layer is encapsulated in a larger container by the layer
below it. The four TCP/IP layers, from highest to lowest, are shown in Figure 2-1.


           Application Layer. This layer sends and receives data for particular applications, such as
           Domain Name System (DNS), Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), and Simple Mail Transfer
           Protocol (SMTP). The application layer itself has layers of protocols within it. For example,
           SMTP encapsulates the Request for Comments (RFC) 2822 message syntax, which
           encapsulates Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME), which can encapsulate other
           formats such as Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).
           Transport Layer. This layer provides connection-oriented or connectionless services for
           transporting application layer services between networks, and can optionally ensure
           communications reliability. Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol
           (UDP) are commonly used transport layer protocols. 2
           IP Layer (also known as the Network Layer). This layer routes packets across networks.
           Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) is the fundamental network layer protocol for TCP/IP. Other
           commonly used protocols at the network layer are Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6), ICMP, and
           Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP).
           Hardware Layer (also known as the Data Link Layer). This layer handles communications on
           the physical network components. The best known data link layer protocol is Ethernet.

Addresses at the data link layer, which are assigned to network interfaces, are referred to as media access
control (MAC) addresses—an example of this is an Ethernet address that belongs to an Ethernet card.
Firewall policies rarely concern themselves with the data link layer. Addresses at the network layer are
referred to as IP addresses. The transport layer identifies specific network applications and
communication sessions as opposed to network addresses; a host may have any number of transport layer
sessions with other hosts on the same network. The transport layer may also include the notion of ports—
a destination port number generally identifies a service listening on the destination host, and a source port
usually identifies the port number on the source host that the destination host should reply to. Transport
protocols such as TCP and UDP have ports, while other transport protocols do not. The combination of
