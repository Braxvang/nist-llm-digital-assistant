NIST SP 800-82r3                                         Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023



Abstract
This document provides guidance on how to secure operational technology (OT) while
addressing their unique performance, reliability, and safety requirements. OT encompasses a
broad range of programmable systems and devices that interact with the physical environment
(or manage devices that interact with the physical environment). These systems and devices
detect or cause a direct change through the monitoring and/or control of devices, processes, and
events. Examples include industrial control systems, building automation systems, transportation
systems, physical access control systems, physical environment monitoring systems, and
physical environment measurement systems. The document provides an overview of OT and
typical system topologies, identifies common threats and vulnerabilities to these systems, and
provides recommended security countermeasures to mitigate the associated risks.

Keywords
computer security; distributed control systems (DCS); industrial control systems (ICS);
information security; network security; operational technology (OT); programmable logic
controllers (PLC); risk management; security controls; supervisory control and data acquisition
(SCADA) systems.

Reports on Computer Systems Technology
The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical
leadership for the Nation’s measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops tests, test
methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance
the development and productive use of information technology. ITL’s responsibilities include the
development of management, administrative, technical, and physical standards and guidelines for
the cost-effective security and privacy of other than national security-related information in
federal information systems. The Special Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research,
guidelines, and outreach efforts in information system security, and its collaborative activities
with industry, government, and academic organizations.
