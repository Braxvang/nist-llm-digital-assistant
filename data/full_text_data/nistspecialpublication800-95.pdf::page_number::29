Centric Enterprise Services (NCES), developed for the Global Information Grid. Both OGSA and NCES
provide a set of services available throughout an organization that are commonly used or essential to most
Web services, such as discovery, authentication, and authorization. OGSA provides a comprehensive list
of what can be offered as core services: service management, service communication, policy services, and
security services. Most SOAs use these same categories of core services but may provide differing
names:

 Service management services: assist in managing a SOA by providing mechanisms to install,
  maintain, monitor, and troubleshoot Web services.
 Service communication services: provide support for various types of communications models
  between services: queued messaging, publish-subscribe event notification, and distributed logging
  services.
 Policy services: provide a framework for creating, administering, and managing policies for the
  infrastructure; these policies cover security, resource allocation, and performance.
 Security services: provide support for different security models, mechanisms, protocols, and
  technologies that extend core Web services security protocols to support activities such as
  authorization, authentication, trust policy enforcement, and credential transformation. 17

                                Figure 2-10. Core Services Used by the Loan Service

In the loan service example, shown in Figure 2-10, core services are used to offload identification,
authentication, and authorization, among other capabilities, so that developers of the loan, rate, and credit
services do not have to implement their own security functionality. For instance, when the loan service
makes a request, it first retrieves an identifier from the identification service associated with the subject.
When the rate service receives the request, it uses the authentication service to validate both the subject
and the loan service. If authentication is successful, the rate service queries the authorization service to
ensure the loan service and subject are authorized to receive policy information.
