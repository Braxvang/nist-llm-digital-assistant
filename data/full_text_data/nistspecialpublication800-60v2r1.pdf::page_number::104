Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure benefits management
information on the ability of responsible agencies to design, develop, and implement benefit
programs that attract, retain and support current and former agency employees will have only a
limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals. The consequences of
unauthorized disclosure of the majority of benefits management information will result in a
limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Where more sensitive information is
involved, it will probably be personal information subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or information that is proprietary to a
corporation or other organization. In such cases, the consequences of unauthorized disclosure of
benefits management information could be serious (particularly in cases of exposure of large
data bases that might reveal private medical information or facilitate identity theft or other
financial fraud). (The provisional impact levels for personnel information are documented in the
Personal Identity and Authentication, Income, and Entitlement Event information types.) In such
cases, the confidentiality impact level would be moderate.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for disclosure of benefits management information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of benefits management information
depends mostly on the criticality of the information with respect to agency mission capability,
protection of agency assets, and safety of individuals. In general, the effects of modifications or
deletion of this information are generally limited with respect to agency mission capabilities or
assets.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
benefits management information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to benefits management information.
Benefits management processes are generally tolerant of delay. Typically, disruption benefits
management information can be expected to have only a limited adverse effect on agency
operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended
benefits management information is low.
