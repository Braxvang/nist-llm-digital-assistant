                                                                                                  GUIDE TO SSL VPNS



Completed                                               Design Decision
Design the Solution–Authentication
              Decide which authentication methods should be supported.
Design the Solution–Access Control
              Specify the resources to be made accessible.
              Specify the groups that have access to the resources.
              Identify the conditions under which the groups have access.
              Decide on the type of SSL VPN access to grant to users for each resource.
Design the Solution–Architecture
              Determine where SSL VPN devices should be located within the network architecture.
              Decide on routing policy including the use of NAT and split tunneling.
              Define architecture for high availability and/or load balancing.
              Determine management policies regarding who has administrative access, for what functions, to
              which interfaces, and by which authentication methods.
              Verify that dynamically downloadable agents will run on client machines.
              Customize vendor-supplied portal or develop internal portal with Application Programming Interface
              (API) hooks.
Design the Solution–Endpoint Security
              Define the host integrity checks that work in conjunction with access control policy.
              Decide which protection mechanisms (cache cleaner, virtual storage space, etc.) to use to protect
              data.
              Define timeout thresholds for inactivity and re-authentication.
Design the Solution–Cryptography
              Choose encryption and integrity protection algorithms and key lengths.
Design the Solution–Other Design Considerations
              Determine if IPv6 compliance is a requirement.
              Adjust incident response policy to include SSL VPN users.
              Define log management policy for SSL VPN devices.
              Consider redundancy for supporting systems (authentication or directory servers, etc.)



4.4   Implement and Test Prototype

After the SSL VPN solution has been designed, the next step is to implement and test a prototype of the
design. This could be done in one or more environments, including a laboratory network, a test network,
and a production network. Ideally, implementation and testing should first be performed with a
laboratory network, then a test network. Only implementations in final testing should be placed onto a
production network. Aspects of the solution to evaluate include the following:

 Connectivity. Users should be able to establish and maintain SSL VPN connections to access all
  resources that are intended to be accessible by the SSL VPN. It is important to verify that all of the
  intended applications are accessible by the operating systems and browsers that are most likely to be
  used by end users. Intermediate devices in the network such as routers and firewalls should not block
  SSL VPN connectivity, especially if the VPN device supports multiple interfaces or if multiple sites
  offer SSL VPN access.
