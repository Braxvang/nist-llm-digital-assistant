9.2.4   Summary and Evaluation

The transition was a great success, in large part because the project team did not try to reach an ideal state
in one step. Instead, it developed both interim and long-term solutions. The interim solution was
designed to respond quickly to an active threat. Someone had recently seriously compromised network
security and could easily have done so again unless immediate measures were taken to provide a defense
against a subsequent attack. In this environment, the bureau did not have the time to procure equipment
or develop a new authentication infrastructure.

Fortunately, the organization was able to build an interim IEEE 802.11 RSN with existing equipment. In
general, the deployment of PSKs significantly increases the administrative complexity of WLAN
operations, primarily because of the need to periodically rotate keys, which is often a manual process.
However, the use of PSKs in the interim solution enabled the bureau to protect its WLAN
communications quickly, giving it the time to design and implement a long-term solution based on a
centralized AS and IEEE 802.1X port-based access control.

In the long-term solution, the bureau decided to leverage its existing RADIUS-based AAA server and
integrate it with its LDAP-enabled e-mail directory. It also incorporated its existing smart card
authentication system for its IT staff, who desired additional security for access to the bureauâ€™s
management network. This configuration meant the use of EAP-TTLS with MD5-Challenge password-
based authentication for the ESS was available to all users, and EAP-TLS authentication was available for
the IT support staff with additional authentication requirements.
