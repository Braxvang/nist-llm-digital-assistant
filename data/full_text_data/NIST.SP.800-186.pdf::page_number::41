A.1.     Non-binary Curves

A.1.1. Group Law for Weierstrass Curves
For each point P on the Weierstrass curve Wa,b, the point at infinity ∅ serves as the identity
element (i.e., P + ∅ = ∅ + P = P).
For each point P = (x, y) on the Weierstrass curve Wa,b, the point −P is the point (x, −y), and one
has P + (−P) = ∅.
Let P1 = (x1, y1) and P2 = (x2, y2) be points on the Weierstrass curve Wa,b, where P1 ≠ ± P2, and let
Q = P1 + P2. Then Q = (x, y), where
          𝑥𝑥 = 𝜆𝜆2 − 𝑥𝑥1 − 𝑥𝑥2 and 𝑦𝑦 = λ(𝑥𝑥1 − 𝑥𝑥) − 𝑦𝑦1 , where λ = (𝑦𝑦2 − 𝑦𝑦1 )/(𝑥𝑥2 − 𝑥𝑥1 ).
Let P = (x1, y1) be a point on the Weierstrass curve Wa,b, where P ≠ − P, and let Q = 2P. Then Q =
(x, y), where
               𝑥𝑥 = λ2 − 2𝑥𝑥1 and 𝑦𝑦 = λ(𝑥𝑥1 − 𝑥𝑥) − 𝑦𝑦1 , where λ = (3 x1 2 + 𝑎𝑎)/2𝑦𝑦1 .

A.1.2. Group Law for Montgomery Curves
For each point P on the Montgomery curve MA,B, the point at infinity ∅ serves as the identity
element (i.e., P + ∅ = ∅ + P = P).
For each point P = (u, v) on the Montgomery curve MA,B, the point −P is the point (u, −v), and
one has P + (−P) = ∅.
Let P1 = (u1, v1) and P2 = (u2, v2) be points on the Montgomery curve MA,B, where P1 ≠ ± P2, and
let Q = P1 + P2. Then Q = (u, v), where
       𝑢𝑢 = 𝐵𝐵 λ2 − 𝐴𝐴 − 𝑢𝑢1 − 𝑢𝑢2 and 𝑣𝑣 = λ(𝑢𝑢1 − 𝑢𝑢) − 𝑣𝑣1 , where λ = (𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑣𝑣1 )/(𝑢𝑢2 − 𝑢𝑢1 ).
Let P = (u1, v1) be a point on the Montgomery curve MA,B, where P ≠ − P, and let Q = 2P. Then Q
= (u, v), where
    𝑢𝑢 = 𝐵𝐵 λ2 − 𝐴𝐴 − 2𝑢𝑢1 and 𝑣𝑣 = λ(𝑢𝑢1 − 𝑢𝑢) − 𝑣𝑣1 , where λ = (3 𝑢𝑢1 2 + 2𝐴𝐴𝑢𝑢1 + 1)/2𝐵𝐵𝑣𝑣1 .

A.1.3. Group Law for Twisted Edwards Curves
Let P1 = (x1, y1) and P2 = (x2, y2) be points on the twisted Edwards curve Ea,d, and let Q = P1 + P2.
Then Q = (x, y), where

                                              𝑥𝑥1 𝑦𝑦2 + 𝑥𝑥2 𝑦𝑦1     𝑦𝑦1 𝑦𝑦2 − 𝑎𝑎𝑥𝑥1 𝑥𝑥2
                             (𝑥𝑥, 𝑦𝑦) = �                         ,                     �.
                                            1 + 𝑑𝑑𝑥𝑥1 𝑥𝑥2 𝑦𝑦1 𝑦𝑦2 1 − 𝑑𝑑𝑥𝑥1 𝑥𝑥2 𝑦𝑦1 𝑦𝑦2
For the twisted Edwards curves specified in this Recommendation, the domain parameter a is
always a square in GF(q), whereas d is not. In this case, the addition formula above is defined for
