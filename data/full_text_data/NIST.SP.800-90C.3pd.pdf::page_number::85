       NIST SP 800-90C 3pd (Third Public Draft)                        Recommendation for RBG Constructions
       September 2022

2400       •   Since the DRBG is not directly accessible, there is no need for a separate instantiation, so
2401           there is also no need for the return of a state handle.
2402       •   The personalization string for the DRBG is “RBG3(XOR).”
2403   The RBG3(XOR)_DRBG_Instantiate function                 in   Section    6.2.1.1   uses   a   DRBG
2404   Instantiate_function to seed the Hash_DRBG:
2405               (status) = Instantiate_function(256, prediction_resistance_flag = FALSE,
2406                                        personalization_string).
2407       •   Since the DRBG is not directly accessible, there is no need for a separate instantiation, so
2408           there is also no need for the return of a state handle.
2409       •   The DRBG is instantiated at a security strength of 256 bits.
2410       •   The DRBG is notified that prediction resistance is not required using
2411           prediction_resistance_flag = FALSE. Since the DRBG will not be accessed directly,
2412           prediction_resistance will never be requested. Optionally, the implementation could omit
2413           this parameter.
2414       •   The personalization string for the DRBG is “RBG3(XOR).” It was provided in the
2415           RBG3(XOR)_DRBG_Instantiate call.
2416   Section 6.2.1.1 refers to Section 5.2.1 for further information on instantiating the DRBG.
2417   The entropy for establishing the security strength (s) of the Hash_DRBG (i.e., where s = 256 bits)
2418   is requested using the following Get_ES_Bitstring call:
2419                           (status, entropy_bitstring) = Get_ES_Bitstring(384),
2420   where 3s/2 = 384 bits of entropy are requested from the entropy source.
2421   If status = SUCCESS is returned from the Get_ES_Bitstring call, the Hash_DRBG is seeded
2422   using the entropy_ bitstring and the personalization_string (“RBG3(XOR)”). The internal state is
2423   recorded (including the 256-bit security strength of the instantiation), and status = SUCCESS is
2424   returned to the consuming application by the Instantiate_function. The RBG can be used to
2425   generate full-entropy bits.
2426   If status = FAILURE is returned from the Get_ES_Bitstring call, status = FAILURE and a Null
2427   state handle are returned to the consuming application from the Instantiate_function. `The
2428   Hash_DRBG’s internal state is not established, and the RBG cannot be used to generate bits.

2429   B.5.2. Generation by an RBG3(XOR) Construction
2430   Assuming that the Hash_DRBG has been instantiated (see Appendix B.4.1), the RBG can be called
2431   by a consuming application to generate output with full entropy.
