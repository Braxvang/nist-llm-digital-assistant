                                                                        GUIDELINES FOR THE SECURE DEPLOYMENT OF IPV6


Executive Summary

Due to the exhaustion of IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) address space, and the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB)1 mandate that U.S. federal agencies begin to use the IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6)
protocol, NIST undertook the development of a guide to help educate federal agencies about the possible
security risks during their initial IPv6 deployment. This document provides guidelines for organizations
to aid in securely deploying IPv6. Since the majority of organizations will most likely run both IPv6 and
IPv4 on their networks for the foreseeable future, this document speaks about the deployment of IPv6
rather than the transition to IPv6.2

The deployment of IPv6 can lead to new challenges and types of threats facing an organization. The goals
of this document are:

 To educate the reader about IPv6 features and the security impacts of those features
 To provide a comprehensive survey of mechanisms that can be used for the deployment of IPv6
 To provide a suggested deployment strategy for moving to an IPv6 environment
The migration to IPv6 services is inevitable as the IPv4 address space is almost exhausted. IPv6 is not
backwards compatible with IPv4, which means organizations will have to change their network
infrastructure and systems to deploy IPv6. Organizations should begin now to understand the risks of
deploying IPv6, as well as strategies to mitigate such risks. Detailed planning will enable an organization
to navigate the process smoothly and securely.

Federal agencies will most likely face security challenges throughout the deployment process, including:

 An attacker community that most likely has more experience and comfort with IPv6 than an
  organization in the early stages of deployment
 Difficulty in detecting unknown or unauthorized IPv6 assets on existing IPv4 production networks
 Added complexity while operating IPv4 and IPv6 in parallel
 Lack of IPv6 maturity in security products when compared to IPv4 capabilities
 Proliferation of transition-driven IPv6 (or IPv4) tunnels, which complicate defenses at network
  boundaries even if properly authorized, and can completely circumvent those defenses if unauthorized
  (e.g. host-based tunnels initiated by end users)
Organizations planning the deployment of IPv6 should consider the following during the planning
process:

        IPv6 is a new protocol that is not backward compatible with IPv4

        In most cases IPv4 will still be a component of IT (Information Technology) infrastructure.
         As such, even after the deployment of IPv6, organizations will require mechanisms for IPv6
         and IPv4 co-existence.

    Since many of the IPv6-related protocols, tools and mechanisms are typically referred to as transition mechanisms, this
    document does use the word transition in that context.
