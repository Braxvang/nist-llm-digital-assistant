                                                                                          GUIDE TO SSL VPNS



An endpoint security policy should also specify how to enforce endpoint security on a client system after
the user has logged out. Security protection mechanisms such as a cache cleaner can be activated during
the logout process to remove data that was cached or saved during the SSL VPN session. For even higher
security, some SSL VPN vendors offer the capability of putting the session into a virtual storage space.
The SSL VPN device allocates temporary memory and hard drive space for it. On a Windows machine,
the virtual storage space may consist of temporary My Documents and Desktop directories. The user is
not able to save anything to a directory outside of the virtual storage space. After the user logs out, the
entire virtual storage space and all data downloaded during the session is erased. This virtual space may
also be encrypted for greater security. Not all applications may be compatible with the virtual storage
space because some of the user’s directories are temporarily replaced, and interoperability problems could
result. Also, the organization will have to make a policy decision about when to put users into the virtual
storage space. For example, it may make sense to allow users to access their entire hard drive and keep
downloaded files or email attachments if they are logging into the SSL VPN from their own organization-
managed hosts.

If a user forgets to log out, the SSL VPN device should be able to perform an automatic logout after a
specific period of inactivity. Ideally the device could detect and ignore activity that is automatic, such as
an email client that periodically connects to the mail server or automatic refresh requests by a Web
browser. The device may also have a separate timeout threshold to require re-authentication regardless of
inactivity. This timeout limits the damage that is done if a malicious user somehow gets control of the
VPN session. Some SSL VPN devices may have different timeout thresholds for different types of users.
For example, users who are put into a virtual storage space might have much shorter timeout thresholds
than users who log in from an organization-managed machine.

The following is an example of an endpoint security policy that is based on the access control policy
described in the previous section. The access control policy is based on a user’s host meeting one of three
conditions: organization-managed host, any host, or correct IP address and time:

 Organization-managed host. An organization-managed host has a firewall, antivirus software, and
  a registry key indicating that it is managed by the organization.
 Any host. If users are not using their organization-managed hosts to access resources, they can still
  use any host, but with more restricted access. The only requirement for the any host condition is that
  if it is running a Windows operating system, it is using one or more specific versions of Windows,
  with each specific version using the most current set of updates.
 Correct IP address and time. Business partners can only access their assigned resources from
  specified IP addresses on Monday to Friday between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. Eastern time.
The endpoint security policy is based on the access control policy and elaborates on host integrity
checking and the post-login process:

 An organization-managed host must be currently running a firewall. Also, for specific versions of
  Windows, if there is no firewall running then the built-in Windows Firewall will automatically be
  enabled. An antivirus software program certified by the organization must be currently running and
  use a signature database that is out of date by no more than one week. The registry key is installed by
  the organization’s information technology (IT) group either when the host is first configured or
  afterward by user request. Users are permitted to keep all cookies, Web browser cache entries, and
  downloaded files and attachments. Desktop search tools are automatically disabled at login.
 If a host is not determined to be organization-managed, it is still permitted to access the SSL VPN but
  must run one or more specific versions of Windows, with each specific version using the most current
