5.3.7.2.       Cybersecurity Capability Considerations
Compute resources – including processing, memory, and storage – vary among IIoT devices.
Some IIoT devices may have constrained resources, while others may have unused capabilities,
both of which have implications for cybersecurity. Organizations should consider how the
resources and capabilities available in the IIoT devices will integrate into the security
architecture to achieve their cybersecurity objectives. Additionally, organizations should
consider whether the operational and safety impacts for IIoT differ from the operational and
safety impacts for other OT devices. For example, IIoT devices may support a separate data
monitoring (i.e., read-only capability) for the environment and have minimal impact on
operational controls or safety, which may allow organizations to implement security operations
differently than those established for OT devices.

       Cybersecurity Architecture Models
Building on the concepts and guidance from Sections 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3, the following subsections
expand on the general OT and IIoT environments described in Section 2 and provide examples
for how the environments might be adapted to support defense-in-depth security architectures.

5.4.1. Distributed Control System (DCS)-Based OT Systems
As described in Section 2, a distributed control system (DCS) is used to control production
systems within the same geographic location for industries. Figure 17 shows an example DCS
system implementation. Figure 18 shows an example defense-in-depth architecture applied to
the DCS system.
