47   Abstract
48   A log is a record of events that occur within an organization’s computing assets, including
49   physical and virtual platforms, networks, services, and cloud environments. Log management is
50   the process for generating, transmitting, storing, accessing, and disposing of log data. It
51   facilitates log usage and analysis for many purposes, including identifying and investigating
52   cybersecurity incidents, finding operational issues, and ensuring that records are stored for the
53   required period of time. This document defines a playbook intended to help any organization
54   plan improvements to its cybersecurity log management.

55   Keywords

58   The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and
59   Technology (NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical
60   leadership for the Nation’s measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops tests, test
61   methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance
62   the development and productive use of information technology. ITL’s responsibilities include the
63   development of management, administrative, technical, and physical standards and guidelines for
64   the cost-effective security and privacy of other than national security-related information in
65   federal information systems. The Special Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research,
66   guidelines, and outreach efforts in information system security, and its collaborative activities
67   with industry, government, and academic organizations.
