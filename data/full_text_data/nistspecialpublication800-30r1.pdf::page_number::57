________________________________________________________________________________________________


 Information System-Related           Risk that arises through the loss of confidentiality,
 Security Risk                        integrity, or availability of information or information
                                      systems considering impacts to organizational operations
                                      and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the
                                      Nation. A subset of Information Security Risk. See Risk.
 Information Technology               Any equipment or interconnected system or subsystem of
 [40 U.S.C., Sec. 1401]               equipment that is used in the automatic acquisition,
                                      storage, manipulation, management, movement, control,
                                      display, switching, interchange, transmission, or
                                      reception of data or information by the executive agency.
                                      For purposes of the preceding sentence, equipment is
                                      used by an executive agency if the equipment is used by
                                      the executive agency directly or is used by a contractor
                                      under a contract with the executive agency which: (i)
                                      requires the use of such equipment; or (ii) requires the
                                      use, to a significant extent, of such equipment in the
                                      performance of a service or the furnishing of a product.
                                      The term information technology includes computers,
                                      ancillary equipment, software, firmware, and similar
                                      procedures, services (including support services), and
                                      related resources.
 Information Type                     A specific category of information (e.g., privacy,
 [FIPS 199]                           medical, proprietary, financial, investigative, contractor
                                      sensitive, security management) defined by an
                                      organization or in some instances, by a specific law,
                                      Executive Order, directive, policy, or regulation.
 Integrity                            Guarding against improper information modification or
 [44 U.S.C., Sec. 3542]               destruction, and includes ensuring information non-
                                      repudiation and authenticity.
 Likelihood of Occurrence             A weighted factor based on a subjective analysis of the
 [CNSSI No. 4009, adapted]            probability that a given threat is capable of exploiting a
                                      given vulnerability or a set of vulnerabilities.
 Management Controls                  The security controls (i.e., safeguards or
 [FIPS 200]                           countermeasures) for an information system that focus on
                                      the management of risk and the management of
                                      information system security.
 Mission/Business Segment             Elements of organizations describing mission areas,
                                      common/shared business services, and organization-wide
                                      services. Mission/business segments can be identified
                                      with one or more information systems which collectively
                                      support a mission/business process.
