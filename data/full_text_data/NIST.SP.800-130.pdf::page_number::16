             Figure 1: The Trusted Association and Supporting Processes

After being received, the metadata can be combined with other locally generated
metadata (if available), and a new trusted association between the key and all available
metadata can then be established for the information to be stored.

Metadata stored within a system also needs a trusted association between the key and its
metadata. Depending on the storage location and characteristics, the association could be
maintained using physical security or cryptographic methods. Physical security methods
include storage within a device that is trusted to maintain the association, i.e., the
confidentiality (when required) and the integrity of a key and its metadata. As long as the
integrity of the trusted association is maintained, one has assurance that the metadata
elements belong to the associated key and have not been disclosed to unauthorized
entities. However, such physical security methods might not be feasible. A physically
secure storage site might be too costly or might not be available. In this case, a
cryptographic binding could be required to provide assurance that a key and its metadata
are properly associated.

2.3 CKMS Applications
A CKMS can be designed to provide services for a single individual (e.g., in a personal
data storage system), an organization (e.g., in a secure VPN for intra-office
communications), or a large complex of organizations (e.g., in secure communications
for the U.S. Government). A CKMS can be owned or rented.
