NIST SP 800-90A Rev. 1                 HASH_DRBG                 Recommendation for Random Number
                                                                  Generation Using Deterministic RBGs


10 DRBG Algorithm Specifications
Several DRBG mechanisms are specified in this Recommendation. The selection of a DRBG
mechanism depends on several factors, including the security strength to be supported and what
cryptographic primitives are available. An analysis of the consuming applicationâ€™s requirements
for random numbers should be conducted in order to select an appropriate DRBG mechanism.
Conversion specifications required for the DRBG mechanism implementations (e.g., between
integers and bitstrings) are provided in Appendix A. Pseudocode examples for each DRBG
mechanism are provided in Appendix B. A detailed discussion on DRBG mechanism selection is
provided in Appendix C.
Examples for determining correct implementation of each DRBG are available at
http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/toolkit/examples.html.

10.1 DRBG Mechanisms Based on Hash Functions

A DRBG mechanism may be based on a hash function that is one-way. The hash-based DRBG
mechanisms specified in this Recommendation have been designed to use any approved hash
function and may be used by consuming applications requiring various security strengths,
providing that the appropriate hash function is used and sufficient entropy is obtained for the
seed.
The following are provided as DRBG mechanisms based on hash functions:
    1. The Hash_DRBG specified in Section 10.1.1.
    2. The HMAC_DRBG specified in Section 10.1.2.
The maximum security strength that can be supported by each DRBG based on a hash function is
the security strength of the hash function for pre-image resistance; these security strengths are
provided in [SP 800-107]. [SP 800-57] identifies hash functions that can be used to support a
required security strength.
This Recommendation supports only four security strengths: 112, 128, 192, and 256 bits. Table 2
specifies the values that shall be used for the function envelopes6 and DRBG algorithm for each
approved hash function.
