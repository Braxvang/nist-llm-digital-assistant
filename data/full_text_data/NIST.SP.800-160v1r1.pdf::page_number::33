     ASSET CLASS                                   DESCRIPTION                                         LOSS PROTECTION CRITERIA
                            (NAS) may be considered infrastructure that itself is a           capability and producing only the authorized
                            system and contains other elements that are forms                 and intended outcomes.
                            of systems and infrastructures, such as Air Traffic
                            Control, navigational aids, weather aids, airports, and
                            the aircraft that maneuver within the NAS.
 SYSTEM                     This asset class is the set of capabilities or services           System capability is protected from loss if
 CAPABILITY                 provided by the system. Generally, system capability              the system meets its performance
                            is determined by (1) the nature of the system (e.g.,              expectations while delivering only the
                            entertainment, vehicular, medical, financial,                     authorized and intended capability and
                            industrial, or recreational) and (2) the use of the               producing only the authorized and intended
                            system to achieve mission or business objectives.                 outcomes.
 HUMAN                      This asset class includes personnel who are part of               Human resources are protected from loss if
 RESOURCES                  the system and are directly or indirectly involved                they are not injured, suffer illness, or killed.

                            loss associated with the system may significantly
                            change the importance of this asset class (e.g., the
                            effect on personnel due to a failure of a guidance
                            system in an aircraft is significantly different from the
                            effect on personnel due to the breach of a system
                            that compromises individual credit card information).
 INTELLECTUAL               This asset class includes trade secrets, recipes,                 Intellectual property is protected from loss if

 DATA AND                   This asset class includes all types of data and                   Data and information are protected from
 INFORMATION                information (aggregations of data) and all encodings              loss due to unauthorized alteration,
                            and representations of data and information (e.g.,                exfiltration, infiltration, and destruction.
                            digital, optical, audio, visual). There are general
                            sensitivity classes of data and information that do
                            not fall within the above categories, such as classified
                            information, Controlled Unclassified Information
                            (CUI), and unclassified data and information.
 DERIVATIVE NON-            This asset class is comprised of derivative, non-                 Non-tangible assets are protected from loss
 TANGIBLES                  tangible assets, such as image, reputation, and trust.            by ensuring the adequate protection of

                            to provide adequate protection for assets in the

Assets may also be considered as individual items or as an aggregate or group of items that spans
asset types or asset classes (e.g., personnel data, fire control function, environmental sensor
capability). This publication uses the term asset of interest to emphasize and establish bounds on
the scope of reasoning for a specific asset, asset type, or asset class. The valuation of an asset is a
