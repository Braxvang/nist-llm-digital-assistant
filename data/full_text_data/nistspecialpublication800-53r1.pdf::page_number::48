Special Publication 800-53, Revision 1               Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________


 Security Control                    Statements of security capability to: (i) build in additional, but
 Enhancements                        related, functionality to a basic control; and/or (ii) increase the
                                     strength of a basic control.
 Security Functions                  The hardware, software, and firmware of the information system
                                     responsible for supporting and enforcing the system security
                                     policy and supporting the isolation of code and data on which the
                                     protection is based.
 Security Impact Analysis            The analysis conducted by an agency official, often during the
 [NIST SP 800-37]                    continuous monitoring phase of the security certification and
                                     accreditation process, to determine the extent to which changes to
                                     the information system have affected the security posture of the
                                     system.
 Security Incident                   See Incident.
 Security Label                      Explicit or implicit marking of a data structure or output media
                                     associated with an information system representing the FIPS 199
                                     security category, or distribution limitations or handling caveats
                                     of the information contained therein.

 Security Objective                  Confidentiality, integrity, or availability.
 [FIPS 199]
 Security Perimeter                  See Accreditation Boundary.

 Security Plan                       See System Security Plan.

 Security Requirements               Requirements levied on an information system that are derived
 [FIPS 200]                          from applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies,
                                     standards, instructions, regulations, procedures, or organizational
                                     mission/business case needs to ensure the confidentiality,
                                     integrity, and availability of the information being processed,
                                     stored, or transmitted.
 Senior Agency                       Official responsible for carrying out the Chief Information
 Information Security                Officer responsibilities under FISMA and serving as the Chief
 Officer                             Information Officer’s primary liaison to the agency’s authorizing
 [44 U.S.C., Sec. 3544]              officials, information system owners, and information system
                                     security officers.
 Spyware                             Software that is secretly or surreptitiously installed into an
                                     information system to gather information on individuals or
                                     organizations without their knowledge; a type of malicious code.
 Subsystem                           A major subdivision or component of an information system
                                     consisting of information, information technology, and personnel
                                     that performs one or more specific functions.
 System                              See Information System.
 System-specific Security            A security control for an information system that has not been
 Control                             designated as a common security control.
