FAMILY: RISK ASSESSMENT                                                               CLASS: MANAGEMENT


RA-1      RISK ASSESSMENT POLICY AND PROCEDURES

          Control: The organization develops, disseminates, and periodically reviews/updates: (i) a formal,
          documented risk assessment policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities,
          management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and (ii)
          formal, documented procedures to facilitate the implementation of the risk assessment policy and
          associated risk assessment controls.
          Supplemental Guidance: The risk assessment policy and procedures are consistent with applicable
          laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. The risk
          assessment policy can be included as part of the general information security policy for the
          organization. Risk assessment procedures can be developed for the security program in general,
          and for a particular information system, when required. NIST Special Publications 800-30
          provides guidance on the assessment of risk. NIST Special Publication 800-12 provides guidance
          on security policies and procedures.
          Control Enhancements: None.


           LOW RA-1                      MOD RA-1                  HIGH RA-1



RA-2      SECURITY CATEGORIZATION

          Control: The organization categorizes the information system and the information processed,
          stored, or transmitted by the system in accordance with applicable laws, Executive Orders,
          directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance and documents the results (including
          supporting rationale) in the system security plan. Designated senior-level officials within the
          organization review and approve the security categorizations.
          Supplemental Guidance: The applicable federal standard for security categorization of nonnational
          security information and information systems is FIPS 199. The organization conducts FIPS 199
          security categorizations as an organization-wide activity with the involvement of the chief
          information officer, senior agency information security officer, information system owners, and
          information owners. The organization also considers potential impacts to other organizations and,
          in accordance with the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 and Homeland Security Presidential
          Directives, potential national-level impacts in categorizing the information system. As part of a
          defense-in-depth protection strategy, the organization considers partitioning higher-impact
          information systems into separate physical domains (or environments) and restricting or
          prohibiting network access in accordance with an organizational assessment of risk. NIST Special
          Publication 800-60 provides guidance on determining the security categories of the information
          types resident on the information system. Related security controls: MP-4, SC-7.
          Control Enhancements: None.
