GUIDE TO INTEGRATING FORENSIC TECHNIQUES INTO INCIDENT RESPONSE



effective in preventing easy collection of files, especially if several wipes are performed. Individuals can
also use physical means to prevent data collection, such as demagnetizing a hard drive (also known as
degaussing) or physically damaging or destroying media. Both physical and software-based techniques
can make it very difficult, or even impossible, to recover all of the data using software. Recovery
attempts in these cases necessitate the use of highly specialized forensic experts with advanced facilities,
hardware, and techniques, but the cost and effort involved in making use of such means are prohibitive
for general use. 43 In some cases, the data is simply not recoverable.

Another common issue is the collection of hidden data. Many OSs permit users to tag certain files,
directories, or even partitions as hidden, which means that by default they are not displayed in directory
listings.44 Some applications and OSs hide configuration files to reduce the chance that users will
accidentally modify or delete them. Also, on some OSs, directories that have been deleted may be
marked as hidden. Hidden data may contain a wealth of information; for example, a hidden partition
could contain a separate OS and many data files.45 Users may create hidden partitions by altering the
partition table to disrupt disk management and prevent applications from seeing that the data area exists.
Hidden data can also be found within ADSs on NTFS volumes, in the end-of-file slack space and free
space on a medium, and in the Host Protected Area (HPA) on some hard drives, which is a region of a
drive intended to be used by vendors only. Many collection tools can recognize some or all of these
methods of hiding data and recover the associated data.

Yet another issue that may arise is collection of data from RAID arrays that use striping (e.g., RAID-0,
RAID-5). 46 In this configuration, a striped volume consists of equal-sized partitions that reside on
separate disk drives. When data is written to the volume, it is evenly distributed across the partitions to
improve disk performance. This can cause problems because all partitions of a striped volume must be
present for the examination of its contents, but in this case the partitions reside on separate physical disk
drives. To examine a striped volume, each disk drive in the RAID array needs to be imaged and the
RAID configuration has to be recreated on the examination system. 47 The examination system needs to
be booted using a forensic boot disk that can recognize and use the RAID array and that prevents writes to
the array. Some imaging tools can acquire striped volumes and preserve unused data areas of the volume,
such as free space and slack space.48

4.3     Examining Data Files

After a logical backup or bit stream imaging has been performed, the backup or image may have to be
restored to another media before the data can be examined. This is dependent on the forensic tools that
will be used to perform the analysis. Some tools can analyze data directly from an image file, whereas
others require that the backup or image be restored to a medium first.49 Regardless of whether an image
file or a restored image is used in the examination, the data should be accessed only as read-only to ensure

      Companies that specialize in such recovery efforts include Data Recovery Services, DriveSavers, and Ontrack Data
      Recovery.
44
      On UNIX systems, files or folders beginning with a ‘.’ are considered hidden and are not displayed when listing files unless
      the –a flag is used.
45
      An example of a freely available tool that can be used to locate hidden partitions is the FDISK utility built into DOS.
      Information about additional tools is available from the Web sites listed in Appendix F.

      Because RAID-5 stores parity information on one disk, it is possible to examine a RAID-5 volume by imaging all of the
      disks but one.

      At one time, when tools had more limited capabilities, it was often recommended that data files be restored to a system
      using the same OS or a related one. Current tools are more advanced and are designed to be used with many types of data
      files, regardless of the underlying OS, so it is no longer necessary in most cases to restore data files to a particular OS.
