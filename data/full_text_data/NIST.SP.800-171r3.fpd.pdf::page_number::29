478   3.1.20. Use of External Systems
479             REQUIREMENT: 03.01.20
480             a. Prohibit the use of external systems unless the systems are specifically authorized.
481             b. Establish the following terms, conditions, and security requirements to be satisfied on
482                external systems prior to allowing use of or access to those systems by authorized
483                individuals: [Assignment: organization-defined terms, conditions, and requirements].
484             c.   Permit authorized individuals to use an external system to access the organizational system
485                  or to process, store, or transmit CUI only after:
486                  1. Verification of the implementation of security requirements on the external system as
487                     specified in the organizationâ€™s security plans; and
488                  2. Retention of approved system connection or processing agreements with the
489                     organizational entity hosting the external system.
490             d. Restrict the use of organization-controlled portable storage devices by authorized
491                individuals on external systems.

492             DISCUSSION
493             External systems are systems that are used by but are not part of the organization. External
494             systems include personally owned systems, system components, or devices; privately owned
495             computing and communication devices in commercial or public facilities; systems owned or
496             controlled by nonfederal organizations; and systems managed by contractors. Organizations
497             have the option to prohibit the use of any type of external system or specified types of external
498             systems, (e.g., prohibit the use of external systems that are not organizationally owned). Terms
499             and conditions are consistent with the trust relationships established with the entities that own,
500             operate, or maintain external systems and include descriptions of shared responsibilities.
501             Authorized individuals include organizational personnel, contractors, or other individuals with
502             authorized access to the organizational system and over whom organizations have the authority
503             to impose specific rules of behavior regarding system access. Restrictions that organizations
504             impose on authorized individuals need not be uniform, as the restrictions may vary depending
505             on the trust relationships between organizations. Organizations need assurance that the external
506             systems satisfy the necessary security requirements so as not to compromise, damage, or harm
507             the system. This requirement is related to 03.16.03.
