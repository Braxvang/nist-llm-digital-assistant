                                                                                               NIST Special Publication 800-50



     Visitor control and physical access to spaces – discuss applicable physical security policy and
      procedures, e.g., challenge strangers, report unusual activity
     Desktop security – discuss use of screensavers, restricting visitors’ view of information on screen
      (preventing/limiting “shoulder surfing”), battery backup devices, allowed access to systems
     Protect information subject to confidentiality concerns – in systems, archived, on backup media, in
      hardcopy form, and until destroyed
     E-mail list etiquette – attached files and other rules.
4.1.2      Sources of Awareness Material

There are a variety of sources of material on security awareness that can be incorporated into an
awareness program. The material can address a specific issue, or in some cases, can describe how to
begin to develop an entire awareness program, session, or campaign. Sources of timely material may
include:

     E-mail advisories issued by industry-hosted news groups, academic institutions, or the organization’s
      IT security office;
     Professional organizations and vendors;
     Online IT security daily news websites;
     Periodicals; and
     Conferences, seminars, and courses.
Awareness material can be developed using one theme at a time or created by combining a number of
themes or messages into a presentation. For example, a poster or a slogan on an awareness tool should
contain one theme, while an instructor-led session or web-based presentation can contain numerous
themes. (Dissemination techniques are covered in greater depth in Section 5.) Regardless of the
approach taken, the amount of information should not overwhelm the audience. Brief mention of
requirements (policies), the problems that the requirements were designed to remedy, and actions to take
are the major topics to be covered in a typical awareness presentation.19

A more complex awareness presentation that incorporates basics and literacy material (see Chapter 3 of
NIST Special Publication 800-16) should go into more depth on a particular subject. Because basics and
literacy is the bridge between awareness and training, this additional level of detail and complexity is
appropriate.

4.2      Developing Training Material

The question to be answered when beginning to develop material for a specific training course is, “What
skill or skills do we want the audience to learn?” The awareness and training plan should identify an
audience, or several audiences, that should receive training tailored to address their IT security
responsibilities. NIST Special Publication 800-16, Information Technology Security Training
Requirements: A Role- and Performance-Based Model
(http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/index.html), contains a methodology for building training

19
      The NIST Computer Security Division website’s awareness, training, education, and professional development pages
      http://csrc.nist.gov/ATE contain a number of links to government, industry, and academic sites that offer or sell both
      awareness and training material.
