The Privacy Engineering Program (PEP) works to provide trusted, rigorous tools and resources
that support innovation and privacy. PEP facilitates dialogue among stakeholders about privacy risk
management and promotes an organizational shift away from checklist-based legal compliance to
improve privacy measures. The following activities reflect progress made in FY 2021 toward three
strategic PEP objectives: advancing the development of privacy engineering and risk management
guidelines and resources, positioning NIST as a leader in privacy research, and advancing the
development and deployment of privacy-enhancing technologies.
Privacy as a programmatic area intersects with each of the other priority focus areas, making
coordination and ongoing engagement critical across a range of technical domains. To advance
its strategic objectives, PEP collaborates with other NIST programs, including the NCCoE, the
Cryptographic Technologies Group, the Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA)
program, and the Cybersecurity for the Internet of Things (IoT) Program, as reflected in activities
throughout this report.
Privacy Framework
NIST continued its Privacy Framework outreach and awareness efforts in FY 2021 in numerous
domestic and international speaking engagements at conferences, webinars, and podcasts. NIST
also worked closely with stakeholders to develop resources and guidelines to assist with Privacy
Framework publication, with a focus on an audience of small and medium businesses (SMBs) and
other organizations with limited privacy resources. In January, NIST released new resources to
coincide with its one-year anniversary celebration. These included a Quick Start Guide for SMBs
and an animated video to introduce the Privacy Framework to a general audience.
