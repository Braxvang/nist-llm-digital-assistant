NIST SP 800-82r3                                          Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

       safety systems should be in the “Run” position at all times unless they are being actively
       programmed.
   •   Restrict unauthorized modification of data. This includes data in all states (e.g., at rest,
       in transit, in use) including data flows crossing network boundaries.
   •   Detect security events and incidents. Detecting security events that have not yet
       escalated into incidents can help defenders break the attack chain before attackers attain
       their objectives. This includes the capability to detect failed OT components, unavailable
       services, and exhausted resources that are important to provide proper and safe
       functioning of the OT system.
   •   Maintain functionality during adverse conditions. This involves designing the OT
       system with the ability to ensure delivery of critical operations through disruption.
       Critical components should have a redundant counterpart. Additionally, if a component
       fails, it should fail in a manner that does not generate unnecessary traffic on the OT or
       other networks nor causes another problem elsewhere, such as a cascading event. The OT
       system should also allow for graceful degradation, such as moving from “normal
       operation” with full automation to “emergency operation” with operators more involved
       and less automation to “manual operation” with no automation.
   •   Restore and recover the system after an incident. Incidents are inevitable, and an
       incident response plan is essential. A major characteristic of a good security program is
       how quickly the system can be recovered after an incident has occurred.
A cross-functional cybersecurity team can share their varied domain knowledge and experience
to evaluate and mitigate risks to the OT system. At a minimum, the cybersecurity team should
consist of a member of the organization’s IT staff, a control engineer, a control system operator,
a network and system security expert, a member of the management staff, and a member of the
physical security department. For continuity and completeness, the cybersecurity team should
consult with the control system vendor and/or system integrator as well. The cybersecurity team
should coordinate closely with site management (e.g., facility superintendent) and the company’s
Chief Information Officer (CIO) or Chief Security Officer (CSO), who – along with the Chief
Executive Officer (CEO) or Chief Operating Officer (COO) – accepts complete responsibility
and accountability for the cybersecurity of the OT system and for any safety incidents, reliability
incidents, or equipment damage caused directly or indirectly by cyber incidents. An effective
cybersecurity program for an OT system should apply a strategy known as “defense in depth,”
while calls for layering security mechanisms such that the impact of a failure in any one
mechanism is minimized. Organizations should not rely on “security by obscurity.”
In a typical OT system, a defense-in-depth strategy includes:
   •   Developing security policies, procedures, training, and educational material that apply
       specifically to the OT system
   •   Considering OT security policies and procedures based on the National Terrorism
       Advisory System and deploying increasingly heightened security postures as the Threat
       Level increases
   •   Addressing security throughout the life cycle of the OT system, including architecture
       design, procurement, installation, operations, maintenance, and decommissioning
