 8.2   The Role of IPsec in VOIP

       The prevalence and ease of packet sniffing and other techniques for capturing
       packets on an IP based network makes encryption a necessity for VOIP. Security
       in VOIP is concerned both with protecting what a person says as well as to whom
       the person is speaking. IPsec can be used to achieve both of these goals as long as
       it is applied with ESP using the tunnel method. This secures the identities of both
       the endpoints and protects the voice data from prohibited users once packets leave
       the corporate intranet. The incorporation of IPsec into IPv6 will increase the
       availability of encryption, although there are other ways to secure this data at the
       application level. VOIPsec (VOIP using IPsec) helps reduce the threat of man in
       the middle attacks, packet sniffers, and many types of voice traffic analysis.
       Combined with the firewall implementations in the previous chapter, IPsec makes
       VOIP more secure than a standard phone line, where people generally assume the
       need for physical access to tap a phone line is deterrent enough. It is important to
       note, however, that IPsec is not always a good fit for some applications, so some
       protocols will continue to rely on their own security features.

 8.3   Local VPN Tunnels

       Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) are “tunnels” between two endpoints that allow
       for data to be securely transmitted between the nodes. The IPsec ESP tunnel is a
       specific kind of VPN used to traverse a public domain (the Internet) in a private
       manner. Many implementations of VOIP have attempted to make use of other
       VPN techniques, including VPN tunneling within an organization’s’s intranet.
       The use and benefits of VPNs in IPsec have been great enough for some to claim
       “VOIP is the killer app for VPNs” [26]. VPN tunnels within a corporate LAN or
       WAN are much more secure and generally faster than the IPsec VPNs across the
       Internet because data never traverses the public domain, but they are not
       scaleable. This sort of implementation has a physical limit at the size of the
       private network, and as VOIP becomes more widely spread, it is not practical for
       an implementation to regard calls outside the local network as a black box. Also,
       no matter how the VPN is set up, the same types of attacks and issues associated
       with IPsec VPNs are applicable, so we consider here only the case of IPsec
       tunneling and assume the security solutions can be scaled down to an internal
       network if needed.

 8.4   Difficulties Arising from VOIPsec

       IPsec has been included in IPv6. It is a reliable, robust, and widely implemented
       method of protecting data and authenticating the sender. However, there are
       several issues associated with VOIP that are not applicable to normal data traffic.
       Of particular interest are the Quality of Service (QoS) issues discussed in Chapter
       3. Chief among these are latency, jitter, and packet loss. These issues are
       introduced into the VOIP environment because it is a real time media transfer,
       with only 150 ms to deliver each packet. In standard data transfer over TCP, if a
       packet is lost, it can be resent by request. In VOIP, there is no time to do this.
