NIST SP 800-124r2                                                  Guidelines for Managing the Security

supply chains may be able to modify device components, source code, or executables during the
design or manufacturing phases. For example, an attacker could manipulate software
development or integration tools (e.g., compilers, software test systems, configuration
management systems), software support tools (e.g., software update or upgrade systems), system
administration tools (e.g., software installation and release management systems, patch
management systems), or an MDM, MAM, or EMM system. NISTIR 8151, Dramatically
Reducing Software Vulnerabilities [29], defines a framework for and provides a broad catalog of
supply chain attack patterns, which cover the malicious insertion of hardware, software,
firmware, and system information.
While it is very difficult to avoid a targeted supply chain attack against a single organization or
group of individuals, choosing validated devices and software and using a vetted system
integrator can help mitigate the risk of broad attacks. NIST’s Cryptographic Algorithm
Validation Program (CAVP) “provides validation testing of [Federal Information Processing
Standards] FIPS-approved and NIST-recommended cryptographic algorithms and their
individual components [13],” while the NIST Cryptographic Module Validation Program
(CMVP) validates cryptographic module implementations against the Security Requirements for
Cryptographic Modules [17].
The National Security Agency’s (NSA) National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP) [7]
is responsible for implementation of the internationally recognized Common Criteria.
throughout the Federal Government. Products certified through the Common Criteria program
are evaluated for conformance with specific security protection profiles. NIAP’s product
compliance list identifies evaluated products and may be searched by vendor, technology type,
protection profiles, and certifying country [8]. NSA’s Commercial Solutions for Classified
Program (CSfC) [9][10] also “requires specific, selectable requirements to be included in the
Common Criteria evaluation” and provides a list of software or hardware systems [33], including
MDM and mobile platforms, that meet these more stringent requirements. In addition, CSfC
provides a Trusted Integrator List [11], which identifies companies that have met its criteria for
trustworthy systems integration capabilities. Organizations are encouraged to use lists of
validated products and vetted system integrators to reduce the risk of acquiring devices or
software with embedded vulnerabilities. In addition to these practices, devices and software
manufacturers can also follow their respective industry recommended practices for secure
software development to demonstrate that they are meeting a set of requirements and have
integrated them within their software development life cycle. More information about secure
software development can be found in the NIST SP 800-218, Secure Software Development
Framework (SSDF) Version 1.1: Recommendations for Mitigating the Risk of Software
Vulnerabilities [43].
Threats Addressed: Exploitation of underlying vulnerabilities in devices, exploitation of supply
chain vulnerabilities, use of untrusted mobile devices, mobile malware

4.3.5. Use Secure Connections to Resources
Encrypting data in transit to preserve confidentiality can be achieved through various
implementation options. System administrators understand what data is encrypted, what
algorithms are used, and how both ends are authenticating each other through their VPN. VPNs
may not encrypt all data, and organizations need to take time to fully understand what
