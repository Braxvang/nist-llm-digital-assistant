A STATISTICAL TEST SUITE FOR RANDOM AND PSEUDORANDOM NUMBER GENERATORS FOR CRYPTOGRAPHIC APPLICATIONS



        For example in this section, C3000 = 0, C3001 = 0.1, C3010 = 0.3, C3011 =0.1, C3100 = 0.1, C3101 = 0.3,
        C3110 = 0.1, C3111 = 0.

                           2 m −1
(4)     Compute ϕ ( m ) = ∑ π i log π i , where πi = C3j , and j=log2 i.
                            i=0


        For the example in this section, ϕ(3) = 0(log 0) + 0.1(log 0.1) + 0.3(log 0.3) + 0.1(log 0.1) +
        0.1(log 0.1) + 0.3(log 0.3) + 0.1(log 0.1) + 0(log 0) = -1.64341772.

(5)     Repeat steps 1-4, replacing m by m+1.

        Step 1: For the example in this section, m is now 4, the sequence to be tested becomes
        0100110101010.

        Step 2: The overlapping blocks become 0100, 1001, 0011, 0110, 1101, 1010, 0101, 1010, 0101,
        1010. The calculated values are: #0011 = 1, #0100 = 1, #0101 = 2, #0110 = 1, #1001 = 1, #1010
        = 3, #1101 = 1, and all other patterns are zero.

        Step 3: C40011 = C40100 = C40110 = C41001 = C41101 = 0.1, C40101 = 0.2, C41010 = 0.3, and all other
        values are zero.

        Step 4: ϕ(4) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0.1(log 0.01) + 0.1(log 0.01) + 0.2(log 0.02) + 0.1(log 0.01) + 0 + 0 +
        0.1(log 0.01) + 0.3(log 0.03) + 0 + 0 + 0.1(log 0.01) + 0 + 0) = -1.83437197.

(6)     Compute the test statistic: χ2 = 2n[log 2 – ApEn(m)] , where ApEn(m) = ϕ (m) − ϕ (m+1) .

        For the example in this section,
                ApEn(3) = -1.643418 – (-1.834372) = 0.190954
                χ2 = 2•10(0.693147-0.190954) = 0.502193
                                           χ2
(7)     Compute P-value = igamc(2m-1,         ).
                                           2
                                                                  0.502193 
        For the example in this section, P-value = igamc  2 2 ,             = 0.261961.
                                                                      2    

2.12.5 Decision Rule (at the 1% Level)
If the computed P-value is < 0.01, then conclude that the sequence is non-random. Otherwise, conclude
that the sequence is random.

2.12.6 Conclusion and Interpretation of Results
Since the P-value obtained in step 7 of Section 2.12.4 is ≥ 0.01 (P-value = 0.261961), the conclusion is
that the sequence is random.

Note that small values of ApEn(m) would imply strong regularity (see step 6 of Section 2.12.4). Large
values would imply substantial fluctuation or irregularity.

2.12.7 Input Size Recommendation
Choose m and n such that m < log2 n -5.
