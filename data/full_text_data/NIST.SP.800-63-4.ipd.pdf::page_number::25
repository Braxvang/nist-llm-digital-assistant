      NIST SP 800-63-4 ipd                                               Digital Identity Guidelines
      December 2022


651            – The verifier interacts with the CSP to verify the binding of the claimant’s
652              identity to their authenticators in the subscriber account and to optionally
653              obtain additional subscriber attributes.
654            – The CSP or verifier functions of the service provider provide information
655              about the subscriber. The RP requests the attributes it requires from the CSP.
656              The RP, optionally, uses this information to make authorization decisions.
657       • Step 5: An authenticated session is established between the subscriber and the RP.

658   Figure 2 shows an example of those same common interactions in a federated model.
659       • Step 1: An applicant applies to an IdP through an enrollment process. Using its
660         CSP function, the IdP identity proofs the applicant.
661       • Step 2: Upon successful proofing, the applicant is enrolled in the identity service as
662         a subscriber.
663            – A subscriber account and corresponding authenticators are established
664              between the IdP and the subscriber. The IdP maintains the subscriber account,
665              its status, and the enrollment data collected for the lifetime of the subscriber
666              account (at a minimum). The subscriber maintains their authenticators.
667   The usual sequence of interactions involved in using one or more authenticators in the
668   federated model to perform digital authentication is as follows:

                                                  13
