       Support for Multi-tier Policies Through a Monitoring Framework
To realize the goals of all types of policies (e.g., coarse- and fine-grained network policies,
identity-tier policies), it is necessary to have a monitoring framework as part of a ZTA. The
salient features of the two tenets called out in SP 800-207 (Section 2.1) for ZTA are:
   •   Measure the integrity and security posture of all resources by establishing a continuous
       diagnostics and mitigation (CDM) or similar system to monitor the state of devices and
       applications and apply patches or fixes as needed.
   •   An enterprise should collect data about the resource security posture, network traffic, and
       access requests; process that data; and use any insight gained to improve policy creation
       and enforcement. This data can also be used to provide context for access requests from
       subjects.
The requirements for the monitoring framework in the context of cloud-native applications are:
   •   MON-CNA-REQ-1: Resource monitoring should cover all categories of resources,
       including those that are enterprise-owned, not managed by the enterprise, and personally
       owned.
   •   MON-CNA-REQ-2: Monitoring should cover application targets (e.g., containers),
       application infrastructure elements (e.g., control plane elements of a service mesh), and
       data plane elements (e.g., sidecar proxies).
   •   MON-CNA-REQ-3: Monitoring should cover every user access request and the
       subsequent series of service calls needed to complete the user request as in
       microservices-based applications.
   •   MON-CNA-REQ-4: Monitoring should cover changes to data in enterprise directories to
       ensure that all changes to directory entries are associated with valid requests and valid
       transactions for carrying out the change requests.
The monitoring data, derived analytics, and telemetry data should be used in the following ways
to realize zero trust principles for cloud-native applications:
   •   MON-DATA-USE-1: Access enforcement in the context of identity-tier policies in ZTA
       should be based on access decisions that rely on assigned permissions as well as the
       contextual information about each connection or access request. A key piece of
       contextual information is the behavioral data associated with the user and/or devices from
       which the request originates. This behavioral data can only be generated from the
       visibility information on network traffic flows, which help verify that the users and
       resources are behaving in a way that is consistent with their roles and are, therefore
       trustworthy.
   •   MON-DATA-USE-2: The telemetry data generated from monitoring activity should be
       used in the following ways:
           o To fine-tune access rights data, such as granting, revoking, and restricting access
