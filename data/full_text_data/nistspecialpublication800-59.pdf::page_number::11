Appendix A: National Security System Identification
Checklist
The National Security System Identification Checklist provided in this Appendix includes
six questions designed to determine whether the system meets the definition of a national
security system provided in Section 2. An affirmative answer to one or more of the six
questions should result in the system being designated as a national security system. The
checklist contained in this Appendix is only one alternative for documenting the basis for
national security system determination. Note that use of the specific form provided here­

or methodology.

A.1 Minimum Question Set

questions must be answered in the affirmative:

       •   Does the function, operation, or use of the system involve intelligence activities?

           related to national security?

       •   Does the function, operation, or use of the system involve command and control
           of military forces?

       •   Does the function, operation, or use of the system involve equipment that is an
