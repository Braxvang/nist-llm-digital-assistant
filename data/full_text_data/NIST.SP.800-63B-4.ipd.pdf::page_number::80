       NIST SP 800-63B-4 ipd                                                Digital Identity Guidelines

2298   10.2.6. Single-Factor Cryptographic Software
2299   Typical Usage
2300   Users authenticate by proving possession and control of the cryptographic software key.
2301   Usability considerations for typical usage include:
2302       • Give cryptographic keys appropriately descriptive names that are meaningful to
2303         users since users have to recognize and recall which cryptographic key to use for
2304         which authentication task. This prevents users from having to deal with multiple
2305         similarly and ambiguously named cryptographic keys. Selecting from multiple
2306         cryptographic keys on smaller mobile devices may be particularly problematic if
2307         the names of the cryptographic keys are shortened due to reduced screen size.

2308   10.2.7. Single-Factor Cryptographic Device
2309   Typical Usage
2310   Users authenticate by proving possession of the single-factor cryptographic device.
2311   Usability considerations for typical usage include:
2312       • Requiring a physical input (e.g., pressing a button) to operate the single-factor
2313         cryptographic device could pose usability difficulties. For example, some USB
2314         ports are located on the back of computers, making it difficult for users to reach.
2315       • Limited availability of a direct computer interface like a USB port could pose
2316         usability difficulties. For example, laptop computers often have a limited number
2317         of USB ports, which may force users to unplug other USB peripherals to use the
2318         single-factor cryptographic device.

2319   10.2.8. Multi-Factor Cryptographic Software
2320   Typical Usage
2321 In order to authenticate, users prove possession and control of the cryptographic key
2322 stored on disk or some other “soft” media that requires activation. The activation is
2323 through the input of a second authentication factor, either a memorized secret or a
2324 biometric characteristic. Usability considerations for the additional factor apply as well
2325 — see Sec. 10.2.1 for memorized secrets and Sec. 10.4 for biometrics used in multi-factor

2326 authenticators.
2327   Usability considerations for typical usage include:
2328       • Give cryptographic keys appropriately descriptive names that are meaningful to
2329         users since users have to recognize and recall which cryptographic key to use for
2330         which authentication task. This prevents users from having to deal with multiple
2331         similarly and ambiguously named cryptographic keys. Selecting from multiple
