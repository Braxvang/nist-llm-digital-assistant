6.1     Monitoring Compliance

Once the program has been implemented, processes must be put in place to monitor compliance and
effectiveness. An automated tracking system should be designed to capture key information regarding
program activity (e.g., courses, dates, audience, costs, sources). The tracking system should capture this
data at an agency level, so that it can be used to provide enterprise wide analysis and reporting regarding
awareness, training, and education initiatives. Requirements for the database should incorporate the
needs of all intended users. Typical users of such a database would include:

     CIOs – Can use the database to support strategic planning, inform the agency head and other senior
      management officials on the health of the IT security awareness and training program, identify in-
      house capability and critical needs in security workforce, perform program analysis, identify activity
      enterprise wide, assist in security and IT budgeting, identify the need for program improvement, and
      assess compliance.
     IT Security Program Managers – Can use the database to support security planning, provide status
      reports to the CIO and other management and security personnel, justify requests for funding,
      demonstrate compliance with agency-established goals and objectives, identify vendors and other
      training sources, respond to security-related inquiries, identify current coverage, and make
      adjustments for critical omissions.
     Human Resource Departments – Can use the database to ensure that an effective mechanism exists
      for capturing all security-related training, identify IT security training related costs, assist in the
      establishment of position descriptions, support status reporting, respond to training inquiries, and aid
      in professional development.
     Agency Training Departments – Can use the database to assist in developing overall agency
      training strategy, establish training database requirements tied to security directives, identify possible
      training sources, support training requests, identify course relevance and popularity, support
      budgeting activity, and respond to inquiries.
     Functional Managers – Can use the database to monitor their user’s training progress and adjust user
      training plans as needed, get status reports and respond to inquiries regarding security training in their
      components, and identify training sources and costs to assist with budget requests and proposals.
     Auditors – Can use information from the database to monitor compliance with security directives and
      agency policy.
     Chief Financial Officers (CFOs) – Can use information from the database to respond to budget
      inquiries, assist in financial planning, and provide reports to the agency head and senior managers
      regarding security training funding activities.
Tracking compliance involves assessing the status of the program as indicated by the database
information and mapping it to standards established by the agency. Reports can be generated and used to
identify gaps or problems. Corrective action and necessary follow-up can then be taken. This may take
the form of formal reminders to management; additional awareness, training, or education offerings;
and/or the establishment of a corrective plan with scheduled completion dates.

6.2     Evaluation and Feedback

Formal evaluation and feedback mechanisms are critical components of any security awareness, training,
and education program. Continuous improvement cannot occur without a good sense of how the existing
program is working. In addition, the feedback mechanism must be designed to address objectives initially
