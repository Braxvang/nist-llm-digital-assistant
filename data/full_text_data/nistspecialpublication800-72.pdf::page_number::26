                                                                                      Guidelines on PDA Forensics


       DragonBall processor. Built-in PIM applications (e.g., Datebook, Address Book, To Do, etc.)
       run properly and the hardware buttons and display react accurately. ROM images can be
       obtained from the PalmSource Web site or by copying the contents of ROM from an actual
       device, using pdd, Pilot-Link, or a companion tool provided with the emulator. POSE is
       limited to Palm OS versions 4.x and below.

       Loading actual RAM-based databases into the emulator, extracted using pilot-link or another
       tool, allows an examiner to view and operate the emulated device in a similar fashion as
       having the original. Though originally developed to run, test, and debug Palm OS applications
       without having to download them to an actual device, POSE also serves as a useful tool for
       doing presentations or capturing screen shots of evidence found on the emulated device from
       within the databases loaded from a seized device. POSE can be configured to map the Palm
       OS serial port to one of the available serial ports on the desktop computer or to redirect any
       TCP/IP calls to the TCP/IP stack on the desktop. With some experimentation, the HotSync
       protocol can even be run between the desktop computer and device it is emulating, over a
       looped back serial connection or a redirected TCP/IP connection.

3.4   PDA Seizure

       Paraben’s PDA Seizure is a commercially available forensic software toolkit that allows
       forensic examiners to acquire and examine information on PDAs for both the Pocket PC
       (PPC) and Palm OS platforms.20 Paraben’s product currently supports Palm OS up to version
       5, Pocket PC 2000-2003 (up to Windows CE 4.2), ActiveSync 3.7, and HotSync. PDA
       Seizure’s features include the ability to acquire a forensic image of Palm OS and Pocket PC
       devices, to perform examiner-defined searches on data contained within acquired files,
       generate hash values of individual files and to generate a report of the findings. PDA Seizure
       also provides book-marking capabilities to organize information, along with a graphics library
       that automatically assembles found images under a single facility, based on the graphics file
       extension of the acquired files.

       During the acquisition stage of a PPC device, the connectivity of the device via ActiveSync is
       required. A guest account must be used to create a connection. Before acquisition begins,
       PDA Seizure places a small program on the device in the first available block of memory to
       access unallocated regions of memory. To access the remaining information, PDA Seizure
       utilizes the Remote API (RAPI) protocol, which provides a set of functions for desktop
       applications to communicate with a device and logically access information. For Palm OS
       devices, the PDA must first be put into a debug mode, commonly referred to as console mode,
       and all active HotSync applications must be closed. Once the memory image of a Palm OS
       device is acquired, the user is prompted to select the HotSync button on the device to acquire
       the logical data separately. The logical data is also represented in the RAM image file that was
       acquired through the physical acquisition.

3.5   EnCase

       EnCase is a commercially available forensic software toolkit that provides acquisition of
       suspect media, search and analytical tools, hash generation of individual files, data capture and
