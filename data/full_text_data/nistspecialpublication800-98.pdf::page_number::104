The Center for Democracy and Technology drafted Privacy Best Practices for Deployment of RFID
Technology 77 as a stakeholder response to privacy challenges posed when personally identifiable
information is involved.

6.8     Summary

Privacy considerations are interrelated with security considerations. A key objective of any RFID
security program is to identify risks and controls for safeguarding PII. An organization implementing a
security and privacy program for an RFID system should consult its privacy officer and legal counsel
throughout the information system development life cycle.

A privacy program may protect different types of personal information. Some information is personally
identifiable, meaning that someone can use it to identify a particular individual. Other information may
not be personally identifiable, but individuals may still consider it private even in settings where they are
anonymous. For example, an individual anonymously traveling on a public bus may not want other
passengers to know what items are in her handbag.

Information that is not PII typically is not subject to legal requirements, but many people may still
consider this information personal and worthy of safeguards. Therefore, organizations may still choose to
implement privacy controls voluntarily to safeguard information its customers, business partners,
employees, and other stakeholders consider personal.

Federal law governs Federal government agencies’ collection and handling of PII. Relevant statutes
include the Privacy Act of 1974, the E-Government Act of 2002, FISMA, and the Consolidated
Appropriations Act of 2005. OMB memoranda provide policy guidance and instructions for agencies’
implementation of these laws. The privacy of health information is covered by HIPAA, which applies to
non-Federal as well as Federal entities.

The Federal CIO Council developed a list of privacy control families that provide a reference framework
for those integrating privacy principles into RFID systems. In some cases, controls can serve to enhance
both security and privacy. In other cases, the privacy controls complement security controls. Since RFID
implementations are typically highly customized, the privacy controls listed are not always applicable or
may not be effective for all RFID systems.
