       Annex 11.B Minimum Security Controls

Security controls in the security control catalog (NIST SP 800-53, Appendix F) have a well-
defined organization and structure. The security controls are organized into classes and families
for ease of use in the control selection and specification process. There are three general classes
of security controls (i.e., management, operational, and technical 75 ). Each family contains
security controls related to the security function of the family. A standardized, two-character
identifier is assigned to uniquely identify each control family. Table 11-1 summarizes the classes
and families in the security control catalog and the associated family identifiers.

                      Table 11-1: Security Control Class, Family, and Identifier

Security control class designations (i.e., management, operational, and technical) are defined
below for clarification in preparation of system security plans.
Management controls focus on the management of the information system and the management
of risk for a system. They are techniques and concerns that are normally addressed by
management. Operational controls address security methods focusing on mechanisms primarily
implemented and executed by people (as opposed to systems). These controls are put in place to
improve the security of a particular system (or group of systems). They often require technical or
specialized expertise and often rely upon management activities as well as technical controls.

     Security control families in NIST SP 800-53 are associated with one of three security control classes
     (i.e., management, operational, technical). Families are assigned to their respective classes based on
     the dominant characteristics of the controls in that family. Many security controls, however, can be
     logically associated with more than one class. For example, CP-1, the policy and procedures control
     from the Contingency Planning family, is listed as an operational control but also has characteristics that
     are consistent with security management as well.
