GUIDE TO INTEGRATING FORENSIC TECHNIQUES INTO INCIDENT RESPONSE



Visualization tools are often included in NFAT software, as described in Section 6.2.6. Some
visualization tools can perform traffic reconstruction—by using timestamp and sequential data fields, the
tools can determine the sequence of events and graphically display how the packets traversed the
organization’s networks. Some visualization tools can also be used to display other types of security
event data. For example, an analyst could import intrusion detection records into a visualization tool,
which would then display the data according to several different characteristics, such as source or
destination IP address or port. An analyst could then suppress the display of known good activity so that
only unknown events are shown.

Although visualization tools can be very effective for analyzing certain types of data, analysts typically
experience a steep learning curve with such tools. Importing data into the tool and displaying it is usually
relatively straightforward, but learning how to use the tool efficiently to reduce large datasets to a few
events of interest can take considerable effort. Traffic reconstruction can also be performed by protocol
analyzers. Although these tools generally lack visualization capabilities, they can turn individual packets
into data streams and provide sequential context for activities.

6.4.3   Draw Conclusions

One of the most challenging aspects of network forensics is that the available data is typically not
comprehensive. In many cases, if not most, some network traffic data has not been recorded and
consequently has been lost. Generally, analysts should think of the analysis process as a methodical
approach that develops conclusions based on the data that is available and assumptions regarding the
missing data (which should be based on technical knowledge and expertise). Although analysts should
strive to locate and examine all available data regarding an event, this is not practical in some cases,
particularly when there are many redundant data sources. The analyst should eventually locate, validate,
and analyze enough data to be able to reconstruct the event, understand its significance, and determine its
impact. In many cases, additional data is available from sources other than network traffic–related
sources (e.g., data files or host OSs). Section 8 provides examples of how analysis can correlate this other
data with data from network traffic to get a more accurate and comprehensive view of what occurred.

Generally, analysts should focus on identifying the most important characteristics of the activity and
assessing the negative impact it has caused or may cause the organization. Other actions, such as
determining the identity of an external attacker, are typically time-intensive and difficult to accomplish,
and do not aid the organization in correcting the operational issues or security weaknesses. Determining
the intent of an attacker is also very difficult; for example, an unusual connection attempt could be caused
by an attacker, malicious code, misconfigured software, or an incorrect keystroke, among other causes.
Although understanding intent is important in some cases, the negative impact of the event should be the
primary concern. Establishing the identity of the attacker might be important to the organization,
particularly when criminal activity has occurred, but in other cases it should be weighed against other
important goals to put it into perspective. The focus of the investigation should be determined at the
onset by the appropriate parties, who should decide if learning the identity of the attacker is vital. It is
particularly important to seek the advice of legal counsel when developing policies and procedures related
to making such decisions, as well as when guidance is needed for a particular situation.

Organizations should be interested not only in analyzing real events, but also in understanding the causes
of false alarms. For example, analysts are often well-positioned to identify the root causes of IDS false
positives. As merited, analysts should recommend changes to security event data sources that improve
detection accuracy.
