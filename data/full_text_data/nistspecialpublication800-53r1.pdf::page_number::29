system is a function of the organization’s assessment of risk and what is required to sufficiently
mitigate the risks to organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals. 46

In many cases, additional security controls or control enhancements will be needed to address
specific threats to and vulnerabilities in an information system or to satisfy the requirements of
applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, standards, or regulations. The risk
assessment at this stage in the security control selection process provides important inputs to
determine the sufficiency of the security controls in the tailored baseline—that is, the security
controls needed to adequately protect the organization’s operations (including mission, function,
image, and reputation), the organization’s assets, and individuals. Organizations are encouraged
to make maximum use of the security control catalog to facilitate the process of enhancing
security controls or adding controls to the tailored baseline. To assist in this process, the security
control catalog in Appendix F contains numerous controls and control enhancements that are
found only in higher-impact baselines or are not included in any of the baselines.

There may be situations in which an organization discovers it is employing information
technology beyond its ability to adequately protect critical and/or essential missions. That is, the
organization cannot apply sufficient security controls within an information system to adequately
reduce or mitigate mission risk. In those situations, an alternative strategy is needed to protect the
mission from being impeded; a strategy that considers the mission risks that are being brought
about by an aggressive use of information technology. Information system use restrictions
provide an alternative method to reduce or mitigate risk, for example, when: (i) security controls
cannot be implemented within technology and resource constraints; or (ii) security controls lack
reasonable expectation of effectiveness against identified threat sources. Restrictions on the use
of an information system are sometimes the only prudent or practical course of action to enable
mission accomplishment in the face of determined adversaries.

The determination of required system use restrictions should be made by organizational officials
having a vested interest in the accomplishment of organizational missions. These officials
typically include, but are not limited to, the information system owner, mission owner,
authorizing official, senior agency information security officer, and chief information officer.
Examples of use restrictions include: (i) limiting either the information an information system can
process, store, or transmit or the manner in which a mission is automated; (ii) prohibiting external
information system access to critical organizational information by removing selected system
components from the network (i.e., air gapping); and (iii) prohibiting moderate- or high-impact
information on an information system component to which the public has access, unless an
explicit determination is made authorizing such access.

It is important for organizations to document the decisions taken during the security control
selection process, providing a sound rationale for those decisions whenever possible. This
documentation is essential when examining the overall security considerations for information
systems with respect to potential mission and/or business case impact. The resulting set of
agreed-upon security controls along with the supporting rationale for control selection decisions
and any information system use restrictions are documented in the security plan for the
information system.

     The organization also considers potential impacts to other organizations and, in accordance with the USA
PATRIOT Act and Homeland Security Presidential Directives, potential national-level impacts in categorizing the
information system.
