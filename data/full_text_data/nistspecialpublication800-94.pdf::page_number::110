GUIDE TO INTRUSION DETECTION AND PREVENTION SYSTEMS (IDPS)



      responding to queries about permitting or denying activity, conducting end user testing in a test or
      production environment is also prudent.
When testing host-based IDPSs, organizations should test the most commonly used and important OSs
and applications that need to be protected. The architecture of each OS and each application is different,
so a single product might exhibit significantly different behavior when used on different platforms.

9.7     Summary

Before evaluating IDPS products, organizations should first define the general requirements that the
products should meet. The features provided by IDPS products and the methodologies that they use vary
considerably, so a product that best meets one organization’s requirements might not be suitable for
meeting another organization’s requirements. Evaluators first need to understand the characteristics of
the organization’s system and network environments and plans for near-term changes, so that an IDPS
can be selected that will be compatible with them and able to monitor the events of interest on the systems
and/or networks. This knowledge is also needed to design the IDPS solution. After gaining an
understanding of the existing system and network environments, evaluators should articulate the goals
and objectives they wish to attain by using an IDPS. Evaluators should also review their existing security
and other IT policies before selecting products. The policies serve as a specification for many of the
features that the IDPS products need to provide. In addition, evaluators should understand whether or not
the organization is subject to oversight or review by another organization. If so, they should determine if
that oversight authority requires IDPSs or other specific system security resources. Resource constraints
should also be taken into consideration by evaluators.

In addition to defining general requirements, evaluators also need to define more specialized sets of
requirements:

 Security capabilities, including information gathering, logging, detection, and prevention
 Performance, including maximum capacity and performance features
 Management, including design and implementation, operation and maintenance, and training,
  documentation, and technical support
 Life cycle costs, both initial and maintenance costs.
Organizations could use these criteria as a basis for creating an organization-specific set of criteria that
takes into account an organization’s environment, policies, and existing security and network
infrastructure. After collecting requirements and selecting criteria, evaluators need to find viable sources
of information about the products to be evaluated. Common product data sources include test lab or real-
world product testing, vendor-provided information, third-party product reviews, and previous IDPS
experience from individuals within the organization and trusted individuals at other organizations.

There are major challenges in performing in-depth hands-on IDPS testing with satisfactory results, which
often make it infeasible. Most organizations find the results of limited IDPS testing helpful for evaluating
daily use, interoperability, and security requirements. Organizations should consider using a combination
of several data sources when performing IDPS product evaluations. When using data from other parties,
organizations should consider the fidelity of the data because it is often presented without an explanation
of how it was generated. When performing hands-on IDPS testing, organizations should focus on those
testing methods that are most likely to be valuable and should avoid methods that are more likely to
disrupt the organization’s operations.
