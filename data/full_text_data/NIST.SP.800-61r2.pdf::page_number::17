                                                                  COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE



 Scope of the policy (to whom and what it applies and under what circumstances)
 Definition of computer security incidents and related terms
 Organizational structure and definition of roles, responsibilities, and levels of authority; should
  include the authority of the incident response team to confiscate or disconnect equipment and to
  monitor suspicious activity, the requirements for reporting certain types of incidents, the requirements
  and guidelines for external communications and information sharing (e.g., what can be shared with
  whom, when, and over what channels), and the handoff and escalation points in the incident
  management process
 Prioritization or severity ratings of incidents
 Performance measures (as discussed in Section 3.4.2)
 Reporting and contact forms.

2.3.2   Plan Elements

Organizations should have a formal, focused, and coordinated approach to responding to incidents,
including an incident response plan that provides the roadmap for implementing the incident response
capability. Each organization needs a plan that meets its unique requirements, which relates to the
organization’s mission, size, structure, and functions. The plan should lay out the necessary resources and
management support. The incident response plan should include the following elements:

 Mission
 Strategies and goals
 Senior management approval
 Organizational approach to incident response
 How the incident response team will communicate with the rest of the organization and with other
  organizations
 Metrics for measuring the incident response capability and its effectiveness
 Roadmap for maturing the incident response capability
 How the program fits into the overall organization.
The organization’s mission, strategies, and goals for incident response should help in determining the
structure of its incident response capability. The incident response program structure should also be
discussed within the plan. Section 2.4.1 discusses the types of structures.

Once an organization develops a plan and gains management approval, the organization should
implement the plan and review it at least annually to ensure the organization is following the roadmap for
maturing the capability and fulfilling their goals for incident response.

2.3.3   Procedure Elements

Procedures should be based on the incident response policy and plan. Standard operating procedures
(SOPs) are a delineation of the specific technical processes, techniques, checklists, and forms used by the
incident response team. SOPs should be reasonably comprehensive and detailed to ensure that the
