Figure 6 shows an example implementation for rail monitoring and control. This example
includes a rail control center that houses the SCADA system and three sections of a rail system.
The SCADA system polls the rail sections for information, such as the status of the trains, signal
systems, traction electrification systems, and ticket vending machines. This information is also
fed to operator consoles at the HMI stations within the rail control center. The SCADA system
monitors operator inputs at the rail control center and disperses high-level operator commands to
the rail section components. In addition, the SCADA system monitors conditions at the
individual rail sections and issues commands based on these conditions (e.g., stopping a train to
prevent it from entering an area that has been flooded or is occupied by another train).
