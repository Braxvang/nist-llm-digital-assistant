D.5.3 Global Trade Information Type

Global Trade refers to those activities the Federal Government undertakes to advance worldwide
economic prosperity by increasing trade through the opening of overseas markets and freeing the
flow of goods, services, and capital. Trade encompasses all activities associated with the
importing and exporting of goods to and from the United States. This includes goods
declaration, fee payments, and delivery/shipment authorization. Export promotion involves the
development of opportunities for the expansion of U.S. exports. Merchandise inspection
includes the verification of goods and merchandise as well as the surveillance, interdiction, and
investigation of imports/exports in violation of various Customs laws. Tariffs/quotas monitoring
refers to the monitoring and modification of the schedules of items imported and exported to and
from the United States. The recommended categorization for the global trade information type
follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, High), (integrity, High), (availability, High)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of export promotion
information on the ability of responsible agencies to advance worldwide economic prosperity by
increasing trade through the opening of overseas markets and freeing the flow of goods, services,
and capital. Also, the confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of
merchandise inspection information on the ability of responsible agencies to accurately
determine, report, and record the discovered status of imported or exported merchandise as it
bears on violations of various Customs laws. Generally, the unauthorized disclosure of
merchandise inspection information will not jeopardize the completion of other merchandise
inspection missions, as shipment status is generally information of public record. The
confidentiality impact level is also the effect of unauthorized disclosure of tariffs/quotas
monitoring information on the ability of responsible agencies to enforce various Customs laws,
and preserve statistical data concerning the historical compliance with such laws. Typically, the
unauthorized disclosure of tariffs/quotas monitoring information will not jeopardize the
completion of other tariffs/quotas monitoring missions because the information is publicly
available.

Unauthorized disclosure of information that has supported an export promotion process may
undo the results of successful export promotion processes. The consequent threat to agency
image or reputations can cause a catastrophic adverse effect on an agency’s mission capability.
Consequently, the general confidentiality impact level associated with export promotion
information is high. Some information that has supported a tariffs/quotas monitoring process
might be of higher sensitivity, such as intelligence information 36 that might point to a dumping
situation. The unauthorized disclosure of this information might jeopardize the success of future
