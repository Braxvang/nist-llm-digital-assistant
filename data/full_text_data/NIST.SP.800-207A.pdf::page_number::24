       Functional Roles of Application Infrastructure Elements in Enforcing
Policies
This section discusses the functionality of each of the application infrastructure elements
involved in the policies (e.g., firewalls, gateways, sidecar, transit, and edge proxies). Since the
functionality of firewalls that take part in this context for coarse network-tier policies is well
known, this section focuses on the functionality of gateways that take part in fine-grained
network and identity-tier policies:
   •   Sidecar — Beside each application instance to intercept all traffic into and out of the
       application and handles east-west internal communication between services in the
       infrastructure. This is the primary use case of the service mesh.
   •   Ingress gateway — Controls how applications in the cluster are exposed outside (e.g.,
       managing what names, certificates, ports, protocols, and application endpoints are served
       to the world outside of the cluster). Think of this as the service mesh control plane that
       manages a traditional reverse proxy similar to Spring Cloud Gateway, NGINX, or
       HAProxy.
   •   Egress gateway — Controls how applications in the cluster communicate with the outside
       world. This can be used for traditional egress filtering and logging, like a Squid proxy,
       but can also implement an identity-based policy for what is allowed to call out and
       perform credential exchange, or present a set of credentials (e.g., an mTLS certificate for
       a partner API), on behalf of the application so that the application does not need to handle
       them (e.g., communicating via mTLS with the partner API). Think of this as a next-
       generation identity-aware Squid proxy.
   •   Edge gateway — Accepts external traffic before the ingress gateway and performs fine-
       grained load balancing across clusters or sites. It is used to terminate external traffic,
       enable infrastructure-level failover, deploy blue-green clusters, and facilitate ingress-
       gateway-per-team deployments without requiring each of those teams to have publicly
       routable ingress gateways. Think of this as a modern software-based local traffic
       manager, like F5, that can apply policy per-request rather than per-connection.
