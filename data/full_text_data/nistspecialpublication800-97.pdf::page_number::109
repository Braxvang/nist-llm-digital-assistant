          The nature of electromagnetic radiation is such that determining the precise boundaries of a WLAN is not feasible. Nevertheless, an organization can estimate boundaries for
          usable coverage ranges based on empirical tests with typical STAs and APs.
108
          The core risk associated with lack of AP physical security is that someone might be able to reset the AP to manufacturer defaults, which could disable RSN protections.
          Exactly what needs to be physically secured depends on the characteristics of the AP technology. When discussing the concept of an AP, this document assumes that AP
          security and radio functionality are integrated in the same device. In most cases, particularly home and small office applications, this is true. However, in some product
          offerings, a WLAN switch supports the IEEE 802.11i RSN AP security functions of session keys generation, TKIP or CCMP encapsulation and decapsulation, and pass
          through communication between the STA and AS. This switch connects to multiple radio devices, each of which has an antenna and proprietary methods for secure
          communication with the switch. In an IEEE 802.11i RSN, the device requiring physical security is the one that performs the AP security functions. When those functions are
          performed on a WLAN switch, that switch should be in a locked communications closet, server room, or data center. When those functions are collocated with the radio, then
          the radio should be physically secured. In many cases, the radios often are placed on conference tables, above ceiling tiles, or in other areas that are easily accessible. In these
          cases, the radio should be placed in a locked box with holes that allow for protruding antennas.
109
          A VLAN is a logical group of STAs that communicate as if they were on the same physical LAN, even though they might be on different ones. VLANs are created through
          the configuration of one or more switches across an enterprise.
