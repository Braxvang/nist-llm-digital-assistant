NIST SP 800-160v1r1                                                                            Engineering Trustworthy Secure Systems
November 2022

Systems security engineering overlaps with other subdisciplines and leverages multiple
specialties to accomplish systems security engineering activities and tasks. These specialties
include computer security; communications security; transmission security; electronic emissions
security; anti-tamper protection; physical security; information, software, hardware, and supply
chain assurance; and technology specialties, such as biometrics and cryptography.

Systems security engineering also leverages contributions from other enabling engineering
disciplines and specialties to analyze and manage complexity, interconnectedness, dynamicity,
and susceptibility associated with hardware, software, and firmware-based technologies. 46 This
includes the development, manufacturing, handling, and distribution of technologies throughout
the system life cycle. 47

Figure 9 illustrates the relationships among systems engineering, systems security engineering,
and contributing security and other specialty engineering areas.




                      Fig. 9. Systems Engineering and Other Specialty Engineering Disciplines

As part of a transdisciplinary systems engineering effort to deliver a trustworthy secure system,
systems security engineering:
â€¢    Works with stakeholders to ensure that security objectives, protection needs and concerns,
     assurance needs, security requirements (including measures of effectiveness [MOEs] and
     measures of performance [MOPs]), and associated validation methods are defined

46
   Enabling engineering disciplines and specialties include reliability, availability, and maintainability (RAM) engineering; software engineering;
resilience engineering; and human factors engineering (ergonomics).
47
   This includes assessing potential supply chain assurance deficiencies when third parties and reuse are considered in planning the system and its
realization.
