                      destruction.
Key-management        A function in the lifecycle of keying material; a repository
archive               containing keying material of historical interest.
Key pair              A public key and its corresponding private key; a key pair is
                      used with a public-key algorithm.
Key recovery          Mechanisms and processes that allow authorized entities to
                      retrieve keying material from key backup or an archive.
Key transport         A key-establishment procedure whereby one entity (the sender)
                      selects a value for secret keying material and then securely
                      distributes that value to another party (the receiver).
Key wrapping          A method of encrypting keys (along with associated integrity
                      information) that provides both confidentiality and integrity
                      protection using a symmetric key.
Keying material       The data (e.g., keys and IVs) necessary to establish and
                      maintain cryptographic keying relationships.
Message               A cryptographic checksum on data that uses a symmetric key to
Authentication Code   detect both accidental and intentional modifications of data.
(MAC)
Non-repudiation       A service that is used to provide assurance of the integrity and
                      origin of data in such a way that the integrity and origin can be
                      verified by a third party as having originated from a specific
                      entity in possession of the private key of the claimed signatory.
Nonce                 A time-varying value that has, at most, a negligible chance of
                      repeating. For example, a nonce could be a random value that is
                      generated anew for each instance of a nonce, a timestamp, a
                      sequence number, or some combination of these.
Owner                 For an asymmetric key pair, the entity that owns the private
                      key, whether that entity generated the key pair or a trusted party
                      generated the key pair for the entity.

                      In Encrypted File Systems, the file owner has control over the
                      file and grants access of the file to others. A file may have one
                      or more owners. An owner could be an individual or a group of
                      individuals or processes
Password              A string of characters (letters, numbers and other symbols) that
                      are used to authenticate an identity or to verify access
                      authorization.
Payload               A part of the data stream representing the user information and
                      user overhead in a communication.
Plaintext             Intelligible data that has meaning and can be understood
