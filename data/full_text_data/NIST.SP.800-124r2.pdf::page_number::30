NIST SP 800-124r2                                                   Guidelines for Managing the Security
May 2023                                                             of Mobile Devices in the Enterprise

   •   Strongly encrypt data communications between the mobile device and the organization.
       This encryption is most often accomplished by a VPN (see Section 4.1.4), although it can
       be established through other uses of secure protocols and encryption.
   •   Strongly encrypt stored data on both built-in storage and removable media storage.
       Removable media also can be “bound” to particular devices so that encrypted information
       can only be decrypted when the removable media is attached to that specific device,
       thereby mitigating the risk of offline attacks on the media.
   •   Wipe the device before reissuing it to another user, retiring the device, etc.
   •   Remotely wipe the device to scrub its stored data if it is suspected that the device has
       been lost, stolen, or otherwise fallen into untrusted hands and is at risk of its data being
       recovered by an untrusted party.

4.2.2. Mobile Application Management
Some EMM systems include MAM functionality, which enables fine-grained control over
different apps on a single managed device, although MAM may also be offered as a distinct
third-party solution. MAM systems are designed to enable enterprise control over mobile apps
that access enterprise services and/or data. These apps include privately developed apps and
publicly available apps. Unlike MDMs, MAM systems do not require the device owner to enroll
the device under enterprise management, nor must the owner accept installation of an enterprise
profile on the device. This distinction is critical for apps designed, for example, to support
business-to-business (B2B) transactions (e.g., an app provided to suppliers to enable access to an
enterprise orders database). In such cases, the mobile user is not an employee of the enterprise
that offers the app. For enterprises with bring your own device (BYOD) policies, the use of
MAM functionality instead of MDM may help address users’ privacy concerns regarding their
personal devices.
Apps used on mobile devices may be managed using EMM technology. Depending on how the
device is managed and enrolled into an EMM solution, the following restrictions may be applied:
   •   Restrict which app stores may be used (e.g., limit access to official app stores, restrict
       sideloading apps).
   •   Restrict which apps may be installed by allowlisting allowed apps (preferable) or
       blocklisting prohibited apps. Allowlisting and blocklisting capabilities are highly
       platform-dependent and may not be available on all MAM systems.
   •   Restrict the permissions (e.g., camera access, location access) assigned to each app. App-
       wrapping technology (described further in Section 4.2.6) may be used; it is highly
       platform-dependent and may also limit app functionality.
   •   Safeguard mechanisms to install, update, and remove apps on a mobile device. Keep a
       current inventory of all apps installed on each device. This capability is highly platform-
       dependent and may not be available on all systems.
   •   Restrict the use of OS and app synchronization and sharing services (e.g., local device
       synchronization, remote synchronization services and websites).
