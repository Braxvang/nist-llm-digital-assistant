Appendix B—Data Model and Interfaces for Removable (Non-Embedded) Hardware
                   Cryptographic Tokens (Normative)

This appendix provides data model and interface requirements for the Derived PIV Applications
implemented on removable hardware cryptographic tokens.

B.1       Derived PIV Application Data Model and Representation

The data model and representation requirements for Derived PIV Applications are based on the
requirements for PIV Card Applications as described in [SP800-73Part1] . The specifications for the
mandatory and optional data objects listed below are the same as the specifications of the corresponding
data objects on a PIV Card Application as described in [SP800-73Part1] , except for the general
difference that the contactless interface is not supported by the Derived PIV Application.

B.1.1        Derived PIV Application Identifier

The Application Identifier (AID) of the Derived PIV Application shall be:

           'A0 00 00 03 08         00 00 20 00     01 00'

The Derived PIV Application can be selected as the current application on the removable hardware
cryptographic token by providing the full AID listed above or by providing the right truncated version, as
follows:

           'A0 00 00 03 08         00 00 20 00'

B.1.2        Derived PIV Application Data Model Elements

The Derived PIV Application shall contain the following mandatory interoperable data object:

          X.509 Certificate for Derived PIV Authentication—The read access control rule for X.509
           Certificate for Derived PIV Authentication and the PKI cryptographic function access rule for the
           corresponding private key are as described for the X.509 Certificate for PIV Authentication in
           Section 3.1.3 of [SP800-73Part1] .
The optional data objects are as follows:

          X.509 Certificate for Digital Signature—The read access control rule for the X.509 Certificate
           for Digital Signature and the PKI cryptographic function access rule for the corresponding private
           key are as described in Section 3.2.1 of [SP800-73Part1] .

          X.509 Certificate for Key Management—The read access control rule for the X.509 Certificate
           for Key Management and the PKI cryptographic function access rule for the corresponding
           private key are as described in Section 3.2.2 of [SP800-73Part1] .

          Discovery Object—The requirements for the Discovery Object are as described in Section 3.3.2
           of [SP800-73Part1] except for the following:

               o   References to “PIV Card Application AID” are replaced by “Derived PIV Application
                   AID.”

               o   References to “PIV Card Application PIN” are replaced by “Derived PIV Application
