                                                                                       GUIDE TO SSL VPNS



 SSL VPN users require access to a portal so they can login to the SSL VPN and gain access to
  internal resources. The portal can either be supplied by the SSL VPN device vendor or developed by
  the organization itself. The organization’s access control policy determines the VPN options
  available to a user.
 The strongest possible cryptographic algorithms and key lengths that are considered secure for current
  practice should be used for encryption and integrity protection unless they are incompatible with
  performance and export constraints. For government agencies, traffic that requires protection must
  employ FIPS-compliant cryptographic algorithms.
 Other design decisions include IPv6 capability, incident response, log management, and redundancy.
 Testing of the prototype implementation should evaluate multiple factors including connectivity,
  authentication, access control, endpoint security, application and client interoperability, management,
  network management, logging, performance, portal design and layout, and security.
 It is important to launch a pilot program before enterprise-wide deployment. Once this program has
  been launched, it is recommended to gradually migrate existing network infrastructure, applications,
  and users to the new SSL VPN solution.
 After implementation, the SSL VPN solution needs to be maintained. Such maintenance can include
  applying patches and deploying SSL VPN connectivity to additional remote sites. Operational issues
  also need to be addressed and resolved.
 Organizations should implement technical, operational, and management controls that support and
  complement SSL VPN implementations. Examples include having control over all entry and exit
  points for the protected networks, ensuring the security of all SSL VPN endpoints, and incorporating
  SSL VPN considerations into organizational policies.
