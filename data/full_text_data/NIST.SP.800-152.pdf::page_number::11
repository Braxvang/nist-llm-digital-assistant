SP 800-152                                                          A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


1 Introduction
This Profile for U.S. Federal Cryptographic Key Management Systems (FCKMSs1) is based
on [SP 800-130], entitled “A Framework for Designing Cryptographic Key Management
Systems (CKMS),” which provides a foundation for designing and implementing CKMSs.
The Framework specifies requirements for designing any commercial or Federal CKMS,
while this Profile provides more-specific design requirements for an FCKMS, and includes
additional requirements for testing, procuring, installing, managing, operating, maintaining,
and using FCKMSs.

This Profile specifies requirements for all FCKMSs. It is intended to assist CKMS designers
and implementers to select and support appropriate security services and key-management
functions, and to assist FCKMS procurers, administrators, service-providing organizations,
and service-using organizations to select appropriate CKMSs or CKMS services. This Profile
specifies requirements for all organizations desiring to operate or use an FCKMS, either
directly or under contract; makes recommendations for Federal organizations having special
security needs and desiring to augment the base security and key-management services; and
suggests additional FCKMS features that may be desirable for Federal organizations to
implement and use now or in the future

This Profile can be used by agencies and organizations to understand their FCKMSs, and to
adopt, adapt and migrate their FCKMSs to comply with the Profile requirements over time.
NIST does not expect that these requirements would be implemented immediately, but that
agencies would use these requirements when creating or procuring FCKMSs or FCKMS
services for their Enterprise Architectures. Agencies can also use these requirements to
assess and understand potential gaps that exist in their current FCKMSs. As agencies plan
for changes, migrations and upgrades, these requirements and the gap assessment can be used
to improve the security of FCKMs overall.

This Profile is intended to:
    1. Assist CKMS designers and implementers in supporting appropriate key and
       metadata management functions, cryptographic key types, key metadata, and
       protocols for protecting sensitive U.S. Federal computing applications and data;
    2. Establish requirements for FCKMS testing, procurement, installation, configuration,
       administration, operation, maintenance and usage;
    3. Facilitate an easy comparison of one FCKMS with another by analyzing their designs
       and implementations in order to understand how each meets the Framework and
       Profile requirements; and
    4. Assist in understanding what is needed to evaluate, procure, install, configure,
       administer, operate, and use an FCKMS that manages the cryptographic keys that
       protect sensitive and valuable data obtained, processed, stored, and used by U.S.
       Federal organizations and their contractors.

 A CKMS is intended to be the system designed and built by a CKMS designer and implementer, while an
FCKMS is the system used by the Federal government, after the CKMS has been designed and configured to be
compliant with Federal needs.
