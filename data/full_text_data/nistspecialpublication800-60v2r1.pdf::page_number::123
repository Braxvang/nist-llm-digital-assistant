Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to record retention information.
Functions and processes supported by most record retention information are not time-critical.
Record retention processes are generally tolerant of reasonable delays. In most cases,
disruption of access to record retention information can be expected to have only a limited
adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Not many business management systems perform functions for which temporary loss of
availability can cause significant degradation in mission capability, place the agency at a
significant disadvantage, result in major damage to assets, or pose a threat to human life.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
record retention information is low.
C.3.5.7 Information Management Information Type

Information Management involves the coordination of information collection, storage, and
dissemination, and destruction as well as managing the policies, guidelines, and standards
regarding information management. Subject to exception conditions described below, the
recommended security categorization for the information management information type is as
follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Moderate), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of information
management information on the ability of responsible agencies to perform the day-to-day
processes of information collection, storage, dissemination, and destruction and managing the
policies, guidelines, and standards regarding information management. The consequences of
unauthorized disclosure depend largely on the content and use of the information being managed.
The unauthorized disclosure of information management information relevant to most
information managed by the government will have only a limited adverse effect on agency
operations, assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Information collection and storage
involve the day-to-day processes of gathering and storing data from agency programs, partners,
and stakeholders. More sensitive information being managed is usually personal information
subject to the Privacy Act of 1974 or information that is proprietary to a corporation or other
organization. The Privacy Act Information provisional impact levels are documented in the
Personal Identity and Authentication information type. Such information will often be assigned
a moderate confidentiality impact level

Where any of the information to be managed can be expected to have a high confidentiality,
impact level, then the information management information must be assigned a high
confidentiality impact level. When the data being managed belongs to one of the information
types described in this guideline, the confidentiality impact assigned to the system is that of the
highest impact information type processed by the system. Depending on the agency and the
mission being supported, the sensitivity of the information can range from none (public
