                                    ESTABLISHING WIRELESS ROBUST SECURITY NETWORKS: A GUIDE TO IEEE 802.11I



9.3.3   Summary and Evaluation

The case study reviewed GRC’s experience with the initiation and acquisition/development phases of the
information systems development life cycle with respect to its WLAN deployment. The commission’s
objective was to use WLAN technology to improve public access to its information. Its project got off to
a strong start largely because it correctly identified when RSNs would facilitate progress towards that
objective and when they might not.

The initial GRC analysis led to a high-level design that tailored the RSN strategy for each area in the
building based on the level of protection needed given the user community it served. In summary, GRC’s
main building had three areas that would be supported by WLANs: the commission offices, the
administrative law courtrooms, and the Public Information Resource Center.

The solution in the commission offices was similar to WLAN deployments in many organizations,
providing users with mobility they did not previously enjoy. The solution for the courtrooms, however,
was innovative and greatly expedited the legal administrative processes with which many were frustrated.
IEEE 802.11 RSN technology enabled this significant increase in productivity because the judges would
not have permitted courtroom network connections without the assurance the RSN provided.

The WLAN solution in the Public Information Resource Center also was an enabling technology,
allowing visitors to complete research projects more efficiently than ever before. However, the solution
was an open system, providing no link layer security. This configuration at first seemed precarious, but
given that the Center’s data was public and its WLAN was isolated from other network resources with
firewall technology, RSN protections were deemed unnecessary.
