      NIST SP 800-217 ipd                         Guidelines for PIV Federation (Initial Public Draft)
      January 2023


473   Note that the use of a home IdP is the only means of making non-PKI-based derived
474   PIV credentials available across security domain boundaries due to the nature of the
475   authenticators, as discussed in [SP800-157].

476   2.2.2. PIV IdP
477   The PIV IdP is the PIV IdP identified in a trust agreement to provide federated assertions
478   for a population of PIV identity accounts for an RP. Establishment of the PIV IdP is
479   discussed in greater detail in Sec. 3.
480   In most cases, the RP’s determination of the PIV IdP depends on the agency that issues
481   the PIV identity account. Therefore, an RP will only accept assertions of PIV identity
482   accounts of a particular agency from a specific IdP. However, it is possible for the RP to
483   be more specific and determine the PIV IdP on a per-account basis, subject to the trust
484   agreements in place.
485   It is possible for an RP’s definition of the PIV IdP for a given PIV identity account to
486   change over time as the federation relationship changes for a variety of reasons, including
487   reorganization of the PIV identity account’s issuing agency or redeployment of the IdP.

488   2.3. PIV Credentials
489   PIV identity accounts are protected using one or more PIV credentials that are bound to
490   the account. PIV credentials can take the form of different kinds of authenticators, each
491   kind suitable for different purposes and use cases.
492   The primary credential for a PIV identity account is the PIV Card, which is issued to the
493   subscriber, as defined in [FIPS201].
494   A PIV identity account can also have multiple derived PIV credentials associated with it,
495   as described in [SP800-157].

496   2.4. Relying Parties
497   In the context of a PIV federation, a subscriber logs into the RP using the federation
498   protocol to use the RP’s services and functionality. The nature of the services provided
499   by the RP and the nature of the RP’s deployment are outside the scope of this document.
500   General requirements for the RP in a PIV federation are discussed in Sec. 5.2, and general
501   requirements for RPs in all federation contexts are discussed in [SP800-63C].
502   In PIV federation, the RP does not directly verify the authentication of the PIV credential,
503   nor does the RP manage the PIV identity account. The RP’s only view into the contents
504   and status of the PIV identity account comes through its interactions with the IdP. The
505   RP can manage its own local reference to the PIV identity account, known as the RP
506   subscriber account, as discussed in Sec. 5.2.2.
