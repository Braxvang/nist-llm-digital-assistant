      <EnrollmentDate>:
             This element contains the date the subject of the chain-of-trust enrollment
             record enrolled for a PIV Card. The <EnrollmentDate> element is optional
             and occurs once when included in the EPBioGraphicType complex type. The
             data is provided in an xs:date format.

3.9     Complex Type EPBiometricsType

The following schema fragment defines the EPBiometricsType complex type:
<xs:complexType name="EPBiometricsType">
  <xs:sequence>
    <xs:element name="Photo" type="xs:base64Binary" minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1"/>
    <xs:element name="FingerprintOffCardComparisonRepresentation" type="xs:base64Binary"
       minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1" />
    <xs:element name="FingerprintOnCardComparisonRepresentation" type="xs:base64Binary"
       minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1"/>
    <xs:element name="IrisRepresentation" type="xs:base64Binary" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1"/>
  </xs:sequence>
</xs:complexType>

The EPBiometrics complex type contains information related to the biometric data of the
subject of the chain-of-trust enrollment record, as captured during PIV enrollment
including the primary and secondary fingerprint representation. The four elements
supported in the EPBiometrics complex type are:

      <Photo>:
            This element is required. The <Photo> element contains the facial image
            collected during the enrollment process, as documented in [SP800-76]
            Biometric Specifications for Personal Identity Verification. The <Photo>
            element includes the CBEFF Header, the INCITS 385 profile for PIV facial
            images, and the CBEFF signature. The facial image is used to both print the
            image on the card and as the digital representation stored in the PIV Card. The
            data is provided in an xs:base64Binary format.
