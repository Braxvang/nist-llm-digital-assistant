6.5.3. Recovery Communications (RC.CO)
Restoration activities are coordinated with internal and external parties. In addition to operational
recovery, an organization may need to manage public relations and repair its reputation.
Supplemental guidance for recovery communications can be found in the following document:
   •   NIST SP 800-184, Guide for Cybersecurity Event Recovery
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            A list of internal and external resources for recovery activities should be
            developed as part of the recovery planning effort. During an event, this
            list should be used to get all necessary personnel on-site, as required, to
            recover within the RTO and RPO.
