4.     Technical Steps for Data De-Identifcation

The goal of de-identifcation is to transform data in a way that protects privacy while pre-
serving the validity of inferences drawn on that data within the context of a target use case.
This section discusses technical options for performing de-identifcation and verifying the
result of a de-identifcation procedure.
Agencies should adopt a detailed, written process for de-identifying data prior to com-
mencing work on a de-identifcation project. The details of the process will depend on
the particular de-identifcation approach that is pursued. In developing technical steps
for data de-identifcation, agencies may wish to consider existing de-identifcation stan-
dards, such as the HIPAA Privacy Rule [166, 3], ISO/IEC 27559:2022 (“Privacy enhancing
data de-identifcation framework”) [82], the IHE De-Identifcation Handbook [79], or the
HITRUST De-Identifcation Framework [101].

4.1.    Determine the Privacy, Data Usability, and Access Objectives
Agencies intent on de-identifying data for release should understand the nature of the
data that they intend to de-identify and determine the policies and standards that will be
used to determine acceptable levels of data accuracy, de-identifcation, and the risk of re-
identifcation. For example:
     • Where did the data come from?
     • What promises were made when the data were collected?
     • What are the legal and regulatory requirements regarding data privacy and release?
     • What is the purpose of the data release?
     • What is the intended use of the data?
     • What data-sharing model ( Sec. 3.4) will be used?
     • Which standards for privacy protection or de-identifcation will be used?
     • What is the level of risk that the project is willing to accept?
     • What are the goals for limiting re-identifcation? For example:
          – No one can be re-identifed.
          – Only a few people can be re-identifed.
          – Only a few people can be re-identifed in theory, but no one will actually be
            re-identifed in practice.
