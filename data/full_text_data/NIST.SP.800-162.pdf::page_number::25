                                                                                             Policy Decision Point (PDP): Computes access decisions by evaluating the applicable DPs and MPs. One

                                                                                             The PEP enforces decisions made by the PDP:

                                                                                             Policy Enforcement Point (PEP): Enforces policy decisions in response to a request from a subject
                                                                                             requesting access to a protected object; the access control decisions are made by the PDP.

                                                                                             PDP and PEP functionality can be distributed or centralized, and may be physically and logically separated
                                                                                             from each other. For example, an enterprise could establish a centrally controlled enterprise decision

                                                                                             organizations within the enterprise may implement separate PDPs which draw on a centralized DP store.
                                                                                             The design and distribution of ACM components requires a management function to ensure coordination
