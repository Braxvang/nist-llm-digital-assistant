NIST’s Trustworthy Networks Program works with industry partners to advance the research,
standardization, and adoption of the technologies that are necessary to increase the security, privacy,
robustness, and performance of networked systems. This includes resolving systemic vulnerabilities
in existing and emerging critical network infrastructures and advancing the development of
potentially disruptive technologies to improve the trustworthiness of future networks. To achieve
these goals, NIST works closely with standards development organizations to improve the quality
and timeliness of emerging technical specifications. NIST’s contributions often include innovating
and applying the measurement science necessary to improve an industry’s trust and confidence
in the design and deployment of new technologies. NIST’s contributions follow the full cycle of
problem identification, standardization of solutions, development of reference implementations
and test tools, publication of deployment guidance, and demonstration and documentation of the
recommended practices when using the resulting commercial products and services.
Core Network Infrastructure Resilience
The following sections describe NIST’s focus on current and emerging technologies that underlie
almost all communication and information systems, spanning enterprise, Internet, and consumer
networks.
Internet Infrastructure Protection
Addressing systemic vulnerabilities in the Internet's foundational protocols and infrastructure
has been identified as a national priority. NIST’s Internet Infrastructure Protection efforts aim to
expedite the design, standardization, commercialization, and deployment of new technologies to
address systemic vulnerabilities in the core infrastructure of the modern Internet. NIST has a long
history of working with the Internet industry to standardize and promulgate new technologies to
address pressing security and robustness issues in core Internet protocols.
