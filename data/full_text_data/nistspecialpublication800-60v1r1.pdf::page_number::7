EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Title III of the E-Government Act (Public Law 107-347), titled the Federal Information Security
Management Act (FISMA), tasked the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to
develop:
    •   Standards to be used by all Federal agencies to categorize all information and information
        systems collected or maintained by or on behalf of each agency based on the objectives
        of providing appropriate levels of information security according to a range of risk levels;
    •   Guidelines recommending the types of information and information systems to be
        included in each such category; and
    •   Minimum information security requirements (i.e., management, operational, and
        technical security controls), for information and information systems in each such
        category.
In response to the second of these tasks, this guideline has been developed to assist Federal
government agencies to categorize information and information systems. The guideline’s
objective is to facilitate application of appropriate levels of information security according to a
range of levels of impact or consequences that might result from the unauthorized disclosure,
modification, or use of the information or information system. This guideline assumes that the
user is familiar with Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and
Information Systems (Federal Information Processing Standard [FIPS] 199). The guideline and
its appendices:
    •   Review the security categorization terms and definitions established by FIPS 199;
    •   Recommend a security categorization process;
    •   Describe a methodology for identifying types of Federal information and information
        systems;
    •   Suggest provisional 1 security impact levels for common information types;
    •   Discuss information attributes that may result in variances from the provisional impact
        level assignment; and
    •   Describe how to establish a system security categorization based on the system’s use,
        connectivity, and aggregate information content.
This document is intended as a reference resource rather than as a tutorial and not all of the
material will be relevant to all agencies. This document includes two volumes, a basic guideline
and a volume of appendices. Users should review the guidelines provided in Volume I, then
refer to only that specific material from the appendices that applies to their own systems and
applications. The provisional impact assignments are provided in Volume II, Appendix C and D.
The basis employed in this guideline for the identification of information types is the Office of


1
 Provisional security impact levels are the initial or conditional impact determinations made until all
considerations are fully reviewed, analyzed, and accepted in the subsequent categorization steps by appropriate
officials.
