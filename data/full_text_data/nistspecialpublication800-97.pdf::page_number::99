                                           ESTABLISHING WIRELESS ROBUST SECURITY NETWORKS: A GUIDE TO IEEE 802.11I



7.3.1    WPA Features

The Wi-Fi Alliance introduced WPA in early 2003 to address serious vulnerabilities inherent in WEP,
which was the only available IEEE 802.11 security protection at that time. WPA is a subset 93 of IEEE
802.11i that provides a solution to WEP’s major problems. To accomplish this protection, WPA
leverages the following core security features from IEEE 802.11i:

      IEEE 802.1X and EAP authentication
      Key generation and distribution based on the IEEE 802.11i 4-Way Handshake
      TKIP mechanisms including

         –    Encapsulation and decapsulation

         –    Replay protection

         –    Michael MIC integrity protection.
Table 7-2 summarizes the primary features provided by IEEE 802.11i that are not included in the WPA
test criteria. Organizations that have deployed WPA-compliant equipment can still support IEEE 802.11i
RSNs based on TKIP; however, organizations need to determine if the absence of the features not present
in WPA is acceptable in their environment. For government organizations, where FIPS compliance is
required, this is not acceptable.

             Feature                                                  Discussion
 IBSS support                       WPA does not cover RSN peer-to-peer relationships (i.e., those without
                                    APs), also known as ad hoc mode, but this configuration is not common in
                                    most enterprises.
 Secure fast 94 handoff             This capability allows users to move from one BSS to another without
 (through Pre-Authentication        having to go through the entire authentication process each time.
 and PMKSA caching)                 Organizations whose users are expected to migrate between various
                                    BSSs frequently (e.g., more than once an hour) may require secure fast
                                    handoff to avoid a situation in which users demand a weakening of
                                    security requirements to improve performance when they are mobile.
 AES-CCMP encapsulation             WPA does not require support for AES-CCMP because the AES-related
                                    portions of 802.11i were not sufficiently specified when WPA was
                                    released. In most cases, pre-WPA products can achieve WPA-level
                                    security with a software upgrade. However, organizations that require
                                    FIPS-validated encryption need to procure WLAN products that use FIPS-
                                    validated AES-CCMP modules.


7.3.2    WPA2 Features

Released in September 2004, WPA2 is the Wi-Fi Alliance’s interoperability certification program for the
complete ratified version of IEEE 802.11i. If a product holds the WPA2 certification, it complies
completely with the IEEE 802.11 standard as amended by IEEE 802.11i and should work seamlessly with
other WPA2-certified products under most operating conditions. Also, WPA2 is backward compatible

93
     There are some subtle differences between the TKIP in WPA and in IEEE 802.11i, and the 4-Way Handshake. The WPA
     suites are also identified by a different OUI than the IEEE 802.11i suites.
94
     In reality, Pre-Authentication and PMKSA caching are not considered to provide a sufficiently fast handoff to support layer
     2 mobility; this was one of the motivations for creating the IEEE 802.11r Task Group, Fast Roaming/Fast BSS Transition.
