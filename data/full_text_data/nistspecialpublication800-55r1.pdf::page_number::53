                      Measure 3: Access Control (AC) (system-level)
         Field                                                Data
Measure ID       Remote Access Control Measure 1 (or a unique identifier to be filled out by the
                 organization)
Goal             •   Strategic Goal: Ensure an environment of comprehensive security and accountability
                     for personnel, facilities, and products.
                 •   Information Security Goal: Restrict information, system, and component access to
                     individuals or machines that are identifiable, known, credible, and authorized.
Measure          Percentage (%) of remote access points used to gain unauthorized access
                 NIST SP 800-53 Controls: AC-17; Remote Access
Measure Type     Effectiveness/Efficiency
Formula          (Number of remote access points used to gain unauthorized access/total number of remote
                 access points) *100
Target           This should be a low percentage defined by the organization.
Implementation   1. Does the organization use automated tools to maintain an up-to-date network diagram
Evidence         that identifies all remote access points (CM-2)?
                       Yes                     No
                 2. How many remote access points exist in the organization’s network? _____
                 3. Does the organization employ Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) to monitor traffic
                 traversing remote access points (SI-4)?
                       Yes                     No
                 4. Does the organization collect and review audit logs associated with all remote access
                 points (AU-6)?
                       Yes                     No
                 5. Does the organization maintain a security incident database that identifies standardized
                 incident categories for each incident (IR-5)?
                       Yes                     No
                 6. Based on reviews of the incident database, IDS logs and alerts, and/or appropriate
                 remote access point log files, how many access points have been used to gain
                 unauthorized access within the reporting period? ______
Frequency        Collection Frequency: Organization-defined (example: monthly)
                 Reporting Frequency: Organization-defined (example: quarterly)
Responsible      •   Information Owner: Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT)
Parties
                 •   Information Collector: System Administrator or Information System Security Officer
                     (ISSO)
                 •   Information Customer: Chief Information Officer (CIO), Senior Agency Information
                     Security Officer (SAISO) (e.g., Chief Information Security Officer [CISO])
Data Source      Incident database, audit logs, network diagrams, IDS logs and alerts
Reporting        Stacked bar chart, by month, which illustrates the percentage of remote access points used
Format           for unauthorized access versus the total number of remote access points
