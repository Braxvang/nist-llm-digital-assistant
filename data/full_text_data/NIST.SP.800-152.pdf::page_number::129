SP 800-152                                                             A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


12 Technological Challenges
A CKMS should be designed and implemented to have a security lifetime of many years.
The CKMS designer, FCKMS service provider and the FCKMS service-using
organization should periodically evaluate possible threats resulting from advances in
technology that may render its key-management services insecure, including16:

       a) New attacks on cryptographic algorithms,
       b) New attacks on key-establishment protocols,
       c) New attacks on FCKMS devices, and
       d) New computing technologies.

FR:12.1 The CKMS design shall specify the expected security lifetime of each
cryptographic algorithm implemented in the system.

FR:12.2 The CKMS design shall specify which sub-functions (e.g., the hash sub-
function of HMAC) of the cryptographic algorithms can be upgraded or replaced with
similar, but cryptographically improved, sub-functions without negatively affecting the
CKMS operation.

FR:12.3 The CKMS design shall specify which key establishment protocols are
implemented by the system.

FR:12.4 The CKMS design shall specify the expected security lifetime of each key-
establishment protocol implemented in the system in terms of the expected security
lifetimes of the cryptographic algorithms employed.

FR:12.5 The CKMS design shall specify the extent to which external access to CKMS
devices is permitted.

FR:12.6 The CKMS design shall specify how all allowed external accesses to CKMS
devices are controlled.

FR:12.7 The CKMS design shall specify the features employed to resist or mitigate the
consequences of the development of new technologies, such as a quantum computing
attack on the CKMS cryptographic algorithms.

FR:12.8 The CKMS design shall specify the currently known consequences of a
quantum computing attack upon the CKMS cryptography.
