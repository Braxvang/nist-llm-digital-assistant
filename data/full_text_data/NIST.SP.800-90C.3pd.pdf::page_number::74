       NIST SP 800-90C 3pd (Third Public Draft)                                                      Recommendation for RBG Constructions

2087   Appendix B. RBG Examples (Informative)
2088   Appendix B.1 discusses and provides an example of the direct access to a DRBG used by an RBG3
2089   construction.
2090   Appendices B.2 â€“ B.6 provide examples of each RBG construction. Not shown in the figures: if
2091   an error that indicates an RBG failure (e.g., a noise source in the entropy source has failed) is
2092   reported, RBG operation is terminated (see Section 7.1.2). For these examples, all entropy sources
2093   are considered to be physical entropy sources.

2094   B.1.         Direct DRBG Access in an RBG3 Construction
2095   An implementation may be designed so that the DRBG implementation used within an RBG3
2096   construction can be directly accessed by a consuming application 35 using the same or separate
2097   instantiations from the instantiation used by the RBG3 construction (see the examples in Figure
2098   19).

2101   In the leftmost example in Figure 19, the same internal state is used by the RBG3 construction and
2102   a directly accessible DRBG. The DRBG implementation is instantiated only once, and only a
2103   single state handle is obtained during instantiation (e.g., RBG3_state handle). 36 Generation and

            Without using other components or functionality used by the RBG3 construction (see Sections 6.2 and 6.3).
       36
            Because only a single instantiation has been implemented, a state handle is not required.
