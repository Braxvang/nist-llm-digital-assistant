                                   (i) the PIV Card contains at least one security feature.
                                       Examples of these security features include the following:
                                       (i) Optical varying structures, (ii) Optical varying inks, (iii)
                                       Laser etching and engraving, (iv) Holograms, (v)
                                       Holographic images, (vi) Watermarks (interview,
                                       observe).
