5      PIV Card Application Administration Keys

PIV Cards may support card activation by the card management system to support card
personalization and post-issuance card update. PIV Cards that support card personalization and
post-issuance updates perform a challenge response protocol using a symmetric cryptographic
key (i.e., the PIV Card Application Administration Key) to authenticate the card management
system. After successful authentication, the card management system can modify information
stored in the PIV Card. Table 5-1, below, establishes specific requirements for cryptographic
algorithms and key sizes for PIV Card Application Administration Keys.
