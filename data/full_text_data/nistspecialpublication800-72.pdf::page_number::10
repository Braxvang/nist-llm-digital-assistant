                                                                          Guidelines on PDA Forensics



1. Introduction

1.1   Authority

       The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed this guide in
       furtherance of its statutory responsibilities under the Federal Information Security
       Management Act (FISMA) of 2002, Public Law 107-347.

       NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines, including minimum
       requirements, for providing adequate information security for all Federal agency operations
       and assets; but such standards and guidelines shall not apply to national security systems. This
       guideline is consistent with the requirements of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
       Circular A-130, Section 8b(3), “Securing Agency Information Systems,” as analyzed in A-
       130, Appendix IV: Analysis of Key Sections. Supplemental information is provided in A-130,
       Appendix III.

       This guide has been prepared for use by Federal agencies. It may be used by nongovernmental
       organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright, though attribution is desired.

       Nothing in this guide should be taken to contradict standards and guidelines made mandatory
       and binding on Federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory authority, nor
       should these guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the
       Secretary of Commerce, Director of the OMB, or any other Federal official.

1.2   Purpose and Scope

       This guide provides basic information on the preservation, examination, and analysis of digital
       evidence on PDAs, relevant to law enforcement, incident response, and other types of
       investigations. The guide focuses mainly on the characteristics of the following families of
       PDAs: Pocket PC, Palm OS, and Linux-based PDAs. It also covers provisions to be taken into
       consideration during the course of an incident investigation, including evidence handling,
       device identification, content acquisition, documentation, and reporting.

       The guide is intended to address common circumstances that may be encountered by
       organizational security staff and law enforcement investigators, involving digital electronic
       data residing on PDAs and associated electronic media. It is also intended to compliment
       existing guidelines and delve more deeply into issues related to PDAs and their examination
       and analysis.

       Procedures and techniques presented in this document are a compilation of the authors’
       opinions and references taken from existing forensic guidelines. The publication is not to be
       used as a step-by-step guide for executing a proper forensic investigation when dealing with
       new technologies such as PDAs or construed as legal advice. Its purpose is to inform readers
       of various technologies and potential ways to approach them from a forensic point of view.
       Readers are advised to apply the recommended practices only after consultation with
       management and legal officials for compliance with laws and regulations (i.e., local, state,
       federal, and international) that pertain to their situation.
