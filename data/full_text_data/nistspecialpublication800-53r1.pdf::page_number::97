FAMILY: INCIDENT RESPONSE                                                                CLASS: OPERATIONAL


IR-1      INCIDENT RESPONSE POLICY AND PROCEDURES

          Control:The organization develops, disseminates, and periodically reviews/updates: (i) a formal,
          documented, incident response policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities,
          management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and (ii)
          formal, documented procedures to facilitate the implementation of the incident response policy
          and associated incident response controls.
          Supplemental Guidance:   The incident response policy and procedures are consistent with applicable
          laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. The incident
          response policy can be included as part of the general information security policy for the
          organization. Incident response procedures can be developed for the security program in general,
          and for a particular information system, when required. NIST Special Publication 800-12
          provides guidance on security policies and procedures. NIST Special Publication 800-61 provides
          guidance on incident handling and reporting. NIST Special Publication 800-83 provides guidance
          on malware incident handling and prevention.
          Control Enhancements: None.


           LOW IR-1                      MOD IR-1                     HIGH IR-1



IR-2      INCIDENT RESPONSE TRAINING

          Control: The organization trains personnel in their incident response roles and responsibilities with
          respect to the information system and provides refresher training [Assignment: organization-
          defined frequency, at least annually].
          Supplemental Guidance: None.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization incorporates simulated events into incident response training to facilitate
                effective response by personnel in crisis situations.
          (2)   The organization employs automated mechanisms to provide a more thorough and realistic
                training environment.
