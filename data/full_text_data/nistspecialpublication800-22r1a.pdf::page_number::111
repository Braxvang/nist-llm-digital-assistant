A STATISTICAL TEST SUITE FOR RANDOM AND PSEUDORANDOM NUMBER GENERATORS FOR CRYPTOGRAPHIC APPLICATIONS



Appendix C—Extending the Test Suite


C.1            Incorporating Additional Statistical Tests

In order to add another statistical test to the test suite, the user should make the following modifications:

1.      [In the file include/defs.h]

        Insert any test input parameters into the _testParameters structure. Increment the value of
        NUMOFTESTS by the number of tests to be added. Add a define for the new test, for example:

                 #define                    TEST_MYNEWTEST                  16

2.      [In the file include/decls.h]

        Insert the new test name, e.g., “MyNewTest”, into the testNames array.

3.      [In the file include/stat_fncs.h]

        Insert the statistical test function prototype declaration.

4.      [In the file src/myNewTest.c]

        Define the statistical test function. Note: The programmer should embed fprintf statements
        using stats[TEST_MYNEWTEST], and results[TEST_MYNEWTEST] as the corresponding output
        channel for writing intermediate test statistic parameters and P-values, respectively.

5.      [In the file src/utilities.c]

        (a) In the function, chooseTests, modify the printf’s to properly display the new test name. For
            example, change

                 printf("         [15] Linear Complexity\n\n");
        to
                 printf("         [15] Linear Complexity                     [16] MyNewTest\n\n");

        and modify the following lines of code (as modified by the actual number of total tests):

                 printf("               1234567891111111\n");
                 printf("                        0123456\n");

        Note: For each PRNG defined in the experiments/ directory, a sub-directory myNewTest must
        be created.

        (c) If an input test parameter is required, in the function, fixParameters, insert the following lines
             of code (under the assumption that myNewTestParameter is an integer). For example,
             insert

                 if ( testVector[TEST_MYNEWTEST] == 1 ) {
                      counter++;
