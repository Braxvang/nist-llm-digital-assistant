NIST SP 800-124r2                                                 Guidelines for Managing the Security
May 2023                                                           of Mobile Devices in the Enterprise

nearly all information from the device’s memory using a “cryptographic erase” technique [16].
Cryptographic erase is accomplished by sanitizing the encryption key for the drive, rendering the
encrypted user data unreadable. It is essential to activate whole-device encryption before a
device is deployed and to perform a factory reset operation to cryptographically erase all user
data before disposing of a device.
There are two additional considerations for secure device disposal: assured destruction of the
drive encryption key and the destruction of user data on removable memory cards (e.g., SIM or
Secure Digital [SD] cards). If the device encryption key is backed up or escrowed outside of the
device, it is possible that the key could be used to recover user data on the device. The
organization should address the existence and location of such backups when designing device
sanitization procedures.
In addition to storing information such as photos and downloaded documents on the device’s
internal memory, many mobile devices store such information on an external SD card. Contacts,
voicemails, and text message logs may be stored on a SIM card as well as in the device’s internal
memory. A factory reset will not clear the information contained on SIM or SD cards used with
the device. To remove all information from these cards, they should be physically removed and
destroyed. A thorough device disposal process includes both a factory reset and the removal of
any associated cards.
