5.     Types of Services

An effective IT security program should encompass multiple layers of protection. An organization should
evaluate the value and criticality of its information systems and determine the security controls that are
appropriate to the level of risk. A security program, whether at the organizational or individual system
level, should include an appropriate mixture of security controls: management, operational, and
          4
technical. Reliance on technical resources alone will be insufficient without complementary
management or operational controls.

This section presents examples of management, operational, and technical services that are discussed in
this document. Table 5-1 lists these IT security services that will be discussed. Each security service is
defined and the nature of the service provision explained. Then, issues and considerations unique to
specific security services are provided.

An exhaustive list of every security service available is not provided. Security service providers may
package elements of many of these services into a unique service offering with a unique name. Advances
in technology will create new security services. In many cases, the issues and considerations provided for
the services presented in this guide may be used or modified for other security services.
