                                                                                           GUIDE TO SSL VPNS



      VPN would communicate with a file server using the appropriate protocol, such as the Common
      Internet File System (CIFS) or the File Transfer Protocol (FTP), and translate the information into a
      Web-based format so that users can view the information with a Web browser. Application
      translation requires a translator engine for each protocol that is supported.
 Network Extension. Network extension is a method of providing partial or complete network access
  to remote users. Users can connect to the network and access internal resources as if they were
  physically located on the internal local area network (LAN). This eliminates the need for creating
  Web-specific portals for all applications that require remote access. An SSL tunnel VPN network
  extension provides a secure connection from the user’s system to an organization’s network. This
  host-to-gateway tunnel can handle arbitrary traffic, much like a host-to-gateway IPsec VPN can. SSL
  tunnel VPN devices can support full or split tunneling. Full tunneling causes all network traffic to go
  through the tunnel to the organization. Split tunneling routes organization-specific traffic through the
  SSL VPN tunnel, but other traffic uses the remote user’s default gateway. Network extension
  requires a client to be installed either as a plug-in in the user’s Web browser or as a program on the
  user’s system, which in turn requires administrative access to the local system. The client is typically
  an active content agent, so the system must have the ability to load the agent and the necessary
  privileges to run it. This can cause challenges on public systems, where users might not have those
  privileges, and on managed systems where security policy prevents such applets and controls. A
  more limited form of network extension is sometimes called port forwarding.
The three core functions allow SSL VPNs to provide secure remote access to a variety of applications.
SSL VPN products vary in quality and effectiveness by the way they implement these three core
functions. For example, SSL VPN products may offer support for different protocols via proxy and
application translation; others might offer more or less control of the level of network access for network
extensions. When evaluating SSL VPN products, it is important to have identified the remote access
needs and applications served.

3.3     SSL VPN Features and Security Services

In addition to the three core functions, SSL VPNs include other features and security services. These
elements often vary in breadth, depth, and completeness, so side-by-side comparisons of SSL VPN
products often result in more differences than similarities. Therefore, it is important to identify and define
requirements, and evaluate several products. Common SSL VPN features include the following:

 Manageability. Manageability includes device management, status reporting, logging, and auditing.
 High availability. High availability is a failover feature to ensure availability during device or
  component interruptions.
 Scalability. Scalability is the ability to support more users, concurrent sessions, and throughput than
  a single SSL VPN device can typically handle. Scalability is often integrated with high availability
  by balancing the VPN load amongst multiple SSL VPN devices.
 Customization. Customization is the ability to control the appearance of the SSL VPN Web pages
  that the users see when they first access the VPN. Besides layout and color preferences, customized
  portals are often necessary to support PDAs and smart phones over the SSL VPN.
Common SSL VPN security services include the following:

 Authentication. Authentication is the process a VPN uses to limit access to protected services by
  forcing users to identify themselves. This feature includes the ability to support strong authentication
  and to integrate with current authentication mechanisms.
