Large or complex information systems composed of multiple lower level systems often require
additional consideration regarding assignment of system security categorization. This section
will provide guidelines for applying and interrelating individual system security categorization
results to enterprise organizations, large supporting infrastructures (such as general support
systems, data warehouse applications, large data storage units, server farms, and information
repositories), and interconnecting systems.
Upon security categorization identification for all information systems interacting with large
infrastructure systems, senior IT and security officials have possession of valuable information
that can now enable an enterprise wide security perspective. One significant activity includes
levying an overall security categorization for the agency’s supporting network infrastructures.
Since networks, as well as other general support systems, do not inherently “own” mission-based
or management and support information types, the infrastructure’s categorization is based on the
aggregation of the information systems’ security categorizations. In other words, the
infrastructure’s security categorization is the high water mark of the supported information
systems and is based on the information types processed, flowed, or stored on the network or
general support system. Together, the top down enterprise wide threat assessment and bottom up
security assessment derived by aggregation will allow an organization to look at its risk profile
from a comprehensive and balanced view. Further, this analysis will ensure the proper
application of common security controls supporting the multiple information systems and the
protection provided by those controls are inherited by the individual systems.

Critical Infrastructures and Key Resources

Where the mission served by an information system, or the information that the system
processes, affects the security of critical infrastructures and key resources, the harm that results
from a compromise requires particularly close attention. In this case, an effect on security might
include a significant reduction in the effectiveness of physical or cyber security protection
mechanisms, or facilitation of a terrorist attack on critical infrastructures and key resources.
Accordingly, the system security categorization should be carefully determined when a loss of
confidentiality, integrity, or availability will result in a negative impact on the critical
infrastructures and key resources.
The Critical Information Infrastructure Act of 2002, Public Law 107-296 §§ 211-215 of
November 25, 2002 (codified as 6 U.S.C. 131-134), defines the term "critical infrastructure
information" to mean information not customarily in the public domain and related to the
security of critical infrastructure or protected systems. Should information types be aligned with
Critical Infrastructures, then action should be taken to ensure compliance with Homeland
Security Presidential Directive No. 7 (HSPD 7) and to initiate an interdependency analysis.

Privacy Information

The E-Government Act of 2002 complements privacy protection requirements of the Privacy Act
of 1974. Under the terms of these public laws, Federal government agencies have specific
