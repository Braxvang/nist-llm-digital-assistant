cryptographic suite is rolled alternates each month. Extending the active key life time to two months
from one (more traditional) is considered a larger security risk, since the key is in use longer (and
therefore subject to a longer window of attack), but the risk is still not severe enough for the majority of
zones.

KSK rollovers can be handled the same way, but since KSK's are rolled over less frequently this is not a
big contributor compared to ZSK rollover schedules.

Also note that this process assumes that the zoneâ€™s KSK is not being used as a trust anchor, and that there
is a signed parent for the zone. If that is not case then the zone administrator must follow a variation of
the steps in RFC 5011 Section 6.3 [RFC 5011] when finishing the rollover of the KSK. This would
involve setting the revoke bit on the algorithm A KSK then waiting the hold-down time before removing
it

11.6 Special Consideration When Transitioning from NSEC Signed Zones to NSEC3
     Signed Zones

For whatever policy decision, an organization using a DNSSEC signed zone may wish to transition their
zone from using NSEC for authenticated denial of existence to using NSEC3 RRs. Due to the nature of
caching in the DNS and DNSSEC, this cannot be done in an atomic fashion; i.e., the NSEC chain
replaced by an NSEC3 chain in a single operation. This transition is done by moving the DNSKEY
RRset from the algorithm code (see Section 9.3) associated with RSA/SHA-1 (code 5) to a special
NSEC3 signaling code for RSA/SHA-1 (code 7).

Transitioning is similar to rolling over to a new algorithm since (sometimes) the algorithm code changes
as well. The only real difference is at the end when an NSEC3 chain in the signed zone replaces the
NSEC chain.
