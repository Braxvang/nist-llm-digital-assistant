NIST SP 800-82r3                                             Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

                       Asset location technologies can be used to track the movements
                       of people and vehicles to ensure that they stay in authorized
                       areas, to identify personnel who may need assistance, and to
                       support emergency response.
            The following are additional physical security considerations:
                   •   Portable devices. Organizations should apply a verification
                       process that includes, at a minimum, scanning devices (e.g.,
                       laptops, USB storage, etc.) for malicious code prior to allowing
                       the device to connect to OT devices or networks.
                   •   Cabling. While unshielded twisted pair communications cables
                       may be acceptable in an office environment, they may not be
                       suitable for some OT environments due to their susceptibility to
                       interference from magnetic fields, radio waves, temperature
                       extremes, moisture, dust, and vibration. Organizations should
                       consider using alternative cabling or shielding that provides
                       suitable protection against environmental threats. Additionally,
                       organizations should consider color-coded cables, connectors,
                       conduits, and labeling to clearly delineate OT and IT network
                       segments and reduce the risk of potential cross-connections.
                   •   Control centers and control rooms. Providing physical security
                       for control centers and control rooms can reduce the potential of
                       many threats, including unauthorized access. Access to these
                       areas should be limited to authorized personnel due to the
                       increased probability of finding sensitive servers, network
                       components, control systems, and consoles that support
                       continuous monitoring and rapid response. Gaining physical
                       access to a control room or OT system components often implies
                       gaining logical access to the system or system components. In
                       extreme cases, organizations may need to consider designing
                       control centers to be blast-proof or provide an off-site emergency
                       control center so that control can be maintained if the primary
                       control center becomes uninhabitable.
