          difficulties, particularly in key management. Here, access control mechanisms
          and policy enforcement may help.

          A mechanism to allow VOIP traffic through firewalls is required. There are a
          variety of protocol dependent and independent solutions, including application
          level gateways (ALGs) for VOIP protocols, Session Border Controllers, or
          other standards-based solutions when they mature.

          Stateful packet filters can track the state of connections, denying packets that
          are not part of a properly originated call. (This may not be practical when
          multimedia protocol inherent security or lower layer security is applied, e.g.,
          H.235 Annex D for integrity provision or TLS to protect SIP signaling.)

          Use IPsec or Secure Shell (SSH) for all remote management and auditing
          access. If practical, avoid using remote management at all and do IP PBX
          access from a physically secure system.

      â€¢   If performance is a problem, use encryption at the router or other gateway, not
          the individual endpoints, to provide for IPsec tunneling. Since some VOIP
          endpoints are not computationally powerful enough to perform encryption,
          placing this burden at a central point ensures all VOIP traffic emanating from
          the enterprise network has been encrypted. Newer IP phones are able to
          provide Advanced Encryption System (AES) encryption at reasonable cost.
          Note that Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2, Security
          Requirements for Cryptographic Modules, is applicable to all Federal agencies
          that use cryptographic-based security systems to protect sensitive information
          in computer and telecommunication systems (including voice systems) as
          defined in Section 5131 of the Information Technology Management Reform
          Act of 1996, Public Law 104-106.

2. Ensure that the organization has examined and can acceptably manage
and mitigate the risks to their information, system operations, and
continuity of essential operations when deploying VOIP systems.

      An especially challenging security environment is created when new technologies
      are deployed. Risks often are not fully understood, administrators are not yet
      experienced with the new technology, and security controls and policies must be
      updated. Therefore, agencies should carefully consider such issues as their level
      of knowledge and training in the technology, the maturity and quality of their
      security practices, controls, policies, and architectures, and their understanding of
      the associated security risks. These issues should be considered for all systems
      but are especially important with VOIP deployment for essential operations, such
      as systems designated "high" under FIPS 199, Standards for Security
      Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems [2].

      VOIP can provide more flexible service at lower cost, but there are significant
      tradeoffs that must be considered. VOIP systems can be expected to be more
