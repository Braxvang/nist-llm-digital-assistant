      NIST SP 800-63-4 ipd                                                Digital Identity Guidelines
      December 2022


854      4. There is a desire to allow primary authenticators to be added and upgraded over
855         time without changing the RP’s implementation.
856      5. There are different environments to be supported, as federation protocols are
857         network-based and allow for implementation on a wide variety of platforms and
858         languages.
859      6. Potential users come from multiple communities, each with its own existing identity
860         infrastructure.
861      7. The ability to centrally manage account lifecycles, including account revocation and
862         binding of new authenticators is important.
863   An organization should consider accepting federated identity attributes if any of the
864   following apply:
865      1. Pseudonymity is required, necessary, feasible, or important to stakeholders
866         accessing the service.
867      2. Access to the service requires a partial attribute list.
868      3. Access to the service requires at least one derived attribute value.
869      4. The organization is not the authoritative source or issuing source for required
870         attributes.
871      5. Attributes are only required temporarily during use (such as to make an access
872         decision), and the organization does not need to retain the data.

873   4.4.1. Federation Beneﬁts
874   Federated architectures have many significant benefits, including, but not limited to:
875       • Enhanced user experience: For example, an individual can be identity proofed once
876         and reuse the subscriber account at multiple RPs.
877       • Cost reduction to both the user (reduction in authenticators) and the organization
878         (reduction in information technology infrastructure).
879       • Minimizing data in applications as organizations do not need to collect, store, or
880         dispose of personal information.
881       • Minimizing data exposed to applications, using pseudonymous identifiers and
882         derived attribute values instead of copying account values to each application.
883       • Mission enablement: Organizations can focus on their mission without worrying
884         about expending resources on identity management.
885   The following sections discuss the components of a federated identity architecture should
886   an organization elect this type of model.
