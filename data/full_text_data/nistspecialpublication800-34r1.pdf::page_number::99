APPENDIX F ALTERNATE STORAGE, SITE AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS

This appendix provides information for alternate storage, alternate processing site, and alternate
telecommunications for the system. Alternate Storage, Site, and Telecommunications information is
required for moderate-impact systems, per NIST SP 800-53, Rev.3. Refer to NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 3, for
details on control specifics. Information that should be provided for each area includes:

Alternate Storage:
       City and state of alternate storage facility, and distance from primary facility;
       Whether the alternate storage facility is owned by the organization or is a third-party storage
        provider;
       Name and points of contact for the alternate storage facility;
       Delivery schedule and procedures for packaging media to go to alternate storage facility;
       Procedures for retrieving media from the alternate storage facility;
       Names and contact information for those persons authorized to retrieve media;
       Any potential accessibility problems to the alternate storage site in the event of a widespread
        disruption or disaster;
       Mitigation steps to access alternate storage site in the event of a widespread disruption or
        disaster;
       Types of data located at alternate storage site, including databases, application software,
        operating systems, and other critical information system software; and
       Other information as appropriate.

Alternate Processing Site:
       City and state of alternate processing site, and distance from primary facility;
       Whether the alternate processing site is owned by the organization or is a third-party site
        provider;
       Name and points of contact for the alternate processing site;
       Procedures for accessing and using the alternate processing site, and access security features of
        alternate processing site;
       Names and contact information for those persons authorized to go to alternate processing site;
       Type of alternate processing site, and equipment available at site;
       Any potential accessibility problems at the alternate processing site in the event of a widespread
        disruption or disaster;
       Mitigation steps to access alternate processing site in the event of a widespread disruption or
        disaster;
