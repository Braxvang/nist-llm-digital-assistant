behavior of mobile code [Vib01]. In addition to mobile code, this class of product may also be applicable
to stationary code or downloaded code whose trustworthiness is in doubt.

5.2.3   Signatures

A digital signature is an unforgeable code computed over a document or other information that uniquely
identifies the signer who computed it. When applied properly, a digital signature serves as a means of
confirming the authenticity of an object, its origin, and its integrity. Because of these characteristics,
digital signatures are involved in most authentication schemes. For example, the Secure Sockets Layer
(SSL) protocol, built into most browsers and Web servers, relies on digital signatures for authenticating
the parties involved in a transaction. When applied to mobile code, the code signer is typically the
individual or organization that created the code. Figure 5-3 illustrates the general scheme.




                           Figure 5-3. Verifying Active Content Digital Signatures

Digital signatures involve public key cryptography, which relies on a pair of keys associated with an
entity. One key is kept private by the signing entity and the other is made publicly available. Passing
mobile code through a non-reversible hash function provides a fingerprint or message digest of the code.
Applying a digital signature function to the message digest using the private key of the signer forms a
digital signature. A recipient uses the signer’s public key to verify the signature conveyed with the code.
The digital signature is in effect an integrity mechanism, since changes to the code would invalidate the
signature and thus be detectable by the recipient. Digital signatures benefit greatly from the availability
of a PKI, since certificates containing the identity of an entity and its public key (i.e., a public key
certificate) can be readily located and verified. This allows the code, signature, and public key certificate
to be forwarded to a recipient, who can easily verify the source and authenticity of the code.

When appropriate, digital signatures should be considered for use in applications involving active content,
not only to verify the identities of the various parties involved, but also to confirm the integrity of any
mobile code and the acceptability of the code’s author. For example, Java can use digital signatures for
determining the protection domain of downloaded code. Note that the meaning of a signature may be
different depending on the policy associated with the signature scheme and the party who signs. For
example, the author of some code, either an individual or organization, may use a digital signature to
indicate who produced the code, but not to guarantee that the agent performs without fault or error.
