is established. Zero trust is a response to enterprise network trends that include remote
users and cloud-based assets that are not located within an enterprise-owned network
boundary. Zero trust focuses on protecting resources rather than network segments,
as the network location is no longer considered the prime component to the security
posture of the resource. NIST has published Draft SP 800-207, Zero Trust Architecture,
which discusses the core logical components that make up a zero trust architecture
(ZTA) network strategy [27]. Draft SP 800-207 contains a definition of zero trust
architecture (ZTA) and gives general deployment models and use cases where zero trust
could improve an enterpriseâ€™s overall information technology security posture.


Improving Security Hygiene
There are a relatively small number of root causes for many data breaches, malware
infections, and other security incidents. Implementing a few simple practices can
address those root causes to prevent many incidents from occurring and to lower the
potential impact of incidents that still occur. In other words, security hygiene practices
make it harder for attackers to succeed and reduces the damage that they can cause.
Unfortunately, security hygiene is easier said than done. For example, IT professionals
have known for decades that patching software (e.g., operating systems, applications, and
the like) eliminates known vulnerabilities. Though there is widespread recognition that
patching can be incredibly effective at mitigating security risk, patching is often resource-
intensive, and the act of patching itself can reduce system and service availability.
Installing software updates (i.e., patching) is a particularly important component of cyber
hygiene, but existing tools are insufficient for many environments and situations. For
example, many organizations lack tools to help them measure and assess the effectiveness
and timeliness of their patching efforts. Many organizations also struggle to prioritize
patching efforts, test patches before deployment, and adhere to policies for how quickly
patches need to be applied in different situations. How, when, and what to patch can be
difficult decisions for any organization. Each organization must balance security with
mission impact and business objectives and figure out their risk tolerance for each. Recent
cybersecurity attacks have highlighted the dangers of having equipment that has not been
patched. Even with recent events and the historical attacks that have been successfully
carried out due to unpatched systems, patching remains a problem.
The NCCoE launched a project to demonstrate an approach for improving enterprise
patching practices for general IT systems. In this project, commercial and open-source
tools will be used to address the most challenging aspects of patching, including
system characterization and prioritization, patch testing, and patch implementation
tracking and verification. These tools are accompanied by actionable, prescriptive
guidance on establishing policies and processes for the entire patching life cycle. For
example, roles and responsibilities are defined for all affected personnel, and a playbook
is established with rapid mitigation actions for destructive malware outbreaks that
organizations can tactically execute in the first 30 days as well as recommendations
that can be implemented strategically beyond 30 days. This project has resulted in              31
