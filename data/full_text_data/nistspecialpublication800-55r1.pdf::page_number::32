framework to measure the performance of major IT investments and their contribution to
program performance.

Organizations should consider tying information security measures development and
implementation into FEA efforts to reduce duplication of data collection and facilitate integration
of information security into their enterprise architectures.

4.3 Linkage Between Enterprise Strategic Planning and Information Security

Federal agencies develop their long-term strategic goals as part of their strategic planning
process—a requirement of GPRA. Five to six strategic goals are usually established, each with
several performance objectives that describe how the goal will be accomplished. As a part of
this process, agencies develop performance measures to quantify the accomplishment of their
goals and objectives with quarterly and annual targets for each performance measure.

Information security performance measures provide a means to monitor and report on an
agency’s implementation of its information security program and associated performance
measures as mandated by FISMA. These measures can also help assess the effectiveness of
security controls in protecting agency information resources in support of the agency’s mission.

Ultimately, all efforts must support the agency’s overall goals and objectives, which are defined
and reassessed annually during its strategic planning activities. Information security must be
explicitly tied to at least one goal or objective in the strategic planning process to demonstrate its
importance in accomplishing the agency’s mission. This connection can be established by
identifying goals and objectives that would articulate agency information security requirements
within the context of the overall agency mission. Progress toward accomplishing these goals and
objectives may be monitored by implementing appropriate information security performance
measures.

Information security performance measures can be developed and used at multiple levels within
an organization—including the overall agency information security program, operating bureau
information security programs, or individual agency programs. They can also be scoped to
different types of efforts, as discussed in Section 3.6. Measures developed at different levels of
an organization should be used for internal management and process improvement purposes.
They may also be aggregated to agency-level information security program performance
measures. Agency-level measures will either be reported to the organization’s upper
management or used for external reporting—such as GPRA and FISMA.
