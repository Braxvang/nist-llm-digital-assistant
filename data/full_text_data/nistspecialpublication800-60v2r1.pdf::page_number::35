Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
program evaluation information is low.
C.2.1.3 Program Monitoring Information Type

Program Monitoring involves the data-gathering activities required to determine the
effectiveness of internal and external programs and the extent to which they comply with related
laws, regulations, and policies. The impact levels should be commensurate with the impact levels
of the programs that are being monitored. For example, if a program contains very sensitive
financial data with moderate impact levels for confidentiality and integrity, the program
monitoring impact levels for confidentiality and integrity should also be moderate. Subject to
exception conditions described below, the recommended security categorization for the program
monitoring information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of program monitoring
information on the ability of responsible agencies to perform data-gathering activities required to
determine the effectiveness of internal and external programs and the extent to which they
comply with related laws, regulations, and policies.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: There are legislative mandates
prohibiting unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets. Trade secrets will generally be assigned a
moderate confidentiality impact level. Note that national security information and national
security systems are outside the scope of this guideline. Otherwise, where the data being
collected belongs to one of the information types described in this guideline, the confidentiality
impact assigned the data and system is that of the highest impact information type collected.
Unauthorized disclosure of program monitoring information can alert personnel associated with
programs being monitored to the focus and implications of monitoring activities. Where a major
programs or human safety is at stake, actions taken based on unauthorized disclosure of program
monitoring information can pose a threat to human life or a loss of major assets. In such cases,
the confidentiality impact is high. If the program monitoring information is moved to the public
domain, the confidentiality impact level becomes Not Applicable (NA).

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: Although there are many circumstances in which
serious adverse effects on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals can result to justify a
moderate base confidentiality impact level for program monitoring information, in most Federal
environments, unauthorized disclosure will have only a limited adverse effect on agency
operations, assets, or individuals. Consequently, for most systems, a low provisional
confidentiality impact level is recommended for program monitoring information.
Integrity
The consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of program monitoring
information can compromise the effectiveness of the monitoring program. Although there may
be time-sensitive program monitoring situations, the integrity impact level is based on the
specific mission and the data supporting that mission, not on the time required to detect the
modification or destruction of information. The damage likely to be caused by unauthorized
