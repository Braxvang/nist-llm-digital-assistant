                                                                                               an activity that is directed toward the achievement of              • Begin with the activity

                                                                                               technology objectives, or mission objectives. Task statements       • Do not contain the task
                                                                                               should be straightforward. While the work encompassed within a        objective
                                                                                               Task statement may have many steps, as with the example
                                                                                               below, the statement itself is easy to read and understand.

                                                                                               A Task statement begins with the activity being executed.
                                                                                                      Example: Troubleshoot system hardware and software.

                                                                                               A Task statement does not contain the objective within the statement, as objective may vary

                                                                                                      Example: Conduct interactive training exercises.

                                                                                               In the above example, the purpose of these exercises may be to create an effective learning

                                                                                               As Figure 1 shows, Tasks are related to K&S statements. A learner will demonstrate that they
