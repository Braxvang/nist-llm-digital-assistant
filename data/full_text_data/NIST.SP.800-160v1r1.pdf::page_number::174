NIST SP 800-160v1r1                                                Engineering Trustworthy Secure Systems
November 2022

       -   Criteria for the secure management of changes to items under configuration management,
           including dispositions, access, release, and control
       -   Security considerations, criteria, and constraints for the locations, conditions, and
           environment of storage
       -   Criteria or events for commencing secure configuration control and securely maintaining the
           baselines of evolving configurations
       -   Security aspects of the audit strategy and the responsibilities for assessing the continual
           integrity and security of the configuration definition information
       -   Criteria and constraints for secure change management, planned configuration control
           boards and security configuration control boards, regulatory and emergency change
           requests, and procedures for secure change management
       -   Secure coordination among stakeholders, acquirers, suppliers, supply chain, and other
           interacting organizations
       CM-1.2 Define the secure archive and retrieval approach for configuration items, configuration
              management artifacts, and data.
       Note: This includes rules that govern secure retention, access, and use.

CM-2   PERFORM CONFIGURATION IDENTIFICATION
       CM-2.1 Identify the security aspects of system elements and artifacts that need to be under
              configuration management.
       CM-2.2 Identify the security aspects of the configuration data to be managed.
       CM-2.3 Establish the security aspects of identifiers for items under configuration
              management.
       CM-2.4 Define the security aspects of baselines throughout the life cycle.
       CM-2.5 Obtain applicable stakeholder agreement on the security aspects to establish a
              baseline.
       CM-2.6 Approve and track the security aspects of system or system element releases.
       Note 1: The security aspects of a release are security-relevant considerations of authorization of
       the use of a system or system element for a specific purpose with or without security-relevant
       restrictions. Examples are releases for tests or operational use.
       Note 2: Releases generally include a set of changes made through the Technical Processes.
       Release approval generally includes acceptance of the verified and validated changes and any
       impacts to security of the changes.

CM-3   PERFORM CONFIGURATION CHANGE MANAGEMENT
       CM-3.1 Identify and record the security aspects of requests for change and requests for
              variance.
       Note 1: This includes requests for deviation, waiver, or concession.
