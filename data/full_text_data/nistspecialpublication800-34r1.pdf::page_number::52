Notifications also should be sent to POCs of external organizations or interconnected system partners that
may be adversely affected if they are unaware of the situation. Depending on the type of outage or
disruption, the POC may have recovery responsibilities. For each system interconnection with an external
organization, a POC should be identified. These POCs should be listed in an appendix to the plan.

The type of information to be relayed to those being notified should be documented in the plan. The
amount and detail of information relayed may depend on the specific team being notified. As necessary,
notification information may include the following:

       Nature of the outage or disruption that has occurred or is impending;
       Any known outage estimates;
       Response and recovery details;
       Where and when to convene for briefing or further response instructions;
       Instructions to prepare for relocation for estimated time period (if applicable); and
       Instructions to complete notifications using the call tree (if applicable).

4.2.3   Outage Assessment

To determine how the ISCP will be implemented following a system disruption or outage, it is essential to
assess the nature and extent of the disruption. The outage assessment should be completed as quickly as
the given conditions permit, with personnel safety remaining the highest priority. When possible, the
Outage Assessment Team is the first team notified of the disruption. Outage assessment procedures may
be unique for the particular system, but the following minimum areas should be addressed:

       Cause of the outage or disruption;
       Potential for additional disruptions or damage;
       Status of physical infrastructure (e.g., structural integrity of computer room, condition of electric
        power, telecommunications, and heating, ventilation and air-conditioning [HVAC]);
       Inventory and functional status of system equipment (e.g., fully functional, partially functional,
        nonfunctional);
       Type of damage to system equipment or data (e.g., water, fire and heat, physical impact, electrical
        surge);
       Items to be replaced (e.g., hardware, software, firmware, supporting materials); and
       Estimated time to restore normal services.
