                                         GUIDE TO INTEGRATING FORENSIC TECHNIQUES INTO INCIDENT RESPONSE



    responsibilities in forensics, receive training and education on forensic–related policies,
    guidelines, and procedures, and be prepared to cooperate with and assist others on forensic
    actions.
! Forensic considerations should be clearly addressed in policies. At a high level, policies
  should allow authorized personnel to monitor systems and networks and perform investigations
  for legitimate reasons under appropriate circumstances. Organizations may also have a separate
  forensic policy for incident handlers and others with forensic roles that provides more detailed
  rules for appropriate behavior. Everyone who may be called upon to assist with any forensic
  efforts should be familiar with and understand the forensic policy. Additional policy
  considerations are as follows:

    –   Forensic policy should clearly define the roles and responsibilities of all people performing or
        assisting with the organization’s forensic activities. The policy should include all internal
        and external parties that may be involved and should clearly indicate who should contact
        which parties under different circumstances.

    –   The organization’s policies, guidelines, and procedures should clearly explain what forensic
        actions should and should not be performed under normal and special circumstances and
        should address the use of anti-forensic tools and techniques. Policies, guidelines, and
        procedures should also address the handling of inadvertent exposures of sensitive
        information.

    –   Incorporating forensic considerations into the information system life cycle can lead to more
        efficient and effective handling of many incidents. Examples include performing auditing on
        hosts and establishing data retention policies that support performing historical reviews of
        system and network activity.
! Organizations should create and maintain guidelines and procedures for performing
  forensic tasks. The guidelines should include general methodologies for investigating an
  incident using forensic techniques, and step-by-step procedures should explain how to perform
  routine tasks. The guidelines and procedures should support the admissibility of evidence into
  legal proceedings. Because electronic logs and other records can be altered or otherwise
  manipulated, organizations should be prepared, through their policies, guidelines, and procedures,
  to demonstrate the reliability and integrity of such records. The guidelines and procedures should
  also be reviewed regularly and maintained so that they are accurate.
