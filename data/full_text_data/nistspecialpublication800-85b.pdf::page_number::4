Special Publication 800-85B                              PIV Data Model Testing Specification




                                     Executive Summary


Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12) called for a new standard to be adopted
governing the use of common identity credentials for physical and logical access to Federal
government locations and systems. The Personal Identity Verification (PIV) standard for Federal
Employees and Contractors, Federal Information Processing Standard 201 (FIPS201), was developed to
establish government-wide identity credentials. Credentials are issued to individuals whose true
identity has been verified and whose need for the credential has been established and authorized by
proper authorities.

FIPS201 describes a variety of data model components as a part of the PIV logical credentials. Such
components include biometric elements in the form of fingerprint information and facial imagery and
security elements such as electronic keys, certificates, and signatures. FIPS201 incorporates by
reference NIST Special Publication 800-73 (SP80073), which specifies elements related to the PIV
card interface, NIST Special Publication 800-76 (SP80076), which specifies the biometric
requirements, and NIST Special Publication 800-78 (SP80078) which specifies acceptable cryptographic
algorithms and key sizes for PIV systems.

A robust testing framework and guidance to provide assurance that a particular component or system is
compliant with FIPS201 and supporting standards should exist to build the necessary PIV infrastructure
to support common unified processes and systems for government-wide use. NIST developed test
guidance in two parts. The first part addresses test requirements for interface to the PIV card and are
provided in SP80085A. The second part provides test requirements for the PIV data model and is
provided in this document. This document specifies the derived test requirements, and the detailed test
assertions and conformance tests for testing the PIV data model.
