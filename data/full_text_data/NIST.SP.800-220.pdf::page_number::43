           BACKGROUND INFORMATION OF ANNUAL REPORT
 This Annual Report provides the opportunity to describe the many cybersecurity program
 highlights and accomplishments from throughout the NIST Information Technology
 Laboratory (ITL). The report is organized into several focus areas that highlight key
 research topics and highlights. ITL, an operating unit under NIST, contains seven divisions.
 Cybersecurity work is conducted by each division, and it is the sole focus for the Applied
 Cybersecurity and Computer Security Divisions. Throughout this Annual Report, there
 are references to particular division activities, and often to work by groups within those
 divisions.
 Please note: This Annual Report covers the Federal Government’s Fiscal Year (FY) 2021,
 from October 1, 2020 to September 30, 2021.

                                         ABSTRACT
 During Fiscal Year 2021 (FY 2021) – from October 1, 2020, through September 30, 2021
 – the NIST Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) Cybersecurity and Privacy Program
 successfully responded to numerous challenges and opportunities in security and privacy. This
 annual report highlights the FY 2021 research agenda and activities for the ITL Cybersecurity
 and Privacy Program, including the ongoing participation and development of international
 standards; the enhancement of privacy and security risk management models, including
 those for the protection of controlled unclassified information (CUI), systems engineering
 and cyber resiliency, supply chains, and mobile technologies; the continued advancement of
 cryptographic technologies, including updates to Federal Information Processing Standard
 (FIPS) Publication 140-3, Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules, and preparation
 for post-quantum cryptographic methods; and improved infrastructure protection in areas
 such as zero trust architectures and advanced networking security. NIST maintained a strong
 focus on supporting small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), including updates to the
 Small Business Cybersecurity Corner website to make resources easier to find and use and
 drawing on contributed cybersecurity resources and feedback received from federal partners
 and the public.

              REPORTS ON COMPUTER SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY
 The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at NIST promotes the U.S. economy
 and public welfare by providing technical leadership for the Nation’s measurement and
 standards infrastructure. ITL develops tests, test methods, reference data, proof of concept
 implementations, and technical analyses to advance the development and productive use
 of information technology. ITL’s responsibilities include the development of management,
 administrative, technical, and physical standards and guidelines for the cost-effective security
 and privacy of other than national security-related information in federal information systems.
 The Special Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research, guidelines, and outreach efforts
 in information system security, and its collaborative activities with industry, government, and
 academic organizations.                                                                            40
