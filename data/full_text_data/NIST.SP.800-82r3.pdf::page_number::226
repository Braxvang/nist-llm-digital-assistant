passive scanning can identify significant amounts of information about devices, potentially
including manufacturers, part numbers, and firmware versions. Passive scanning cannot identify
devices that are not actively communicating, nor can it inspect encrypted traffic (without special
provisioning). Additionally, a passive scan will often take days to complete due to its
dependence on existing network traffic.

E.2.3. Active Scanning
Active network scans are a form of network discovery that directly probe the network for
attached devices. Systems that employ active scanning introduce traffic to the network and will
directly interact with the devices within the scanâ€™s scope. OT network owners should exercise
extreme caution when permitting active scanning on an operational network due to device
sensitivity on the target network. Active scans may cause device instability or interfere with the
device process state, potentially impacting safety and integrity. Active scans should be scheduled
to occur during planned OT outages whenever possible.

Some OT-specific scanning devices combine passive and active scanning to enable a safer
version of active scanning. Safe active scanning first learns about connected equipment through
passive means and then uses device-specific communication to actively gain additional
information about connected equipment without risk to OT operations.

E.2.4. Malware Detection
Endpoint malware detection can be bolstered with antivirus software. Antivirus software
monitors activity on the host device and alerts the user to possible malicious activities. Older
detection techniques rely on file signatures to detect known threats. Over time, malware
developers have found ways to bypass this mechanism, such as with polymorphic code. Modern
antivirus software uses behavioral analysis of running processes and advanced file analysis to
detect potentially malicious activity.
Host-based malware detection with antivirus software may not be advisable for some OT
endpoints due to OS incompatibility, software incompatibility, or runtime requirements.
However, network-based malware detection can still be utilized. Unlike host-based antivirus
software, network-based malware detection runs on an independent system that aggregates and
inspects network traffic for anomalies. Network-based malware detection offers similar
capabilities to host-based detection without the computational overhead being placed on the
defended component. Network-based detection is a primary component of SIEM packages.

E.2.5. Behavioral Anomaly Detection
Behavioral anomaly detection (BAD) systems compare the current state of an environment with
a baseline to detect abnormal activity for further investigation. This could be unusual network
traffic, such as large amounts of data being transferred, new ports or protocols, or new
connections between devices. Unusual activity on an endpoint may include excessive processor
usage, logins outside of work hours, or new processes. The detectable events are dependent on
the sensor capabilities of the specific implementation. Some BAD systems utilize AI and ML
algorithms to automatically update the baseline model. By automating this process, the BAD
