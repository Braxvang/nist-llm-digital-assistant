•   Checklist item 41: Administrators should configure two or more recursive resolvers for each stub
    resolver on the network.

•   Checklist item 42: Enterprise firewalls should consider restricting outbound DNS traffic from
    stub resolvers to only the enterprise’s designated recursive resolvers.

•   Checklist item 43 : Each recursive server must have a root hints file containing the IP address of
    one or more DNS root servers. The information in the root hints file should be periodically
    checked for correctness.

•   Checklist item 44 : The root hints file should be owned by the account under which the name
    server software is run. The permission bits should be set so that the root hints file can be read or
    modified only by the account that runs the name server software.

•   Checklist item 45: Administrators should configure two or more recursive resolvers for each stub
    resolver on the network.

•   Checklist item 46: Enterprise firewalls should consider restricting outbound DNS traffic from
    stub resolvers to only the enterprise’s designated recursive resolvers.
