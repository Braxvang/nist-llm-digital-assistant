APPENDIX F

VULNERABILITIES AND PREDISPOSING CONDITIONS
RISK FACTORS AFFECTING THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESSFUL THREAT EXPLOITATION




T      his appendix provides: (i) a description of potentially useful inputs to the vulnerability and
       predisposing condition identification task; (ii) an exemplary taxonomy of predisposing
       conditions; (iii) exemplary assessment scales for assessing the severity of vulnerabilities
and the pervasiveness of predisposing conditions; and (iv) a set of templates for summarizing and
documenting the results of the vulnerability and predisposing condition identification task. The
taxonomy and assessment scales in this appendix can be used by organizations as a starting point
with appropriate tailoring to adjust for any organization-specific conditions. Tables F-3 and F-6,
outputs from Task 2-3, provide relevant inputs to the risk tables in Appendix I.
