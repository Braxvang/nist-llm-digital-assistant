          backup hardware or media and that the data is readily available to be downloaded for recovery in
          a contingency situation.

Servers normally have much larger amounts of data that need to be maintained and secured. It is
recommended in environments with multiple servers, that storage not be dedicated to each server but
rather centralized for use by multiple servers. SAN and NAS are common multi-server storage systems.
Centralizing the data of multiple servers allows for a common backup of data for offsite storage. Given
the large amount of data that must be backed up, it is recommended that a separate and dedicated network
be used just for the data transfers required for backing up data. This will enable the primary network to
be dedicated to production traffic, and not impact the backup process.

Contingency solutions may be built into the client/server system during design and implementation. A
client/server system, for example, may be constructed so that all data resides in one location (such as the
organization’s headquarters) and is replicated to the local sites. Changes at local sites could be replicated
back to headquarters. If data is replicated to the local sites as read-only, the data in the client/server
system is backed up at each local site. This means that if the headquarters server were to fail, data could
still be accessed at the local sites over the WAN. Conversely, if data were uploaded hourly from local
sites to the headquarters’ site, then the headquarters’ server would act as a backup for the local servers.

As the example above illustrates, the client/server system typically provides some inherent level of
redundancy that can be incorporated in the contingency strategy. For example, consider a critical system
that is distributed between an organization’s headquarters and a small office. Assuming data is replicated
at both sites, a cost-effective recovery strategy may be to establish a reciprocal agreement between the
two sites. Under this agreement, in the event of a disruption at one office, essential personnel would
relocate to the other office to continue to process system functions. This strategy could save significant
contingency costs by avoiding the need to procure and equip alternate sites.

If considering the use of remote sites for system backups, or the use of Internet or other means of backup,
the ISCP Coordinator should ensure that the remotely hosted storage services can provide the same level
of protection of data as the original site. This can be done through SLAs and periodic reviews and
assessments of the remote storage facility and processes.

5.3       Telecommunications Systems

There are two primary classes of telecommunications systems: LANs and WANs. Wireless connectivity,
prevalent for use with portable devices, can be used in either LAN or WAN environments.

A LAN is located within an office or campus environment. It can be as small as two PCs attached to a
single network switch, or it may support hundreds of users and multiple servers. LANs can be developed
using any of several topologies. Each connection on a LAN is considered a node.

A WAN is a data communications network that consists of connecting two or more systems that are
dispersed over a wide geographical area. Communications links, usually provided by a public carrier,
provide the connection to enable one system to interact with other systems.

WANs can connect LANs together, connect to mainframe systems, and connect client computers to
servers. WANs provide much of the communications requirements of geographically dispersed
environments. Types of WAN communications links include the following methods:

         T-1. T-1 is a dedicated phone connection supporting data rates of 1.544 Megabits per second
          (Mbps). A T-1 line consists of 24 individual 64-kbps channels, and each channel can be
