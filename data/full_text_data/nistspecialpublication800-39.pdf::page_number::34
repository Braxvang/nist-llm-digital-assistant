Organizations are becoming increasingly reliant on information system services50 and information
provided by external organizations as well as partnerships to accomplish missions and business
functions. This reliance results in the need for trust relationships among organizations.51 In many
cases, trust relationships with external organizations, while generating greater productivity and
cost efficiencies, can also bring greater risk to organizations. This risk is addressed by the risk
management strategies established by organizations that take into account the strategic goals and
objectives of organizations.

Effectively addressing the risk associated with the growing dependence on external service
providers and partnerships with domestic and international public and private sector participants
necessitates that organizations:
•      Define the types of services/information to be provided to organizations or the types of
       information to be shared/exchanged in any proposed partnering arrangements;
•      Establish the degree of control or influence organizations have over the external
       organizations participating in such partnering arrangements;
•      Describe how the services/information are to be protected in accordance with the information
       security requirements of organizations;
•      Obtain the relevant information from external organizations to determine trustworthiness and
       to support and maintain trust (e.g., visibility into business practices and risk/information
       security decisions to understand risk tolerance);
•      Appropriately balance mission/business-based requirements to support information sharing
       while considering the risk of working with competing or hostile entities and the risk that other
       organizations, while neither competing or hostile, may be a path through which such entities
       attack;
•      Determine if the ongoing risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other
       organizations, or the Nation resulting from the continuing use of the services/information or
       the participation in the partnership, is at an acceptable level; and
•      Recognize that decisions to establish trust relationships are expressions of acceptable risk.

The degree of trust that an organization places in external organizations can vary widely, ranging
from those who are highly trusted (e.g., business partners in a joint venture that share a common
business model and common goals) to those who are less trusted and may represent greater
sources of risk (e.g., business partners in one endeavor who are also competitors or adversaries).
The specifics of establishing and maintaining trust can differ from organization to organization
based on mission/business requirements, the participants involved in the trust relationship, the
criticality/sensitivity of the information being shared or the types of services being rendered, the
history between the organizations, and the overall risk to the organizations participating in the
relationship. Appendix G provides several trust models that organizations can use when dealing
with external organizations.

In many situations, the trust established between organizations may not allow a full spectrum of
information sharing or a complete provision of services. When an organization determines that

50
  External information system services are services that are implemented outside of the system’s traditional
authorization boundary (i.e., services that are used by, but not a part of, the organizational information system).
51
     External providers or mission/business partners can be public or private sector entities, domestic or international.
