                                                         TECHNICAL GUIDE TO INFORMATION SECURITY TESTING AND ASSESSMENT



address FISMA requirements such as reporting on findings from evaluations, compliance with NIST
standards, significant deficiencies, and planned remediation activities. Reports that will remain within the
organization can be tailored for the appropriate audiences, such as program management, information
management, security engineers, configuration management, or technical staff. Internal reports should
include test methodology, test results, analysis, and POA&M. 38 A POA&M will ensure that individual
vulnerabilities are addressed with specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and tangible actions.

8.3      Remediation/Mitigation

The POA&M provides the program management office with the details and required actions needed to
appropriately and acceptably mitigate risk. As a complement to the POA&M, organizations may consider
developing a strategy or process for implementing the plan. Organizations should follow at least the four
steps outlined below during their remediation implementation process—these will provide consistency
and structure for security personnel and program managers.

The first step in the process is testing the remediation recommendation. Before implementing technical
modifications to a production asset, testing should be done on test systems in an environment that
replicates the network in which the mitigation action would be implemented. For example, before being
pushed to the enterprise, patches should be installed on comparable systems in the test environment to
determine if there are any negative implications. Such testing significantly reduces, but does not
eliminate, the risk of a system reacting adversely to a technical modification.

Second, the POA&M should be coordinated through an organization’s configuration control or
configuration management board because the POA&M likely proposes changes to existing systems,
networks, policy, or processes. Communicating POA&M changes both before deployment and upon
completion ensures that the appropriate individuals are aware of the pending changes and their impact on
environment, mission, and operations. At a minimum, the program manager or system owner should be
contacted before executing any POA&M actions and should provide approval of the planned mitigation
actions before they are implemented.

Obtaining management approval can be challenging. It may be beneficial to identify why it is needed
(i.e., whether it is driven by policy or technology) and the positive impact that will be realized with the
mitigation action (i.e., increased security posture or compliance). A cost/benefit analysis may also
provide managers with a quantitative analysis of the increased savings to be realized by implementing the
POA&M items. Additional benefits that may be communicated to senior management include decreased
exposure, increased control of assets, decreased vulnerabilities, a proactive approach to security, and
maintenance of compliance.

Third, mitigation actions are implemented and verified to ensure their appropriate and accurate
implementation. Verification can take place by conducting an audit of the system, retesting the system
and its components, and holding personnel accountable through documentation. A system audit provides
technical verification of the changes that have been implemented on the system, and can be conducted by
onsite security personnel or an external security test team. The audit team may use the mitigation strategy
as a checklist for ensuring that each action is accomplished—also, retesting the system will validate that
the mitigation actions have been completed. It is important to note that the test team will be able to verify
its implementation only if a mirror copy of the original test is performed. As technology evolves,

      NIST SP 800-37 notes that a POA&M “describes the measures that have been implemented or planned: (i) to correct any
      deficiencies noted during the assessment of the security controls; and (ii) to reduce or eliminate known vulnerabilities in the
      information system. The plan of actions and milestones document identifies: (i) the tasks needing to be accomplished; (ii)
      the resources required to accomplish the elements of the plan; (iii) any milestones in meeting the tasks; and (iv) scheduled
      completion dates for the milestones.”
