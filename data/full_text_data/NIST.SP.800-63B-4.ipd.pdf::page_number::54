       NIST SP 800-63B-4 ipd                                              Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022                                       Authentication and Lifecycle Management


1591   As part of the binding process, the CSP MAY require additional information about
1592   the new authenticator or the endpoint it is associated with to determine that they are
1593   suitable for the AAL being requested and to attempt to determine that the endpoint and
1594   authenticator are free from malware.

1595   6.1.1. Binding at Enrollment
1596   The following requirements apply when an authenticator is bound to a subscriber account
1597   as part of the enrollment process.
1598   The CSP SHALL bind at least one — and SHOULD bind at least two — physical
1599   (something you have) authenticators to the subscriber account, in addition to a
1600   memorized secret or one or more biometric characteristics. Binding of multiple
1601   authenticators provides a means to recover from the loss or theft of the subscriber’s
1602   primary authenticator. Preservation of online material or an online reputation makes it
1603   undesirable to lose control of a subscriber account due to the loss of an authenticator. The
1604   second authenticator makes it possible to securely recover from an authenticator loss.
1605   If enrollment and binding cannot be completed in a single physical encounter or
1606   electronic transaction (i.e., within a single protected session), the following methods
1607    SHALL be used to ensure that the same party acts as the applicant throughout the
1608   processes:
1609   For remote transactions:
1610      1. The applicant SHALL identify themselves in each new binding transaction
1611         by presenting a temporary secret which was either established during a prior
1612         transaction, or sent to the applicant’s phone number, email address, or postal
1613         address of record.
1614      2. Long-term authenticator secrets SHALL only be issued to the applicant within a
1615         protected session.
1616   For in-person transactions:
1617      1. The applicant SHALL identify themselves in person by either using a secret as
1618         described in remote transaction (1) above, or through use of a biometric that was
1619         recorded during a prior encounter.
1620      2. Temporary secrets SHALL NOT be reused.
1621      3. If the CSP issues long-term authenticator secrets during a physical transaction, then
1622         they SHALL be loaded locally onto a physical device that is issued in person to the
1623         applicant or delivered in a manner that confirms the address of record.
