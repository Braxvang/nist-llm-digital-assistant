NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                      Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
December 2023                                                                             and Derived PIV Credential Issuers


   Identifier                                  Issuer Control                                                 Source

                  (iii) The PIV Card termination status is distributed to all logical and
                        physical access points, as applicable (test).
     MP-7       The organization has completed a life cycle walkthrough at one year              SP 800-79, Sec. 5.4 – Monitoring
                intervals since the last authorization date, and the results are documented      Phase
                in a report to the DAO.

                Assessment
                Determine that:
                   (i) The organization has completed a life cycle walkthrough to cover
                       sponsorship, identity proofing, card production, activation/issuance,
                       and maintenance processes (interview).
                  (ii) Life cycle walkthroughs have been completed at one year intervals
                       since the last authorization date (interview).
                 (iii) The results of the issuer life cycle walkthrough have been
                       documented and reviewed by the DAO (review, interview).
     MP-8       The intent of this control is covered by controls MP-18 and MP-19.               -
     MP-9       The entire identity proofing, registration, and issuance process is repeated     [FIPS201], Sec. 2.9.1 – PIV Card
  (UPDATED)     if the issuer does not maintain a PIV enrollment record that includes            Reissuance Requirements
                biometric data records for the cardholder.

                Assessment
                Determine that:
                  (i) The issuing facility completes the entire identity proofing,
                      registration, and issuance process if they do not maintain a PIV
                      enrollment record that includes biometric data records for the
                      cardholder (review, observe).
    MP-10       Previously collected biometric data is not reused with the new PIV Card if       [FIPS201], Sec. 2.9.1 – PIV Card
                the expiration date of the new PIV Card is more than 12 years after the          Reissuance Requirements
                date that the biometric data was obtained.

                Assessment
                Determine that:
                  (i) The issuing facility ensures that new biometric data is collected if the
                      new PIV Card’s expiration is 12 years after the collection of the
                      initial biometric data available with the issuer (review, observe).
    MP-11       Post-issuance updates are performed (either with the issuer in physical   [FIPS201], Sec. 2.9.2 – PIV Card
                custody of the PIV Card or remotely) with issuer security controls        Post Issuance Update
                equivalent to those applied during PIV Card reissuance. These include the Requirements
                following: (i) communication between the PIV Card issuer and the PIV Card
                only occurs over mutually authenticated secure sessions between tested
                and validated cryptographic modules (one being the PIV Card); (ii) data
                transmitted between the issuer and PIV Card is encrypted and contain data
                integrity checks; (iii) the PIV Card application will communicate with no
                endpoint entity other than the PIV Card issuer during the remote post-
                issuance update.

                Assessment
                Determine that:
                  (i) Post-issuance updates require all security controls to be
                      implemented by the issuer and the issuer’s information systems
                      (review).
    MP-12       When a PIN reset is performed in person at the issuing facility, the issuer     [FIPS201], Sec. 2.9.3.1 – PIN
  (UPDATED)     performs a biometric verification before giving the reset PIV Card back to      Reset
                the cardholder to ensure that the cardholder’s biometric characteristics elicit
                a positive biometric verification decision when compared to biometric data
