GUIDELINES ON ELECTRONIC MAIL SECURITY



 Cannot scan encrypted emails
 May require more powerful (expensive) servers to handle the load of a large organization.
 Can detect only those threats that have been identified; offers little protection against zero-day
  exploits.
When considering mail server-based malware scanners, look for the following qualities:

 Detects and cleans all types of malware typically carried by email (e.g., viruses, worms, Trojan
  horses, malicious mobile code, spyware)
 Provides heuristic scanning (provides some protection from new and unknown malware)
 Provides content filtering (see Section 6.2.2)
 Incorporates mechanisms to help prevent email from circumventing the system
 Provides ease of management
 Provides automated downloading and installation of updates
 Provides frequent updates (critical)
 Can identify and apply rules to different types of content
 Provides a robust and configurable alert mechanism
 Provides detailed logging capabilities (see Section 9.1).
6.2.1.3 Scanning on Client Hosts

Malware scanners can also be located on client hosts (see Figure 6.3). This type of malware scanner is
installed on user workstations and mobile devices, such as personal digital assistants (PDA). Incoming
emails are scanned as they are opened by the user, and outbound emails are checked as the user attempts
to send them. The primary advantage of this type of configuration is that scanning is distributed across
many hosts and therefore has minimal effect on the performance of each individual host. Also, if a client
machine becomes infected with malware, this layer of protection might stop the malware from spreading
to the mail server and other mail clients.
