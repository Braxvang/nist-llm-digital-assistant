Monitoring, follow-up, and corrective procedures are well defined and seamless. Finally, in this stage,
agencies have incorporated into their awareness and training program formal mechanisms for ongoing
research in areas of technology advancement, good practices, and benchmarking opportunities.

6.5      Program Success Indicators

CIOs, program officials, and IT security program managers should be primary advocates for continuous
improvement and for supporting an agency’s security awareness, training, and education program. It is
critical that everyone be capable and willing to carry out their assigned security roles in the organization.
In security, the phrase, “Only as strong as the weakest link,” is true. Securing an organization’s
information and infrastructure is a team effort. Listed below are some key indicators to gauge the support
for, and acceptance of, the program.

     Sufficient funding to implement the agreed-upon strategy.
     Appropriate organizational placement to enable those with key responsibilities (CIO, program
      officials, and IT security program manager) to effectively implement the strategy.
     Support for broad distribution (e.g., web, e-mail, TV) and posting of security awareness items.
     Executive/senior level messages to staff regarding security (e.g., staff meetings, broadcasts to all
      users by agency head).
     Use of metrics (e.g., to indicate a decline in security incidents or violations,22 indicate that the gap
      between existing awareness and training coverage and identified needs is shrinking, the percentage of
      users being exposed to awareness material is increasing, the percentage of users with significant
      security responsibilities being appropriately trained is increasing).
     Managers do not use their status in the organization to avoid security controls that are consistently
      adhered to by the rank and file.
     Level of attendance at mandatory security forums/briefings.
     Recognition of security contributions (e.g., awards, contests).
     Motivation demonstrated by those playing key roles in managing/coordinating the security program.

      While improved security behavior can result in a decline in incidents or violations, reporting of potential incidents may
      increase because of enhanced vigilance among users.
