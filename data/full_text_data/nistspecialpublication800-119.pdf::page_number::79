                                                               GUIDELINES FOR THE SECURE DEPLOYMENT OF IPV6


     G. A MN includes an Alternate CoA in a BU:

             –   The BU contains a Home Test (Type 3) MH option to indicate a CoA different from the
                 source address (because of network topology or security, for example).

             –   The CN uses the Alternate CoA instead of the original CoA.
    4.4.2   Differences from IPv4 Standards

MIPv4 is standardized in RFC 3344. MIPv4 and MIPv6 share much of the same motivation and have
somewhat similar designs, but MIPv6 provides enhanced security, streamlined administrative protocols,
and greater efficiency. This is not an accident: the reason MIPv6 has so many advantages over MIPv4 is
that is uses the new features and capabilities found in IPv6 but not in IPv4. IPv6 has autoconfiguration,
globally unique addressing (without NAT), flexible extension headers, and mandatory IPsec. The much
larger IPv6 address space makes MIPv6 easier to deploy. Some of the biggest differences are:

    Route optimization is standard with MIPv6, and it uses a new approach to security called return
     routability.

    MIPv6 does not use the MIPv4 last-hop foreign agent. The tunnel endpoint is built directly into the
     MN, which also allows end-to-end security.

    MIPv6 does not have any new, special-purpose authentication, authorization and accounting (AAA)
     support. MIPv6 uses standard link layer and IP network access methods for AAA along with IPsec.
     Using standard, already understood methods is always preferable.

    MIPv6 uses two-way tunneling, which works better with ingress filtering.

    MIPv6 has many security improvements.
MIPv4 and MIPv6 use different protocols. MIPv4 uses ICMP(v4) Router Discovery, Port 434 (UDP or
TCP), and ―home-grown‖ security, whereas Mobile IPv6 uses ICMPv6, IPv6 Routing and Mobility
Extension Headers, Destination Options, and IPsec.

    4.4.3   Security Ramifications

For MIPv6, security has always been a primary design concern. A thorough approach to security requires
looking at all of the potential vulnerabilities and choosing appropriate measures to deal with them. The
designers of MIPv6 actually used a security threat analysis as the basis for the design. MIPv6 security
starts with the base specification, Using IPsec to Protect Mobile IPv6 Signaling between Mobile Nodes
and Home Agents (RFC 3776), and extends into several other RFCs, primarily:

    RFC 4225, Mobile IP version 6 Route Optimization Security Design Background

    RFC 4285, Authentication Protocol for Mobile IPv6

    RFC 4487, Mobile IPv6 and Firewalls: Problem Statement

    RFC 4449, Securing Mobile IPv6 Route Optimization Using a Static Shared Key

    RFC 4877, Mobile IPv6 Operation with IKEv2 and the revised IPsec Architecture

    RFC 4882, IP Address Location Privacy and Mobile IPv6: Problem Statement.
