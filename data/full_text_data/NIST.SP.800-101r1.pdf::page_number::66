       Brief description of steps taken during examination, such as string searches, graphics
        image searches, and recovering erased files.

       Supporting materials such as printouts of particular items of evidence, digital copies of
        evidence, and chain of custody documentation

            Graphic image analysis

            Indicators of ownership, which could include program registration data

            Data analysis

            Description of relevant programs on the examined items
