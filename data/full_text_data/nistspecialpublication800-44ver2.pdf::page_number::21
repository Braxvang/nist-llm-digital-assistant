                                                                   GUIDELINES ON SECURING PUBLIC WEB SERVERS



3.      Planning and Managing Web Servers

The most critical aspect of deploying a secure Web server is careful planning prior to installation,
configuration, and deployment. Careful planning will ensure that the Web server is as secure as possible
and in compliance with all relevant organizational policies. Many Web server security and performance
problems can be traced to a lack of planning or management controls. The importance of management
controls cannot be overstated. In many organizations, the IT support structure is highly fragmented. This
fragmentation leads to inconsistencies, and these inconsistencies can lead to security vulnerabilities and
other issues.

3.1     Installation and Deployment Planning

Security should be considered from the initial planning stage at the beginning of the systems development
life cycle to maximize security and minimize costs. It is much more difficult and expensive to address
security after deployment and implementation. Organizations are more likely to make decisions about
configuring hosts appropriately and consistently if they begin by developing and using a detailed, well-
designed deployment plan. Developing such a plan enables organizations to make informed tradeoff
decisions between usability and performance, and risk. A deployment plan allows organizations to
maintain secure configurations and aids in identifying security vulnerabilities, which often manifest
themselves as deviations from the plan.

In the planning stages of a Web server, the following items should be considered [Alle00]:

 Identify the purpose(s) of the Web server.

       What information categories will be stored on the Web server?

       What information categories will be processed on or transmitted through the Web server?

       What are the security requirements for this information?

       Will any information be retrieved from or stored on another host (e.g., back-end database, mail
          server)?

       What are the security requirements for any other hosts involved (e.g., back-end database,
          directory server, mail server, proxy server)?

       What other service(s) will be provided by the Web server (in general, dedicating the host to being
          only a Web server is the most secure option)?

       What are the security requirements for these additional services?

       What are the requirements for continuity of services provided by Web servers, such as those
          specified in continuity of operations plans and disaster recovery plans?

       Where on the network will the Web server be located (see Section 8)?

 Identify the network services that will be provided on the Web server, such as those supplied through
  the following protocols:

       HTTP
