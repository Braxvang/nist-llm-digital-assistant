               The Technical Specification for the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.2



Appendix A—Security Considerations

Major security considerations for this version of SCAP include the following:
   Confidentiality. SCAP does not define any mechanisms for protecting the confidentiality of SCAP
    content or results. Organizations can add on such protections as they deem appropriate, such as
    encrypting results files that contain sensitive information regarding system vulnerabilities.
   Malicious content. While SCAP does provide mechanisms for ensuring integrity of SCAP content
    and verifying content signatures, SCAP does not have any features specifically for handling malicious
    SCAP content (benchmarks, tailoring files, etc.) At a minimum, organizations should generate
    signatures for their content and verify signatures on all content before using it to ensure that the
    content has not been maliciously altered. Also, organizations should not process content that fails
    validation, and for stronger assurance may choose not to use any content that has not been signed.
   Security value of content. It is outside the scope of SCAP’s capabilities to make any assertions or
    assessments regarding the security value of SCAP checklists and other forms of SCAP content.
    People and organizations may determine security value through their own methods, such as applying
    checklists to test systems and evaluating the results of those tests, but SCAP itself does not have any
    way of ensuring the security value of its content.
   Component security. Be aware of security considerations of all of the component protocols,
    specifications, standards, etc. used by SCAP. SCAP does not impose any additional security
    requirements on these.
