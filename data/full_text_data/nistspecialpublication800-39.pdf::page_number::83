organizations, brokers the trust relationship between the two organizations, thus helping to
establish the required level of trust. Another type of mediated trust involves the concept of
transitivity of trust. In this example, one organization establishes a trust relationship with a
second organization. Independent of the first trust relationship, the second organization
establishes a trust relationship with a third organization. Since the first organization trusts the
second organization and the second organization trusts the third organization, a trust relationship
is now established between the first and third organizations (illustrating the concept of transitive
trust among organizations).77

Mandated Trust
In the mandated trust model, an organization establishes a level of trust with another organization
based on a specific mandate issued by a third party in a position of authority.78 This mandate can
be established by the respective authority through Executive Orders, directives, regulations, or
policies (e.g., a memorandum from an agency head directing that all subordinate organizations
accept the results of security assessments conducted by any subordinate organization within the
agency). Mandated trust can also be established when some organizational entity is decreed to be
the authoritative source for the provision of information resources including information
technology products, systems, or services. For example, an organization may be given the
responsibility and the authority to issue Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificates for a group of
organizations.

Hybrid Trust
In general, the trust models described above are not mutually exclusive. Each of the trust models
may be used independently as a stand-alone model or in conjunction with another model. Several
trust models may be used at times within the organization (e.g., at various phases in the system
development life cycle). Also, since organizations are often large and diverse, it is possible that
subordinate organizations within a parent organization might independently employ different trust
models in establishing trust relationships with potential partnering organizations (including
subordinate organizations). The organizational governance structure may establish the specific
terms and conditions for how the various trust models are employed in a complementary manner
within the organization.

Suitability of Various Trust Models
The trust models can be employed at various tiers in the risk management approach described in
this publication. None of the trust models is inherently better or worse than the others. However,
some models may be better suited to some situations than others. For example, the validated trust
model, because it requires evidence of a technical nature (e.g., tests completed successfully), is
probably best suited for application at Tier 3. In contrast, the direct historical trust model, with a
significant emphasis on past experiences, is more suited for application at Tiers 1 or 2. The
mediated and mandated trust models are typically more oriented toward governance and
consequently are best suited for application at Tier 1. However, some implementations of the
mandated trust model, for example, being required to trust the source of a PKI certificate, are
more oriented toward Tier 3. Similarly, although the mediated trust model is primarily oriented
toward Tier 1, there can be implementations of it that are more information system-, or Tier 3-

   In the mediated trust model, the first organization typically has no insight into the nature of the trust relationship
between the second and third organizations.

  The authoritative organization explicitly accepts the risks to be incurred by all organizations covered by the mandate
and is accountable for the risk-related decisions imposed by the organization.
