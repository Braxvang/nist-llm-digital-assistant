       as the probability for a specifc individual or the probability averaged over the entire
       dataset (AKIRP).17
Unknown inclusion re-identifcation probability (UIRP) is the probability of fnding the
    record that matches a specifc individual without frst knowing whether the individual
    is in the dataset. UIRP can be expressed as a probability for an individual record in
    the dataset averaged over the entire population (AUIRP).18
Record-matching probability (RMP) is the probability of fnding the record that matches
     a specifc individual chosen from the population. Other useful metrics include the av-
     erage record-matching probability (ARMP), which is the probability averaged over
     the entire dataset, and the maximum RMP for all of the individual records.
Inclusion probability (IP) is the probability that a specifc individual’s presence in the
      dataset can be inferred.
Whether it is necessary to quantitatively estimate these probabilities depends on the specifcs
of each intended data release. For example, many cities publicly disclose whether taxes
have been paid on a property. Given that this information is already a matter of public
record, it may not be necessary to consider inclusion probability when a dataset of property
taxpayers for a specifc dataset is released. Likewise, there may be some attributes in a
dataset that are already public and may not need to be protected with disclosure limitation
techniques. However, the existence of such attributes may pose a re-identifcation risk for
other information in the dataset or in other de-identifed datasets. The fact that information
is public may not negate the responsibility of an agency to provide protection for that in-
formation, as the aggregation and distribution of information may cause privacy risks that
were not otherwise present. Agencies may also be legally prohibited from releasing copies
of information that are similar to information that is already in the public domain.
Although disclosures are commonly thought to be discrete events involving the release of
specifc data, such as an individual’s name matched to a record, disclosures can result from
the release of data that merely changes a data intruder’s probabilistic belief. For example,
a disclosure might change an intruder’s estimate that a specifc individual is present in a
dataset from a 50 % probability to 90 %. The intruder still does not know if the individual
is in the dataset or not (and the individual might not, in fact, be in the dataset), but a
probabilistic disclosure has still occurred because the intruder’s estimate of the individual
has been changed by the data release. This is similar to the (p,q) rule (also known as the
ambiguity rule) in the SDL literature (see 105).



17 Some texts refer to KIRP as “prosecutor risk.” The scenario is that a prosecutor is looking for records that

  belong to a specifc named individual.
18 Some texts refer to UIRP as “journalist risk.” The scenario is that a journalist has obtained a de-identifed

  fle and is trying to identify one of the data subjects, but the journalist fundamentally does not care who is
  identifed.
