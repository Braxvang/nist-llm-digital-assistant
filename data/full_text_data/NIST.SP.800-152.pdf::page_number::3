This publication has been developed by NIST to further its statutory responsibility under the
Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) of 2014, 44 U.S.C. ยง 3541 et seq.,
Public Law (P.L.) 113-283. NIST is responsible for developing information-security standards and
guidelines, including minimum requirements for Federal information systems, but such standards
and guidelines shall not apply to national security systems without the express approval of
appropriate Federal officials exercising policy authority over such systems. This guideline is
consistent with the requirements of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular
A-130.

Nothing in this publication should be taken to contradict the standards and guidelines made
mandatory and binding on Federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory
authority. Nor should these guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing
authorities of the Secretary of Commerce, Director of the OMB, or any other Federal official.
This publication may be used by nongovernmental organizations on a voluntary basis and is not
subject to copyright in the United States. Attribution would, however, be appreciated by NIST.

Certain commercial entities, equipment, or materials may be identified in this document in order to describe an
experimental procedure or concept adequately. Such identification is not intended to imply recommendation or

There may be references in this publication to other publications currently under development by NIST in
accordance with its assigned statutory responsibilities. The information in this publication, including concepts and
methodologies, may be used by federal agencies even before the completion of such companion publications. Thus,
until each publication is completed, current requirements, guidelines, and procedures, where they exist, remain
operative. For planning and transition purposes, federal agencies may wish to closely follow the development of
these new publications by NIST.
Organizations are encouraged to review all draft publications during public comment periods and provide feedback
