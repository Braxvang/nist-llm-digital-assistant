       NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                  Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
       December 2023                                                         and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

2234   Sample Authorization Decision Letter (Interim Authorization to Operate)
2235   From: Designated Authorizing Official                        Date:
2236   To: Enterprise Identity Management Official
2237   Subject: Authorization Decision for [PCI/DPCI]
2238   After reviewing the results of the assessment of [ISSUER NAME], I have determined that the
2239   requirements identified in [FIPS201] and the organization’s policies, regulations, and standards
2240   have not been implemented satisfactorily. However, I have also determined that there is an
2241   overarching need for the issuance services to continue due to mission necessity and other
2242   considerations. Accordingly, I am issuing an interim authorization to operate (IATO). Operation
2243   of the [ISSUER] shall be performed in accordance with the enclosed terms and conditions during
2244   the IATO period. The [ISSUER] is not considered authorized during this IATO period.
2245   This IATO also applies to facilities under the [ISSUER]. Included is a list of facilities authorized
2246   to operate during this interim period, along with specific limitations or restrictions that apply.
2247   This interim authorization to operate is valid until close of business on <date> [not to exceed
2248   three months]. This interim authorization will remain in effect as long as (i) the required status
2249   reports for the [ISSUER] are submitted to this office every month, (ii) the problems or
2250   deficiencies reported from the authorization do not result in additional risk that is deemed
2251   unacceptable, and (iii) continued progress is being made to reduce or eliminate the deficiencies
2252   in accordance with the corrective actions plan (CAP). At the end of IATO period, the [ISSUER]
2253   must be ready to receive an authorization to operate. A second IATO will be granted only in
2254   extenuating circumstances. This office will review the CAP submitted with the authorization
2255   package during the IATO period and monitor progress on the removal or reduction of concerns
2256   and discrepancies before reauthorization is initiated.
2257   A copy of this letter and all supporting authorization documentation shall be retained in
2258   accordance with the organization’s record retention schedule.
