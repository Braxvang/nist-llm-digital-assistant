GUIDELINES ON ELECTRONIC MAIL SECURITY



Datagram Protocol (UDP) as well as IP. The most powerful firewalls are application layer or proxy
firewalls that are able to understand and filter email content and commands. 42

A common misperception about firewalls and routers (acting as firewalls) is that they eliminate all risk
and can protect against the misconfiguration of the mail server or poor network design. Unfortunately,
this is not the case. Firewalls and routers themselves are vulnerable to misconfiguration and software
vulnerabilities. In addition, most firewalls have limited or no “insight” into the application layer where
many current attacks occur. Thus mail servers in particular are vulnerable to many attacks, even when
located behind a secure, well-configured firewall.

A firewall or router (acting as a firewall) that is protecting a mail server should be configured to block all
access to the mail server from the Internet except the necessary ports, such as TCP port 25 (SMTP). A
firewall is the first line of defense for a mail server; however, to be truly secure, organizations need to
implement layered protection for their mail servers (and networks). Most importantly, organizations
should strive to maintain all systems in a secure posture and not depend solely on routers, firewalls, or
any other single component to stop attackers.

A modern enterprise router is able to function as a network and transport layer filter (e.g., a basic
firewall). A router functioning as a network/transport layer firewall can provide filtering based on several
pieces of information [Wack02a], including the following:

 Source IP address
 Destination IP address
 Traffic type
 TCP/UDP port number and state.
The strengths of routers are in the following areas:

 Cost (most organizations already have a border router that can be configured to provide
  network/transport layer firewall capabilities).
The weaknesses of routers are in the following areas:

 Susceptibility to application layer attacks (e.g., cannot examine email content or commands)
 Susceptibility to attacks via allowed ports (routers are generally weaker than firewalls in this area
  because the routers do not perform analysis at the application layer, but the firewalls do, allowing the
  firewalls to recognize some attacks sent via allowed ports)
 Difficulty of configuration and administration
 Limitations in logging capabilities
 Processing capabilities may be more limited and overtaxed by complex rule sets (i.e., access controls
  lists)
 Insufficient rule set expressiveness and filtering capabilities.
