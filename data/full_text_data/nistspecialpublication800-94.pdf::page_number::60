GUIDE TO INTRUSION DETECTION AND PREVENTION SYSTEMS (IDPS)



5.3.3.3 Tuning and Customization

Wireless IDPS technologies usually require some tuning and customization to improve their detection
accuracy. The main effort is in specifying which WLANs, APs, and STAs are authorized, and in entering
the policy characteristics into the wireless IDPS software. Because wireless IDPSs are only examining
wireless network protocols, not higher level protocols (e.g., application), there are generally not a large
number of alert types, and consequently not many customizations or tunings available. Some wireless
IDPSs offer industry-specific templates that can be helpful in establishing base policies.

Wireless IDPSs offer some customization features. Most have thresholds that can be used for anomaly-
based detection. Blacklists and whitelists are used to hold lists of known malicious and benign WLAN
devices, respectively. The lists can also be used to record authorized or unauthorized WLAN NIC
vendors; alerts can be generated when any NICs not on the authorized list are used for APs or STAs.
Individual alerts can be customized, just as they can for network-based IDPSs. Code editing is not
available for most products, although some vendors allow administrators to enter complex logical
expressions to tune certain detection capabilities.

Besides reviewing tuning and customizations periodically to ensure that they are still accurate,
administrators should also ensure that changes to building plans are incorporated occasionally. This is
needed for accurate identification of the physical location of threats and accurate planning of sensor
deployments.

5.3.3.4 Technology Limitations

Although wireless IDPSs offer robust detection capabilities, they do have some significant limitations.
Three of the most important are being unable to detect certain wireless protocol attacks, being susceptible
to evasion techniques, and being unable to withstand attacks against the IDPSs themselves. These
limitations are discussed in detail below.

Wireless IDPSs cannot detect certain types of attacks against wireless networks. An attacker can
passively monitor wireless traffic, which is not detectable by wireless IDPSs. If weak security methods
are being used (e.g., WEP), the attacker can then perform offline processing of that collected traffic to
find the encryption key used to provide security for the wireless traffic. With this key, the attacker can
decrypt the traffic that was already collected, as well as any other traffic that is collected from the same
WLAN. Wireless IDPSs cannot fully compensate for the use of insecure wireless networking protocols.

Another problem with some wireless IDPS sensors is the use of evasion techniques. Attackers can
identify the wireless IDPS product in use by various means, including a physical survey of the area in
which the sensors are deployed, and the use of fingerprinting techniques that can identify the product in
use by the characteristics of its prevention actions (see Section 5.3.4 for information on prevention).
Once an attacker has identified the product, evasion techniques can be used that take advantage of the
productâ€™s channel scanning scheme. One example is performing attacks in very short bursts on channels
that are not currently being monitored. An attacker could also launch attacks on two channels at the same
time. If the wireless IDPS sensor detects the first attack, it cannot detect the second attack unless it scans
away from the channel of the first attack. Another drawback of channel scanning is the impact it could
have on network forensics. Since each sensor sees only a fraction of the activity on each channel, the
forensic data is quite incomplete, making it considerably more difficult to analyze.

Wireless IDPS sensors are also susceptible to attack. The same denial of service attacks (both logical and
physical) that attempt to disrupt WLANs can also disrupt sensor functions. Sensors are also often
particularly susceptible to physical attack because they are usually located in hallways, conference rooms,
