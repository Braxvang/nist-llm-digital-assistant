NIST stakeholders made significant and helpful new contributions to the online resource repository.
These contributions included new regulatory crosswalks to key domestic and international privacy
regulations and translations of the Privacy Framework to Spanish, Portuguese, and Bahasa
Indonesia. A broad group of implementers voiced their support for the Framework by contributing
14 new quotes to the Privacy Framework website. In early 2022, NIST plans to release its first
Privacy Framework “Success Story”, which will be provided from the Arlington County, Virginia
government.
Workforce Advancement
In April 2021, NIST officially launched a Privacy Workforce Public Working Group (PWWG) pursuant
to the Privacy Framework companion roadmap and in response to stakeholder challenges with
privacy workforce recruitment and development. The PWWG provides a forum in which participants
from the general public – including private industry, the public sector, academia, and civil society
– can create descriptions of tasks, knowledge, and skills aligned with the Privacy Framework
Core Subcategories and the NICE Cybersecurity Workforce Framework taxonomy to support the
development of a workforce capable of managing privacy risk. The PWWG currently has over 600
members from across the world and has two active project teams generating the PWWG work
product.
Privacy Leadership
Through leadership positions in key privacy and security organizations, NIST helps drive change
and the standardization of privacy considerations. NIST personnel co-chaired the Interagency
Working Group (IWG) for Privacy with the U.S. Networking and Information Technology Research
and Development (NITRD) Program, co-chaired the NIST Privacy Workforce Public Working
Group, and served as the first privacy co-chair of the Federal Computer Security Managers’ Forum
(FCSM).
Privacy-Enhancing Technologies
NIST continues its work in advancing the understanding and deployment of privacy-enhancing
technologies. In FY 2021, there has been increased interest among federal agencies in the use
of these technologies to enable greater research access to agency datasets while maintaining
security and privacy. In May 2021, NIST co-hosted a workshop with the National Science
Foundation (NSF) on this topic. As a follow-up to the workshop, NIST has been working with the
NSF to develop a prize challenge to accelerate the use of these technologies, which is anticipated
to be announced in FY 2022.
Differential Privacy
Differential privacy involves adapting a dataset that has personal information in it such that the
personal information is not readily identifiable. In FY 2021, NIST produced a blog series about
differential privacy and applicable use cases and to help privacy engineers and Information
Technology (IT) professionals that covers the basics, applicable use cases, and open-source tools
available for an implementation to leverage the differential privacy contributions indexed in the
Privacy Engineering Collaboration Space (an online venue open to the public where practitioners
can discover, share, discuss, and improve upon open-source tools, solutions, and processes that
support privacy engineering and risk management).
