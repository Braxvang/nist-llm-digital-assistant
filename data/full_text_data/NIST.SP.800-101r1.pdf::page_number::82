Appendix C. Standardized Call Records

     The European Telecommunications Standards Institute specification for GSM event and call
     data provides detailed definitions for a variety of records needed in the administration of
     subscriber related event and call data [ETS99]. Table 5 gives the record structure for a mobile-
     originated call attempt, identifying and describing the name of the various fields involved and
     an indication of whether the field is mandatory (M), conditional (C), or optional (O).

     Other record definitions also appear in the standard. The reader is asked to consult the standard
     directly for a more detailed explanation of the use of each field given in Table 5 and a better
     understanding of the range of records and data involved in network administration.
