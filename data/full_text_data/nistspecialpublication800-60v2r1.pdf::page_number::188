materials or archives, the potential consequences to key national assets could be serious to
severe. Consequently, the confidentiality impact could be moderate to high.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for cultural and historic exhibition information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of cultural and historic exhibition
information would have, at most, a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or
individuals. Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external
communications (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect operations and/or public
confidence in the agency, but the damage to the mission would usually be limited.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: In cases where undetected modification of
information might be useful to an individual or organization intent on the destruction of
historical materials or archives, the potential consequences to key national assets could be
serious to severe. Consequently, the integrity impact could be moderate to high.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
cultural and historic exhibition information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to cultural and historic exhibition
information. The effects of disruption of access to most cultural and historic exhibition
information or information systems would have a limited adverse effect on agency
operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
cultural and historic exhibition information is low.
