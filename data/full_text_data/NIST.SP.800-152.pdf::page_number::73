SP 800-152                                                   A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


                              c) That confidentiality has been provided to secret and
                                 private keys and sensitive metadata.


6.6.2 Key Agreement
Two entities working together can create and agree on a cryptographic key without the key
being transported from one entity to the other during an automated key-agreement process.
Cryptographic algorithms employing key-agreement keys are used by each entity. NIST-
approved methods for key agreement using public-key algorithms are provided in [SP 800-
56A] and [SP 800-56B].

Each entity participating in a key-agreement process must obtain assurance of the identity of
the other entity during the execution of that process.

FR:6.83 The CKMS design shall specify each key agreement scheme supported by the
CKMS.

FR:6.84 The CKMS design shall specify how each entity participating in a key agreement is
authenticated.

                           When keys and metadata are agreed-upon during an
PR:6.70
                           automated key-agreement process in a Federal CKMS, each
                           entity involved in the transaction shall obtain assurance of the
                           identity or role of the other party.

6.6.3 Key Confirmation
When keys are established between two entities, each entity should confirm that the other
entity did, in fact, have the correct key. [SP 800-56A] and [SP 800-56B] specify key
confirmation schemes for use in some automated key-establishment schemes. Other methods
may also be appropriate, such as decrypting ciphertext and comparing with the expected
plaintext value.

FR:6.85 The CKMS design shall specify each key confirmation method used to confirm that
the correct key was established with the other entity.

FR:6.86 The CKMS design shall specify the circumstances under which each key
confirmation is performed.

                           For Moderate and High impact-level systems, a Federal
PR:6.71
                           CKMS shall support key confirmation for all key-
                           establishment transactions.

                           For Low impact-level systems, a Federal CKMS should
PA:6.17
                           support key confirmation for all key-establishment
                           transactions.
