models. For example, data that belong to two families in adjoining towns may be swapped
to protect the identity of the families. Alternatively, the data for an outlier variable may be
removed and replaced with a range value that is incorrect (e.g., replacing the value “60”
with the range “30-35”). It is considered best practice for the data publisher to indicate that
some values have been modifed or otherwise imputed but not to reveal the specifc values
that have been modifed.

4.4.2.   Test Data
It is also possible to create test data that are syntactically valid but do not convey accurate
information when analyzed. Such data can be used for software development. When cre-
ating test data, it is useful for the names, addresses, and other information in the data to
be conspicuously non-natural so that the test data are not inadvertently confused with true
confdential data. For example, use the name “FIRSTNAME1 LASTNAME2” rather than
“JOHN SMITH.”

4.4.3.   Realistic Test Data
Test data that can be mistaken for real data are sometimes called realistic test data. Such
data may be required for some kinds of software testing or validation—for example, soft-
ware that applies a statistical model to names in an attempt to identify typos or inadvertent
repetitions. Provided that the realistic test data are not developed using confdential data
or a model based on the confdential data, realistic test data will not compromise the con-
tent of confdential data. However, it can be diffcult to develop such data, and it can be
inadvertently confused with confdential data, potentially causing operational diffculties.

4.4.4.   Fully Synthetic Data
A fully synthetic dataset is a dataset for which there is no one-to-one mapping between
data in the original dataset and data in the de-identifed dataset. One approach to creating
a fully synthetic dataset is to use the original dataset to create a high-fdelity model – that
is, a model with many parameters that is functionally close to the reality that it models –
and then to use a simulation to produce individual data elements that are consistent with
the model. Special efforts must be taken to maintain marginal and joint probabilities when
creating partially or fully synthetic data.
Fully synthetic datasets cannot provide more information to the downstream user than was
contained in the original model. Nevertheless, some users may prefer to work with the fully
synthetic dataset instead of the model for a variety of reasons:
    • Synthetic data provide users with the ability to develop queries and other techniques
      that can be applied to the real data without exposing real data to users during the
      development process. The queries and techniques can then be provided to the data
      owner, who can run them on the real data and provide the results to the users.
