CHAPTER 14                                              Configuration Management


   • CCRB. CM responsibilities of the CCRB include:
     – Discussing and resolving change requests that require additional funding or
       resources to implement;
     – Ensuring that change requests do not adversely affect any systems or
       services related to the system or associated systems, subsystems, and
       facilities; and
     – Evaluating CM metric information on funding and other CM-related issues.
   • CM manager. The CM manager is responsible for day-to-day activities,
     including:
     – Documenting and implementing the CM plan;
     – Establishing system baselines and evaluating controls;
     – Ensuring that proposed changes do not adversely affect agency systems or
       data;
     – Managing change requests and coordinating implementation of changes;
     – Conducting impact analysis of changes;
     – Approving, denying, or deferring changes;
     – Notifying users of system changes;
     – Ensuring existence of a process for storing, retrieving, and distributing CM
       materials; and
     – Ensuring that an audit trail of changes is documented and maintained.
   • System users. System users are responsible for reporting any weaknesses or
     new requirements that are identified in current versions of the software.
   • Developers. The developers are responsible for coordinating and working with
     the CM manager to identify, resolve, and implement controls and other CM
     issues.

14.3 Configuration Management Process
   The CM process identifies the steps required to ensure that all changes are
properly requested, evaluated, and authorized. The CM process also provides a
detailed, step-by-step procedure for identifying, processing, tracking, and
documenting changes. An example CM process is depicted in Figure 14-2.

Step 1: Identify Change
   The first step of the CM process begins with a person or process associated with
the information system identifying a need for a change. The change can be initiated
by numerous individuals, such as users or system owners, or they may be identified
by audit findings or other reviews. A change may consist of updating the fields or
records of a database to upgrading the operating system with the latest security
patches. Once the need for a change has been identified, a change request should
be submitted to the appropriate decision-making body.
