large, general-purpose PKIs, such as the Federal PKI. For PKIs requiring less
interoperability, these requirements should be evaluated for appropriateness within their
systems. In general, cryptographic algorithm and key size standards should be met by all
PKIs.

2.2 Security and Compliance Issues
2.2.1 Recommended Key Sizes and Algorithms
Table 2-1 below summarizes the recommended key sizes for key pairs used by PKI users
and infrastructure components. The PKI uses the term digital signature key to refer to a
private signature key or public signature verification key (as defined in Part 1) that
provides a non-repudiation service. The term authentication key is used by the PKI to
refer to a private authentication key or public authentication key as defined in Part 1.
Note that both a digital signature key and an authentication key are used with a digital
signature algorithm.

The dates in this table are consistent with those that appear in Part 1, where:
      A digital signature key is as defined above.
      A key establishment key is an asymmetric key pair used to provide key agreement
       or key transport, and
      A CA and OCSP responder signing key is an asymmetric key pair used to sign
       and verify certificates.

Approved algorithms and key sizes specified in Table 2-1 and certificate expiration dates
are two different things. These algorithms and key sizes are approved for use beyond the
year 2013. However, a digital signature or key establishment certificate may expire at any
time, depending on the organization’s security policy.
