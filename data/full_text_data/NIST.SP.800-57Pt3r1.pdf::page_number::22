2.3 Procurement Guidance
The following provides guidance for those responsible for making decisions about which
products to purchase in support of a PKI.

2.3.1 CA/RA Software and Hardware:
1. Ensure that CA and RA software supports at least one of these protocols: the
   Certificate Management Protocol (CMP) [RFC 4210], Enrollment over Secure
   Transport (EST) [RFC 7030] and Certificate Management Using Cryptographic
   Message Syntax (CMC); see [RFC 5272].

2. Ensure that all CAs support the generation of certificates and CRLs that conform to
   [RFC 5280]. (Specific requirements with respect to certificate and CRL extensions
   are detailed below.)

3. Ensure that CAs are capable of issuing multiple certificates to users, and for all such
   certificates, asserting the key usage extension, including the Extended Key Usage
   extension.

4. Ensure that CAs are capable of including the CRL distribution points extension.

5. Ensure that CAs support the inclusion of HTTP URLs to specify the location of
   CRLs.

6. CAs should support the inclusion of LDAP to specify the location of CRLs.

7. Ensure that CAs are capable of specifying an authoritative OCSP responder in the
   Authority Information Access extension.

8. Each PKI has its own certificate profile, identifying certificate extensions that appear
   in the certificates and CRLs it issues.10 Ensure that CAs are able to generate all
   mandatory extensions in the appropriate profiles. For CAs owned or operated on
   behalf of federal agencies, the following specific guidance applies:

       a) Ensure that CAs that implement federal agency-specific policies are able to
          generate certificates and CRLs that meet the agency profile and the Federal PKI
          Certificate Profile [FPKI PROF].
       b) Ensure that CAs that implement the Common Policy Framework [COMMON] are
          able to generate certificates and CRLs meeting the Shared Services Certificate
          and CRL Profile [COMMON PROF].

9. CAs should support the inclusion of “private” extensions in certificates and CRLs.11



10
     This profile is often documented explicitly, but may be implicitly specified through the certificate policy.
11
  Private extensions are defined by an organization to meet their own unique requirements. Note that
noncritical private extensions do not impact the interoperability of certificates or CRLs.
