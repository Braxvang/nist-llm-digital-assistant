ESTABLISHING WIRELESS ROBUST SECURITY NETWORKS: A GUIDE TO IEEE 802.11I



7.2   Wi-Fi Alliance Certification Programs

The Wi-Fi Alliance began conducting interoperability testing in April 2000 and has since awarded its Wi-
Fi CERTIFIED label to over 2,500 WLAN products. Product categories include access points and a wide
variety of clients, including embedded systems, internal and external wireless network interface cards,
Universal Serial Bus (USB) devices, and printers. Table 7-1 reviews the three basic types of
certifications: radio standards, network security, and multimedia content support. Radio standard
certifications involve the electrical engineering aspects of WLAN communications, such as the frequency,
power, and modulation of radio signals and the rules by which STAs contend for available channels. The
certifications for network security, the subject of this guidance document, cover topics such as
authentication and confidentiality services. Multimedia content support refers to quality of service
mechanisms that give priority to streaming audio and video over other data, which helps prevent users
from experiencing irregular, intermittent multimedia content delivery. To address quality of service
interoperability issues, the Wi-Fi Alliance created its Wi-Fi Multimedia (WMM) certification.

                               Table 7-1. Wi-Fi Alliance Certification Programs

          Certification Type            Resulting Certification Label       Underlying Standard
                                                      A                           IEEE 802.11a

                                                     WPA                     IEEE 802.11i (subset)
           Network security
                                                    WPA2                          IEEE 802.11i
      Multimedia content support           Wi-Fi Multimedia (WMM)           IEEE 802.11e (subset)


All Wi-Fi CERTIFIEDTM products must pass interoperability testing with at least one of the radio
standards. Otherwise, there would be no assurance that the products could perform their core function of
WLAN communications. The network security and multimedia content support certifications supplement
the radio standards certification. WPA compliance was initially optional for Wi-Fi CERTIFIEDTM
products, but was subsequently made mandatory. As of March 1, 2006, WPA2 compliance is mandatory;
however, there is a grandfather clause for products that were certified WPA-compliant before that date.
Wi-Fi Multimedia (WMM) compliance is likely to remain optional for the foreseeable future.

The Wi-Fi Alliance also manages a licensing program for Wi-Fi providers called Wi-Fi Zone.
Organizations participating in the program agree to use Wi-Fi CERTIFIEDTM products only and adhere to
certain service standards. Customers that see the Wi-Fi Zone logo at an establishment offering Wi-Fi
services are offered assurance that they can connect securely and reliably to the Internet. The Wi-Fi
Allianceâ€™s Web Page (http://certifications.wi-fi.org/wbcs_certified_products.php) contains a search
engine that allows viewers to search for various types of wireless equipment that conforms to some or all
of its Certification Programs.

7.3   Wi-Fi Alliance Network Security Certifications

WPA and WPA2 are the network security certifications offered by the Wi-Fi Alliance. This section
describes these certifications and highlights their differences. It also explains the different certification
levels available for both WPA and WPA2: Personal, which uses a pre-shared key for authentication; and
Enterprise, which certifies the use of EAP authentication in addition to pre-shared key.
