NIST SP 800-124r2                                                    Guidelines for Managing the Security

the EMM to verify that the device can be provisioned. Once the device is provisioned to the
EMM, the appropriate EMM policies are applied to the mobile device, and if the device
configuration is not automatically updated, the device will need to be configured to meet the
policy requirements. After the provisioning process is complete, the device user has access to
enterprise data (e.g., email, calendar, contacts), and the enterprise is able to monitor the device
and ensure that it is compliant with their enterprise policies.
Devices may be provisioned in-person or remotely. In-person provisioning requires an
administrator to physically have the device to install the EMM certificate and confirm that the
device is properly provisioned. Remote provisioning requires the device user to implement the
provisioning process on their own. The user may not provision the device properly, which may
render the device and enterprise data vulnerable.

5.3.5. Verification Testing
To protect the operational enterprise environment, as well as enterprise and user data, it is
important to verify the device configurations and software installed on mobile devices that
connect with the enterprise. Before deploying an app, software update, or patch throughout the
enterprise, enterprise administrators may run pre-deployment tests to provide insight into how
the change may impact the security or functionality of existing enterprise systems. For
significant software deployments or major updates, administrators may want to first deploy to a
limited group of users to assess the impacts to the production environment.
Allowing mobile devices to access enterprise resources can better enable staff members to
execute the enterprise mission. However, mobile devices also carry security risks for enterprise
systems, data, and users. Verifying that mobile devices and their applications have acceptable
configurations is essential to ensuring that the benefits of mobile access outweigh the security
risks that they present to the enterprise ecosystem.
Mobile device or app-level configurations can significantly impact the security posture of the
enterprise. Thus, permissions for the device or individual apps may be granted depending on
specific configuration settings. Network configurations may include an obligation to authenticate
and use a VPN before permitting connection to an enterprise wireless network. A geofencing
policy may specify that a device operating within a particular geographic region be granted
different permissions than the same device used within a different region. Different users,
devices, or apps may be granted different permissions for accessing enterprise backend services
(e.g., a database holding sensitive information), depending on the app or device configurations.
In many cases, mobile device security features are configured to better protect the enterprise in
addition to the mobile device itself: device data encryption, screen lock timeout, password, and
application firewall requirements are configurable and contribute to the security posture of the
enterprise. Finally, enterprise policy may restrict the apps that may be installed on the device,
require updates to apps or the mobile OS, or limit access to some of the device features in order
to protect enterprise systems or data.

5.3.6. Deployment Testing
Enterprise networks and applications require software updates to improve functionality, patch
vulnerabilities, fix bugs, or enable new hardware deployment. To make sound enterprise
