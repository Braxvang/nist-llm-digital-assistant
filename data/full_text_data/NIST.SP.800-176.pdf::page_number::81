The group is recognized for technical leadership and innovation in the development and execution
of the USGv6 Program that enabled the U.S. Government to meet aggressive OMB milestones for the
adoption of IPv6 technologies. The team developed the critical standards, acquisition profiles, accredi-
tation and testing programs, test suites, procurement guides, security guides, and operational test and
measurement tools necessary to significantly improve the maturity of commercial IPv6 products and to
guide the USG in their acquisition, deployment, and secure use. The NIST USGv6 Program provided a
vital catalyst to the Internet industry and established the USG as a world leader in ensuring the contin-
ued growth and continuity of the Internet.
