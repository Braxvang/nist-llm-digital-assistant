                                                         CONTINGENCY PLANNING GUIDE FOR FEDERAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS



Wireless routers commonly provide password authentication and transmission encryption as standard
features. 41

For organizations considering remote connectivity, several security requirements and guidelines must be
implemented. This includes verification of a user’s identity through electronic authentication, or e-
authentication. E-authentication guidelines provide four basic levels of protection, from minimal identity
verification (Level 1) to cryptographic two-factor authentication keys (Level 4). NIST SP 800-63,
Electronic Authentication Guideline, 42 provides more information on the four levels and implementing e-
authentication into a system. 43

WAN contingency solutions include all of the measures discussed for client/server systems and LANs. In
addition, WAN contingency planning must consider the communications links that connect the disparate
systems. WAN contingency strategies are influenced by the type of data routed on the network. A WAN
that hosts a mission-critical system (see Section 5.4) may require a more robust recovery strategy than a
WAN that connects multiple LANs for simple resource-sharing purposes. Organizations should consider
the following contingency solutions for ensuring WAN availability:

        Redundant communications links. Redundant communications links usually are necessary
         when the network processes critical data. The redundant links could be the same type, such as
         two T-1 connections, or the backup link could provide reduced bandwidth to accommodate only
         critical transmissions in a contingency situation. For example, an Integrated Services Digital
         Network (ISDN) line with a bandwidth of 128Kbps could be used as a contingency
         communications link for a primary T-1 connection. If redundant links are used, the ISCP
         Coordinator should ensure that the links have physical separation and do not follow the same
         path; otherwise, a single incident, such as a cable cut, could disrupt both links.
        Redundant network service providers. If near 100 percent connectivity is required, redundant
         communications links can be provided through multiple NSPs. If this solution is chosen, the
         ISCP Coordinator should ensure that the NSPs do not share common facilities at any point,
         including building entries or demarcations (places where the WAN connection ends within a
         facility).
        Redundant network-connecting devices. Duplicate network-connecting devices, such as
         routers, switches, and firewalls, can create high availability at the LAN interfaces and provide
         redundancy if one device fails. Duplicate devices also provide load balancing in routing traffic.
        Redundancy from NSP or Internet Service Provider (ISP). The ISCP Coordinator should
         consult with the selected NSP or ISP to assess the robustness and reliability within their core
         networks (e.g., redundant network-connecting devices and power protection).

To reduce the effects of a telecommunications disruption through prompt detection, monitoring software
can be installed. The monitoring software issues an alert if a node or connection begins to fail or is not
responding. The monitoring software can facilitate troubleshooting and often provides the administrator
with a warning before users and other nodes notice problems. Many types of monitoring software may be
configured to send an electronic page or email to a designated individual(s) automatically when a system
parameter falls out of its specification range.

   establishing and maintaining a robust security wireless network.
42
   NIST SP 800-63 is supported by OMB M-04-04, E-Authentication Guidance for Federal Agencies (December, 16, 2003),
   which establishes rules and regulations regarding e-authentication in federal systems.
43
   NIST SP 800-53 control IA-2 (Identification and Authentication [Organizational Users]) also provides guidance and reference
   to remote access of systems. Depending on the impact level of the system, certain control enhancements in IA-2 must be
   incorporated as part of remote and WiFi user identification and authentication.
