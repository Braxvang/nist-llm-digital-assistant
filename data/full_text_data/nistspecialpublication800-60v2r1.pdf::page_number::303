dissemination of personal information by federal executive branch agencies. However, the Act's
imprecise language, limited legislative history, and somewhat outdated regulatory guidelines
have rendered it a difficult statute to decipher and apply. Moreover, even after more than twenty-
five years of administrative and judicial analysis, numerous Privacy Act issues remain
unresolved or unexplored. Adding to these interpretational difficulties is the fact that many
Privacy Act cases are unpublished district court decisions.

A primary element of the Privacy Act of 1974 is the “no disclosure without consent” rule: No
agency shall disclose any record which is contained in a system of records by any means of
communication to any person, or to another agency, except pursuant to a written request by, or
with the prior written consent of, the individual to whom the record pertains [subject to 12
exceptions]." 5 U.S.C. § 552a(b).

Note that a "disclosure" can be by any means of communication - written, oral, electronic, or
mechanical. [See OMB Guidelines, 40 Fed. Reg. 28,948, 28,953 (1975).]
Details of the Privacy Act of 1974, together with OMB and judicial interpretations can be found
on the Department of Justice web site, http://www.usdoj.gov/04foia/04_7_1.html.

Subsection (v) of the Privacy Act requires the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to: (1)
"prescribe guidelines and regulations for the use of agencies in implementing" the Act; and (2)
"provide continuing assistance to and oversight of the implementation" of the Act by agencies. 5
U.S.C. § 552a(v). The vast majority of OMB's Privacy Act Guidelines (OMB Guidelines) are
published at 40 Fed. Reg. 28,948-78 (1975). However, these original guidelines have been
supplemented in particular subject areas over the years. 40 Fed. Reg. 56,741-43 (1975) (system
of records definition, routine use and intra-agency disclosures, consent and congressional
inquiries, accounting of disclosures, amendment appeals, rights of parents and legal guardians,
relationship to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)); 48 Fed. Reg. 15,556-60 (1983)
(relationship to Debt Collection Act); 52 Fed. Reg. 12,990-93 (1987) ("call detail" programs); 54
Fed. Reg. 25818-29 (1989) (computer matching); 56 Fed. Reg. 18,599-601 (proposed Apr. 23,
1991) (computer matching); 61 Fed. Reg. 6428, 6435-39 (1996) ("Federal Agency
Responsibilities for Maintaining Records About Individuals").

As a general rule, the OMB Guidelines are entitled to the deference usually accorded the
interpretations of the agency that has been charged with the administration of a statute. Quinn v.
Stone, 978 F.2d 126, 133 (3d Cir. 1992); Baker v. Dep't of the Navy, 814 F.2d 1381, 1383 (9th
Cir. 1987); Perry v. FBI, 759 F.2d 1271, 1276 n.7 (7th Cir. 1985) (citing Bartel v. FAA, 725 F.2d
1403, 1408 n.9 (D.C. Cir. 1984); Albright v. United States, 631 F.2d 915, 919 n.5 (D.C. Cir.
1980)), rev'd en banc on other grounds, 781 F.2d 1294 (7th Cir. 1986); Smiertka v. United States
Dep't of the Treasury, 604 F.2d 698, 703 n.12 (D.C. Cir. 1979); Rogers v. United States Dep't of
Labor, 607 F. Supp. 697, 700 n.2 (N.D. Cal. 1985); Sanchez v. United States, 3 Gov't Disclosure
Serv. (P-H) ¶ 83,116, at 83,709 (S.D. Tex. Sept. 10, 1982); Golliher v. United States Postal
Serv., 3 Gov't Disclosure Serv. (P-H) ¶ 83,114, at 83,703 (N.D. Ohio June 10, 1982); Greene v.
VA, No. C-76-461-S, slip op. at 6-7 (M.D.N.C. July 3, 1978); Daniels v. FCC, No. 77-5011, slip
op. at 8-9 (D.S.D. Mar. 15, 1978); see also Martin v. Office of Special Counsel, 819 F.2d 1181,
1188 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (OMB interpretation is "worthy of our attention and solicitude").
However, a few courts have rejected particular aspects of the OMB Guidelines as inconsistent
