3.2   SSL VPN Functions

Providing secure remote access to a wide variety of users and devices at many locations calls for a diverse
set of SSL VPN services and features. Most SSL VPNs have one or more of the following three core
functions:

 Proxying. A proxy is an intermediary device or program that provides communication and other
  services between a client and server. It has the ability to represent itself as the server to the client,
  and vice versa. A proxy may service requests internally or translate the information and pass it on to
  other servers. Proxying is a core function of an SSL portal VPN. The simplest form of an SSL portal
  VPN involves secure proxying of Web pages. The SSL portal VPN acts as a gateway by mediating
  the traffic between the user and the application. It receives the request from the user, connects to the
  Web server, downloads the information, and sends the information back to the user over the SSL
  connection. The proxy performs encryption or decryption and content inspection on each packet,
  which causes slightly slower performance.
 Application Translation. Application translation converts information from one protocol to
  another. It is often used to convert a legacy or proprietary protocol into a more widely used or
  standard protocol. It is also used to facilitate system integration and communication between
  applications and devices. Application translation uses proxying to interact with both sides of the
  connection with the appropriate protocol. SSL portal VPNs use application translation for
  applications that are not Web-enabled. This allows users to use a Web browser to access applications
  that do not have their own Web interfaces. For example, to provide file server access, an SSL portal
