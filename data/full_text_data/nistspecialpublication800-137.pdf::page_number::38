3.4    ANALYZE DATA AND REPORT FINDINGS
Organizations develop procedures for analyzing and reporting assessment and monitoring results.
This includes the specific staff/roles to receive ISCM reports, the content and format of the
reports, the frequency of reports, and any tools to be used. Also included are requirements for
analyzing and reporting results of controls that are not easily automated. It may be necessary to
collect additional data to supplement or clarify security-related information under analysis or
provided in initial reports. System- and mission/business-level staff receives and provides reports
as required by organizational and mission/business-level policies and procedures.

3.4.1 ANALYZE DATA
Organizations analyze the security-related information resulting from ISCM. It may be necessary
to collect additional data to supplement or clarify security-related information under analysis. The
information to be analyzed is provided to organizational officials in a variety of ways, such as
recurring reports, automated reports, ad hoc reports, data feeds, and database views.

Security-related information resulting from ISCM is analyzed in the context of stated risk
tolerances, the potential impact that vulnerabilities may have on information systems,
mission/business processes, and organization as a whole, and the potential impact of mitigation
options. Even with real-time or near real-time organization-specific and system-specific security-
related information, evolving vulnerability and threat data is always considered during the
analysis. Organizational officials review the analyzed reports to determine whether to conduct
mitigation activities or to transfer, avoid/reject, or accept risk. In some cases, authorizing officials
may determine that accepting some specific risk is preferable to implementing a mitigating
response. The rationale for such determinations may include organizational risk tolerance,
negative impact to mission/business processes, or cost-effectiveness/return on investment of the
implementation. Resolution of risk and the rationale for the decision is recorded in accordance
with organizational policies and procedures.

Primary Roles: Risk Executive (Function), Chief Information Officer, Senior Information
Security Officer; Authorization Officials, Security Control Assessors

Supporting Roles: Information System Owners, Common Control Providers, System Security
Officers

Expected Input: Security-related information, organizational ISCM strategy, organizational risk
tolerance, reporting requirements

Expected Output: Analysis of security status information for all tiers; updated System Security
Plan, Security Assessment Report, and Plan of Action and Milestones; revised organizational risk
management decisions

3.4.2 REPORT ON SECURITY CONTROL ASSESSMENTS
Organizations report on assessments of all implemented security controls for effectiveness in
accordance with organizational requirements. Security-related information from assessments may
be conveyed in templates or spreadsheets or collected and reported in an automated fashion. At
the system level, security-related information from assessments directly supports ongoing
authorization decisions and plans of action and milestones creation and tracking. Some security
controls or elements of security controls, by definition, are security metrics (e.g., SI-4
