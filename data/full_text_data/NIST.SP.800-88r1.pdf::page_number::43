NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1                                                             Guidelines for Media Sanitization


                   Degaussing the media in a storage device typically renders the device unusable.



                           Table A-6: Peripherally Attached Storage Sanitization


   Peripherally Attached Storage

   External Locally Attached Hard Drives This includes, USB, Firewire, etc. (Treat eSATA as ATA
   Hard drive.)

   Clear:          Overwrite media by using organizationally approved and tested overwriting
                   technologies/methods/tools. The Clear pattern should be at least a single pass with a fixed data
                   value, such as all zeros. Multiple passes or more complex values may alternatively be used.

   Purge:          The implementation of External Locally Attached Hard Drives varies sufficiently across models
                   and vendors that the issuance of any specific command to the device may not reasonably and
                   consistently assure the desired sanitization result.
                   When the external drive bay contains an ATA or SCSI hard drive, if the commands can be
                   delivered natively to the device, the device may be sanitized based on the associated media-
                   specific guidance. However, the drive could be configured in a vendor-specific manner that
                   precludes sanitization when removed from the enclosure. Additionally, if sanitization techniques
                   are applied, the hard drive may not work as expected when reinstalled in the enclosure.
                   Refer to the device manufacturer to identify whether the device has a Purge capability that
                   applies media-dependent techniques (such as rewriting, block erasing, Cryptographic Erase,
                   etc.) to ensure that data recovery is infeasible, and that the device does not simply remove the
                   file pointers.

   Destroy:        Shred, Disintegrate, Pulverize, or Incinerate by burning the device in a licensed incinerator.


   Notes:          Verification as described in the Verify Methods subsection must be performed for each technique
                   within Clear and Purge.
                   Some external locally attached hard drives, especially those featuring security or encryption
                   features, may also have hidden storage areas that might not be addressed even when the drive
                   is removed from the enclosure. The device vendor may leverage proprietary commands to
                   interact with the security subsystem. Please refer to the manufacturer to identify whether any
                   reserved areas exist on the media and whether any tools are available to remove or sanitize
                   them, if present.
