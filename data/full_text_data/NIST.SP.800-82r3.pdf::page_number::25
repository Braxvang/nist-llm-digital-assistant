        OT Overview
Operational technology (OT) 3 encompasses a broad range of programmable systems and devices
that interact with the physical environment (or manage devices that interact with the physical
environment). These systems and devices detect or cause a direct change through the monitoring
and/or control of devices, processes, and events. Examples include industrial control systems,
building automation systems, transportation systems, physical access control systems, physical
environment monitoring systems, and physical environment measurement systems.
OT systems consist of combinations of control components (e.g., electrical, mechanical,
hydraulic, pneumatic) that act together to achieve an objective (e.g., manufacturing,
transportation of matter or energy). The part of the system primarily concerned with producing
an output is referred to as the process. The part of the system primarily concerned with
maintaining conformance with specifications is referred to as the controller (or control). The
control components of the system include the specification of the desired output or performance.
The system can be configured in one of three ways:
        •    Open loop: The output is controlled by established settings.
        •    Closed loop: The output affects the input in such a way as to maintain the desired control
             objective.
        •    Manual mode: The system is completely controlled by humans.
This section provides an overview of several types of common OT systems, including
supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA), distributed control systems (DCS),
programmable logic controllers (PLCs), building automation systems (BASs), physical access
control systems (PACSs), and the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Diagrams depict the
network topology, connections, components, and protocols that are typically used for each
system type. These examples only attempt to identify notional topology concepts. Actual
implementations of these types of control systems may be hybrids that blur the lines between
them. Note that the diagrams in this section do not focus on securing OT. Security architecture
and security controls are discussed in Section 5 and Appendix F of this document, respectively.

             Evolution of OT
Much of today’s OT evolved from the insertion of IT capabilities into existing physical systems,
often replacing or supplementing physical control mechanisms. For example, embedded digital
controls replaced analog mechanical controls in rotating machines and engines. Improvements in
cost and performance have encouraged this evolution and resulted in many of today’s “smart”
technologies, such as the smart electric grid, smart transportation, smart buildings, smart
manufacturing, and the Internet of Things. While this increases the connectivity and criticality of
these systems, it also creates a greater need for their adaptability, resilience, safety, and security.
Engineering OT continues to provide new capabilities while maintaining the typical long life
cycles of these systems. The introduction of IT capabilities into physical systems presents
emergent behavior with security implications. Engineering models and analysis are evolving to
address these emergent properties, including safety, security, privacy, and environmental impact
interdependencies.
