2.        Background
Cloud computing has been defined by NIST as a model for enabling convenient, on-demand
network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers,
storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal
management effort or cloud provider interaction [Mel11]. Cloud computing can be considered a
new computing paradigm insofar as it allows the utilization of a computing infrastructure at one
or more levels of abstraction, as an on-demand service made available over the Internet or other
computer network. Because of the implications for greater flexibility and availability at lower
cost, cloud computing is a subject that has been receiving a good deal of attention.

Cloud computing services benefit from economies of scale achieved through versatile use of
resources, specialization, and other practicable efficiencies. However, cloud computing is an
emerging form of distributed computing that is still undergoing evolution and standardization.
The term itself is often used today with a range of meanings and interpretations [Fow09]. Much
of what has been written about cloud computing is definitional, aimed at identifying important
paradigms of deployment and use, and providing a general taxonomy for conceptualizing
important facets of service.

2.1       Deployment Models
Public cloud computing is one of several deployment models that have been defined [Mel11].
Deployment models broadly characterize the management and disposition of computational
resources for delivery of services to consumers, as well as the differentiation between classes of
consumers. A public cloud is one in which the infrastructure and computational resources that it
comprises are made available to the general public over the Internet. It is owned and operated by
a cloud provider delivering cloud services to consumers and, by definition, is external to the
consumers’ organizations. At the other end of the spectrum are private clouds. A private cloud
is one in which the computing environment is operated exclusively for a single organization. It
may be managed by the organization or by a third party, and may be hosted within the
organization’s data center or outside of it. A private cloud has the potential to give the
organization greater control over the infrastructure, computational resources, and cloud
consumers than can a public cloud.

Two other deployment models exist: community and hybrid clouds. A community cloud falls
between public and private clouds with respect to the target set of consumers. It is somewhat
similar to a private cloud, but the infrastructure and computational resources are exclusive to two
or more organizations that have common privacy, security, and regulatory considerations, rather
than a single organization.1 Hybrid clouds are more complex than the other deployment models,
since they involve a composition of two or more clouds (private, community, or public). Each
member remains a unique entity, but is bound to the others through standardized or proprietary
technology that enables application and data portability among them.
