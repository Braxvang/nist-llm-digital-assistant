NIST SP 800-52 REV. 2                                            GUIDELINES FOR TLS IMPLEMENTATIONS


4.4.2.14 Post-handshake Client Authentication

Applies to TLS version 1.3

The client sends the Post-handshake Client Authentication extension (post_handshake_auth) to
indicate that it is willing to respond to client authentication requests after the handshake is
complete. TLS clients that support TLS 1.3 may support this extension.

4.4.3    Discouraged TLS Extensions

The following extensions should not be used:

      1. Client Certificate URL
      2. Early Data Indication

The Raw Public Key extension shall not be supported.

The reasons for discouraging the use of these extensions can be found in Section 3.4.3.

4.5     Server Authentication

The client shall be able to build the certification path for the server certificate presented in the
TLS handshake with at least one of the trust anchors in the client trust store if an appropriate
trust anchor is present in the store. The client may use all or a subset of the following resources
to build the certification path: the local certificate store, certificates received from the server
during the handshake, Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), the resources declared in
the CA Repository field of the Subject Information Access extension in various CA certificates,
and the resources declared in the CA Issuers field of the Authority Information Access extension
in various certificates.

4.5.1    Path Validation

The client shall validate the server certificate in accordance with the certification path validation
rules specified in Section 6 of [19]. The revocation status of each certificate in the certification
path shall be checked using the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) or a certificate
revocation list (CRL). OCSP checking shall be in compliance with [63]. Revocation information
shall be obtained as described in Section 4.2.2.

Not all clients support name constraint checking. Federal agencies should only procure clients
that perform name constraint checking in order to obtain assurance that unauthorized certificates
are properly rejected.

The client shall terminate the TLS connection if path validation fails.

Federal agencies shall only use clients that check that the DNS name or IP address (whichever is
presented in the client TLS request) matches a DNS name or IP address contained in the server
certificate. The client shall terminate the TLS connection if the name check fails.
