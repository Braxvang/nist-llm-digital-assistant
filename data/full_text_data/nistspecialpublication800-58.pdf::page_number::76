                   SRTP streams.

            Because SRTP is defined as an RTP profile it may be used with existing
            multimedia standards. H.323 SRTP support is defined within the H.235 Annex G
            (currently in draft status), for SIP or more precisely SDP enhancements have been
            defined to transport the key management data necessary for SRTP. Thus, the
            combination of SRTP and MIKEY may be used to provide end-to-end encryption
            even between different multimedia signaling standards like H.323 and SIP.


9.3         Key Management for SRTP – MIKEY

            SRTP uses a set of negotiated parameters from which session keys for encryption,
            authentication and integrity protection are derived. MIKEY (Section 4.2.2.2)
            describes a key management scheme that addresses real-time multimedia
            scenarios (e.g. SIP calls and RTSP sessions, streaming, unicast, groups, multicast)
            and is currently being standardized within the IETF’s MSEC group. The focus
            lies on the setup of a security association for secure multimedia sessions including
            key management and update, security policy data, etc., such that requirements in a
            heterogeneous environment are fulfilled. MIKEY also supports the negotiation of
            single and multiple crypto sessions. This is especially useful for the case where
            the key management is applied to SRTP, since here RTP and RTCP may to be
            secured independently. Deployment scenarios for MIKEY comprise peer-to-peer,
            simple one-to-many, and small-size interactive group scenarios.

            MIKEY supports the negotiation of cryptographic keys and security parameters
            (SP) for one or more security protocols. This results in the concept of crypto
            session bundles, which describe a collection of crypto sessions that may have a
            common Traffic Encryption Key (TEK) Generation Key (TGK) and belonging
            session security parameters.

            MIKEY has some important properties:
            o MIKEY can be implemented as an independent software library to be easily
              integrated in a multimedia communication protocol. It offers independency of
              a specific communication protocol (SIP, H.323, etc.)
            o Establishment of key material within a 2-way handshake, therefore best suited
              for real-time multimedia scenarios
            o There are four options for Key Distribution:
                  o Preshared-key
                  o Public-key encryption
                  o Diffie-Hellman key exchange protected by public-key encryption
                  o Diffie-Hellman key exchange protected with preshared-key and
                      keyed hash functions (using an MIKEY extension (DHHMAC))
            o Re-keying Support
            o Multicast Support (one sender)
