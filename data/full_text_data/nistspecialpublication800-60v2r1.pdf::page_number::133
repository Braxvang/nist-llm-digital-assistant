     •   Operational Defense – Linking tactics and strategy by establishing operational
         objectives needed to accomplish the strategic objectives, sequencing events to
         achieve the operational objectives, initiating actions, and applying resources to bring
         about and sustain these events; and
     •   Tactical Defense – The ordered arrangement and maneuver of combat elements in
         relation to each other and to the enemy to achieve combat objectives.

Impacts to information and many information systems associated with defense and national
security missions may affect the security of a broad range of critical infrastructures and key
national assets. Systems that, involve command and control of military forces, weapons
control 29 , involve equipment that is an integral part of a weapon or weapons system, are
critical to the direct fulfillment of military missions or are otherwise employed in strictly
military operations 30 are defined under Public Law as national security systems. National
security information and national security systems are outside the scope of this guideline.
Information assurance responsibilities are delegated to the Department of Defense for
systems that are operated by the Department of Defense, or another entity on behalf of the
Department of Defense 31 . Security objectives and impact levels associated with these
systems are determined by the Department of Defense.

D.2 Homeland Security
Homeland Security involves protecting the nation against terrorist attacks. This includes
analyzing threats and intelligence, guarding borders and airports, protecting critical
infrastructure, and coordinating the response emergencies. The Homeland Security Line of
Business is defined by the President’s Strategy on Homeland Security. Note: Some of the
Critical Mission Areas from the President’s strategy are included in other information classes
and categories.

D.2.1 Border and Transportation Security Information Type

Border and Transportation Security includes facilitating or deterring entry and exit of people,
goods, and conveyances at and between U.S. ports of entry, as well as ensuring the security of
transportation and infrastructure networks, facilities, vehicles, and personnel within the United
States. Border control involves enforcing the laws regulating the admission of foreign-born
persons (i.e., aliens) to the United States. This includes patrolling and monitoring borders and
deportation of illegal aliens. Some border control information is also associated with other
mission information types (e.g., criminal apprehension, and criminal investigation and
surveillance information). In such cases, the impact levels of the associated mission information
may determine impact levels associated with border control information. Some aspects of

29
   Weapons control involves the actions taken to monitor and protect U.S. weaponry, as well as the oversight and
   control of arms in other countries. Weapons Control applies to conventional, biological, chemical, and nuclear
   weaponry.
30
   Military operations involve the activities that take place during base trainings, military conflicts, and
   peacekeeping missions.
