B.3.   Mapping Between Twisted Edwards Curves and Weierstrass Curves
A straightforward method to map points on a twisted Edwards curve to points on a Weierstrass
curve is to convert the curve to Montgomery format first. Use the mapping described in
Appendix B.1 to map points on a twisted Edwards curve to points on a Montgomery curve. Then
use the mapping described in Appendix B.2 to convert points on the Montgomery curve to points
on a Weierstrass curve.

B.4.   4-Isogenous Mapping
The 4-isogeny map between the Montgomery curve Curve448 and the Edwards curve
Edwards448 is given in [RFC_7748] to be

                         (u, v) = ( 2 ,                   )

                        (𝑥𝑥, 𝑦𝑦) = � 4                   ,                                   �.

The curve Edwards448 (Section 3.2.3.2) is 4-isogenous to the curve E448 (Section 3.2.3.3),
where the base point of Edwards448 corresponds to the base point of E448 and where the
identity element (0, 1) and the point (0, −1) of order two of Edwards448 correspond to the
identity element (0, 1) on E448. Every other point (x, y) on Edwards448 corresponds to the point
on E448, where α is the element of GF(p) defined in Section 3.2.2.2:
