                               GUIDE TO PROTECTING THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION (PII)



     nationals whose data resides in mixed systems, which are systems of records with information about
     both U.S. persons and non-U.S. persons.84

     Organizations should consult with legal counsel to determine if they have an additional obligation to
     protect the confidentiality of the personal information relating to foreign nationals, such as the
     Immigration and Nationality Act, which requires the protection of the confidentiality of Visa
     applicant data.85

4. How did the need for guidelines on protecting PII come about? Why is this important?

     With the increased use of computers for the processing and dissemination of data, the protection of
     PII has become more important to maintain public trust and confidence in an organization, to protect
     the reputation of an organization, and to protect against legal liability for an organization. Recently,
     organizations have become more concerned about the risk of legal liability due to the enactment of
     many federal, state, and international privacy laws, as well as the increased opportunities for misuse
     that accompany the increased processing and dissemination of PII.

     In the United States, Federal privacy laws are generally sector-based. For example, the Health
     Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) applies to the health care sector, and
     the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (GLBA) applies to the financial services sector. In contrast,
     many states have enacted their own generally applicable privacy laws, such as breach notification
     laws. Some U.S.-based organizations that conduct business abroad must also comply with
     international privacy laws, which vary greatly from country to country. Organizations are responsible
     for determining which laws apply to them based on sector and jurisdiction.

     For Federal government agencies, the need to protect PII was first established by the Privacy Act of
     1974. It required Federal agencies to protect PII and apply the Fair Information Practices to PII.
     Also, the Privacy Act required agencies to ―establish appropriate administrative, technical, and
     physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of records and to protect against any
     anticipated threats or hazards to their security or integrity which could result in substantial harm,
     embarrassment, inconvenience, or unfairness to any individual on whom information is maintained.‖

     In response to the increased use of computers and the Internet to process government information, the
     E-Government Act of 2002 was enacted to ensure public trust in electronic government services. It
     required Federal agencies to conduct Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) and to maintain privacy
     policies on their web sites. The E-Government Act also directed OMB to issue implementation
     guidance to Federal agencies. In 2003, OMB issued M-03-22 to provide guidance on PIAs and web
     site privacy policies. OMB has continued to provide privacy guidance to Federal agencies on many
     PII protection topics such as remote access to PII, encryption of PII on mobile devices, and breach
     notification (see Appendix G for additional information).

     Additionally, Federal agencies are required to comply with other privacy laws, such as the Children‘s
     Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and HIPAA (only if the agency acts as a health care provider
     or other covered entity as defined by the statute).
