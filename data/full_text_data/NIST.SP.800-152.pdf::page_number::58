SP 800-152                                                     A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


6.4.4 Deactivate a Key
This function transitions a key from an active state to a deactive state (see [SP 800-57 Part 1]
for further information). A cryptographic key is generally given a deactivation date and time
when it is created and distributed. Deactivation may also be based on the number of times a
key has been used to apply cryptographic protection or the amount of data that it has been
used to protect. This period usually has a maximum value, based in part on the impact-levels
of the data that the key is protecting and the threats that could be brought against that key or
the entire FCKMS.

FR:6.24 The CKMS design shall specify, for each key type, how deactivation of the key is
determined (e.g., by crypto period, by number of uses, or by the amount of data).

FR:6.25 The CKMS design shall specify how each key type is deactivated (e.g., manually or
automatically, based on the deactivation date-time, the number of usages, or the amount of
protected data).

FR:6.26 The CKMS design shall specify how the deactivation date-time for each key type
can be changed.

FR:6.27 For each key type, the CKMS design shall specify requirements for advance
notification of the deactivation of the key type, including which CKMS supported roles are
notified, how they are notified, what security services are applied to the notification, and the
time-frames for notification(s).

                            A Federal CKMS shall support deactivating an active
PR:6.25
                            symmetric or private key and notifying relying parties that the
                            key has been deactivated.

6.4.5 Revoke a Key
When a key is to be removed from service, it may be revoked. Key revocation should be used
when the authorized use of a key must be terminated prior to the end of its cryptoperiod. A
cryptographic key should be revoked as soon as feasible after its use is no longer authorized
(e.g., the key has been compromised). Entities that have been, are, or will be using the key
(i.e., relying parties) need to be notified that the key has been revoked. Such notification is
accomplished by sending the notification to all relying parties and/or providing a notification
that can be accessed by the relying parties, when needed. In this publication, revocation
applies to both symmetric and asymmetric keys.

FR:6.28 The CKMS design shall specify when, how, and under what circumstances
revocation is performed and revocation information is made available to the relying parties.

                            A Federal CKMS shall support the revocation of a key and
PR:6.26
                            maintaining the reason for revocation.
                            A Federal CKMS shall provide a notification when a key is
PR:6.27
                            revoked, including the reason for the revocation.
