A STATISTICAL TEST SUITE FOR RANDOM AND PSEUDORANDOM NUMBER GENERATORS FOR CRYPTOGRAPHIC APPLICATIONS




2.15 Random Excursions Variant Test

2.15.1 Test Purpose
The focus of this test is the total number of times that a particular state is visited (i.e., occurs) in a
cumulative sum random walk. The purpose of this test is to detect deviations from the expected number
of visits to various states in the random walk. This test is actually a series of eighteen tests (and
conclusions), one test and conclusion for each of the states: -9, -8, …, -1 and +1, +2, …, +9.


2.15.2 Function Call
RandomExcursionsVariant(n), where:

        n        The length of the bit string; available as a parameter during the function call.

Additional input used by the function, but supplied by the testing code:

        ε        The sequence of bits as generated by the RNG or PRNG being tested; this exists as a
                 global structure at the time of the function call; ε = ε1, ε2, … , εn.

2.15.3 Test Statistic and Reference Distribution
       ξ:     For a given state x, the total number of times that the given state is visited during the
              entire random walk as determined in step 4 of Section 2.15.4.


The reference distribution for the test statistic is the half normal (for large n). (Note: If ξ is distributed as
normal, then |ξ| is distributed as half normal.) If the sequence is random, then the test statistic will be
about 0. If there are too many ones or too many zeroes, then the test statistic will be large.

2.15.4 Test Description
(1)    Form the normalized (-1, +1) sequence X in which the zeros and ones of the input sequence (ε)
       are converted to values of –1 and +1 via X = X1, X2, … , Xn, where Xi = 2εi – 1.

        For example, if ε = 0110110101, then n = 10 and X = -1, 1, 1, -1, 1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1.

(2)     Compute partial sums Si of successively larger subsequences, each starting with x1. Form the set S
        = {Si}.

                 S1 = X1
                 S2 = X1 + X2
                 S3 = X1 + X2 + X3
                 .
                 .
                 S k = X 1 + X 2 + X 3 + . . . + Xk
                 .
                 .
                 Sn = X1 + X2 + X3 + . . . + Xk + . . .+ Xn
