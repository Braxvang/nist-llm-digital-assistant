        improved security, diagnostics, documentation, reliability, and performance. It also is integrated
        with items that were added only later to IKEv1: DHCPv6, NAT traversal, explicit congestion
        notification (ECN), extended sequence numbers (ESN) and extensible authentication protocol
        (EAP). Clarifications to IKEv2 were later published in RFC 4718; RFC 5996 consolidates and
        updates the two IKEv2 RFCs.
     RFC 4307, Cryptographic Algorithms for Use in the Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2).
      This RFC specifies the cryptographic algorithms for IKEv2, simplifying document maintenance.
      Figure 5-5 shows the REQUIRED and RECOMMENDED methods. These are the algorithms that
      IKEv2 uses to protect its own traffic. In addition, IKEv2 has the capability to negotiate the
      algorithms listed in Figure 5-4 for use in ESP and AH.

 RFC 4308, Cryptographic Suites for IPsec. After a long debate about whether individual
  cryptographic algorithms or entire suites should be defined with IKEv2 and IPsec, the decision was to
  use the former but provide specific guidance for the latter. This RFC provides such guidance by
  defining two suites, one oriented towards triply iterated Data Encryption Standard (3DES) and SHA-
  1, a second oriented towards the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in Cipher Block Chaining
  (CBC) Mode. Additional suites (RFC 4869) oriented towards elliptic curves and AES in
  Galois/Counter Mode have emerged more recently.
Work on IPsec standards has continued in several areas, and the following RFCs, categorized by subject,
have been published:
