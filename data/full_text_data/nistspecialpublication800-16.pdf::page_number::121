      INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SECURITY TRAINING MATRIX                              ~ Cell 3.2C
^Training Area: System Life Cycle Security             — Development
 Functional Specialty: Design & Develop

 Definition   —        The system life cycle is a model for building and operating an IT system
                       from its initial inception to its termination and disposal of assets. The
                       model includes six phases: Initiation, Development, Test and Evaluation,
                       Implementation, Operations, and Termination. Life cycle security is the
                       ensemble of processes and procedures which ensures data confidentiality, as
                       needed, as well as data and system integrity, and availability.


                       The development phase is the series of steps followed to ensure that
                       security requirements are considered, resolved, and incorporated as
                       information systems and technologies are developed or changed.

 Behavioral Outcome         —   Individuals responsible for system design, development or
                                modification are able to use baseline FT security requirements to
                                select and install appropriate safeguards.
