repositories, information systems, applications, information technologies, communications links), people, and physical
resources (e.g., buildings, power supplies), which could be affected by threat events. Organizational impacts are
defined and prioritized at Tiers 1 and 2, and communicated to Tier 3 as part of risk framing. At Tier 3, impacts are
associated with information system capabilities (e.g., processing, display, communications, storage, and retrieval) and
resources (e.g., databases, services, components) that could be compromised.
Appendix H provides a set of exemplary tables for use in determining adverse impacts:
• Table H-1 provides a set of exemplary inputs to the impact determination task;
• Table H-2 provides representative examples of adverse impacts to organizations focusing on harm to organizational
  operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation;
• Table H-3 provides an exemplary assessment scale for assessing the impact of threat events; and
• Table H-4 provides a template for summarizing/documenting adverse impacts.
The information produced in Task 2-5 provides adverse impact inputs to the risk tables in Appendix I.



                                   Summary of Key Activities – Task 2-5

       •    Identify impact determination inputs (see Table H-1 as tailored by the organization).
       •    Identify impact determination factors using organization-defined information sources.
       •    Identify adverse impacts and affected assets (see Table H-2, as tailored by the organization);
            create or update Table H-4.
       •    Assess the maximum impact associated with the affected assets (see Table H-3, as tailored
            by the organization); update Table H-4.
       •    Update Column 12 in Table I-5 for adversarial risk; or update Column 10 in Table I-7 for non-
            adversarial risk.




DETERMINE RISK
TASK 2-6: Determine the risk to the organization from threat events of concern considering: (i) the impact
that would result from the events; and (ii) the likelihood of the events occurring.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations assess the risks from threat events as a combination of likelihood and impact.
The level of risk associated with identified threat events represents a determination of the degree to which
organizations are threatened by such events. Organizations make explicit the uncertainty in the risk determinations,
including, for example, organizational assumptions and subjective judgments/decisions. Organizations can order the list
of threat events of concern by the level of risk determined during the risk assessment—with the greatest attention going
to high-risk events. Organizations can further prioritize risks at the same level or with similar scores (see Appendix J).
Each risk corresponds to a specific threat event with a level of impact if that event occurs. In general, the risk level is
typically not higher than the impact level, and likelihood can serve to reduce risk below that impact level. However,
when addressing organization-wide risk management issues with a large number of missions/business functions,
mission/business processes, and supporting information systems, impact as an upper bound on risk may not hold. For
example, when multiple risks materialize, even if each risk is at the moderate level, the set of those moderate-level risks
could aggregate to a higher level of risk for organizations. To address situations where harm occurs multiple times,
organizations can define a threat event as multiple occurrences of harm and an impact level associated with the
cumulative degree of harm. During the execution of Tasks 2-1 through 2-5, organizations capture key information
related to uncertainties in risk assessments. These uncertainties arise from sources such as missing information,
subjective determinations, and assumptions made. The effectiveness of risk assessment results is in part determined by
the ability of decision makers to be able to determine the continued applicability of assumptions made as part of the
assessment. Information related to uncertainty is compiled and presented in a manner that readily supports informed
risk management decisions.
Appendix I provides a set of exemplary tables for use in determining risk:
• Table I-1 provides a set of exemplary inputs to the risk and uncertainty determination task;
• Tables I-2 and I-3 provide exemplary assessment scales for assessing levels of risk;
