739        PIV Data Objects Representation

740              Data Objects Definition
741   A data object is an item of information seen on the card command interface that has a specified
742   name, a description of logical content, a format, and a coding. Each data object has a globally
743   unique name called its object identifier (OID), as defined in ISO/IEC 8824-2:2002 [ISO8824].
744   A data object whose data content is encoded as a BER-TLV data structure, as in ISO/IEC 8825-
745   1:2002 [ISO8825], is called a BER-TLV data object.

746   4.1.1. Data Object Content
747   The content of a data object is the sequence of bytes that are said to be contained in or to be the
748   value of the data object. The number of bytes in this byte sequence is referred to as the length of
749   the data content as well as the size of the data object. The first byte in the sequence is regarded as
750   being at byte position or offset zero in the content of the data object.
751   The data content of a BER-TLV data object MAY consist of other BER-TLV data objects. In
752   this case, the tag of the data object indicates that the data object is a constructed data object. A
753   BER-TLV data object that is not a constructed data object is called a primitive data object.
754   The PIV data objects are BER-TLV objects encoded as per [ISO8825]. However, tag values of
755   the PIV data objectâ€™s inner tag assignments do not conform to BER-TLV requirements 10 due to
756   the need to accommodate legacy tags inherited from [GSC-IS].
757   Before the card is issued, data objects that are created but not used SHALL be set to zero-length
758   value.

759              OIDs and Tags of PIV Card Application Data Objects
760   Table 3 lists the ASN.1 object identifiers and BER-TLV tags of the thirty-six PIV Card
761   Application data objects. For the purpose of constructing PIV Card Application data object
762   names in the CardApplicationURL in the CCC of the PIV Card Application, the NIST RID ('A0
763   00 00 03 08') SHALL be used and the card application type SHALL be set to '00'.

764              Object Identifiers
765   Each of the data objects in the PIV Card Application has been provided with a BER-TLV tag and
766   an ASN.1 OID from the NIST personal identity verification arc. These object identifier
767   assignments are given in Table 3.
768   A data object SHALL be identified on the PIV client-application programming interface using its
769   OID. An object identifier on the PIV client-application programming interface SHALL be a dot-
770   delimited string of the integer components of the OID. For example, the representation of the

         The exception does not apply to the BIT Group template, the Discovery Object, or the Application Property Template (APT) since these objects
      use interindustry tags from ISO/IEC 7816-6.
