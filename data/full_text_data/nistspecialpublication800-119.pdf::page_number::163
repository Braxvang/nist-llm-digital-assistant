  6.9.2   Acquisition / Development Phase

The acquisition and development phase is concerned with taking the requirements gathered during the
initiation phase and developing the IPv6 enterprise architecture. When developing the IPv6 environment,
the current enterprise architecture should be considered. The acquisition/development phase will work
with three different architectures: the ―as is‖ IPv4 based enterprise architecture, the ―to be‖ IPv6, and the
transitional architecture that bridges the ―as is‖ and ―to be‖.

During the development phase, an organization should plan for an IPv6 evaluation pilot. The goals of an
IPv6 pilot are to test IPv6 configuration and design assumptions against existing equipment, test and
evaluate new IPv6 equipment and begin training staff. The pilot is the time to test the IPv6 numbering
plan and other design assumptions. It is easier and less expensive to correct design deficiencies earlier in
the transition lifecycle. As the requirements are evaluated against the existing equipment, inventory gaps
may be discovered. It should be expected that some equipment will not make the transition; either it does
not support IPv6 or does not meet performance expectations. The pilot should be used to evaluate new
equipment and its ability to coexist in the ―to be‖ and transition architectures. The pilot is a great
opportunity to allow technical staff to develop their IPv6 skills. A pilot affords the opportunity to
combine classroom training with a hands-on environment.

IPv4 and IPv6 are different protocols; they behave differently on similarly configured equipment. The
IPv6 pilot should include testing to validate the performance of IPv6 in the environment and to develop
strategies to mitigate any problems. IPv6 generally performs worse on equipment that was designed for
IPv4. This is mainly the result of IPv6 header manipulation in software instead of hardware. Other
factors besides header size can degrade performance, including extension headers, large packet sizes, and
differences in fragmentation characteristics. This performance difference can vary.

The pilot should establish the baseline performance of IPv4 only, IPv6 only, and dual stack equipment
and services. The baseline performance will allow the enterprise architects to understand the different
performance characteristics and to design capacity into the ―to be‖ and transition architectures. When
possible the testing should use production configuration to reduce the variation between the production
and the test environment.

When establishing a baseline for security equipment, performance and coverage measures must be
established. Security equipment evaluates traffic, which introduces latency into the network and reduces
network throughput. IPv6 security equipment tends to have fewer known heuristics available for
identifying potentially suspicious traffic than equivalent IPv4 equipment, which reduces the level of
traffic coverage and potentially increases risk. Testing should be performed after establishing equivalent
levels of coverage between IPv4 and IPv6. All security controls should be tested to include access
control list, firewall rules, and IDPS signatures. The goal should be to design an IPv6 environment that is
as secure as or more secure than the IPv4 environment.
