                        and not written to.

Record                  To write data on a medium, such as a magnetic tape, magnetic disk,
                        or optical disk.

Remanence               Residual information remaining on storage media.

ROM                     See Read-Only Memory.

Sanitize                A process to render access to Target Data on the media infeasible for
                        a given level of effort. Clear, Purge, and Destroy are actions that can
                        be taken to sanitize media.

SANITIZE Command        A command in the ATA and SCSI standards that leverages a
                        firmware-based process to perform a Sanitization action. If a device
                        supports the sanitize command, the device must support at least one
                        of three options: overwrite, block erase (usually for flash memory-
                        based media), or crypto scramble (Cryptographic Erase). These
                        commands typically execute substantially faster than attempting to
                        rewrite through the native read and write interface. The ATA
                        standard clearly identifies that the Sanitization operations must
                        address user data areas, user data areas not currently allocated
                        (including “previously allocated areas and physical sectors that have
                        become inaccessible”), and user data caches. The resulting media
                        contents vary based on the command used. The overwrite command
                        allows the user to specify the data pattern applied to the media, so
                        that pattern (or the inverse of that pattern, if chosen) will be written
                        to the media (although the actual contents of the media may vary due
                        to encoding). The result of the block erase command is vendor
                        unique, but will likely be 0s or 1s. The result of the crypto scramble
                        command is vendor unique, but will likely be cryptographically
                        scrambled data (except for areas that were not encrypted, which are
                        set to the value the vendor defines).

SCSI                    A magnetic media interface specification. Small Computer System
                        Interface.

Secure Erase Command    An overwrite command in the ATA standard (as ‘Security Erase
                        Unit’) that leverages a firmware-based process to overwrite the
                        media. This command typically executes substantially faster than
                        attempting to rewrite through the native read and write interface.
                        There are up to two options, ‘normal erase’ and ‘enhanced erase’.
                        The normal erase, as defined in the standard, is only required to
                        address data in the contents of LBA 0 through the greater of READ
                        NATIVE MAX or READ NATIVE MAX EXT, and replaces the
                        contents with 0s or 1s. The enhanced erase command specifies that,
                        “…all previously written user data shall be overwritten, including
