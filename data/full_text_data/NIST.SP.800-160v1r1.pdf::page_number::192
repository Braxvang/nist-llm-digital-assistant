AQ-3   ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN AN AGREEMENT
       AQ-3.1 Develop and approve an agreement with the supplier that includes security acceptance
              criteria.
       Note: This agreement can range in formality. Appropriate to the level of formality, the
       agreement establishes security requirements, secure development and delivery milestones,
       security verification, security validation, and the security aspects of acceptance conditions,
       process requirements (e.g., configuration management, risk management, and measurement),
       and the handling of data rights and intellectual property. The security aspects of the agreement
       also include the application of all of the above to subcontractors and other supporting
       organizations to the supplier.
       AQ-3.2 Identify necessary security-relevant changes to the agreement.
       AQ-3.3 Evaluate the security impact of changes to the agreement.
       Note: The basis for the agreement change may or may not be security-related. However, there
       may be a security-relevant impact regardless of the basis for the change.
       AQ-3.4 Update the security criteria in the agreement with the supplier, as necessary.
