GUIDE TO INTEGRATING FORENSIC TECHNIQUES INTO INCIDENT RESPONSE



6.4.2.1 Data Source Value

As described in Section 6.2, organizations typically have many different sources of network traffic data.
Because the information collected by these sources varies, the sources may have different value to the
analyst, both in general and for specific cases. The following items describe the typical value of the most
common data sources in network forensics:

    ! IDS Software. IDS data is often the starting point for examining suspicious activity. Not only
      do IDSs typically attempt to identify malicious network traffic at all TCP/IP layers, but also they
      log many data fields (and sometimes raw packets) that can be useful in validating events and
      correlating them with other data sources. Nevertheless, as noted previously, IDS software does
      produce false positives, so IDS alerts should be validated. The extent to which this can be done
      depends on the amount of data recorded related to the alert and the information available to the
      analyst about the signature characteristics or anomaly detection method that triggered the alert.
    ! SEM Software. Ideally, SEM can be extremely useful for forensics because it can automatically
      correlate events among several data sources, then extract the relevant information and present it
      to the user. However, because SEM software functions by bringing in data from many other
      sources, the value of SEM depends on which data sources are fed into it, how reliable each data
      source is, and how well the software can normalize the data and correlate events.
    ! NFAT Software. NFAT software is designed specifically to aid in network traffic analysis, so it
      is valuable if it has monitored an event of interest. NFAT software usually offers features that
      support analysis, such as traffic reconstruction and visualization; Section 6.2.6 describes these in
      more depth.
    ! Firewalls, Routers, Proxy Servers, and Remote Access Servers. By itself, data from these
      sources is usually of little value. Analyzing the data over time can indicate overall trends, such as
      an increase in blocked connection attempts. However, because these sources typically record
      little information about each event, the data provides little insight into the nature of the events.
      Also, many events might be logged each day, so the sheer volume of data can be overwhelming.
      The primary value of the data is to correlate events recorded by other sources. For example, if a
      host is compromised and a network IDS sensor detected the attack, querying the firewall logs for
      events involving the apparent attacking IP address might confirm where the attack entered the
      network and might indicate other hosts that the attacker attempted to compromise. In addition,
      address mapping (e.g., NAT) performed by these devices is important for network forensics
      because the apparent IP address of an attacker or a victim might actually have been used by
      hundreds or thousands of hosts. Fortunately, analysts usually can review the logs to determine
      which internal address was in use.
    ! DHCP Servers. DHCP servers typically can be configured to log each IP address assignment
      and the associated MAC address, along with a timestamp. This information can be helpful to
      analysts in identifying which host performed an activity using a particular IP address. However,
      analysts should be mindful of the possibility that attackers on an organization’s internal networks
      falsified their MAC addresses or IP addresses, a practice known as spoofing.
    ! Packet Sniffers. Of all the network traffic data sources, packet sniffers can collect the most
      information on network activity. However, sniffers might capture huge volumes of benign data
      as well—millions or billions of packets—and typically provide no indication as to which packets
      might contain malicious activity. In most cases, packet sniffers are best used to provide more
      data on events that other devices or software has identified as possibly malicious. Some
      organizations record most or all packets for some period of time so that when an incident occurs,
