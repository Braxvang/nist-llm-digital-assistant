      NIST SP 800-73pt1-5 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification: Part 1
      September 2023                                 PIV Card Application Namespace, Data Model, and Representation

779           Data Types and Their Representation
780   This section describes the data types used in the PIV Client Application Programming Interface
781   (SP 800-73-5, Part 3) and PIV Card Command Interface (SP 800-73-5, Part 2). Unless otherwise
782   indicated, the representation SHALL be the same on both interfaces.
783   The data types are defined in Part 1 rather than in Parts 2 and 3 in order to achieve smart card
784   platform independence from Part 1. Thus, non-government smart card programs can readily
785   adopt the interface specifications in Parts 2 and 3 while customizing Part 1 to their own data
786   model, data types, and namespaces.

787                 Key References
788   A key reference is a 1-byte reference data identifier that specifies a cryptographic key or PIN
789   according to its PIV Key Type. Table 4, Table 5, and SP 800-78, Table 8, define the key
790   reference values that SHALL be used on the PIV interfaces. For example, the key reference
791   values are used in a cryptographic protocol, such as an authentication or a signing protocol. Key
792   references are only assigned to private and secret (symmetric) keys, PINs, PIN Unblocking Keys
793   (PUKs), OCC, and the pairing code. All other PIV Card Application key reference values are
794   reserved for future use.
795   In accordance with FIPS 201, no more than 10 consecutive activation retries for each of the
796   activation methods (i.e., PIN and OCC attempts) SHALL be permitted. Issuers MAY further
797   restrict the maximum retry limit to a lower value, as indicated in Table 4 below.

           The sole use of the pairing code is the establishment of a VCI. Its use over the contact interface serves no purpose.
