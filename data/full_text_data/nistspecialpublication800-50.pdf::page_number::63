NIST Special Publication 800-50



                       This metric can be correlated with the number of security incidents and the number
                       of patched vulnerabilities to determine whether an increase in the number of trained
                       security staff is related to, and facilitates, a reduction in certain types of incidents and
                       open vulnerabilities.

Comments: Questions 1 and 2 are used to gauge the reliability of the information for this metric. Roles
and responsibilities must be defined in policy and procedures, and personnel identified to carry out the
roles. Questions 4 and 5 provide information to help identify any specialized training that personnel need
to complete.

If sufficient training of personnel is not provided, Question 7 helps identify why. If the cause of
insufficient training is known, management can institute corrective actions to remedy this deficiency.
