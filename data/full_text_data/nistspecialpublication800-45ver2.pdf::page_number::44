GUIDELINES ON ELECTRONIC MAIL SECURITY



5.1      Updating and Configuring the Operating System

This section provides an overview of the second, third, and fourth steps in the list above. The combined
result of these steps should be to have reasonable protection for the mail server’s operating system.

5.1.1      Patch and Upgrade Operating System

Once an operating system is installed, applying needed patches or upgrades to correct for known
vulnerabilities is essential. Any operating system has known vulnerabilities that should be corrected
before using it to host a mail server. To adequately detect and correct these vulnerabilities, mail server
administrators should do the following:

 Create and implement a patching process 29
 Identify vulnerabilities and applicable patches 30
 Mitigate vulnerabilities temporarily if needed and if feasible (until patches are available, tested, and
  installed)
 Install permanent fixes (often called patches, hotfixes, service packs, or updates).
Administrators should ensure that mail servers, particularly new ones, are adequately protected during the
patching process. For example, a mail server that is not fully patched or not configured securely could be
compromised by threats if it is publicly accessible while it is being patched. When preparing new mail
servers for deployment, administrators should do either of the following:

 Keep the servers disconnected from networks or connect them only to an isolated “build” network
  until all patches have been transferred to the servers through out-of-band means (e.g., CDs) and
  installed, and the other configuration steps listed in Section 5.1 have been performed.
 Place the servers on a virtual local area network (VLAN) or other network segment that severely
  restricts what actions the hosts on it can perform and what communications can reach the hosts—only
  allowing those events that are necessary for patching and configuring the hosts. Do not transfer the
  hosts to regular network segments until all the configuration steps listed in Section 5.1 have been
  performed.
Administrators should generally not apply patches to mail servers without first testing them on another
identically configured server, because patches can inadvertently cause operational problems. Although
administrators can configure mail servers to download patches automatically, the servers should not be
configured to install them automatically so that they can first be tested.

5.1.2      Remove or Disable Unnecessary Services and Applications

Ideally, a mail server should be on a dedicated, single-purpose host. When configuring the operating
system, disable everything except that which is expressly permitted – that is, disable all services and
applications, enable only those required by the mail server, and then remove the unneeded services and
applications. If possible, install the minimal operating system configuration that is required for the mail

      is available at http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/. A single patch management process can be put into place for both
      operating systems and applications (including mail server and mail client software).
