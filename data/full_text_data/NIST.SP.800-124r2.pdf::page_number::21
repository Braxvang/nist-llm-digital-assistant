3.1.5. Credential Theft Via Phishing
Enterprise employees receive phone calls, emails, text messages, and app-related
messages/notifications to their mobile devices on a daily basis. Sometimes, the authenticity of
emails and texts can be difficult to determine. Attackers often attempt to steal or request an
employee’s user credentials through an email or text message. An employee may be tricked into
believing the message is from a trusted source and provide their credentials or allow an attacker
unauthorized access to their mobile device by clicking a hyperlink within the email or text
message. These are examples of phishing on mobile devices.

3.1.6. Installation of Unauthorized Certificates
Digital certificates are software cryptographic tokens used for authentication and signing
software, among other things. These certificates can be distributed to devices through a variety of
channels, including web browsers, physical connections (e.g., USB cable), and profiles applied
through an EMM policy. Once a certificate is provided to a mobile device’s certificate store, it
can be used for authentication and making trust-based decisions about apps by showing warnings
to users. The presence of a malicious certificate could trick a user’s device into trusting a
phishing site or installing a fake phishing or Trojan application, such as a banking app.

3.1.7. Use of Untrusted Mobile Devices
Many mobile devices – particularly those that are personally owned – are not inherently
trustworthy. For example, jailbreaking or rooting a device bypasses built-in restrictions on
security, OS use, and other functions. Organizations should assume that all mobile devices are
untrusted unless the organization has properly secured them and continuously monitors their
security while the devices are used to access enterprise apps or data. Untrusted devices are the
riskiest mobile devices, often have access to sensitive enterprise information, and are the easiest
to compromise.

3.1.8. Wireless Eavesdropping
Because mobile devices primarily use non-enterprise networks for internet access, organizations
typically have no control over the security of the external communications networks that the
devices access and limited visibility into the wireless traffic that traverses these networks.
Communications media may include wireless systems, such as Bluetooth, WiFi, and cellular
networks. Bluetooth devices are often used to transmit audio information (e.g., voice traffic,
music) as well as notifications and health information from wearable devices [31]. WiFi and
cellular can be used to transmit multiple types of traffic, including voice and data. All of these
network protocols and media are susceptible to eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle (MitM)
attacks that can intercept and modify communications between a device and an enterprise system
[26].
