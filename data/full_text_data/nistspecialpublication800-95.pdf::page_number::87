6.      Secure Implementation Tools and Technologies

When implementing a secure Web service, developers should be aware of how to use the available
development tools, techniques, and languages in a secure manner, in addition to implementing the
security functionality already discussed in this guide. While security functionality is an important aspect
of secure Web services, security functionality can be compromised by poorly implemented software. See
Appendix A for a discussion of some attacks to which Web services are susceptible. The following
sections outline the various developer toolkits, XML parsers, available development languages, and
security testing methodologies that can aid in testing a Web service.

6.1     Web Services Developer Toolkits

When choosing an appropriate Web services developer toolkit, it is important to first determine whether
there are any language requirements of the Web service. Should it be able to interact with a .NET
environment, a Java environment, or natively compiled libraries? In most cases, either a Java or .NET
Web service will be able to meet all of the functional requirements of the system, but there are times
when a Web service written using C or C++ may be necessary. If the language requirement is not an
obstacle, there are further attributes of a Web service development toolkit to consider.

The most important aspect of a Web service development toolkit is its ability to interoperate with Web
services developed using other toolkits. The SOAP and WSDL specifications developed by W3C left
some design choices to individual Web service toolkit developers, making Web services less
interoperable. In particular, by default Java and .NET Web services may not be able to communicate with
one another. To this end, WS-I developed WS-I Basic Profile 1.1, which specifies exactly how the
WSDL and SOAP specifications should be implemented to achieve full interoperability. Toolkits that
support WS-I Basic Profile 1.1 will be able to interoperate with Web services from other toolkits with—at
most—only minor changes to the Web service being developed. 56

Additionally, WS-I is working on WS-I Basic Security Profile 1.0, which will allow Web services to
implement interoperable authentication mechanisms. WS-Security implementations do not always
interoperate well with other Web services, so the WS-I Basic Security Profile will aid in developing
secure interoperable Web services. As this specification has not yet been ratified, few (if any) Web
service toolkits support it. Until the WS-I Basic Security Profile has been released by WS-I, toolkits
should be used that provide support for (or have libraries available for) the WS-Security and SAML
specifications, which are the most commonly used tools for securing and authenticating Web services.

Finally, WS toolkits should ease the burden placed on the Web service developer by providing tools that
will create stubs, the Web service-specific code, that the developer can use without having to delve into
XML or SOAP specifics. Usually, these tools are in the form of a command-line program that will take
either a pre-existing application and develop the WSDL or develop stubs from a pre-existing WSDL.

6.2     XML Parsers

XML parsers are the first portion of a Web service that process input from other Web services. A poorly
designed or poorly configured XML parser can be used to compromise the Web service regardless of how
secure the Web service is. To this end, it is important to use robust and proven XML parsers.

      DoD has created the Federated Development and Certification Environment (FDCE), which provides the policies, processes,
      and infrastructure to allow services to be progressively refined, tested, evaluated, and certified in increasingly rigorous
      situation leading to an operational deployment. Web services certified by FDCE will have some level of assurance that they
      will be fully interoperable with other FDCE-certified Web services. Similar efforts are being proposed by other
      organizations within the commercial and Federal spaces.
