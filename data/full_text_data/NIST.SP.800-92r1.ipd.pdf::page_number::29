767      4. PMG-3.4: Revise the draft plan and policies to address the feedback based on the
768         adjudications. This includes harmonizing changes throughout the documents.
769              o If stakeholder feedback results in significant changes to the draft plan or policies,
770                this play may need to be repeated so that affected stakeholders can provide
771                feedback on the changes.
772              o If stakeholder feedback is not needed, the revised plan and policies should be
773                finalized and communicated to all affected parties.
774   Supporting information for tasks: It may be appropriate to specify future effective dates for
775   certain policy changes, depending on the timeframes for the corresponding items in the draft
776   project plan.
