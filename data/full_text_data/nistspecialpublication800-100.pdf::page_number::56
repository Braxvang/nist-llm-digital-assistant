CHAPTER 6                                                                  Interconnecting Systems


Special Publication (SP) 800-47, Security Guide for Interconnecting Information
Technology Systems, provides detailed guidance on interconnecting information
systems.

6.1 Managing System Interconnections
    All federal agencies must explicitly address the subject of interconnecting
information systems by establishing formal agreements that specify the technical
and security requirements of the interconnection, define the responsibilities of the
participating organizations, and specify the rules governing these interconnections.
In addition to an A-130, Appendix III, requirement to obtain written management
authority before interconnecting information systems, OMB recommends that
agencies use NIST SP 800-47 to ensure compliance for connections to non-agency
systems. 43
    When organizations are properly managing interconnected systems, the added
benefits include greater efficiency, centralized access to data, and greater
functionality. The security controls of each of the interconnected systems should be
evaluated and meet each other’s requirements for implementing security controls
that are appropriate for the particular interconnection. Both organizations should
specify their requirements regarding the security controls to be implemented in
accordance with NIST FIPS 200, Minimum Security Requirements for Federal
Information and Information Systems, and NIST SP 800-53, Recommended Security
Controls for Federal Information Systems.
    Each system involved in interconnection should be governed by an organization’s
AO who has the authority to formally assume responsibility for operating a system at
an acceptable level of risk. NIST SP 800-53 specifically defines an information
systems connections control (specified in Table 6-1) that organizations are required
to implement based on an information system’s security categorization. Since these
categorizations and guidance apply to individual systems, agencies should carefully
weigh the associated risks when systems differing in configuration or security
controls are interconnected.

                Table 6-1. NIST SP 800-53 Information System Connections Control
Identifier         Title                                         Control
CA-3          Information     The organization authorizes all connections from the information system to
              System          other information systems outside of the accreditation boundary and regularly
              Connections     monitors/controls the system interconnections. Appropriate organizational
                              officials approve information system interconnection agreements.

       It is critical that both organizations maintain clear lines of communication to:
       • Ensure that the interconnection is properly maintained and that security
         controls remain effective;
       • Facilitate effective change management activities by making it easy for both
         sides to notify each other about planned system changes that could affect the
         interconnection; and
       • Enable prompt notification by both sides of security incidents and system
         disruptions and facilitate coordinated response, if necessary.
