4.3.10.      Challenges Posed by Linked Data
Data can be linked in many ways. Pseudonyms allow data records from the same individual
to be linked together over time. Family identifers, such as distinctive family names or some
kinds of genetic information, may allow data from parents to be linked with their children.
Device identifers allow data to be linked to physical devices and potentially link together
all data coming from the same device. Data can also be linked to geographical locations.
Data linkage increases the risk of re-identifcation by providing more attributes that can be
used to distinguish the true identity of a data record from others in the population. For ex-
ample, survey responses that are linked together by household are more readily re-identifed
than survey responses that are not linked. Heart rate measurements may not be considered
identifying, but, given a long sequence of tests, each individual in a dataset would have
a unique constellation of heart rate measurements, and the dataset could be susceptible to
being linked with another dataset that contains the same values.35 Geographical location
data can – when linked over time – create individual behavioral time-location patterns that
can be used to classify and single out an individual within unlabeled data, even with a small
number of recorded locations per individual [107, 106].
Dependencies between records may result in record linkages even when there is no explicit
linkage identifer. For example, it may be that an organization has new employees take a
profciency test within seven days of being hired. This information would allow links to be
drawn between an employee dataset that accurately reported an employee’s start date and a
training dataset that accurately reported the date that the test was administered, even if the
sponsoring organization did not intend for the two datasets to be linkable.

4.3.11.      Challenges Posed by Composition
In computer science, the term composition refers to combining multiple functions to create
more complicated ones. One of the defning characteristics of complex systems is that they
have unpredictable behavior, even when they are composed of very simple components. A
challenge of composition is to develop approaches for limiting or eliminating such unpre-
dictable behavior. Typically, this is done by proactively limiting the primitives that can be
composed. De-identifcation is such a primitive that statisticians and data scientists must
carefully control to ensure that the results of de-identifcation efforts can be composed.
Without such controls, the results of composition can become unpredictable.
Specifcally, it is important to understand whether the techniques used for de-identifying
will retain their privacy guarantees when they are subject to composition. For example, if
the same dataset is made available through two different de-identifcation regimes, what
will happen to the privacy guarantees if the two downstream datasets are recombined? One
of the primary advantages of differential privacy is that its operators are composable: if two

35 This is a different approach than characterizing an individual’s heartbeat pattern so that it can be used as a

  biometric. In this case, it is a specifc sequence of heartbeats that is recognized.
