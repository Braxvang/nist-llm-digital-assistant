                                                                                         GUIDE TO SSL VPNS



 Implementation of endpoint security controls varies greatly from one SSL VPN product to another.
  Endpoint security should be evaluated to ensure it provides the necessary host integrity checking and
  security protection mechanisms for the organization.
 Not all SSL VPNs have integrated intrusion prevention capabilities. Those that do should be
  evaluated to ensure they do not introduce an unacceptable amount of latency into the network traffic.
Several of the security services provided by SSL VPNs rely on the underlying SSL protocol. SSL VPNs
may use versions of either SSL or TLS protocols. The choice of which protocol to implement depends on
the data being secured. For example, TLS is approved for use in the protection of Federal information;
SSL versions other than 3.1 are not. The SSL VPN must be configured to ensure that the appropriate
protocol is used. This also applies to the security mechanisms that SSL and TLS use to secure
communications.

Not all SSL VPN products include all of these services, and there are differences in the level of
sophistication of the services that are supported. The main differentiators for SSL VPN products are how
they implement security policies and handle remote clients, and how transparent their usage is to the end
user. The strengths of an SSL VPN include support for a variety of systems and locations, granular
access control, Web browser client access, and ease of use.

SSL VPNs, although a maturing technology, continue to face several challenges. These include
limitations on their ability to support a large number of applications and clients, the methods of
implementing network extension and endpoint security, the ability to provide clientless access, the use of
the SSL VPN from public locations, and product and technology education.
