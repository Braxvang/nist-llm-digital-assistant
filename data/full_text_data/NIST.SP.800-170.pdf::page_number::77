                                                        Inaugural Lynn F. McNulty Information
                                                          Security Leadership Tribute Award

                               National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Fellow Ron Ross has been awarded the
                             inaugural Lynn F. McNulty Tribute U.S. Government Information Security Leadership Award. The (ISC)2
                             U.S. Government Advisory Board for Cyber Security (GABCS) announced the award on October 29,
                             2013, in recognition of Ross’s “key role in establishing cybersecurity requirements for federal agencies
                             for decades.”
    The award was established last year after the death of (ISC)2 Fellow and IT security evangelist Lynn F. McNulty, CISSP. McNulty
  was considered by those in the community as the “pioneer” of government information security. The Tribute Award recognizes a
  member of the U.S. federal information security community who upholds McNulty’s legacy as a visionary and innovator through
  outstanding service and commitment.
    Ross worked with McNulty during the 1990s when McNulty was NIST’s Associate Director of Computer Security.
     “Ron’s insight and leadership in producing a library of guidance publications over the past decade has greatly contributed to the
  advancement of information security in government and around the world,” said Peter Gouldmann, CISSP, director of information
  risk programs, Office of Information Assurance, U.S. Department of State, and member, (ISC) 2 GABCS. “His highly collaborative
  approach, incorporating government and industry, has resulted in products that are being adopted and adapted for use on national
  security systems, transcending the unclassified and classified systems landscape.”
