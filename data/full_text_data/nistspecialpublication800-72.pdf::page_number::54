Generally, two types of computer forensic investigations take place. The first is where some
incident has occurred, but the identity of the offender is unknown (e.g., malicious code attack,
hacking incident, etc.). The second is where the offender and the incident are both known
(e.g., a child-porn investigation). Armed with the knowledge of the circumstances of the
incident, the forensic examiner and analyst can proceed toward accomplishing the following
objectives:

        Gather information about the individual(s) involved {who}.

        Determine the exact nature of the events that occurred {what}.

        Construct a timeline of events {when}.

        Discover what tools or exploits were used {how}.

        Uncover information that explains the motivation for the offense {why}.

Table 5 below provides a cross reference of generic evidence sources found on PDAs and their
likely contribution toward satisfying the above objectives. Most of the source information
comes from PIM data, and Internet related information. Other support applications that run on
the device potentially provide other evidence sources. User files placed on the device for
rendition, viewing, or editing are also another important evidence source. Besides graphic
files, other relevant file content includes spreadsheets, presentation slides, and similar items.
For hybrid devices, such as PDA phones or GPS PDAs, additional evidence sources exist, for
example, the last dialed number or coordinates to some destination.

Knowledge and experience with multiple tools for acquiring and examining the contents of
PDAs is extremely valuable. For instance, one tool may perform better than another in
