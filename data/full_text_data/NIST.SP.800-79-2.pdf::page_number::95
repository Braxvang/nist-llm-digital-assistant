Focus Area         Identifier                             Issuer Control                                Source
                                   (v) Any data change about the cardholder, is recorded by the
                                       issuer in the chain-of-trust, if applicable (review, observe);
                                  (vi) Name changes are performed in accordance with Section
                                       2.9.1.1 of [FIPS 201-2] (review, observe).
                   MP-9         The entire identity proofing, registration, and issuance process is [FIPS 201-2], Section 2.9.1 -
                   (NEW)        repeated if the issuer: (i) does not maintain a chain-of-trust record PIV Card Reissuance
                                for the cardholder or (ii) if the reissuance process was not started Requirements
                                before the old PIV Card expired.

                                Assessment
                                Determine that:
                                  (i) the issuing completes the entire identity proofing,
                                      registration and issuance process if they don’t maintain a
                                      chain of trust or if the reissuance process was not started
                                      before the old PIV Card expired (review, observe).


                   MP-10        Previously collected biometric data is not reused with the new PIV [FIPS 201-2], Section 2.9.1 -
                   (NEW)        Card if the expiration date of the new PIV Card is no later than 12 PIV Card Reissuance
                                years after the date that the biometric data was obtained.          Requirements

                                Assessment
                                Determine that:
                                  (i) the issuing facility ensures that new biometric data is
                                      collected if the new PIV Card’s expiration is 12 years after
                                      the collection of the initial biometric data available with the
                                      issuer (review, observe).


                   MP-11        Post issuance updates (either performed with the issuer in        [FIPS 201-2], Section 2.9.2 -
                   (NEW)        physical custody of the PIV Card or remotely) is performed with   PIV Card Post Issuance
                                issuer security controls equivalent to those applied during PIV   Update Requirements
                                Card reissuance. These include the following: (i) communication
                                between the PIV Card issuer and the PIV Card occurs only over
                                mutually authenticated secure sessions between tested and
                                validated cryptographic modules (one being the PIV Card); (ii)
                                data transmitted between the issuer and PIV Card is encrypted
                                and contain data integrity checks; (iii) the PIV Card Application
                                will communicate with no end point entity other than the PIV Card
                                issuer during the remote post issuance update.

                                Assessment
                                Determine that:
                                  (i) post issuance updates include all required security
                                      controls be implemented by the issuer and the issuer
                                      information systems (review).


                   MP-12        When a PIN reset is performed in-person at the issuing facility,  [FIPS 201-2], Section 2.9.3 -
                   (NEW)        before providing the reset PIV Card back to the cardholder, the   PIV Card Verification Data
                                issuer performs a 1:1 biometric match to ensure that the          Reset
                                cardholder's biometric matches either the stored biometric on the
                                PIV Card or biometric data stored in the chain-of-trust. In cases
                                where a biometric match is not possible, the cardholder provides
                                the PIV Card to be reset and another primary identity source
                                document (as specified in Section 2.7 of [FIPS 201-2]). An
                                attending operator inspects these and compares the cardholder
                                with the facial image retrieved from the enrollment data record
