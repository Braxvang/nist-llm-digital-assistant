NIST SP 800-90A Rev. 1                                         Recommendation for Random Number
                                                                Generation Using Deterministic RBGs


4        Terms and Definitions

Algorithm                 A clearly specified mathematical process for computation; a
                          set of rules that, if followed, will give a prescribed result.
Approved                  FIPS-approved, NIST-Recommended and/or validated by the
                          Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP).
Approved entropy source   An entropy source that has been validated as conforming to
                          [SP 800-90B].

Backtracking Resistance   An RBG provides backtracking resistance relative to time T if
                          it provides assurance that an adversary that has knowledge of
                          the state of the RBG at some time(s) subsequent to time T (but
                          incapable of performing work that matches the claimed
                          security strength of the RBG) would be unable to distinguish
                          between observations of ideal random bitstrings and
                          (previously unseen) bitstrings that are output by the RBG at or
                          prior to time T. In particular, an RBG whose design allows the
                          adversary to "backtrack" from the initially-compromised RBG
                          state(s) to obtain knowledge of prior RBG states and the
                          corresponding outputs (including the RBG state and output at
                          time T) would not provide backtracking resistance relative to
                          time T. (Contrast with prediction resistance.)
Biased                    A value that is chosen from a sample space is said to be biased
                          if one value is more likely to be chosen than another value.
                          Contrast with unbiased.

Bitstring                 A bitstring is an ordered sequence of 0’s and 1’s.
Bitwise Exclusive-Or      An operation on two bitstrings of equal length that combines
                          corresponding bits of each bitstring using an exclusive-or
                          operation.

Block Cipher              A symmetric-key cryptographic algorithm that transforms one
                          block of information at a time using a cryptographic key. For
                          a block cipher algorithm, the length of the input block is the
                          same as the length of the output block.

Consuming Application     The application (including middleware) that uses random
                          numbers or bits obtained from an approved random bit
                          generator.
Cryptographic Key (Key)   A parameter that determines the operation of a cryptographic
                          function, such as:
                             1. The transformation from plaintext to ciphertext and
                                vice versa,
