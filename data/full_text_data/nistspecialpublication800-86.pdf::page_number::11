                                             GUIDE TO INTEGRATING FORENSIC TECHNIQUES INTO INCIDENT RESPONSE



IT professionals throughout an organization, especially incident handlers and other first responders to
incidents, should understand their roles and responsibilities for forensics, receive training and education
on forensicâ€“related policies and procedures, and be prepared to cooperate with and assist others when the
technologies that they are responsible for are part of an incident or other event. IT professionals should
also consult closely with legal counsel both in general preparation for forensics activities, such as
determining which actions IT professionals should and should not perform, and also on an as-needed
basis to discuss specific forensics situations. In addition, management should be responsible for
supporting forensic capabilities, reviewing and approving forensic policy, and approving certain forensic
actions, such as taking mission-critical systems off-line.
