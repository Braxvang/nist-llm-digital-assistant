       Delay is not confined to the endpoints of the system. Each hop along the network
       introduces a new queuing delay and possibly a processing delay if it is a security
       checkpoint (i.e. firewall or encryption/decryption point). Also, larger packets
       tend to cause bandwidth congestion and increased latency. In light of these
       issues, VOIP tends to work best with small packets on a logically abstracted
       network to keep latency at a minimum.

 3.2   Jitter

       Jitter refers to non-uniform packet delays. It is often caused by low bandwidth
       situations in VOIP and can be exceptionally detrimental to the overall QoS.
       Variations in delays can be more detrimental to QoS than the actual delays
       themselves [11]. Jitter can cause packets to arrive and be processed out of
       sequence. RTP, the protocol used to transport voice media, is based on UDP so
       packets out of order are not reassembled at the protocol level. However, RTP
       allows applications to do the reordering using the sequence number and
       timestamp fields. The overhead in reassembling these packets is non-trivial,
       especially when dealing with the tight time constraints of VOIP.

       When jitter is high, packets arrive at their destination in spurts. This situation is
       analogous to uniform road traffic coming to a stoplight. As soon as the stoplight
       turns green (bandwidth opens up), traffic races through in a clump. The general
       prescription to control jitter at VOIP endpoints is the use of a buffer, but such a
       buffer has to release its voice packets at least every 150 ms (usually a lot sooner
       given the transport delay) so the variations in delay must be bounded. The buffer
       implementation issue is compounded by the uncertainty of whether a missing
       packet is simply delayed an anomalously long amount of time, or is actually lost.
       If jitter is particularly erratic, then the system cannot use past delay times as an
       indicator for the status of a missing packet. This leaves the system open to
       implementation specific behavior regarding such a packet.
