NIST SP 800-90A Rev. 1                                           Recommendation for Random Number
                                                                  Generation Using Deterministic RBGs


This Recommendation specifies several DRBG mechanisms, all of which provided acceptable
security when this Recommendation was published. However, in the event that new attacks are
found on a particular class of DRBG mechanisms, a diversity of approved mechanisms will
allow a timely transition to a different class of DRBG mechanism.

Random number generation does not require interoperability between two entities, i.e.,
communicating entities may use different DRBG mechanisms without affecting their ability to
communicate. Therefore, an entity may choose a single, appropriate DRBG mechanism for their
consuming applications; see Appendix C for a discussion of DRBG mechanism selection.

The precise structure, design and development of a random bit generator is outside the scope of
this document.

NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-90B [SP 800-90B] provides guidance on designing and
validating entropy sources. SP 800-90C [SP 800-90C] provides guidance on the construction of
an RBG from a randomness source and an approved DRBG mechanism from this document (i.e.,
SP 800-90A).
