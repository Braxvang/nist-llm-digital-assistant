            Vulnerability                                                 Description
  Data flow controls are not            Data flow controls based on data characteristics are needed to restrict the
  employed                              information that is permitted between systems. These controls can prevent
                                        the exfiltration of information and illegal operations.
  Firewalls are nonexistent or          A lack of properly configured firewalls could permit unnecessary data to
  improperly configured                 pass between networks, such as control and corporate networks, thus
                                        allowing attacks and malware to spread between networks, making
                                        sensitive data susceptible to monitoring/eavesdropping, and providing
                                        individuals with unauthorized access to systems.
  Inadequate firewall and router logs   Without proper and accurate logs, it might be impossible to determine
                                        what caused a security incident to occur.
  Standard, well-documented             Adversaries that can monitor the OT network activity can use a protocol
  communication protocols are used      analyzer or other utilities to decode the data transferred by protocols, such
  in plaintext                          as telnet, File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Hypertext Transfer Protocol
                                        (HTTP), and Network File System (NFS). The use of such protocols also
                                        makes it easier for adversaries to perform attacks against the OT and
                                        manipulate OT network activity.
  Authentication of users, data, or     Many OT protocols have no authentication at any level. Without
  devices is substandard or             authentication, there is the potential to replay, modify, or spoof data or
  nonexistent                           devices, such as sensors and user identities.
  Use of unsecure OT protocols          OT protocols often have few or no security capabilities, such as
                                        authentication and encryption, to protect data from unauthorized access or
                                        tampering. The incorrect implementation of the protocols can also lead to
                                        additional vulnerabilities.
  Lack of integrity checking for        Integrity checks are not built into most OT protocols, so adversaries could
  communications                        manipulate communications undetected. To ensure integrity, the OT can
                                        use lower-layer protocols (e.g., IPsec) that offer data integrity protection
                                        when traversing untrusted physical media.
  Inadequate authentication between     Strong mutual authentication between wireless clients and access points is
  wireless clients and access points    needed to ensure that legitimate OT clients do not connect to a rogue
                                        access point deployed by an adversary and that adversary clients do not
                                        connect to any of the OT wireless networks.
  Inadequate data protection            Sensitive data between wireless clients and access points should be
  between wireless clients and          protected using strong encryption to ensure that adversaries cannot gain
  access points                         unauthorized access to the unencrypted data.
