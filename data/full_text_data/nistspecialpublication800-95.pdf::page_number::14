1.    Introduction

1.1   Authority

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed this document in furtherance of its
statutory responsibilities under the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002,
Public Law 107-347.

NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements, for
providing adequate information security for all agency operations and assets; but such standards and
guidelines shall not apply to national security systems. This guideline is consistent with the requirements
of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Section 8b(3), “Securing Agency
Information Systems,” as analyzed in A-130, Appendix IV: Analysis of Key Sections. Supplemental
information is provided in A-130, Appendix III.

This guideline has been prepared for use by Federal agencies. It may be used by nongovernmental
organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright. Attribution is desired and requested.

Nothing in this document should be taken to contradict standards and guidelines made mandatory and
binding on Federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory authority, nor should these
guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the Secretary of Commerce,
Director of the OMB, or any other Federal official.

1.2   Purpose and Scope

This publication seeks to assist organizations in understanding the challenges in integrating information
security practices into SOA design and development based on Web services. This publication also
provides practical, real-world guidance on current and emerging standards applicable to Web services, as
well as background information on the most common security threats to SOAs based on Web services.
This document presents information that is largely independent of particular hardware platforms,
operating systems, and applications. Supplementary security mechanisms (i.e., perimeter security
appliances) are considered outside the scope of this publication. Interfaces between Web services
components and supplementary controls are noted as such throughout this document on a case-by-case
basis.

1.3   Audience

The document, while technical in nature, provides the background information to help readers understand
the topics that are discussed. The intended audience for this document includes the following:

 System and software architects and engineers trained in designing, implementing, testing, or
  evaluating Web services
 Software developers experienced in XML, C#, Visual Basic for .NET (VB.NET), C, or Java for Web
  services
 Security architects, engineers, analysts, and secure software developers/integrators
 Researchers who are furthering and extending service interfaces and conceptual designs.
This document assumes that readers have some minimal Web services expertise. Because of the
constantly changing nature of Web services threats and vulnerabilities, readers are expected to take
