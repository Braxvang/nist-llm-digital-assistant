Special Publication 800-85B                                  PIV Data Model Testing Specification


Precondition            1.    A valid PIV card is inserted into the contact reader.
                        2.    A valid PC/SC connection exists between the test application and
                              the contact reader.
                        3.    The test application is currently connected to the card application
                              which is accessible through card handle.
                        4.    A PIV authentication key and corresponding certificate are present
                              on the PIV card.
Test Steps              1. Set cardHandle := <<valid card handle>>
                        2. Set OID := <<PIV Authentication Certificate
                           (2.16.840.1.101.3.7.2.1.1)>>
                        3. Call pivGetData w/
                           • (IN) cardHandle
                              • (IN) OID
                              • (OUT) data
                        4. Extract the AuthorityInfoAccess->accessMethod and
                              AuthorityInfoAccess->accessLocation extension fields
                              from the certificate
Expected Result(s)      An accessMethod containing id-ad-ocsp is present. The accessLocation
                        for this AccessMethod is of type uniformResourceIdentifier and that the
                        scheme is “http” (not “https”).


11.1.2.4 Verify interim status extension

Purpose                 Confirms that the piv-interim extension is present in the certificate.
Reference(s)            1.    FIPS201, Appendix D
                        2.    AS07.01.09
Precondition            1.    A valid PIV card is inserted into the contact reader.
                        2.    A valid PC/SC connection exists between the test application and
                              the contact reader.
                        3.    The test application is currently connected to the card application
                              which is accessible through card handle.
                        4.    A PIV authentication key and corresponding certificate are present
                              on the PIV card.
Test Steps              1. Set cardHandle := <<valid card handle>>
                        2. Set OID := <<PIV Authentication Certificate
                           (2.16.840.1.101.3.7.2.1.1)>>
                        3. Call pivGetData w/
                           • (IN) cardHandle
                              • (IN) OID
                              • (OUT) data
                        4. Extract the piv-interim extension in the certificate
Expected Result(s)      The piv-interim extension is present and contains the interim_indicator
                        field which is of type BOOLEAN.
