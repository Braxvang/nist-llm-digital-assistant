                                                                                                        When no function other than cSHAKE is desired, N is set to the empty string.

                                                                                             An implementation of cSHAKE may reasonably support only input strings and output lengths

                                                                                                 This limit is imposed by the integer encoding schemes left_encode and right_encode, defined in Sec. 2.3.1.
                                                                                                 Beyond this limit, the string cannot be encoded. In the remainder of this document, absurdly large limits like
