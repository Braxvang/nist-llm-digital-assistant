Appendix A Security Considerations

A.1 User-Selected Passwords

A password or a passphrase is a secret string of characters that is used to gain access to a
restricted resource. When passwords are used to generate cryptographic keys, it is
assumed that an attacker is able to perform an offline search attack on the key derivation
process using a system of his own choosing, which may be much more powerful than the
system used by the authorized user to generate the key from the password. Moreover,
such attacks are parallelizable. Therefore, the amount of entropy (roughly speaking, the
number of guesses an attacker requires, on average, to determine a password) in the
password is critical.

Randomly-generated passwords generally have much higher entropy than user-chosen
passwords of the same length. However, in many applications, passwords are chosen by
the users, because it is very hard to memorize randomly-generated passwords. For the
security of electronically stored data, passwords should be strong enough so that it is
infeasible for attackers to gain access by guessing the password. The strength of a
password is related to its length and its randomness properties. Passwords shorter than 10
characters are usually considered to be weak. There are many other properties that may
render a password weak. For example, it is not advisable to use sequences of numbers or
sequences of letters as passwords. Easily accessed personal information, such as the
user’s name, phone number, and date of birth, should not be used directly as a password.

Passphrases frequently consist solely of letters, but they make up for their lack of entropy
by being much longer than passwords, typically 20 to 30 characters. Passphrases shorter
than 20 characters are usually considered weak.
