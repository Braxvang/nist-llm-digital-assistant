      NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                                Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
      December 2023                                                                                       and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

882   function identified in the operations plan becoming unavailable, then the DAO SHALL issue a
883   denial of authorization to operate (DATO) (Sec. 2.10.3). However, if the issuer can continue to
884   provide all of the services in the operations plan, then the authorization decision letter SHALL be
885   modified to exclude those issuing facilities that have ceased operations, thus revising the
886   authorization boundary. The required reauthorization activities are at the discretion of the DAO
887   and based on the extent and type of change.

888   2.10.2.                 Interim Authorization to Operate (IATO)
889   An interim authorization is an authorization to operate under specific terms and conditions. An
890   interim authorization to operate (IATO) SHOULD be issued 7 if — after reviewing the results of
891   the assessment phase — the DAO deems the discrepancies to be significant, but there is an
892   overarching necessity to allow the issuer to operate. An IATO is rendered to an issuer when the
893   identified deficiencies are significant but can be addressed and remediated in a timely manner.
894   The deficiencies SHALL be documented so that they can be addressed during the planning of
895   corrective actions. The DAO SHALL indicate exactly which facilities are included in the IATO
896   authorization decision during this interim period, along with any limitations or restrictions. The
897   maximum duration of an IATO is three months, and a maximum of two consecutive IATOs
898   MAY be granted. Failure to correct deficiencies before the expiration of the second IATO
899   SHALL result in an issuance of a DATO for the issuer. The authorization boundary SHOULD be
900   revised to exclude issuing facilities that exhibit significant deficiencies in performing their
901   functions. The IATO is transmitted to the EIMO.
902   An issuer SHALL NOT be considered to be authorized during the period of an IATO. When the
903   deficiencies have been corrected, the IATO SHOULD be replaced with an ATO. Significant
904   changes in the status of an issuer (e.g., addition of new issuing facilities) that occur during the
905   IATO period SHALL be reported immediately to the DAO.

906   2.10.3.                 Denial of Authorization to Operate (DATO)
907   A denial of authorization to operate (DATO) SHALL be transmitted to the EIMO if — after
908   reviewing the results of the assessment phase — the DAO deems operation of the issuer to be
909   unacceptable. Failure to receive an ATO indicates that there are major deficiencies in reliably
910   meeting the requirements of [FIPS201] and its related documents. The issuer is not authorized
911   and SHALL NOT be allowed to operate. If issuance services are currently in operation, all
912   functions SHALL be halted, including all operations at any issuing facility. If an issuer was
913   previously authorized and had issued PIV Cards or derived PIV credentials under an ATO, the
914   EIMO and issuing facility managers SHOULD consider whether a revocation of PIV Cards and
915   derived PIV credentials is necessary. The DAO and the assessor SHOULD work with the EIMO
916   and issuing facility managers to ensure that proactive measures are taken to correct the
917   deficiencies.

          The issuer IATO can be affected by the underlying system authorization status (see Sec. 2.10.4).
