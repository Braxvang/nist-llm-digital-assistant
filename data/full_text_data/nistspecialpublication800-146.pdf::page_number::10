                                                            CLOUD COMPUTING SYNOPSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



Operational Characteristics. Cloud computing favors applications that can be broken up into small
independent parts. Cloud systems generally depend on networking and hence any limitations on
networking, such as data import/export bottlenecks or service disruptions, reduce cloud utility, especially
for applications that are not tolerant of disruptions.

Service Agreements, including Service Level Agreements. Organizations should understand the terms
of the service agreements that define the legal relationships between cloud customers and cloud providers.
An organization should understand customer responsibilities, and those of the service provider, before
using a cloud service.

Security. Organizations should be aware of the security issues that exist in cloud computing and of
applicable NIST publications such as NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53 “Recommended Security
Controls For Federal Information Systems and Organizations.” As complex networked systems, clouds
are affected by traditional computer and network security issues such as the needs to provide data
confidentiality, data integrity, and system availability. By imposing uniform management practices,
clouds may be able to improve on some security update and response issues. Clouds, however, also have
potential to aggregate an unprecedented quantity and variety of customer data in cloud data centers. This
potential vulnerability requires a high degree of confidence and transparency that cloud providers can
keep customer data isolated and protected. Also, cloud users and administrators rely heavily on Web
browsers, so browser security failures can lead to cloud security breaches. The privacy and security of
cloud computing depend primarily on whether the cloud service provider has implemented robust security
controls and a sound privacy policy desired by their customers, the visibility that customers have into its
performance, and how well it is managed.

Inherently, the move to cloud computing is a business decision in which the business case should consider
the relevant factors, some of which include readiness of existing applications for cloud deployment,
transition costs and life-cycle costs, maturity of service orientation in existing infrastructure, and other
factors including security and privacy requirements.
