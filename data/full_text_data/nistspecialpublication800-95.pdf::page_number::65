                                                                              GUIDE TO SECURE WEB SERVICES



3.6     Confidentiality and Integrity of Service to Service Interchanges

Although transport layer security mechanisms are provided through using secure transport protocols such
as SSL/TLS, message layer security of XML is still needed for the following:

 End-to-End Security. Secure transport protocols can assure the security of messages only during
  transmission. Because messages are received and processed by intermediaries, secure end-to-end
  communication is not possible if these intermediaries are not completely trusted.
 Transport Independence. Even if all the communication links are secure and the intermediaries can
  be trusted, security information such as the authenticity of the originator of the message needs to be
  translated to the next secure transport protocol along the message path. This could be tedious and
  complex, which may lead to security breaches. It is important to deal with the security concerns at
  the message layer independently of the transport layers.
 Security of Stored Messages. Once a transmission is received and decrypted, transport layer
  security does not protect data from illicit accesses and alterations. In situations where messages are
  stored and then forwarded, message layer security is necessary.
The following subsections describe technologies that may be leveraged to improve the confidentiality and
integrity of Web services. This includes both session/transport level security (i.e., SSL/TLS) as well as
message-level security, such as that provided through WS-Security (as described below). Integrity can be
enforced to an extent through the use of XML gateways (i.e., XML firewalls), and further explanation of
this notion is provided in Section 3.6.4.

3.6.1    Transport Layer Confidentiality and Integrity: HTTPS

Because Web services rely on HTTP as the transport layer, they can be easily configured to communicate
over HTTP Secure (HTTPS). The HTTPS protocol is defined as HTTP over SSL/TLS. SSL/TLS
provide socket-layer security, encrypting all communication over a particular TCP connection—
immediately granting an insecure application-layer protocol security without altering it. Through
SSL/TLS, HTTPS supports authentication, confidentiality, and integrity of data sent between the
endpoints. Use of HTTPS provides the following:

 Each service only needs to have knowledge of those services it directly communicates with, which
  reduces the certificate distribution problem.
 Each Web service uses the framework’s authentication and authorization mechanism rather than
  implementation-specific code.
3.6.2    XML Confidentiality and Integrity

The XML security standards define a framework and processing rules that can be shared across
applications using common tools, avoiding the need for extensive customization of applications to add
security. The XML security standards reuse the concepts, algorithms and core technologies of legacy
security systems while introducing changes necessary to support extensible integration with XML. This
allows interoperability with a wide range of existing infrastructures and across deployments.

The XML security standards define XML vocabularies and processing rules using established
cryptographic and security technologies, to provide flexible, extensible and practical ways of satisfying
security requirements. The core XML security standards include the following:
