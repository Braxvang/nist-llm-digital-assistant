  Special Publication 800-157                                                      Guidelines for Derived PIV Credentials


  Appendix D—Derived PIV Credentials in Relation to OMB Memoranda (Informative)

  This document provides a spectrum of choices for two-factor remote authentication with a mobile device,
  all of which are subject to OMB guidance on remote electronic authentication.

  Table D-1 summarizes the association of Derived PIV Credentials’ token types with the existing remote
  electronic authentication policies in OMB memoranda M-06-16 [M0616] and M-07-16 [M0716]. Both
  memoranda specify a “Control Remote Access” provision that calls for two-factor authentication where
  one of the two factors is provided by a device that is separate from the device accessing the remote
  resource.

  Increasingly, mobile devices are becoming thinner and/or lighter. These constraints limit external ports
  and force the integration of authentication tokens and security features. As indicated by column 6 in Table
  D-1,15 four of the five tokens with Derived PIV Credentials are integrated. For these tokens, guidance will
  be made available by OMB to provide an alternative to the remote authentication policy in M-06-16 and
  M-07-16. With integrated tokens, authentication factors are not provided by a separate token and sensitive
  government information may be at greater risk of loss. OMB’s alternative guidance intends to also
  address these risks by pointing to NIST guidelines for compensating controls (e.g., SP 800-53, SP 800-
  124, SP 800-164).

  Note: To provide a complete set of options for PIV-enabled remote access with mobile devices, the PIV
  Card as token type has been included.
