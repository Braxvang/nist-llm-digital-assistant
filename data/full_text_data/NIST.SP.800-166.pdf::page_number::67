NIST SP 800-166                                                      DERIVED PIV APPLICATION AND
                                                                     DATA MODEL TEST GUIDELINES

                        3. From Step 3, the command returns status word '6A 86' (incorrect
                           parameter in P1 or P2).

8.3.3.10 Support for Command Chaining

 Test Assertion             TA-08.03.03.10
 Purpose                    Confirms that the Derived PIV Application responds to the
                            GENERAL AUTHENTICATE command and supports command
                            chaining to permit the uninterrupted transmission of long command
                            data fields to the Derived PIV Application.

 Vendor Documentation       The vendor to provide information in its documentation
                            demonstrating compliance to this requirement. The GET
                            RESPONSE command is used to return the complete result of the
                            cryptographic operation. In addition, if a token command other than
                            the GENERAL AUTHENTICATE command is received by the
                            Derived PIV Application before the termination of a GENERAL
                            AUTHENTICATE chain, the Derived PIV Application rolls back
                            to the state it was in immediately prior to the reception of the first
                            command in the interrupted chain.

8.3.4 VERIFY Command

8.3.4.1 Verify with a Valid Key Reference and the Correct Password

 Test Assertion            TA-08.03.04.01
 Purpose                   Verifies that the Derived PIV Application responds to the VERIFY
                           command with a valid key reference and sets the security status
                           appropriately when the correct password is provided.

 Precondition(s)           • A token with the Derived PIV Application is inserted into an
                              appropriate token reader.
                           • Suitable drivers have been loaded between the test system and
                              an instance of the reader.
                           • The Derived PIV Application Password is recorded.
                           • The Derived PIV Application Password’s retry counter is not 0.
