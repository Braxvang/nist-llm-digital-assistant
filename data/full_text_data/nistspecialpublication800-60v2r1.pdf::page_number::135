Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Unauthorized modification or destruction
of information associated with ensuring security of transportation and infrastructure networks,
facilities, vehicles, and personnel within the United States may seriously affect mission
operations or result in the loss of human life. Unauthorized modification or destruction of
information affecting anti-terrorism information may adversely affect mission operations in a
manner that results in unacceptable damage to critical infrastructures and/or key national assets
or loss of key national assets and/or human life. Consequently, the integrity impact level
associated with information that ensures the security of transportation and infrastructure
networks, facilities, vehicles, and personnel within the United States is high.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
border control information is moderate.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to border control information.
Functions and processes supported by most border control information are not time-critical.
Also, disruption of access will have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations
(including mission functions and public confidence in the agency), agency assets, or
individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: There may be time critical cases, for
example, information regarding transport of illegal aliens or information about a physical
threat posed by aliens that border control personnel have been assigned to interdict. In such
cased, the availability impact will be high.

The consequences of disruption of access to information or information systems associated
with ensuring security of transportation and infrastructure networks, facilities, vehicles, and
personnel within the United States may be severe. Also, anti-terrorism missions are not
reliably tolerant of delays. The availability impact level for information systems that ensure
the security of transportation and infrastructure networks, facilities, vehicles, and personnel
within the United States is high.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: Except for such time-critical cases, cases where impact is
driven by information shared with associated missions (e.g., anti-terrorism), the provisional
availability impact level recommended for border control information is normally moderate.

D.2.2 Key Asset and Critical Infrastructure Protection Information Type

Key Asset and Critical Infrastructure Protection involves assessing key asset and critical
infrastructure vulnerabilities and taking direct action to mitigate vulnerabilities, enhance security,
and ensure continuity and necessary redundancy in government operations and personnel. The
Critical Infrastructure Information Protection Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 131-134) places specific
controls on the dissemination of critical infrastructure information (see Volume I, 3.5.2.3).
Under the provisions of Executive Order 13292, some anti-terrorism information is subject to
