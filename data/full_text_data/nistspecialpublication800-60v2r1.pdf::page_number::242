may require a moderate or high integrity impact level for information infrastructure maintenance
information.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
information infrastructure maintenance information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to information infrastructure maintenance
information. Disruption of access to information infrastructure maintenance information or
information systems will typically result in denial of access to resources for all affected agencies.
Typically, disruption of access will have a limited adverse effect on agency operations (including
mission functions and public confidence in the agency), agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Exceptions may include emergency
response aspects of disaster management or other time critical functions (e.g., some systems that
support air traffic control functions). The availability impact level associated with unauthorized
modification or destruction of information infrastructure maintenance information needed to
respond to emergencies or critical to public safety may be high.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
information infrastructure maintenance information is low.

D.23 Federal Financial Assistance
Federal Financial Assistance is the provision of earned and unearned financial or monetary-like
benefits to individuals, groups, or corporations.

D.23.1 Federal Grants (Non-State) Information Type

Federal Grants involve the disbursement of funds by the Federal Government to a non-Federal
entity to help fund projects or activities. This includes the processes associated with grant
administration, including the publication of funds availability notices, development of the grant
application guidance, determination of grantee eligibility, coordination of the peer
review/evaluation process for competitive grants, the transfer of funds, and the
monitoring/oversight as appropriate. The recommended provisional security categorization for
the federal grants information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of federal grants
information on the ability of responsible agencies to disburse funds to non-Federal entities to
fund projects or activities. Typically, unauthorized disclosure of federal grants information will
have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals.
