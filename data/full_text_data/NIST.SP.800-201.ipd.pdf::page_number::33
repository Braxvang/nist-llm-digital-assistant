1019   Appendix B. Glossary
1020   challenge
1021   For this paper, a currently difficult or impossible task that is either unique to cloud computing or exacerbated by it.

1022   cloud computing
1023   A model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing
1024   resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released
1025   with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. This cloud model is composed of five essential
1026   characteristics, three service models, and four deployment models. [16]

1027   cloud consumer
1028   A person or organization that maintains a business relationship with and uses service from cloud providers. [22]

1029   cloud provider
1030   The entity (a person or an organization) responsible for making a service available to interested parties. [22,
1031   adapted]

1032   criminal exploitation
1033   The exploitation of computing resources by criminals. Criminal activities are planned and/or carried out using these
1034   computing resources.

1035   digital forensics
1036   The process used to acquire, preserve, analyze, and report on digital evidence using scientific methods that are
1037   demonstrably reliable, accurate, and repeatable such that it may be used in judicial proceedings. [23, adapted]

1038   flowchart
1039   A diagram that shows step-by-step progression through a process using boxes to show the steps and connecting
1040   arrows between the boxes to show their order.

1041   forensic investigator
1042   A person who is an expert in acquiring, preserving, analyzing, and presenting digital evidence from computers and
1043   other digital media. This evidence may be related to both computer-based and non-cybercrimes, including security
1044   threats, cyber-attacks, and other illegal activities.

1045   forensic readiness
1046   The ability to collect digital evidence effectively and quickly with minimal investigation costs. This involves being
1047   able to define the digital evidence required to reconstruct past computing events of interest.

1048   functional capability
1049   Cloud processes or solutions in the Cloud Security Allianceâ€™s Enterprise Architecture that cover business operations,
1050   IT operations, security and risk management, presentation services, application services, information services, and
1051   infrastructure services. [2, adapted]

1052   incident response
1053   The mitigation of violations of security policies and recommended practices. Addressing and managing the
1054   consequences of a security breach or cyberattack.

1055   mapping
1056   An operation that associates each element of a given set with one or more elements of a second set.

1057   security
1058   Measures and controls that ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information processed and
1059   stored by a computer.
