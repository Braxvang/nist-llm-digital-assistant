Committee (NIST contributors include V.Y. Pillitteri and T.L.
Brewer), “Cybersecurity User’s Guide to the Guidelines
for Smart Grid Cybersecurity (NISTIR 7628 Vol. 1 2010),”
February 26, 2014, 30 pp.
   While the NISTIR 7628 document covers many
   significant cybersecurity topics, this User’s Guide
   is focused primarily on the application of NISTIR
   7628 Volume 1 in the context of an organization’s
   cybersecurity risk management practices. The User’s
   Guide provides an end-to-end implementation
   guide for an organization’s Smart Grid cybersecurity
   activities, and references the Department of Energy
   Electricity Subsector Cybersecurity Risk Management
   Process to provide the cybersecurity risk management
   framework and organizational structure needed
   before system-specific controls identified in NISTIR
   7628 can be applied. The User’s Guide was developed
   with significant involvement by utilities.
