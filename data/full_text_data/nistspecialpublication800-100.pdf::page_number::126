                      For all the importance of security in general and information security in particular, it
                      must support the mission or business function. When thinking about the implications
Strategic/Mission     of any decision, ultimately, decision makers must ask themselves what is best for the
                      organization from a strategic point of view and what best helps the organization meet
                      its mission.
                      Though funding is often at the heart of any business decision, cost is only one of

                      IT services, including management services with technical implications. Throughout
Technical/
                      the life cycle, information security program managers must consider whether their

                      Issues such as damage to an organization’s image and reputation, change in focus
                      on core competencies, and resiliency of the organization, relate to the intangible
                      elements of an organization. In many cases, long-accepted internal controls and
Organizational
                      business practices that have developed over time due to natural business unit
                      divisions or regulatory requirements may have to be reconsidered when an
                      information security service provider is engaged.
                      Issues related to the organization’s contractors and employees. Managers must
                      remain aware of the impact of their decisions on their employees. Depending on the
Personnel             service arrangement implemented, major ramifications could exist for current
                      employees; understanding these potential implications and dealing with them early
                      will ensure the employees remain an important resource for the organization.
                      Effective security starts with strong policy, and implications to policies and process
Policy/Process
                      must be considered to ensure appropriate transitions and implementations.


12.2.3 General Considerations for Information Security Services
    In identifying the service provider that best meets an organization’s needs,
decision makers will need to have many questions answered. Specifically, depending
on the nature of the data the service provider accesses and processes on behalf of
the agency, the service provider may be subject to legislative and regulatory
requirements, including Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) and
NIST standards and guidance, such as SP 800-53, Recommended Security Controls
for Federal Information Systems, SP 800-37, Guide for the Security Certification and
Accreditation of Federal Information Systems, and others. Questions pertaining to
these requirements should become part of the organization’s standard process for
researching and evaluating information security services and service providers. Table
12-4 is a representative sample of such questions, which includes general questions
grouped into the six issue categories.
   These questions are intended as a guide, and each organization will need to
decide which questions are relevant to its specific needs. The questions are not an
exhaustive list, and organizations should develop additional questions. Lastly, the
question may best be answered by the organization, not the service provider.
