information in both paper and electronic form are specified in this layer of policy. The
inputs to the Information Security Policy include, but are not limited to, the Information
Management Policy specifications, the potential threats to the security of the
organization’s information, and the risks involved with the unauthorized disclosure,
modification, and destruction or loss of the information.

The outputs of the Information Security Policy layer include information sensitivity
levels (e.g., low, medium, and high) assigned to various categories of information and
high-level rules for protecting the information. The Information Security Policy may also
be used to create a CKMS Security Policy that specifies the use and protection of
cryptographic keys, algorithms, and mechanisms that provide confidentiality and
integrity protection of the keys and their metadata for the organization.

4.3 CKMS Security Policy
The CKMS Security Policy specifies rules for the protection of keys and metadata that
the CKMS must support. A CKMS Security Policy needs to establish and specify rules
for protecting the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and source authentication of all
cryptographic keys and metadata used by the CKMS. These rules cover the entire key
lifecycle, including when they are operational, stored, and transported. The CKMS
Security Policy may include the selection of all cryptographic mechanisms and
cryptographic protocols that can be used by the CKMS. The CKMS Security Policy
needs to be consistent with the higher-level policies of the organization. For example, if
the Information Security Policy states that the confidentiality of electronically transmitted
information is to be protected for up to 30 years, then the CKMS Security Policy and the
CKMS design must be capable of supporting that policy.

The designer of a CKMS might not be a member of the organization that will be using
the CKMS, and might not have access to the organization’s policies, e.g., the
organization may purchase a CKMS or the services of a CKMS that was developed
external to the organization. The designer of the CKMS should create a set of security
capabilities or features in the design that support the market for which the designer is
creating the CKMS. These capabilities or features should be documented by the designer
and can be considered to form the designer’s initial CKMS Security Policy. The design
documentation should state how and when the features are used to support the CKMS
Security Policy. The organization may work with the designer or the CKMS service
provider to develop a modified CKMS Security Policy, based on the initial CKMS
Security Policy developed by the designer. Ultimately, it is the responsibility of the
organizations that use the CKMS to assure that the CKMS design adequately supports, or
can be configured to support, the (possibly modified) CKMS Security Policy.

The specific protections applied to each key type and its metadata (see Section 6) may be
considered as supporting the Key Security Policy, which would be a part of the CKMS
Security Policy. A Key Security Policy would state the policy for confidentiality,
integrity and source authentication for the key and its metadata over the entire key
lifecycle. These policies would then be supported by the CKMS.
