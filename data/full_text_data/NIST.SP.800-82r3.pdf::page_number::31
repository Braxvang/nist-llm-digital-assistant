SCADA communication topologies vary among implementations. The various topologies used
are shown in Fig. 3, including point-to-point, series, series-star, and multi-drop [AGA12]. Point-
to-point is functionally the simplest type, though it can be expensive because of the individual
channels needed for each connection. In a series configuration, the number of channels used is
reduced, though channel sharing impacts the efficiency and complexity of SCADA operations.
Similarly, the series-star and multi-drop configurationsâ€™ use of one channel per device results in
decreased efficiency and increased system complexity.
The four basic SCADA topologies shown in Fig. 3 can be further augmented by using dedicated
devices to manage communication exchanges and perform message switching and buffering.
