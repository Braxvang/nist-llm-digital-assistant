 Definition   —       The system life cycle is a model for building and operating an IT system
                      from its initial inception to its termination and disposal of assets. The
                      model includes six phases: Initiation, Development, Test and Evaluation,
                      Implementation, Operations, and Termination. Life cycle security is the
                      ensemble of processes and procedures which ensures data confidentiality, as
                      needed, as well as data and system integrity, and availability.


                      The termination phase comprises the series of steps taken to retire a system
                      when it is no longer needed and to securely and properly archive or dispose
                      of its assets.

 Behavioral Outcome        —   Individuals with management responsibilities are able to understand
                               the special IT security considerations and measures required during
                               the shutdown of a system, and effectively plan and direct these
                               activities.
