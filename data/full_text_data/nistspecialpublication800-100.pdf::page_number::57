CHAPTER 6                                                                Interconnecting Systems


     Identifying and implementing security controls is vital in protecting the
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the connected systems and the data that
is transferred between the systems. If security controls are not in place or if they
are configured improperly, the process of establishing the interconnection could
expose the information systems to unauthorized access. Agencies should select
applicable controls from NIST SP 800-53, based on the security categorization of the
systems involved in the interconnection from FIPS 199, Standards for Security
Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems, and NIST SP 800-
60, Guide for Mapping Types of Information and Information Systems to Security
Categories. The security controls should be appropriately selected in consideration
of the systems that will be connected and the environment in which the
interconnection will operate.
    One or both organizations should review the security controls for the
interconnection at least annually or whenever a significant change occurs to either
system or the operational environment. This review is intended to ensure that all
controls are operating properly and still provide the requisite degree of system and
data security. 44

6.2 Life-Cycle Management Approach
    NIST SP 800-47 details a four-phase “life-cycle management” approach for
interconnecting information systems that emphasizes proper attention to information
security:
       • Phase 1: Planning the Interconnection;
       • Phase 2: Establishing the Interconnection;
       • Phase 3: Maintaining the Interconnection; and
       • Phase 4: Disconnecting the Interconnection.

6.2.1 Phase 1: Planning the Interconnection
   The process of connecting two or more information systems begins with a
planning phase, where the participating organizations perform preliminary activities
and examine all relevant technical, security, and administrative issues. The planning
phase ensures that the interconnection will operate as efficiently and securely as
possible. Six steps are recommended for planning a system interconnection. Figure
6-2 illustrates the step-by-step process to plan a system interconnection. A more
detailed process is described in the following paragraphs.
