580   3.1.6. Least Privilege – Privileged Accounts
581           REQUIREMENT: 03.01.06

582           ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE
583           Determine if:
584           A.03.01.06.ODP[01]: personnel or roles to which privileged accounts on the system are to
585           be restricted are defined.
586           A.03.01.06.a: privileged accounts on the system are restricted to <A.03.01.06.ODP[01]:
587           personnel or roles>.
588           A.03.01.06.b: users (or roles) with privileged accounts are required to use non-privileged
589           accounts when accessing nonsecurity functions or nonsecurity information.

591           Examine
592           [SELECT FROM: access control policy and procedures; procedures for least privilege; list of
