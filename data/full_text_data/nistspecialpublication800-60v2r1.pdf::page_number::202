D.15.4 Food and Nutrition Assistance Information Type

Food and Nutrition Assistance involves the development and management of programs that
provide food and nutrition assistance to those members of the public who are unable to provide
for these needs themselves. The recommended provisional categorization of the food and
nutrition assistance information type follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of food and nutrition
assistance information on the ability of responsible agencies to develop and manage of programs
that provide food and nutrition assistance to those members of the public who are unable to
provide for these needs themselves. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of most food
and nutrition assistance information would have a limited adverse effect on agency operations,
agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Exceptions that might have a
potential for more serious consequences are based on privacy information (e.g., information
required by the Privacy Act of 1974 or other statutes and executive orders to receive special
handling to protect the privacy of individuals). The Privacy Act Information provisional impact
levels are documented in the Personal Identity and Authentication information type. This can
result in assignment of a moderate impact level to such information.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact recommended
for food and nutrition assistance information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of food and nutrition assistance
information would have, at most, a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or
individuals. Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external
communications (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect operations and/or public
confidence in the agency, but the damage to the mission would usually be limited.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
food and nutrition assistance information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to food and nutrition assistance
