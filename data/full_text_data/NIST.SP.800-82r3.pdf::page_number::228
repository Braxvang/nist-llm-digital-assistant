E.3.2. Immutable Storage
Immutable storage is a special type of backup storage that provides additional data integrity
through data storage in a read-only format. Immutable storage can be used to store backups of
programs or device configurations. It can also be used as a read-only drive in a maintenance
workstation for added protection against the installation of new software.

E.3.3. File Hashing
The integrity of critical files such as program logic can be validated by using hashes. A hashing
algorithm calculates a fixed-size string from a fileâ€™s contents. If a hash is calculated and stored
for a critical file when it is first created, the integrity of the file can be checked later by
calculating the hash again. For example, if an end user needs to restore functionality to a device
by returning it to a baseline, the integrity of the baseline files can first be validated by
recomputing the file hash. If a different hash is calculated for a target file, the data owner can
assume that the backup files have been compromised. Many data backup software systems
include hashing within their feature set. NIST-approved hash algorithms are specified in FIPS
180-4, Secure Hash Standard [FIPS180], and FIPS 202, SHA-3 Standard [FIPS202].

E.3.4. Digital Signatures
Digital signatures are an additional data integrity measure. They are the electronic analogue of a
written signature and provide assurance that the claimed signatory signed the information and
that the information was not modified following signature. FIPS 186-4, Digital Signature
Standard (DSS) [FIPS186], specifies three NIST-approved digital signature algorithms: DSA,
RSA, and ECDSA.

E.3.5. Block Ciphers
Asset owners can protect the confidentiality of data at rest using block ciphers. Block ciphers are
algorithms that encrypt data in block-sized chunks rather than one bit at a time. This is beneficial
when encrypting large amounts of data at once. NIST-approved block ciphers are the Advanced
Encryption Standard (AES) and Triple Data Encryption Standard (DES). AES is specified in
FIPS 197, Advanced Encryption Standard [FIPS197]. Triple DES is specified in NIST SP 800-
67, Rev. 2, Recommendation for the Triple Data Encryption Algorithm Block Cipher [SP800-
67r2].
