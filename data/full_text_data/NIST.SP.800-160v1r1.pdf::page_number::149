H.9.         Verification
The purpose of the Verification process is to provide objective evidence that a system, system
element, or artifact fulfills its specified requirements and characteristics.

H.9.1. Security Purpose
-       Provide objective evidence that a system, system element, or artifact (e.g., system
        requirements, architecture description, or design description) fulfills its specified security
        requirements and characteristics.
-       Identify security-relevant anomalies 98 in any artifact, implemented system elements, or life
        cycle processes, and provide the necessary information to determine the resolution of such
        anomalies.

H.9.2. Security Outcomes
-       Security-relevant verification constraints that influence requirements, architecture, or design
        are identified.
-       Enabling systems or services for the security aspects of verification are available.
-       Security aspects of the system, system element, or artifact are verified.
-       Security-relevant data that provides information for corrective actions is reported.
-       Objective evidence that the realized system fulfills the security requirements and security
        aspects of the architecture and design is provided.
-       Security aspects of verification results and anomalies are identified.
-       Traceability of the security aspects of the verified system elements is established.

H.9.3. Security Activities and Tasks
VE-1         PREPARE FOR VERIFICATION
             VE-1.1 Identify the security aspects within the verification scope and corresponding security
                    verification actions.
             Note: Scope includes the system, system elements, information items, or artifacts that will be
             verified against applicable requirements, security characteristics, or other security properties.
             Each verification action description includes what will be verified (e.g., actual system, model,

     Anomalies include behaviors and outcomes that are observed but not specified.
