       NIST SP 800-63-4 ipd                                               Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022


2184   transactions, which may require separate analysis within the overall digital identity risk
2185   assessment.

2186   Transport Layer Security (TLS)
2187   An authentication and security protocol widely implemented in browsers and web servers.
2188   TLS is defined by [RFC5246]. TLS is similar to the older SSL protocol, and TLS 1.0 is
2189   effectively SSL version 3.1. NIST SP 800-52, Guidelines for the Selection and Use of
2190   Transport Layer Security (TLS) Implementations [SP800-52], specifies how TLS is to be
2191   used in government applications.

2192   Trust Anchor
2193   A public or symmetric key that is trusted because it is directly built into hardware or
2194   software, or securely provisioned via out-of-band means, rather than because it is vouched
2195   for by another trusted entity (e.g. in a public key certificate). A trust anchor may have
2196   name or policy constraints limiting its scope.

2197   Usability
2198   The extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve specified
2199   goals with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction in a specified context of use.
2200   [ISO/IEC9241-11]

2201   Validation
2202   The process or act of checking and confirming that the evidence and attributes supplied by
2203   an applicant are authentic, accurate and associated with a real-life identity. Specifically,
2204   evidence validation is the process or act of checking that presented evidence is authentic,
2205   current, and issued from an acceptable source; attribute validation is the process or act of
2206   confirming the a set of attributes are accurate and associated with a real-life identity.

2207   Verification
2208   The process or act of confirming that the applicant holds the claimed identity represented
2209   by the validated identity attributes and associated evidence. In NIST SP 800-63, the term
2210   “verification” is synonymous with “identity verification.”

2211   Verifier
2212   An entity that verifies the claimant’s identity by verifying the claimant’s possession and
2213   control of one or more authenticators using an authentication protocol. To do this, the
2214   verifier needs to confirm the binding of the authenticators with the subscriber account and
2215   check that the subscriber account is active.

2216   Verifier Impersonation
2217   See Phishing.
