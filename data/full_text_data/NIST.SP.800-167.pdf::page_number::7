NIST SP 800-167                                                             GUIDE TO APPLICATION W HITELISTING


When evaluating the possibility of deploying application whitelisting, analyze the environment or
environments in which the application whitelisting will be running.

It is more practical to implement whitelisting on hosts that are centrally managed and have a consistent
application workload. Application whitelisting solutions are generally strongly recommended for hosts in
high-risk environments where security outweighs unrestricted functionality. Suitability for typical
managed environments depends on how tightly the hosts are managed and the extent of the risks that they
face. Organizations considering application whitelisting deployment in a typical managed environment
should perform a risk assessment to determine whether the security benefits provided by application
whitelisting outweigh its possible negative impact on operations. Organizations should also be mindful
that they will need dedicated staff managing and maintaining the application whitelisting solution
depending on the scale and specifics of the solution implemented, similar to handling an enterprise
antivirus or intrusion detection solution. An organization that can dedicate the necessary trained staff to
solution maintenance and has built-in application whitelisting technology should generally implement
application whitelisting at least in a monitoring mode.
