3.        DNS Data and DNS Software

The two primary software components of DNS are the name server and the resolver. The primary
functions of the name server are to host the database (called the zone file) containing domain information
and to provide responses to name resolution queries through authoritative responses or referrals. The
primary function of the resolver software is to formulate a name resolution query or series of queries. The
primary DNS data is the zone file (the configuration file is another type of DNS data). Section 3.1
discusses the composition of the zone file, and Sections 3.2 and 3.3 address the functions of various types
of name servers and resolvers, respectively. The discussion of name servers and resolvers is in the
enterprise-level context and may not apply to corresponding entities in the root and TLD levels.

3.1       DNS Zone Data

The zone file contains information about various resources in that zone. The information about each
resource is represented in a record called a Resource Record (RR). Because a zone may contain several
domains and several types of resources within each domain, the format of each RR contains fields for
making this identification. Specifically, the RR consists of the following major fields:

      •    Owner name: the domain name or a resource name

      •    TTL: time to live in seconds

      •    Class: at present only one class, IN (denoting Internet), is used

      •    RRType: type of resource

      •    RData: information about the resource (depends upon RRType)
Some of the common RRTypes are:

      •    A: Address RRType. An RR of this type provides the IP address for a host name (identified using
           a FQDN).

      •    MX: Mail Exchanger RRType. An RR of this type provides the mail server host name for a
           domain.

      •    NS: Name Server RRType. An RR of this type provides a name server host name for a domain.
IETF RFC 1035 provides the complete format of valid RRTypes in DNS [RFC1035]. Because there could
be multiple resources of a given RRType (e.g., several hosts acting as name servers) under the same
owner name and since there is only one class (CLASS) (i.e., IN), the information of interest (e.g., all mail
servers (RRType = MX) in a domain) in a zone file is on a combination of RRs that contain the same
owner name, TTL, class, and RRType. The set of RRs with the same owner name, class, and RRType is
called an RRSet. Hence, logically a zone file is made up of several RRSets.

3.2       Name Servers (DNS Software)

There are two main types of name servers: authoritative name servers and caching name servers. The term
authoritative is with respect to a zone. If a name server is an authoritative source for RRs for a particular
zone (or zones), it is called an authoritative name server for that zone (or zones). An authoritative name
server for a zone provides responses to name resolution queries for resources for that zone, using the RRs
