Appendix B                                             Frequently Asked Questions


   • Operational Services are focused on controls implemented and executed by
     people (as opposed to systems). They often require technical or specialized
     expertise and rely on management activities and technical controls.
   • Technical Services are focused on the security controls an information system
     executes. These services are dependent on the proper function of the system
     for effectiveness.

Q. What is an organizational conflict of interest (OCI)?
A. An OCI may exist when a party to an agreement has a past, present, or future
   interest related to the work performed (or to be performed), which may diminish
   the capacity to provide impartial, technically sound, objective service, or results
   in an unfair competitive advantage. Of course, it is best to avoid organizational
   conflicts before they arise.

Q. What is a service agreement?
A. A service agreement is the agreement between the service provider and the
   organization requesting the service. As service arrangements become more
   complex and employ commercial service providers, the formality of the
   agreement should increase. A fully externalized service arrangement with a
   commercial entity, for example, will require a formal contract so that managers
   can hold service providers accountable for their actions.

Q. Why should security products be used?
A. Security products should be selected and used within the organization’s overall
   program to manage the design, development, and maintenance of its information
   security infrastructure, and to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and
   availability of its mission-critical information.

Q. What important steps should be taken while selecting a security
   product?
A. It is important to perform a cost-benefit analysis when selecting security
   products. As part of the cost-benefit analysis, a life cycle cost (LCC) estimate for
   the status quo and each alternative identified should be developed. In addition to
   LCC estimates, benefits associated with each alternative should be identified and,
   to the extent practicable, quantified in terms of dollar savings or cost avoidance.
   Once the necessary controls are identified, information security products can be
   identified to provide for these controls.

Q. Who should be involved during the security product selection process?
A. Product selection involves numerous people throughout an organization.
   Depending on its needs, an organization may include all of the following
   personnel or a combination of particular positions relevant to information security
   needs: information security program manager, chief information officer, IT
   investment review board (or equivalent), program manager/system owner/data,
   owner/procurement initiator, acquisition personnel, contracting officer,
   contracting officer’s technical representative, or system security officer.
