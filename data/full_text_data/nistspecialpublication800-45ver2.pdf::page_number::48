GUIDELINES ON ELECTRONIC MAIL SECURITY



     authentication mechanisms and devices are used, the organization’s policy should be changed
     accordingly.
As mentioned earlier, attackers using network sniffers can easily capture passwords passed across a
network in clear text. However, passwords are economical and appropriate if properly protected while in
transit. Implement authentication and encryption technologies, such as Secure Sockets Layer
(SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS), Secure Shell (SSH), or Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) (for
remote users), to protect passwords during transmission. Requiring server side authentication to be used
with encryption technologies reduces the likelihood of successful man-in-the-middle attacks.

5.1.4    Configure Resource Controls Appropriately

All commonly used modern server operating systems provide the capability to specify access privileges
individually for files, directories, devices, and other computational resources. By carefully setting access
controls and denying personnel unauthorized access, the mail server administrator can reduce security
breaches. For example, denying read access to files and directories helps to protect confidentiality of
information, and denying unnecessary write (modify) access can help maintain the integrity of
information. Limiting the execution privilege of most system-related tools to authorized system
administrators can prevent users from making configuration changes that could reduce security. It also
can restrict the attacker’s ability to use those tools to attack the system or other systems on the network.

5.1.5    Install and Configure Additional Security Controls

Operating systems often do not include all of the security controls necessary to secure the operating
system, services, and applications adequately. In such cases, administrators need to select, install, and
configure additional software to provide the missing controls. Commonly needed controls include the
following:

 Anti-malware software, such as anti-virus software, anti-spyware software, and rootkit detectors, to
  protect the local operating system from malware and to detect and eradicate any infections that
  occur. 33 Examples of when anti-malware software would be helpful include a mail administrator
  bringing infected media to the mail server and a network service worm contacting the server and
  infecting it. This software is independent of the anti-malware software used to scan the email passing
  through the server. For many mail systems, anti-virus software is the only form of anti-malware
  software needed to protect the OS.
 Host-based intrusion detection and prevention software, to detect attacks performed against the mail
  servers. Section 7.2.2 contains additional information on host-based intrusion detection and
  prevention software.
 Host-based firewalls, to protect the server from unauthorized access. 34
 Patch management software, to ensure that vulnerabilities are addressed promptly. Patch
  management software can be used just to apply patches, or also to identify new vulnerabilities in the
  mail server’s operating systems, services, and applications.
