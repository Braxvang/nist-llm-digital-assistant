                                                   GUIDE TO INTRUSION DETECTION AND PREVENTION SYSTEMS (IDPS)



 Processes for dealing with specific policy violations. It is helpful to have a clear idea of what the
  organization wishes to do when an IDPS detects that a policy has been violated. If the organization
  does not intend to react to such violations, it may not make sense to configure the IDPS to detect
  them. If the organization wishes to respond to such violations, it may be necessary to select an IDPS
  product that can detect them, and perhaps also perform automated responses to stop them.
9.1.4   External Requirements

Evaluators should understand if the organization is subject to oversight or review by another organization,
or if it is likely that the organization will be subject to an additional form of oversight in the near term. If
either is true, the evaluators should determine if that oversight authority requires IDPSs or other specific
security resources. Examples of external requirements are as follows:

 Security-specific requirements levied by law. For example, there may be legal requirements to
  protect personally identifiable information (such as earnings information or medical records) stored
  on the systems. There could also be legal requirements for investigation of security violations that
  divulge or endanger that information.
 Audit requirements for security best practices or due diligence. The audit requirements may
  specify functions that the IDPS must provide or support. Some IDPSs offer features to meet special
  needs of certain industries or market niches, such as reports designed to meet legislative requirements
  for health care or financial institutions.
 System accreditation requirements. If the organization’s systems are subject to accreditation, the
  evaluators should identify and consider the accreditation authority’s requirements for IDPS or other
  security protection.
 Requirements for law enforcement investigation and resolution of security incidents. They may
  impose additional requirements on IDPS functions, especially those having to do with collection and
  protection of IDPS logs as evidence.
 Requirements to purchase products previously evaluated through an independent process. For
  example, an organization might be required to or prefer to purchase products that hold a certain rating
  from an evaluating body.
 Cryptography requirements. For example, Federal agencies are required to purchase products that
  use FIPS-approved encryption algorithms to protect network communications and storage of sensitive
  data. Also, if any of the IDPS components will be deployed in other countries, evaluators should
  consider any restrictions or limitations that might affect the deployment or use of cryptographic
  components incorporated in the IDPS.
9.1.5   Resource Constraints

IDPSs can protect the systems of an organization, but at a price. It makes little sense to incur additional
expense for IDPS features if the organization does not have sufficient systems or personnel to use them.
Evaluators should consider the following:

 The budget for acquisition and life cycle support of IDPS hardware, software, and
  infrastructure. The total cost of ownership of IDPSs well exceeds acquisition costs. Other costs
  may be associated with acquiring systems on which to run software components, deploying additional
  networks, providing sufficient storage for IDPS data, obtaining specialized assistance in installing and
  configuring the system, and training personnel. See Section 9.5 for additional information on life
  cycle costs.
