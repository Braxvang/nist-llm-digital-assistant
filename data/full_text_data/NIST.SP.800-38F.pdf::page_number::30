B.1    Technical Differences With Earlier Specifications of Key-Wrap Algorithms
Two features that are unique to this Recommendation are: 1) the maximum plaintext lengths for
KW and TKW in Sec 5.3.1, and 2) the explicit option for implementation-specific subsets of
valid lengths for KW, KWP, and TKW in Sec. 5.3.2. In particular, KW-AE, KWP-AE, and
TKW-AE are undefined on plaintexts of invalid length, while KW-AD, KWP-AD, and TKW-
AD check whether the length of the purported ciphertext is valid.

This Recommendation also differs slightly in its support of underlying block ciphers. The AES
Key Wrap, both in the original “AES Key Wrap Specification” that was posted on NIST’s
Computer Security Resource Center web site and also in [11], is defined only for the AES block
cipher; however, KW and KWP will also support any 128-bit block cipher that is approved in the
future. The “Key Wrap” algorithm in [1] supports a wider choice of block ciphers, encompassing
a variant that is equivalent to TKW, but also allowing TDEA with key lengths that are not
supported in TKW.

Otherwise, the specification of KW in this Recommendation is equivalent to the original “AES
Key Wrap Specification” and to the specification in [11], and almost equivalent to the “Key
Wrap” specification in [1]. The specification in [1] supports the appending of random padding
bits to plaintexts that are not semiblock strings, when the length of plaintext is fixed. This
amounts to a reversible padding scheme that is different than the padding scheme defined in [4]
and later adopted for KWP.

In [2], an analogue of KWP and an analogue of TKW are defined. The wrapping and unwrapping
functions for these analogues are equivalent to W, W-1, TW, and TW-1, but the formatting of the
plaintext is different, so implementations of the key-wrap algorithms in [2] cannot be compliant
with this Recommendation.

B.2    Comparison of Functionality with Other Authentication Methods
The authentication assurance that KW-AD, KWP-AD, and TKW-AD each provide is described
in Appendix A.3 above; that assurance is similar to the authentication assurance that other
methods provide via the verification of an authentication tag, i.e., a digital signature or a message
authentication code (MAC). Therefore, a digital signature or a MAC is not necessary to
authenticate the data that is protected by a key-wrap algorithm.

However, other authentication methods differ from KW, KWP, and TKW in at least three
properties: 1) Digital signatures provide non-repudiation. 2) Many authenticated-encryption
algorithms, including the Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) [6] and the Counter with Cipher Block
Chaining Mode (CCM) [5], provide an efficient means of authenticating associated data that is
not confidential, such as the routing information in a networking protocol, or the description of
the usage of the protected key. 3) Digital signatures on ciphertexts or MACs on ciphertexts can
