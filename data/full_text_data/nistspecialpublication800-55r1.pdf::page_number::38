through development and use of performance measures. This approach assumes that
organizations have multiple strategic goals, and that a single goal may require inputs from
multiple measures.

5.5.1   Measures Development Approach

Depending on the scope of the measurement effort, development of information security
measures should focus on gauging the security performance of a specific security control, a
group of security controls, or a security program. Such an approach will result in measures that
help determine where a given organization stands in support of the corresponding strategic
objective—and, when multiple controls or the entire program are being measured, provide a
broad view of information security performance.

Measures corresponding to security control families or individual security controls should:

   •    Be mapped directly to the individual security control(s);
   •    Use data describing the security control’s implementation to generate required measures
        such as POA&M, testing, and project tracking; and
   •    Characterize the measure as applicable to low, moderate, or high information system
        categorization.

Measures dealing with overall information security program performance should:

   •    Be mapped to information security goals and objectives that may encompass performance
        of information security across the spectrum of security controls; and
   •    Use the data describing the information security program performance to generate
        required measures.

5.5.2   Measures Prioritization and Selection

The universe of possible measures, based on existing policies and procedures, will be quite large.
Measures must be prioritized to ensure that the set selected for initial implementation has the
following qualities:
   •    Facilitates improvement of high-priority security
        control implementation as defined using a risk-based
                                                                    Organizations manage what
        approach. “High priority” may be defined by the
                                                                    they measure. It is important
