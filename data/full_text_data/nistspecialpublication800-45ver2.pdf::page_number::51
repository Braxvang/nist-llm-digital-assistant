                                                                      GUIDELINES ON ELECTRONIC MAIL SECURITY



6.      Securing Mail Servers and Content

Hardening mail server applications is an important step in protecting mail servers from compromise. This
section provides recommendations for securely installing mail servers and configuring operating system
and mail server access controls. Another important part of mail security is protecting the email content
that traverses the server, which includes content filtering, malware scanning, and spam prevention.
Securing access to mailboxes by encrypting communications, including Web-based mail access, is also
addressed in this section. Email content security can also involve email encryption to preserve
confidentiality and digital signatures to support integrity and non-repudiation; these are discussed in
Section 3.

6.1     Hardening the Mail Server Application

After ensuring that the mail serverâ€™s operating system is secured properly, the next step is to install the
mail server application and secure it from likely threats. The subsections that follow provide an overview
of these two actions.

6.1.1    Securely Installing the Mail Server

In many respects, the secure installation and configuration of the mail server application mirrors the
operating system process discussed in Section 5. The overarching principle, as before, is to install only
the services required for the mail server and to eliminate any known vulnerabilities through patches or
upgrades. Any unnecessary applications, services, or scripts that are installed should be removed
immediately once the installation process is complete. During the installation of the mail server, the
following steps should be performed:

 Install the mail server software on a dedicated host
 Apply any patches or upgrades to correct for known vulnerabilities
 Create a dedicated physical disk or logical partition (separate from operating system and mail server
  application) for mailboxes, or host the mailboxes on a separate server
 Remove or disable all services installed by the mail server application but not required (e.g., Web-
  based mail, FTP, remote administration)
 Remove or disable all unneeded default login accounts created by the mail server installation
 Remove all manufacturer documentation from the server
 Remove any example or test files from the server
 Apply appropriate security template or hardening script to the server
 Reconfigure SMTP, POP, and IMAP service banners (and others as required) NOT to report mail
  server and operating system type and version (this may not be possible with all mail servers)
 Disable dangerous or unnecessary mail commands (e.g., VRFY and EXPN).
6.1.2    Configuring Operating System and Mail Server Access Controls

Most mail server host operating systems provide the capability to specify access privileges individually
for files, devices, and other computational resources on that host. Any information that the mail server
can access using these controls can potentially be distributed to all users accessing the mail server. The
