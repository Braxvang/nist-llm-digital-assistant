NIST SP 800-82r3                                               Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

Rationale for adding PE-22 to MOD and HIGH baselines: OT is unique in that it may look like
an IT component but perform a very different function. Visible differentiation between
components that perform different functions can help reduce reliability incidents due to
maintenance errors.
