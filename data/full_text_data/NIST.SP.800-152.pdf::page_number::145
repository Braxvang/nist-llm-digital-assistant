SP 800-152                                               A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


Relying party             In this Recommendation, a party that relies on the security and
                          authenticity of a key or key pair for applying cryptographic
                          protection and removing or verifying the protection that has
                          been applied. This includes parties relying on the public key
                          in a public key certificate and parties that share a symmetric
                          key.
Role-based                A process that provides assurance of an entityâ€™s role by means
authentication            of an authentication mechanism that verifies the role of the
                          entity. Contrast with identity-based authentication

Scalability testing       Testing the ability of a system to handle an increasing amount
                          of work correctly.
Secret key                A cryptographic key used by a secret-key (symmetric)
                          cryptographic algorithm and that is not made public.
Security assessment       An evaluation of the security provided by a system, device or
                          process.
Security strength         A number associated with the expected amount of work (that
                          is, the base 2 logarithm of the number of operations) to
                          cryptanalyze a cryptographic algorithm or system.
Security testing          Testing that attempts to verify that an implementation protects
                          data and maintains functionality as intended.
Self testing              Testing within a system, device or process during normal
                          operation to detect misbehavior.
Semantics                 The intended meaning of acceptable sentences of a language.
Sentences, formal         The entire set of sentences that can be created or recognized
                          as being valid using the formal syntax specifications of a
                          formal language.
Service Level             A service contract between an FCKMS service provider and
Agreement (SLA)           an FCKMS service-using organization that defines the level of
                          service to be provided, such as the time to recover from an
                          operational failure or a system compromise.
Source authentication     A process that provides assurance of the source of
                          information.
Store a key or metadata   Placing a key and/or metadata in storage outside of a
                          cryptographic module without retaining the original copy in
                          the cryptographic module.
Support                   To be capable of providing a service or perform a function
                          that is required or desired; to agree with a policy or position;
                          to fulfill requirements.
