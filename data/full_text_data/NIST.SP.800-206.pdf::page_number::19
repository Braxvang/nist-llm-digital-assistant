     IMPERATIVE 3 – Strengthening Cryptographic Standards And Validation




            CRYPTO STANDARD = HUGE $$ IMPACT
            In FY18, NIST released a study19 that estimated a $250 billion economic impact
            from the development of its Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) from 1996-
            2017. AES is a cryptographic algorithm20 to encrypt and decrypt electronic
            information. It was approved for use by the Federal Government in November
            2001 and has since been widely adopted by private industry. Today, AES protects
            everything from classified data and bank transactions to online shopping and
            social media apps. According to the study, NIST’s investment in AES has been
            repaid many times over—the study’s most conservative estimate shows a 29 to 1
            benefit-to-cost ratio for the AES program. The estimated benefit-to-cost ratio for
            the whole economy was 1,976 to 1. The report relied on a survey of government
            and private sector consumers of encryption systems and private integrators who
            develop and produce encryption hardware or software.
            In 1997, NIST launched its effort to identify a new standard encryption algorithm
            for the Federal Government after recognizing that the Data Encryption Standard
            (DES), adopted 20 years earlier, was growing vulnerable in the face of advances
            in cryptanalysis and the exponential growth in computing power. In October
            2000, following a three year, open international competition, NIST announced
            its proposal for the replacement standard: an algorithm submitted by two
            cryptographers from Belgium. The unclassified, publicly disclosed encryption
            algorithm is available royalty-free and is used by the U.S. Federal Government
            in its Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) and voluntarily by private
            organizations worldwide.
