an adversarial perspective, and normally identifies and exploits the most rudimentary vulnerabilities to
gain network access. If an organization’s goal is to mirror a specific adversary, this type of testing
requires special considerations—such as acquiring and modeling threat data. The resulting scenarios
provide an overall strategic view of the potential methods of exploit, risk, and impact of an intrusion.
Covert testing usually has defined boundaries, such as stopping testing when a certain level of access is
achieved or a certain type of damage is achievable as a next step in testing. Having such boundaries
prevents damage while still showing that the damage could occur.

Besides failing to identify many vulnerabilities, covert testing is often time-consuming and costly due to
its stealth requirements. To operate in a stealth environment, a test team will have to slow its scans and
other actions to stay “under the radar” of the target organization’s security staff. When testing is
performed in-house, training must also be considered in terms of time and budget. In addition, an
organization may have staff trained to perform regular activities such as scanning and vulnerability
assessments, but not specialized techniques such as penetration or application security testing. Overt
testing is less expensive, carries less risk than covert testing, and is more frequently used—but covert
testing provides a better indication of the everyday security of the target organization because system
administrators will not have heightened awareness.
