certificates (digital signature certificate, key management certificates, etc.) that may be stored on
embedded tokens.

2.2       Derived PIV Application Test

These tests are intended to ensure that tokens with Derived PIV Applications, sold and supplied
by vendors, conform to the requirements specified in SP 800-157. In general, these tests cover
the following:

      +    Transport layer conformance, which ensures interoperability and portability of the
           Derived PIV Application token between mobile devices.

      +    The Derived PIV Application data object access/storage conformance, which ensures that
           the application is set up and is conformant to [SP800-157] with regards to data object
           container sizes, data object identifiers, password requirements as well as the security
           conditions for accessing and storing each of the associated data objects.

      +    The Derived PIV Application command interface as per [SP800-157], and includes the
           security conditions for executing each command in the interface with appropriate
           response statuses.

The tests should be performed via test scripts that communicate directly with the hardware
cryptographic token through the API of the associated reader drivers and includes the following
categories of tests.

2.2.1 Transport Layer Conformance

Transport layer conformance tests ensure that an implementation on a specific removable
hardware token (i.e., UICC or USB) is compliant with industry standards specified in [SP800-
157] and that portability of the token is achieved across mobile devices.

2.2.2 Derived PIV Application Data Object Access/Storage Conformance

The Derived PIV Application data object access/storage conformance tests ensure that the
Derived PIV Application is set up and configured per the requirements specified in [SP800-157].
It covers requirements that apply to the removable hardware cryptographic token and includes
testing that covers containers for the following data objects:

      +    The one mandatory data object as defined in [SP800-157]:

                 X.509 Certificate for Derived PIV Authentication.

      +    The twenty-five optional data objects, defined in [SP800-157]:

                 X.509 Certificate for Digital Signature,

                 X.509 Certificate for Key Management,

                 Discovery Object,
