block. (The acronym XTS stands for the XEX Tweakable Block Cipher with Ciphertext
Stealing).

The specification of the ciphertext stealing method in Ref.[2] includes an ordering convention for
the final complete block and partial block of the encrypted data string. A different convention, in
which the order is swapped, may be desirable in some cases. The specification in Ref.[2]
provides flexibility in the physical location of these elements, as long as interoperability is not
compromised, as discussed in Section 5.

The XTS-AES mode provides confidentiality for the protected data. Authentication is not
provided, because the P1619 Task Group designed XTS-AES to provide encryption without data
expansion, so alternative cryptographic methods that incorporate an authentication tag are
precluded. In the absence of authentication or access control, XTS-AES provides more
protection than the other approved confidentiality-only modes against unauthorized manipulation
of the encrypted data.

Annex D of Ref.[2] discusses in detail the design choices for XTS, including the resistance to
manipulation of the encrypted data, and their ramifications for the incorporation of XTS-AES
into an information system. Prospective implementers of XTS-AES should consider this
information carefully to ensure that XTS-AES is an appropriate solution for a given threat
model.

4 Conformance

An instance of an XTS-AES implementation is defined by the following three elements, as
specified in Ref. [2]:

1) a secret key,
2) a single, fixed length for the data units that the key protects,
3) an implementation of the XTS-AES-Enc procedure or the XTS-AES-Dec procedure, or both,
   for the key and the length of the data units.

The length of the data unit for any instance of an implementation of XTS-AES shall not exceed
220 AES blocks. Note that Subclause 5.1 of Ref.[2] recommends this limit but does not require
it.

An implementation of the XTS-AES encryption mode may claim conformance with this
Recommendation if every supported instance satisfies this length requirement for a data unit, in
addition to all of the requirements in Clauses 1-6 of Ref. [2].

Key management is important for XTS-AES, as for any keyed cryptographic algorithm, but the
representation of a key backup structure in the Extensible Markup Language (XML) that is
specified in Clause 7 of Ref. [2] is outside the scope of this Recommendation.

Consistent with the 220 block limit for a data unit, an implementation of XTS-AES may further
restrict the length of the data units for any key. For example, an implementation may support
