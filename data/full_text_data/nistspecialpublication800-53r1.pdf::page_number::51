MINIMUM SECURITY CONTROLS – SUMMARY
LOW-IMPACT, MODERATE-IMPACT, AND HIGH-IMPACT INFORMATION SYSTEMS




T
        he following table lists the minimum security controls, or security control baselines, for
        low-impact, moderate-impact, and high-impact information systems. The three security
        control baselines are hierarchical in nature with regard to the security controls employed in
those baselines. 48 If a security control is selected for one of the baselines, the family identifier
and control number are listed in the appropriate column. If a control is not used in a particular
baseline, the entry is marked “not selected.” Control enhancements, when used to supplement
basic security controls, are indicated by the number of the control enhancement. For example, an
“IR-2 (1)” in the high baseline entry for the IR-2 security control indicates that the second control
from the Incident Response family has been selected along with control enhancement (1). Some
security controls and control enhancements in the security control catalog are not used in any of
the baselines but are available for use by organizations if needed; for example, when the results of
a risk assessment indicate the need for additional controls or control enhancements in order to
adequately mitigate risks to individuals, the organization, or its assets. A complete description of
security controls, supplemental guidance for the controls, and control enhancements is provided
in Appendix F. A detailed listing of security controls and control enhancements for each control
baseline is available at http://csrc.nist.gov/sec-cert.




48
   The hierarchical nature applies to the security requirements of each control (i.e., the base control plus all of its
enhancements) at the low-impact, moderate-impact, and high-impact level in that the control requirements at a
particular impact level (e.g., AC-18 Wireless Access Restrictions—Moderate: AC-18 (1)) meets a stronger set of
security requirements for that control than the next lower impact level of the same control (e.g., AC-18 Wireless Access
Restrictions—Low: AC-18). Since the numerical designation of a control enhancement is neither indicative of the
relative strength of the enhancement nor assumes any hierarchical relationship among enhancements, there are some
controls (e.g., IA-2) that may not appear to satisfy the hierarchical nature of the security requirements of each control
even though they do. For example, with IA-2 User Identification and Authentication, enhancement (1) is called out for
the moderate baseline and enhancements (2) and (3) are called out for the high baseline. In this case, high [IA-2(2)(3)]
is hierarchical to moderate [IA-2(1)] with regard to the security requirements being imposed.
