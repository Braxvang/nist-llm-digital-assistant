      NIST SP 800-171r3 fpd (Final Public Draft)                      Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information

820           a. Define the types of changes to the system that are configuration-controlled.
821           b. Review proposed configuration-controlled changes to the system and approve or disapprove
822              such changes with explicit consideration for security impacts.
823           c.   Implement and document approved configuration-controlled changes to the system.
824           d. Monitor and review activities associated with configuration-controlled changes to the system.

825           DISCUSSION
826           Configuration change control refers to tracking, reviewing, approving or disapproving, and
827           logging changes to the system. Specifically, it involves the systematic proposal, justification,
828           implementation, testing, review, and disposition of changes to the system, including system
829           upgrades and modifications. Configuration change control includes changes to baseline
830           configurations for system components (e.g., operating systems, applications, firewalls, routers,
831           mobile devices) and configuration items of the system, changes to configuration settings,
832           unscheduled and unauthorized changes, and changes to remediate vulnerabilities.

836   3.4.4. Impact Analyses
837           REQUIREMENT: 03.04.04
838           Analyze the security impact of changes to the system prior to implementation.

839           DISCUSSION
840           Organizational personnel with security responsibilities conduct impact analyses that include
841           reviewing security plans, policies, and procedures to understand security requirements; reviewing
842           system design documentation and operational procedures to understand how system changes
843           might affect the security state of the system; reviewing the impacts of changes on supply chain
844           partners with stakeholders; and determining how potential changes to a system create new risks
845           and the ability to mitigate those risks. Impact analyses also include risk assessments to understand
846           the impacts of changes and to determine whether additional security requirements are needed.

850   3.4.5. Access Restrictions for Change
851           REQUIREMENT: 03.04.05
852           Define, document, approve, and enforce physical and logical access restrictions associated with
853           changes to the system.

854           DISCUSSION
855           Changes to the hardware, software, or firmware components of the system or the operational
856           procedures related to the system can have potentially significant effects on the security of the
857           system. Therefore, organizations permit only qualified and authorized individuals to access the
