needs to be convinced of the signature generation time.
Figure 9 depicts the case where entity A provides evidence of timeliness using data
supplied by entity B, and entity B determines (more precisely) when the digital signature
generated by entity A was received. This scheme is similar to the scheme in Section
4.3.4, with the only difference being the nonce sent from entity B to entity A. Note that
the Nonce supplied by entity B could include a timestamp (trusted by both entity A and
entity B), in which case, this (additional) timestamp would establish an interval during
which the signature was generated.
The first three steps are the same as those                                                  TTA
specified in Section 5.1. After entity B




                                                                              4. SIGA(M), other_info
verifies SIGA(M, Nonce), the scheme
proceeds as follows:
   4. Entity B sends SIGA(M, Nonce) (and
      possibly other information) to the




                                                                                                       5. TSP
      TTA in a timestamp request, i.e,
      user_supplied_info = SIGA(M),
      other_info. Note that the other_info
      may be Null.
   5. The TTA returns a TSP to entity B:                      1. Nonce
           TSP = timestamped_data,                 A      2. D = M, SIGA(M)                            B
              timestamp_signatureTTA
       where:
                                                    Figure 9: Entity B Requests a
           user_supplied_info = SIGA(M,                            Ti
              Nonce), other_info.
           timestamped_data = user_supplied_info, TTA_supplied_info, timestamp.
           timestamp_signatureTTA = SIGTTA(user_supplied_info, TTA_supplied_info,
              timestamp).
       If there is a mutual agreement between entity B and the TTA, the following
       information may be omitted from the TSP data transmitted by the TTA:
           •    Any portion of the user_supplied_info may be omitted, since it is known
                by entity B.
           •    Any portion of the TTA_supplied_info may be omitted when this
                information is known or can be determined by entity B.
       However, even though they may be omitted from the transmitted TSP data, both
       the entire user_supplied_info and the entire TTA_supplied_info shall be included
       in the timestamped_data that is used in the generation / verification of
       timestamp_signatureTTA = SIGTTA(timestamped_data).
   6. Entity B then 1) checks that the transmitted portions of user_supplied_info are
      correct and 2) verifies the timestamp_signatureTTA using the TTA’s public
