Authenticity              The property that data originated from its purported source.

Bit                       A binary digit: 0 or 1.

Bit Length                The number of bits in a bit string.

Bit String                An ordered sequence of bits.

Block                     A bit string whose length is the block size of the block cipher
                          algorithm.

Block Cipher              A family of functions and their inverses that is parameterized by
Algorithm                 cryptographic keys; the functions map bit strings of a fixed length to
                          bit strings of the same length.

Block Size                The bit length of an input (or output) block of the block cipher.

CBC-MAC                   Cipher Block Chaining-Message Authentication Code

CCM                       Counter with Cipher Block Chaining-Message Authentication Code.

Ciphertext                The output of the CCM encryption-generation process.

Cryptographic Key         A parameter used in the block cipher algorithm that determines the
                          forward cipher function.

CTR                       Counter.

Decryption-Verification   The process of CCM in which a purported ciphertext is decrypted and
                          the authenticity of the resulting payload and the associated data is
                          verified.

Exclusive-OR              The bitwise addition, modulo 2, of two bit strings of equal length.

FIPS                      Federal Information Processing Standard.

Formatting Function       The function that transforms the payload, associated data, and nonce
                          into a sequence of complete blocks.

Forward Cipher            One of the two functions of the block cipher algorithm that is
Function                  determined by the choice of a cryptographic key.

Generation-Encryption     The process of CCM in which a MAC is generated on the payload
                          and the associated data, and encryption is applied to the payload and
                          the MAC.
