Securing Mail Clients

          Completed                                             Action
                          Patch and update mail clients
                          Update mail client to newest or most secure version
                          Apply any necessary patches to mail client (in conformance with organizational
                          polices and configuration management)
                          Apply any necessary patches to Web browser (for mail clients that are integrated
                          with browser)
                          Configure mail client security features
                          Disable automatic message preview
                          Disable automatic opening of messages
                          Disable automatic loading of pictures in messages
                          Disable downloading and processing of active content (if appropriate)
                          Enable anti-spam and anti-phishing features
                          Reconfigure portable mail clients, such as those on cell phones and PDAs, to
                          improve their security
                          Ensure that security policy supports the protection of portable mail clients, such
                          as requiring anti-virus software to be installed and enabled
                          Limit access to VPN clients and other remote access applications on mobile
                          devices, or remove the clients/applications if they are not needed
                          Configure authentication and access
                          Enable secure authentication and access
                          Disable ability of mail client to store username and passwords
                          Configure client to use encryption (TLS) for SMTP, POP, and IMAP
                          communications
                          Set restrictions on the selection of email addresses, such as ensuring they are
                          unrelated to user account names
                          Secure the mail client host operating system
                          Keep the OS updated to the most secure patch level
                          Configure the OS to allow only the appropriate user(s) to access locally stored
                          messages and mail client configuration files
                          Secure or remove Windows Script Host (Windows hosts only)
                          Change the default action on files associated with the Windows Script Host from
                          execute to edit (Windows hosts only)
                          Ensure that the OS is configured to show full file extensions (Windows hosts
                          only)
                          Install an anti-virus application and configure it to scan incoming messages and
                          attachments; also install an anti-spyware application if the anti-virus software
                          does not offer robust anti-spyware capabilities
                          Install a personal firewall if needed to protect the computer from unauthorized
                          communications
                          Ensure the OS enforces the concept of least privilege, because malicious code
                          runs in the security context on which it was launched (i.e., the userâ€™s access
                          level)
