NIST SP 800-82r3                                          Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

When the OT cannot support the specific system and communications protection requirements of
a control, the organization employs compensating controls in accordance with the general
tailoring guidance. Examples of compensating controls are given with each control as
appropriate.
SC-1    POLICY AND PROCEDURES

                                                                        CONTROL BASELINES
  CNTL                         CONTROL NAME
   NO.                      Control Enhancement Name
                                                                      LOW         MOD         HIGH

 SC-1       Policy and Procedures                                    Select     Select      Select

OT Discussion: The policy specifically addresses the unique properties and requirements of OT
and the relationship to non-OT systems.
SC-2    SEPARATION OF SYSTEM AND USER FUNCTIONALITY

                                                                        CONTROL BASELINES
  CNTL                         CONTROL NAME
   NO.                      Control Enhancement Name
                                                                      LOW         MOD         HIGH

 SC-2       Separation of System and User Functionality                         Select      Select

OT Discussion: Physical separation includes using separate systems for managing the OT and for
operating OT components. Logical separation includes the use of different user accounts for
administrative and operator privileges. Example compensating controls include providing
increased auditing measures.
SC-3    SECURITY FUNCTION ISOLATION

                                                                        CONTROL BASELINES
  CNTL                         CONTROL NAME
   NO.                      Control Enhancement Name
                                                                      LOW         MOD         HIGH

 SC-3       Security Function Isolation                                                     Select

OT Discussion: Organizations consider implementing this control when designing new
architectures or updating existing components. An example compensating control includes
access controls.
SC-4    INFORMATION IN SHARED SYSTEM RESOURCES

                                                                     CONTROL BASELINES
  CNTL                        CONTROL NAME
   NO.                     Control Enhancement Name
                                                                    LOW        MOD        HIGH

 SC-4      Information in Shared System Resources                             Select     Select

OT Discussion: This control is especially relevant for OT systems that process confidential data.
Example compensating controls include engineering the use of the OT to prevent sharing system
resources.
