                 Figure 2-9. Web Services Security Standards: Notional Reference Model

Standards at the network, transport and XML security layers are used to secure messages as they are
transmitted over the network. The security standards IPsec, SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport
Layer Security), XML Encryption and XML Signature each operate on SOAP messages at a different
level.

Above the XML Security layer, there are two types of standards: standards built on top of SOAP and
standalone standards. Message security standards WS-Security and WS-SecureConversation define how
to use XML Signature, XML Encryption and credentials to secure SOAP at the message layer while
reliable messaging standards define the protocols and constructs necessary to ensure that messages will be
received. The access control standards are not unique to Web services; XACML can define the access
policy for any system and SAML can be used to define assertions in any environment. The policy layerâ€™s
WS-Policy defines a grammar to communicate the policy requirements of a Web service. These
standards are described in more detail in Section 3.

Security management specifications define other Web services to manage credentials such as PKI
certificates within the SOA. Identity management standards take advantage of access control standards,
policy standards and SOAP standards to offer services for distributing and managing user identities and
credentials within the SOA.
