4.2.2     Operations and Functions

0s                     The bit string that consists of s ‘0’ bits.

CIPHK (X)              The output of the forward cipher function of the block cipher under the
                       key K applied to the block X.

GCTRK (ICB, X)         The output of the GCTR function for a given block cipher with key K
                       applied to the bit string X with an initial counter block ICB.

GHASHH (X)             The output of the GHASH function under the hash subkey H applied to
                       the bit string X.

incs(X)                The output of incrementing the right-most s bits of the bit string X,
                       regarded as the binary representation of an integer, by 1 modulo 2s.

int(X)                 The integer for which the bit string X is a binary representation.

len(X)                 The bit length of the bit string X.

LSBs (X)               The bit string consisting of the s right-most bits of the bit string X.

MSBs (X)               The bit string consisting of the s left-most bits of the bit string X.

⎡x⎤                    The least integer that is not less than the real number x.

[x]s                   The binary representation of the non-negative integer x as a string of s bits,
                       where x<2s.

X >> 1                 The bit string that results from discarding the rightmost bit of the bit string
                       X and prepending a ‘0’ bit on the left.

X || Y                 The concatenation of two bit strings X and Y.

X⊕Y                    The bitwise exclusive-OR of two bit strings X and Y of the same length.

X•Y                    The product of two blocks, X and Y, regarded as elements of a certain
                       binary Galois field.

Xi                     For a positive integer i, the ith power of X under the product ‘•’.

x·y                    The product of two integers, x and y.
