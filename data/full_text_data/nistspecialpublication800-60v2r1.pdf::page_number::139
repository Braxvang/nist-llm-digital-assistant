systems, the function, operation, or use of, which involve intelligence activities or are critical
to the direct fulfillment of intelligence missions 32 are defined under Public Law 33 as national
security systems. National security information and national security systems are outside the
scope of this guideline. Security objectives and impact levels associated with national
security systems are determined by the head of each agency exercising control of the
system 34 .

Intelligence operations are subdivided into the following sub-elements:

     • Intelligence Planning Information Type – Intelligence Planning involves developing
       strategies focused on intelligence requirements, prioritizing these requirements, and
       managing these requirements (adding, deleting and modifying).
     • Intelligence Collection Information Type – Intelligence Collection involves acquiring raw
       data and provisioning the data to processing elements.
     • Intelligence Analysis and Production Information Type – Intelligence Analysis and
       Production consists of integrating, evaluating, and/or interpreting information from single
       or multiple sources into intelligence satisfying consumer needs and preparing intelligence
       products in support of known or anticipated consumers.
     • Intelligence Dissemination Information Type – Intelligence Dissemination consists of
       delivering the intelligence products to consumers.
     • Intelligence Processing Information Type – Intelligence processing involves converting
       collected raw data into forms suitable for analysis.

Some agencies are charged with gathering domestic intelligence. Much domestic intelligence
information is classified. Other domestic intelligence information may not be classified (e.g.,
some information obtained from state and local government sources). All classified information
is treated under separate rules established for national security information. The recommended
categorization for unclassified domestic intelligence information follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, High), (integrity, High), (availability, High)}




32
    Systems that do not involve a) intelligence activities, b) cryptologic activities related to national security, c)
   command and control of military forces, d) equipment that is an integral part of a weapon or weapons system or 5)
   information classified by an act of Congress or under an Executive order are not designated as national security
   systems if they are used exclusively for routine business or administrative applications even if they are critical to
   the direct fulfillment of military or intelligence missions. Routine business or administrative applications are
   defined as including payroll, finance, logistics, and personnel management applications. [Federal Information
