            Vulnerability                                                Description
  Hardware, firmware, and software     The organization does not know the patch management status, security
  are not under configuration          settings, or configuration versions that it has, resulting in an inconsistent
  management                           and ineffective defense posture. A lack of configuration change
                                       management procedures can lead to security oversights, exposures, and
                                       risks. A process for controlling modifications to hardware, firmware,
                                       software, and documentation should be implemented to ensure that an OT
                                       is protected against inadequate or improper modifications before, during,
                                       and after system implementation. To properly secure an OT, there should
                                       be an accurate listing or repository of the current configurations.
  OS and vendor software patches       Because of the tight coupling between OT software and the underlying
  may not be developed until long      OT, changes must undergo expensive and time-consuming comprehensive
  after security vulnerabilities are   regression testing. The elapsed time for such testing and the subsequent
  found                                distribution of updated software provides a long window of vulnerability.
                                       Vulnerability management procedures should include flexibility for
                                       interim alternative mitigations.
  Vendor declines to develop           Out-of-date OSs and applications may contain newly discovered
  patches for vulnerability            vulnerabilities that could be exploited. Security patch support may not be
                                       available for legacy OT, so vulnerability management procedures should
                                       include contingency plans for mitigating vulnerabilities where patches
                                       may never be available or replacement plans.
  Lack of a vulnerability              Vulnerabilities not considered by the organization could result in
  management program                   exploitation. Vulnerability management procedures should be in place to
                                       determine a plan of action or inaction upon the discovery of a
                                       vulnerability. Some OT considerations are: availability concerns may push
                                       patching until the next planned operational downtime; security patch
                                       support may not be available for OT systems that use outdated OSs;
                                       isolated systems may not require immediate patching; and OT exposed to
                                       the internet may need to be prioritized for patching.
  Inadequate testing of security       Modifications to hardware, firmware, and software deployed without
  changes                              testing could compromise normal operation of the OT. Documented
                                       procedures should be developed for testing all changes for security
                                       impacts. The live operational systems should never be used for testing.
                                       The testing of system modifications may need to be coordinated with
                                       system vendors and integrators.
  Poor remote access controls          There are many reasons why an OT may need to be remotely accessed,
                                       including vendors and system integrators performing system maintenance
                                       functions or OT engineers accessing geographically remote system
                                       components. The concept of least privilege should be applied to remote
                                       access controls. Remote access capabilities must be adequately controlled
                                       to prevent unauthorized individuals from gaining access or authorized
                                       individuals from gaining excessive access to the OT.
  Poor configurations are used         Improperly configured systems may leave unnecessary ports and protocols
                                       open. These unnecessary functions may contain vulnerabilities that
                                       increase the overall risk to the system. Using default configurations often
                                       exposes vulnerabilities and exploitable services. All settings should be
                                       examined.
  Critical configurations are not      Procedures should be available for restoring OT configuration settings in
  stored or backed up                  the event of accidental or adversary-initiated configuration changes to
                                       maintain system availability and prevent the loss of data. Documented
                                       procedures should be developed for maintaining configuration settings.
  Data unprotected on portable         System security could be compromised if sensitive data (e.g., passwords,
  device                               dial-up numbers) is stored in cleartext on lost or stolen portable devices,
                                       such as laptops and mobile devices. Policy, procedures, and mechanisms
                                       are required for protection.
