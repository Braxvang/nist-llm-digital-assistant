                 The Technical Specification for the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.2



2.       SCAP 1.2 Conformance

The component specifications included in SCAP 1.2 are as follows:
    Languages
     o    Extensible Configuration Checklist Description Format (XCCDF) 1.2, a language for authoring
          security checklists/benchmarks and for reporting results of evaluating them [XCCDF]
     o    Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL) 5.10, a language for representing system
          configuration information, assessing machine state, and reporting assessment results [OVAL]
     o    Open Checklist Interactive Language (OCIL) 2.0, a language for representing checks that collect
          information from people or from existing data stores made by other data collection efforts [OCIL]
    Reporting formats
     o    Asset Reporting Format (ARF) 1.1, a format for expressing the transport format of information
          about assets and the relationships between assets and reports [ARF]
     o    Asset Identification 1.1, a format for uniquely identifying assets based on known identifiers
          and/or known information about the assets [AI]
    Enumerations
     o    Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) 2.3, a nomenclature and dictionary of hardware, operating
          systems, and applications [CPE]
     o    Common Configuration Enumeration (CCE) 5, a nomenclature and dictionary of software
          security configurations [CCE]
     o    Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE), a nomenclature and dictionary of security-related
          software flaws9 [CVE]
    Measurement and scoring systems
     o    Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) 2.0, a system for measuring the relative severity
          of software flaw vulnerabilities [CVSS]
     o    Common Configuration Scoring System (CCSS) 1.0, a system for measuring the relative severity
          of system security configuration issues [CCSS]
    Integrity
     o    Trust Model for Security Automation Data (TMSAD) 1.0, a specification for using digital
          signatures in a common trust model applied to other security automation specifications
          [TMSAD].
All references to these specifications within this document are to the version numbers listed above unless
otherwise explicitly specified.
Combinations of these specifications can be used together for particular functions, such as security
configuration checking. These functions, known as SCAP use cases, are ways in which a product can use
SCAP. The collective XML content used for a use case is called an SCAP data stream, which is a specific
instantiation of SCAP content. There are two types of SCAP data streams: an SCAP source data stream
holds the input content, and an SCAP result data stream holds the output content. The major elements of
a data stream, such as an XCCDF benchmark or a set of OVAL Definitions, are referred to as stream
components.
