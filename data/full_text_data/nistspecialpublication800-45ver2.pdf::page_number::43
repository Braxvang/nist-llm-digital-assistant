5.     Securing the Mail Server Operating System

Protecting a mail server from compromise involves hardening the underlying operating system, the mail
server application, and the network to prevent malicious entities from directly attacking the mail server.
The first step in securing a mail server, hardening the underlying operating system, is discussed at length
in this section. (Securing the mail server application and the network are addressed in Sections 6 and 7,
respectively).

All commonly available mail servers operate on a general-purpose operating system. Many security
issues can be avoided if the operating systems underlying the mail servers are configured appropriately.
Default hardware and software configurations are typically set by manufacturers to emphasize features,
functions, and ease of use at the expense of security. Because manufacturers are unaware of each
organization’s security needs, each mail server administrator must configure new servers to reflect their
organization’s security requirements and reconfigure them as those requirements change. The practices
recommended here are designed to help mail server administrators configure and deploy mail servers that
satisfy their organization's security requirements. 27 Mail server administrators managing existing mail
servers should confirm that their systems address the issues discussed.

The techniques for hardening different operating systems vary greatly; therefore, this section includes the
generic procedures common in securing most operating systems. Security configuration guides and
checklists for many operating systems are publicly available; these documents typically contain
recommendations for settings that improve the default level of security, and they may also contain step-
by-step instructions for securing systems. 28 In addition, many organizations maintain their own
guidelines specific to their requirements. Some automated tools also exist for hardening operating
systems and their use is strongly recommended.

Five basic steps are necessary to maintain basic operating system security:

1. Planning the installation and deployment of the host operating system and other components for the
   mail server
2. Patching and updating the host operating system as required
3. Hardening and configuring the host operating system to address security adequately
4. Installing and configuring additional security controls, if needed
5. Testing the host operating system to ensure that the previous four steps adequately address all security
   issues.
The first step is discussed in Section 4.1. The other steps are covered in Sections 5.1 and 5.2.

     If Web-based mail access will be provided, administrators should ensure that the associated Web servers are secured
     properly, including securing their operating systems and Web server software. See NIST SP 800-44, Guidelines on
     Securing Public Web Servers, for additional information (http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/).

     Checklists and implementation guides for various operating systems and applications are available from NIST at
     http://checklists.nist.gov/. Also, see NIST SP 800-70, Security Configuration Checklists Program for IT Products, available
     at the same Web site, for general information about NIST’s checklists program.
