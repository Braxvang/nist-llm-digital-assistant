       NIST SP 800-171r3 fpd (Final Public Draft)                       Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information
       November 2023

 975             mobile devices upon return from travel include examining the device for signs of physical
 976             tampering and purging and reimaging the device storage.

 980         Identification and Authentication

 981   3.5.1. User Identification, Authentication, and Re-Authentication
 982           REQUIREMENT: 03.05.01
 983           a. Uniquely identify and authenticate system users and associate that unique identification with
 984              processes acting on behalf of those users.
 985           b. Re-authenticate users when [Assignment: organization-defined circumstances or situations
 986              requiring re-authentication].

 987           DISCUSSION
 988           System users include individuals (or system processes acting on behalf of individuals) who are
 989           authorized to access a system. Typically, individual identifiers are the usernames associated with
 990           the system accounts assigned to those individuals. Since system processes execute on behalf of
 991           groups and roles, organizations may require the unique identification of individuals in group
 992           accounts or accountability of individual activity. The unique identification and authentication of
 993           users applies to all system accesses. Organizations employ passwords, physical authenticators,
 994           biometrics, or some combination thereof to authenticate user identities. Organizations may re-
 995           authenticate individuals in certain situations, including when roles, authenticators, or credentials
 996           change; when the execution of privileged functions occurs; after a fixed time period; or
 997           periodically.

1001   3.5.2. Device Identification and Authentication
1002           REQUIREMENT: 03.05.02
1003           Uniquely identify and authenticate devices before establishing a system connection.

1004           DISCUSSION
1005           Devices that require unique device-to-device identification and authentication are defined by
1006           type, device, or a combination of type and device. Organization-defined device types include
1007           devices that are not owned by the organization. Systems use shared known information (e.g.,
1008           Media Access Control [MAC], Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol [TCP/IP]
1009           addresses) for device identification or organizational authentication solutions (e.g., Institute of
1010           Electrical and Electronics Engineers [IEEE] 802.1x and Extensible Authentication Protocol
1011           [EAP], RADIUS server with EAP-Transport Layer Security [TLS] authentication, Kerberos) to
