Measure ID          Physical Security Incidents Measure 1 (or a unique identifier to be filled out by the
                    organization)
Goal                •   Strategic Goal: Ensure an environment of comprehensive security and accountability
                        for personnel, facilities, and products.
                    •   Information Security Goal: Integrate physical and information security protection
                        mechanisms to ensure appropriate protection of the organization’s information
                        resources.
Measure             Percentage (%) of physical security incidents allowing unauthorized entry into facilities
                    containing information systems
                    NIST SP 800-53 Control – PE-6: Monitoring Physical Access
Measure Type        Effectiveness/Efficiency
Formula             (Number of physical security incidents allowing unauthorized entry into facilities
                    containing information systems/total number of physical security incidents) *100
Target              This should be a low percentage defined by the organization.
Implementation      1. How many physical security incidents occurred during the specified period (PE-6)?
Evidence            _____

                    2. How many of the physical security incidents allowed unauthorized entry into facilities
                    containing information systems (PE-6)? _____
