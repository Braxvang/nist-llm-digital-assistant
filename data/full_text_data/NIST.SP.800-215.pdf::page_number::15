organizations to extend perimeter-based security across a public network. Security is enabled by
setting up a secure tunnel in the public network using protocols such as Internet Protocol
Security (IPSEC) and Transport Layer Security (TLS).
However, there are some limitations and security risks associated with VPNs.
   •   An increasing trend involves the movement of corporate resources to the cloud and the
       use of mobile devices. The VPN connections that remote users establish terminate at the
       VPN concentrators located at the edge of the corporate network. Hence, even traffic
       generated during those users’ cloud service access lands at the corporate internet edge
       and has to be validated and routed back to the internet to access the cloud resources. This
       phenomenon is called “hair-pinning”, results in extra distance, increases network latency,
       and has the potential to cause traffic bottlenecks.
   •   Periodic disclosure of vulnerabilities. Two recent examples are “session hijacking” and
       “account ID extraction” [2].
   •   When VPNs are deployed as hardware appliances, it puts a limit on the number of users
       who can connect through the network gateway and limits scalability.
   •   VPNs often require agents, which makes providing access in scenarios with a high
       volume of third-party users (contractors and partners) difficult [53].

2.3 Limitation of MPLS Technology as Enterprise WANs
Multi-protocol label switching (MPLS) technology is used for enterprise WANs, but the wide
geographic span of an enterprise network with multiple data centers and cloud services has
imposed some limitations on its use (in addition to cost).
   •   The geographic span of enterprise IT resources and subsequent networking connections
       have made traversal through the internet inevitable for many portions of the enterprise’s
       access network. Since MPLS is a different network, it provides access to the internet only
       through designated and limited access points (similar to the hair pinning phenomenon).
       This increases latency for time-sensitive corporate applications.
   •   Given the different networking technology, the appliances and subsequent configuration
       procedures are different, making network management a complex task.

2.4 Limitation of Authentication Infrastructure
In the current network landscape, which consists of access to on-premises and cloud-based
applications, there exist authentication infrastructures (both enterprise and cloud-based) to
authenticate end users using various token-based approaches (e.g., Jason Web Tokens [JWT] or
Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0 tokens). This infrastructure by itself is not
sufficient to meet the authentication needs of the environment that contains microservices-based
applications, which are becoming ubiquitous in both enterprise and cloud environments. This
class of application consists of loosely coupled microservices that require the generation of
multiple interservice requests to complete a business process or transaction. This scenario, in
