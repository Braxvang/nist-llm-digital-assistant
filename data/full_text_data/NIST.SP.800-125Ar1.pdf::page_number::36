NIST SP 800-125A REV. 1                                             SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR
                                                                SERVER-BASED HYPERVISOR PLATFORMS

               remapping where the DMA call from a device to guest physical
               address (GPA) must be translated to host physical address (HPA) and
               then checked whether the HPA address falls within the protection
               domain assigned to that device.

  HY-SR-7      It should be possible to set up an Access Control List (ACL) to restrict    HY-BF2
               access of each VM process to only the devices assigned to that VM. To       (Devices
               enable this, the hypervisor configuration should support a feature to       Mediation &
               mark (label) VMs (semantically a set of tasks) and/or has a feature to      Access Control)
               specify a whitelist (list of allowable) of devices for each VM.
  HY-SR-8      It should be possible to set resource limits for network bandwidth and      HY-BF2
               I/O bandwidth (e.g., disk read/write speeds) for each VM to prevent         (Devices
               denial of service (DOS) attacks. Further, the proper use of resource        Mediation &
               limits, localizes the impact of a DOS to the VM or the cluster for which    Access Control)
               the resource limit is defined.
  HY-SR-9      Gold-standard must be defined for VMs of all types and VM Images not        HY-BF4 (VM
               conforming to the standard should not be allowed to be stored in the VM     Lifecycle
               Image server/library. Further images in the VM Image library should be      Management)
               periodically scanned for OS versions and patches going out of date and
               thus have drifted from the standard.
  HY-SR-10     Every VM Image stored in the image server should have a digital signature   HY-BF4 (VM
               attached to it as a mark of authenticity and integrity, signed using        Lifecycle
               trustworthy, robust cryptographic keys.                                     Management)
  HY-SR-11 Permissions for checking in to and checking out images from                     HY-BF4 (VM
           VM Image library should be enforced through a robust access                     Lifecycle
           control mechanism and limited to an authorized set of                           Management)
           administrators. In the absence of an access control mechanism, VM
           image files should be stored in encrypted devices that can only be
           opened/closed by a limited set of authorized administrators with
  HY-SR-12 Access to the server storing VM images should always be through a               HY-BF4 (VM
           secure protocol such as TLS.                                                    Lifecycle

  HY-SR-13    During VM live migration, care should be taken to see that a secure          HY-BF4 (VM
              authentication protocol is used for performing live migration, that          Lifecycle
                                                                                           Management)
              the credentials of the administrator performing the migration is
              passed only to the destination host, the migration of memory content
              and processor state takes place over a secure network connection
              and a dedicated virtual network segment is used in both source and
              destination hosts for carrying this traffic.
  HY-SR-14     There should be a mechanism for security monitoring and security policy     HY-BF4 (VM
