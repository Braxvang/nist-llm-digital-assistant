Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to financial sector oversight
information. Missions supported by financial sector oversight information are generally
tolerant of delay.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
financial sector oversight information is low.

D.9.4 Industry Sector Income Stabilization Information Type

Industry Sector Income Stabilization involves all programs and activities devoted to assisting
adversely impacted industrial sectors (farming, commercial transportation, etc.) to ensure the
continued availability of their services for the American public and the long-term economic
stability of these sectors. The provisional recommended security categorization for the industry
sector income stabilization information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Moderate), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of industry sector
income stabilization information on the ability of responsible agencies to assist adversely
impacted industrial sectors (farming, commercial transportation, etc.) to ensure the continued
availability of their services for the American public and the long-term economic stability of
these sectors. In most cases, unauthorized disclosure of industry sector income stabilization
information will have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals.
However, unauthorized premature disclosure of Federal government plans for industry sector
income stabilization actions (e.g., grants or subsidies) as well as of government economic
forecasts and commentary preliminary to formulation of plans may result in major financial
consequences. Unauthorized and premature disclosure to a single institution (e.g., a major
manufacturing institution, a major agribusiness institution, or a commodity brokerage house),
could damage confidence in economic stabilization institutions and have a severe adverse effect
on public confidence in the government.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for industry sector income stabilization information is moderate.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Industry sector
income stabilization activities are not generally time-critical. In most cases, the adverse effects
of unauthorized modification or destruction of industry sector income stabilization information
on agency mission functions and public confidence in the agency will be limited.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
industry sector income stabilization information is low.
