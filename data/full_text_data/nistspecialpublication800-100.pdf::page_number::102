CHAPTER 10                                                                           Risk Management


pair identified during the risk assessment (see Chapter 5 of this handbook and NIST
SP 800-30 for a discussion on identifying threat/vulnerability pairs). FIPS 200,
Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems,
mandates the use of NIST SP 800-53 for selecting minimum baseline security
controls for government systems. System security controls selected are grouped
into one of the three categories of management, operational, or technical controls,
and are either preventive or detective in nature.
    For new systems, once the security controls for the system have been identified
and refined and an initial risk assessment conducted, the selected controls must be
implemented. For legacy systems, the security controls that are selected are
verified. Organizations can leverage controls used among multiple systems by
designating them as common controls where implementation, assessment, and
monitoring is conducted at an organizational level or by areas of specific expertise
(e.g., human resources, physical security, building management). The system
owner must understand who is responsible for implementing these controls and
identify the risk that this extension of trust will generate. For information on
common controls, see NIST SP 800-53, Revision 1.
    Because it is impracticable to eliminate all risk, it is important to note that even
after the controls have been selected and implemented, some degree of residual risk
will remain. The remaining residual risk should be analyzed to ensure that it is at an
acceptable level. For federal agencies, after the appropriate controls have been put
in place for the identified risks, the authorizing official will sign a statement accepting
any residual risk and either authorize the operation of the new information system or
request continued processing of the existing information system. If the residual risk
has not been reduced to an acceptable level, the risk management cycle must be
repeated to identify a way of lowering the residual risk to an acceptable level.

10.3 Evaluation and Assessment
   The third and final phase in the risk management process is evaluation and
assessment. The art of risk management in today’s dynamic and constantly
changing information technology (IT) environments must be ongoing and
continuously evolving. Systems are upgraded and expanded, components are
improved, and architectures are constantly evolving.
    The security control evaluation and assessment, which is conducted during the
Security Certification Phase of a system’s security certification and accreditation,
provides input needed to finalize the risk assessment. 68 The results are used to
provide the Authorizing Official with the essential information needed to make a
credible, risk-based decision on whether to authorize the operation of the
information system. Ideally, the risk assessment activities would be conducted at
the same time the system is being certified and accredited. The reuse of assessment
data will not only save valuable resources, but also provide the most up-to-date risk
information for the authorizing official.
Many of the risk management activities are conducted during a snapshot in time—a
static representation of a dynamic environment. All the changes that occur to
systems during normal, daily operations have the potential to adversely affect the
security of the system in some fashion, and it is the goal of the risk management
