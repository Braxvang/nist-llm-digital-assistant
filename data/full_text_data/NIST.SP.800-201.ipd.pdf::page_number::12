      NIST SP 800-201 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                  Cloud Computing Forensic
      February 2023                                                                  Reference Architecture

301   provide core support for the design, implementation, assessment, monitoring, and operations of
302   information systems:
303       •   NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF) [4] – A focused guide to information system
304           risk management
305       •   ISO 27000 Series [5] – A series of standards dealing with a wide range of information
306           security topics, such as:
307           o ISO/IEC 27001 [6] – Information Security Management
308           o ISO/IEC 27002 [7] – Information Security Controls
309           o ISO/IEC 27018 [8] – Security of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in the
310             Cloud
311           o ISO/IEC 27035 [9] – Incident Response
312           o ISO/IEC 27037 [10] – Digital Evidence Collection and Preservation
313       •   IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL) [11] – A service-oriented architecture (SOA)
314       •   Sherwood Applied Business Security Architecture (SABSA) [12]
315       •   The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF) [13] – A general security
316           framework
317       •   Cloud Security Alliance STAR program [14] – A progressive security certification
318   The focus of each of these frameworks varies but generally facilitates architecting,
319   implementing, and operating secure and resilient information systems. The RMF is focused on
320   security from a risk identification and management perspective. As varied as the ISO 27000
321   series [5] is, it contains standards that address digital evidence and incident response.
322   Interestingly, however, there is not a readily apparent, in-depth exploration of cloud-system
323   forensics.
324   The endeavor presented here deals with the matter of forensics performed within a cloud
325   computing environment. The advent of cloud computing has simplified business operations and
326   introduced a level of business agility not previously experienced with traditional or on-premises
327   computing. However, cloud computing has also introduced a range of security and forensics
328   challenges. Enhanced capabilities enjoyed by legitimate businesses and friendly governments are
329   often equally available to opposing nation-states, terrorist groups, and international criminal
330   elements and assets. As a result, targets that were once unassailable by nefarious actors may now
331   be vulnerable to attack or exploitation.
332   To a great extent, cloud computing runs on virtualization – that is, the creation of processing
333   resources that have hardware as their basis but run as multiplexed programs and are thus
334   functionally multiplied through it. Cloud forensics involves performing analysis on “virtual
335   machines” using techniques that rely on having “real machines” on which to work. In addition,
336   there is the issue of the information obtained. If the “machine” is essentially “unreal,” what does
337   that say about any evidence derived from it? This evidence is therefore different from traditional
338   digital evidence.
339   Cloud computing has become increasingly pervasive as more entities discover its advantages.
340   These entities include legitimate businesses, governments, and individuals who use SaaS cloud
