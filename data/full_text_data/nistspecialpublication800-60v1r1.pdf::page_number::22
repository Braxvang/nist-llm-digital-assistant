4.1 Step 1: Identify Information Types
In accordance with FIPS 199, agencies shall identify all of the applicable information types that
are representative of input, stored, processed, and/or output data from each system. The initial
activity in mapping types of Federal information and information systems to security objectives
and impact levels is the development of an information taxonomy, or creation of a catalog of
information types. 12 The basis for the identification of information types is the OMB’s Business
Reference Model (BRM) described in the October 2007 publication, FEA Consolidated
Reference Model Document, Version 2.3. The BRM describes four business areas containing 39
FEA lines of business. 13 The four business areas separate government operations into high-level
categories relating:
     •   The purpose of government (services for citizens);
     •   The mechanisms the government uses to achieve its purpose (mode of delivery);
     •   The support functions necessary to conduct government operations (support delivery
         of services); and
     •   The resource management functions that support all areas of the government’s
         business (management of government resources).
The first two business areas, services for citizens and the mode of delivery represent the NIST SP
800-60 Mission-based Information Types and will be discussed first in the following section,
while support delivery of services and management of government resources represent
Management and Support Information Types and will be presented in Section 4.1.2.
Although this guideline identifies a number of information types and bases its taxonomy on the
BRM, only a few of the types identified are likely to be processed by any single system. Also,
each system may process information that does not fall neatly into one of the listed information
types. Once a set of information types identified in this guideline has been selected, it is prudent
to review the information processed by each system under review to see if additional types need
to be identified for impact assessment purposes. Also, it is recommended that organizational
officials maintain proper documentation of identified information types per information system
along with the basis for the information type selection. Guidance for documenting information
types is provided in Section 4.5.

4.1.1    Identification of Mission-based Information Types

This section describes a process for identifying mission-based information types and for
specifying the impact of unauthorized disclosure, modification, or unavailability of this
information. Mission-based information types are, by definition, specific to individual
departments and agencies or to specific sets of departments and agencies. The BRM services for
citizens business area provides the primary frame of reference for determining the security


12
   One issue associated with the taxonomy activity is the determination of the degree of granularity. If the
categories are too broad, then the guidelines for assigning impact levels are likely to be too general to be useful.
On the other hand, if an attempt is made to provide guidelines for each element of information processed by
each government agency, the guideline is likely to be unwieldy and to require excessively frequent changes.

   Definitions are provided in SP 800-60 Appendix A for the BRM terms such as “Business Areas”, “Lines of
Businesses” and “Sub-functions”.
