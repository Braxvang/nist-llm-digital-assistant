           Vulnerability                                                  Description
  Vendor default passwords are used     Most vendor default passwords are easy to discover within vendor product
                                        manuals, which are also available to adversaries. Using the default
                                        password can drastically increase OT vulnerability.
  Password generation, use, and         Password policy and procedures must be followed to be effective.
  protection do not comply with         Violations of password policy and procedures can increase OT
  policy                                vulnerability.
  Inadequate access controls applied    Access controls must match how the organization allocates
                                        responsibilities and privilege to its personnel. Poorly specified access
                                        controls can result in an OT user having too many or too few privileges.
                                        The following exemplify each case:
                                        • System configured with default access control settings gives an
                                             operator administrative privileges
                                        • System configured improperly results in an operator being unable to
                                             take corrective actions in an emergency situation
  Improper data linking                 OT data storage systems may be linked to non-OT data sources. An
                                        example of this is database links, which allow data from one database
                                        (e.g., data historian) to be automatically replicated on others. Data linkage
                                        may create a vulnerability if it is not properly configured and may allow
                                        unauthorized data access or manipulation.
  Malware protection is not installed   The installation of malware (i.e., malicious software) is a common attack.
  or up to date                         Malware protection software, such as antivirus software, should be kept
                                        current in a dynamic environment. Outdated malware protection software
                                        and definitions leave the system open to malware threats.
  Malware protection implemented        Malware protection software that is deployed without sufficient testing
  without sufficient testing            could impact normal operation of the OT and block the system from
                                        performing necessary control actions.
  Denial of service (DoS)               OT software could be vulnerable to DoS attacks, resulting in the
                                        prevention of authorized access to a system resource or delaying system
                                        operations and functions.
  Intrusion detection and prevention    Incidents can result in loss of system availability and integrity; the
  software is not installed             capture, modification, and deletion of data; and incorrect execution of
                                        control commands. IDS/IPS software may stop or prevent various types of
                                        attacks, including DoS attacks, and also identify attacked internal hosts,
                                        such as those infected with worms. IDS/IPS software must be tested prior
                                        to deployment to ensure that it does not compromise normal operation of
                                        the OT.
  Logs are not maintained               Without proper and accurate logs, it might be impossible to determine
                                        what caused a security event to occur and perform adequate forensics.
