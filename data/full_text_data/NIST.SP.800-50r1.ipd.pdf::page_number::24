553          The CPLP Plan and Strategy
554   A CPLP strategic plan benefits the organization by providing an organization-wide view of the
555   current state of its cybersecurity and privacy learning, where the organization wants to or needs
556   to be, and how to address the gap between the two states (e.g., resources, staffing.) The strategic
557   plan helps the Learning Program Manager balance their daily responsibilities in ensuring that the
558   organization’s personnel are ready to meet the challenges of the cybersecurity and privacy risks
559   associated with their work.
560   The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130 [1] establishes general policy for
561   the planning, budgeting, governance, acquisition, and management of federal information,
562   personnel, equipment, funds, IT resources, and supporting infrastructure and services. Each
563   federal agency is required to develop, maintain, and implement a comprehensive CPLP to meet
564   its mission needs. To develop a robust program that includes a variety of materials, including
565   offering learners engaging opportunities to stay current on relevant cybersecurity and privacy
566   risks to their organization, the CPLP must have an effective strategy for development,
567   implementation, and continual improvement.
568   This section discusses the steps involved in building a Strategic Plan that takes the organization’s
569   objectives, unique requirements, audience types, and program scope into consideration. The
570   planning stages will also help the organization evaluate priorities, budget, resources, and
571   communication plans.

572          Building the Strategic Plan
573   The CPLP must intersect with the organization’s strategic plan for continual development of the
574   workforce. The owner of the CPLP should understand the structure and mission of the
575   organization to determine where the strategy originates. Some agencies are organized with a top-
576   down approach, where a headquarters function owns the mission and provides guidance on the
577   program strategy. Other organizations develop CPLPs in various business functions or combine
578   both approaches. Documenting the program and how it supports the goals of the risk
579   management strategy shows executive leadership why the program is needed. A well-developed
580   strategic plan describes how an organization’s risk management and workplace learning culture
581   enable all personnel to assess risk with their every action and decision. With agencies of varying
582   sizes, a program that works for one will not necessarily work for another. Each agency must
583   identify the best program that will work for them since one size does not fit all.
584   The CPLP Strategy should always be clearly stated and will most likely be reviewed by the
585   Senior Leadership Committee and agreed upon before any funding is approved. The strategic
586   plan describes how the CPLP supports and aligns with the overall organizational risk
587   management and workforce learning strategy.
588   Key items to address in the CPLP Strategy include:
589      •   Vision and mission
590      •   Strategic goals and objectives
591      •   Training Approaches and Action plans
592      •   Tactics
