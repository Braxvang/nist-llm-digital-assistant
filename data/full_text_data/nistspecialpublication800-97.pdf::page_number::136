ESTABLISHING WIRELESS ROBUST SECURITY NETWORKS: A GUIDE TO IEEE 802.11I



WLAN topology with real-time statistics on performance problems and outages. However, the
proprietary solution was the most expensive of the options and could constrain future upgrade options,
which would frustrate some of the bureau’s most influential users.

Smart card supporters argued that it was the most secure of the options because it used two-factor
authentication. Moreover, the bureau already had hands-on experience with it, having used it for some
time to support the IT staff. Members of this group were worried that an enterprise WLAN solution could
weaken the security of the IT infrastructure if the IT staff were compelled to give up their smart cards.
The disadvantages to this approach were that the user community might reject the smart cards as overly
cumbersome, and that the cards added a significant expense to the project and subsequent operations.

The third group felt the authentication infrastructure needed to be as transparent to users as possible to be
accepted readily. Users were used to entering a username and password to access their e-mail, so they
should be able to remember a similar combination for authentication to the WLAN. They recommended
using EAP-TTLS with MD5-Challenge as the inner EAP method. The AAA server could support this
configuration and also communicate using Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) with the
directory server that stored the e-mail security credentials.

The issue was brought before the CIO for resolution. She rejected the proprietary solution because of its
cost. She then successfully brokered a compromise between the second and third groups. Users outside
of the IT department would authenticate using their e-mail username and password. The IT staff would
also use this system, but would continue to use their smart cards for access to the management network.
The SSID of the enterprise ESS would be BAR1; the SSID of the ESS for the IT management network
would be BAR2. A firewall between the enterprise user network and the IT management network would
strictly limit the types of traffic that can flow between the two of them.

The second challenge was to replace all of the APs that could not support IEEE 802.1X and CCMP. To
prevent service disruptions, whenever a new AP was installed, it was configured to support both the old
WLAN and the new one. Users were given 60 days to migrate to the new WLAN.

The third challenge was to deploy new WLAN client software on each STA. The IT staff was surprised
at the diversity of STAs in their environment and knew that finding RSN client support for all of them
would be difficult. The STAs included UNIX, Linux, and Windows computers; two types of personal
digital assistants (PDA); six printers; and some smart phones with integrated IEEE 802.11g interfaces.
The project team identified a software product that could support EAP-TTLS on UNIX, Linux, Windows,
and one of the PDA types, but none of the printers or smart phones. Another product was found for the
other PDA type; wireless print servers were found to support the printers.

No support was available for the smart phones, which could support WEP only. Despite the commitment
to maintain WLAN service for all users, it was decided that the security of the enterprise could not be
compromised for the convenience of a handful of users with IEEE 802.11-capable smart phones. These
users were told that they would have to find alternative methods of connecting to the WLAN (e.g., using a
PDA).

Several of the original APs did not support CCMP and could not be used in the final solution. This
equipment was outdated and no longer of value to the organization. Before donating the equipment to a
local elementary school, a technician cleared all keys and network addresses from the devices to avoid
revealing any information about the bureau’s network to external parties.
