      NIST SP 800-201 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                  Cloud Computing Forensic
      February 2023                                                                  Reference Architecture

519       5. Application Services – These functional capabilities are associated with the development
520          and use of cloud applications provided by an organization. The capabilities cover
521          programming interfaces, security knowledge life cycle, development processes,
522          integration middleware, connectivity and delivery, and abstraction.
523       6. Information Services – These functional capabilities are associated with the storage and
524          use of cloud information and data. The capabilities cover service delivery, service
525          support, reporting services, information technology operation and support, business
526          operations and support, data governance, user directory services, risk management, and
527          security monitoring.
528       7. Infrastructure Services – These functional capabilities are associated with core functions
529          that support the cloud IT infrastructure. The capabilities cover facilities, hardware,
530          networks, and virtual environments.
531   Together, there are 347 functional capabilities within these domains.
532   As mentioned above, the CSA’s EA functional capabilities are leveraged by the NIST Cloud
533   Security Reference Architecture (SRA) [15], which is comprised of a formal model designed as a
534   security overlay to the NIST Cloud Computing Reference Architecture [22] and a methodology
535   for architecting and orchestrating a cloud-based solution. The methodology allows cloud
536   architects to identify the system’s functional capabilities. The orchestration employs a risk-based
537   approach that follows the Risk Management Framework (RMF) [4] applied to cloud-based
538   systems.
539   The SRA’s risk-based approach for determining a cloud actor’s responsibilities for implementing
540   specific system components supports a clear delineation between the security responsibilities of
541   cloud providers and consumers and a clear understanding of the customer responsibility matrix.
542   Specifically, for each cloud service model, system components are analyzed to identify the level
543   of involvement of each cloud actor when implementing those components.
