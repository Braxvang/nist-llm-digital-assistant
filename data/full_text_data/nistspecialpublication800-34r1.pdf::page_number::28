3.1         Develop the Contingency Planning Policy Statement

To be effective and to ensure that personnel fully understand the organization’s contingency planning
requirements, the contingency plan must be based on a clearly defined policy. The contingency planning
policy statement should define the organization’s overall contingency objectives and establish the
organizational framework and responsibilities for system contingency planning. To be successful, senior
management, most likely the CIO, must support a contingency program and be included in the process to
develop the program policy. The policy must reflect the FIPS 199 impact levels and the contingency
controls that each impact level establishes. Key policy elements are as follows:

           Roles and responsibilities;
           Scope as applies to common platform types and organization functions (i.e., telecommunications,
            legal, media relations) subject to contingency planning;
           Resource requirements;
           Training requirements;
           Exercise and testing schedules;
           Plan maintenance schedule; and
           Minimum frequency of backups and storage of backup media.

                   Sample information system contingency policy statement
     All organizations must develop contingency plans for each information system to meet
     the needs of critical system operations in the event of a disruption. The procedures for
     execution of such a capability shall be documented in a formal contingency plan by the
     Information Systems Contingency Plan (ISCP) Coordinator and must be reviewed
     annually and updated as necessary by the ISCP Coordinator. The plan must account
     for the FIPS 199 security categorization (low, moderate, high) and comply with the
     appropriate security controls. The plan must assign specific responsibilities to
     designated staff or positions to facilitate the recovery and/or continuity of essential
     system functions. Resources necessary to ensure viability of the procedures must be
     acquired and maintained. Personnel responsible for target systems must be trained to
     execute contingency procedures. The plan recovery capabilities and personnel shall be
     tested annually to identify weaknesses of the capability.



As information system contingency plans are developed during the Initiation phase of the SDLC, 13 they
should be coordinated with related organization-wide policies and programs, including information
system security, physical security, human resources, system operations, and emergency preparedness
functions. Information system contingency activities should be compatible with program requirements
for these areas, and recovery personnel should coordinate with representatives from each area to remain
aware of new or evolving policies, programs, or capabilities. The ISCPs must be written in coordination
with other plans associated with each target system as part of organization-wide resilience strategy. Such
plans include the following:


13
     The SDLC refers to the scope of activities associated with a system, encompassing the system’s initiation, development and
     acquisition, implementation, operation, and maintenance, and ultimately its disposal that instigates another system initiation.
     The SDLC approach is discussed in depth in NIST SP 800-64, Security Considerations in the Information System Development
     Life Cycle. An overview of contingency planning and the SDLC is provided in Appendix F.
