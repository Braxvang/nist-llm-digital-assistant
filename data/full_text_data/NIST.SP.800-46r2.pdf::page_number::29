                                                                                                software that has complex security settings. For example, many users have difficulty with manually

                                                                                                configuration. Locking ensures that security settings are not inadvertently or intentionally altered, which
                                                                                                could reduce remote access security. However, there is no standardization for remote management
                                                                                                capabilities or interfaces, and many remote access systems do not have remote management features for

                                                                                                managed before selecting and deploying a remote access solution. More broadly, organizations should
                                                                                                also plan how the telework client devices that they provide to teleworkers will be managed and supported,
                                                                                                such as a help desk agent remotely accessing a device to perform troubleshooting of operational problems
                                                                                                reported by a teleworker. If not properly secured, remote management capabilities can be misused by
                                                                                                attackers to compromise telework client devices and use them to gain access to an organization’s internal
                                                                                                resources. Therefore, organizations should ensure that remote management is properly secured,
                                                                                                particularly encrypting network communications and performing mutual authentication of endpoints.
