       •   Results of considering the potential impacts to other organizations and considering, “in
           accordance with the USA Patriot Act of 2001 and Homeland Security Presidential
           Directives, potential national-level impacts in categorizing the information system”
           (NIST SP 800-53 security control RA-2)
       •   Results of reviewing the identified security categorizations for the aggregate of
           information types (Step 4 in Table 1)
       •   Effects of various factors and circumstances (e.g., data aggregation, critical system
           functionality, privacy, trade secrets, critical infrastructure, aggregation, critical system
           functionality, extenuating circumstances) on the system category (Section 4.4.2)
       •   Whether and why the agency determined that the system impact level must be higher than
           any of the levels of the information types that the system processes (Section 4.4)
       •   Approvals of all determinations or decisions (Step 4 in Table 1)

4.6 Uses of Categorization Information
The results of system security categorization can and should be used by, or made available to,
appropriate agency personnel to support agency activities including:
       •   Business Impact Analysis (BIA): Agency personnel should consider the cross-utilization
           of security categorization and BIA information in the performance of each activity. Their
           common objectives enable agencies to mutually draw from them, thus, providing checks
           and balances to ensure accuracy for each information system. Conflicting information
           and anomalous conditions, such as a low availability impact and a BIA three-hour
           recovery time objective, should trigger a reevaluation by the mission and data owners.
       •   Capital Planning and Investment Control (CPIC) and Enterprise Architecture (EA): Just
           as no IT investment should be made without a business-approved architecture,21 the
           security categorization that begins the security life cycle is a business-enabling activity
           directly feeding the enterprise architecture and CPIC processes for new investments, as
           well as migration and upgrade decisions. Specifically, the security categorization can
           provide a firm basis for justifying certain capital expenditures and also can provide
           analytical input to avoid unnecessary investments.
       •   System Design: Understanding and designing the system architecture with varying
           information sensitivity levels in mind may assist in achieving economies of scale with
           security services and protection through common security zones within the enterprise.
           For example, an information system containing privacy information may be located in
           one security zone with other information systems containing similar sensitive
           information. Each zone may have varying levels of security. For instance, the more
           critical zones may require 3-factor authentication where the open area may only require
           normal access controls. This type of approach requires a solid understanding of an
           agency’s information and data types gained through the security categorization process.
