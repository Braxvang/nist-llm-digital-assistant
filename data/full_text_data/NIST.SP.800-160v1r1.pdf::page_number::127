NIST SP 800-160v1r1                                                                           Engineering Trustworthy Secure Systems

iteratively, or recursively at any level in the structural hierarchy of a system with the appropriate
fidelity and rigor and at any stage in the system life cycle in accordance with acquisition,
systems engineering, or other process models. Using their expertise and experience, practitioners
can tailor the system life cycle processes, activities, and tasks to achieve optimized and efficient
results. 92 Considerations include:
•    How the system life cycle processes apply within the development models used by an
     organization
•    The ordering or sequencing of the activities and tasks in the system life cycle processes
•    How the outcomes may be achieved in ways that do not strictly adhere to the presentation of
     the processes in this publication
•    Additional activities and tasks needed to achieve specific outcomes
•    The size, scope, and complexity of the system
•    The need to accommodate specific technologies, methods, or techniques used to develop the
     system

Tailoring the system life cycle processes allows the engineering team to:
•    Optimize the application of the processes in response to technological, programmatic,
     acquisition, process, procedural, system life cycle stage, or other objectives and constraints
•    Allow for the concurrent application of the processes by sub-teams focused on different parts
     of the same engineering effort
•    Facilitate the application of the processes to conform with a variety of system development
     methodologies, processes, and models (e.g., agile, spiral, waterfall) that could be used on a
     single engineering effort
•    Accommodate the need for unanticipated or other event-driven execution of the processes to
     resolve issues and respond to changes that occur during the engineering effort

While the life cycle processes and activities are restated from [4], the tasks in this publication are
neither a restatement of nor a one-for-one mapping to the tasks in [4]. This publication focuses
on the security contributions to the processes, and, therefore, the tasks are titled to reflect these
contributions. In some cases, tasks have been added to address the range of outcomes appropriate
for achieving trustworthy secure system objectives.

The descriptions of the system life cycle processes assume that sufficient time, funding, and
human and material resources are available to ensure the complete application of the processes
within the systems engineering effort. The processes represent the standard of excellence within
which appropriate tailoring is accomplished to achieve realistic, optimal, and cost-effective
results within the constraints imposed on the engineering team.

   Tailoring can occur as part of the project planning process at the start of the systems engineering effort or in an ad hoc manner at any time
during the engineering effort when situations and circumstances so dictate. Understanding the fundamentals of systems security engineering (i.e.,
the science underpinning the discipline) helps to inform the tailoring process whenever it occurs during the system life cycle. The INCOSE
Systems Engineering Handbook provides additional guidance on how to tailor the systems engineering processes [15].
