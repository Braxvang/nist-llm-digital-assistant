NIST SP 800-85A-4                                              PIV CARD APPLICATION & MIDDLEWARE
                                                                        INTERFACE TEST GUIDELINES

8.        Test and Compliance Process

The PIV software component that passes all applicable tests, as explained in this document,
will be considered conformant. This document provides the technical details for the testing of
the two PIV software components. In this context, compliance means:
      +    Passing the related test assertions explained in this document, and
      +    Passing the inspection/verification of the required vendor documentation.
The certified and/or accredited test laboratory that will conduct the testing has the following
responsibilities:
      +    Prepare and provide the test application forms and the documentation,
      +    Receive and configure the PIV software component to be tested,
      +    Conduct the test with the testing toolkit,
      +    Review the test results and report failures,
      +    Inspect the vendor documentation, and
      +    Communicate the results.
Upon vendorâ€™s submission of the request for PIV component certification, the required
documentation, and the PIV software components to be tested, the test laboratory configures
the test system, records all preconditions, and runs the applicable suite of tests for the
submitted PIV component. After conducting the tests, the test laboratory evaluates the test
results and communicates the Test Results Summary (TRS) and Test Run Details (TRD) to
the vendor.
The Test Results Summary provides the overall environmental information (date and time the
tests were conducted, the tester name, vendor product identifier, etc.) as well as the summary
conclusion for tests associated with that particular class. The format of the summary report
will vary depending upon the test classes. The TRS associated with each of the three classes
are:
      +    PIV Client API Test Summary.
      +    Card Command Interface Test Summary.
      +    PIV Data Objects Accessibility and Storage Test Summary.
The TRDs are used to log the details of each test run associated with each of the three classes
in the test suite. They provide the details of the outcome of each test run for various
execution conditions. This detailed report will enable the product vendor to make the
necessary logic changes to the implementation of the various commands/interfaces and data
object representations in order to become fully conformant.
8.1       Failure Review

The test will be repeated once for components that do not pass the tests. After the retest, the
tester prepares, for each failure, a discrepancy report that summarizes the purpose of the test,
the progression of steps, and the responses received from the tested components. The
discrepancy report will be internally reviewed and discussed by the test lab before an official
