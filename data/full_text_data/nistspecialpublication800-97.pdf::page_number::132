  SSID
             -   No security                 -   Place ESS on perimeter               - Move ESS back to internal
             -   AP1 and AP2 must be             network outside the firewall           network once newly procured
                 replaced because they       -   Require users to use client            WPA2-Enterprise equipment
                 do not support upgrades         VPN software to access                 is in place

             -   AP3 can be used in long-        internal network resources           - Use password
                 term solution because of    -   AP placed near the center of           synchronization or single
  WLAN1                                                                                 sign-on technology to reduce
                 WPA2-Enterprise                 the cubicle area, away from
                 certification                   windows and walls                      users’ concerns over burden
                                                                                        of new security measures
             -   Users insist on continued
                 use of WLAN regardless                                               - Disallow TKIP
                 of security posture
             -   AP placed near window
             -   WEP provides                -   Configure APs to use TKIP        -     Procure new WPA2-
                 inadequate security             with PSKs                              Enterprise APs to support
             -   All equipment can           -   Establish a temporary                  long-term solution
                 support TKIP but not            Transition Security Network      -     Disallow TKIP
                 CCMP                            (TSN) that permits both WEP
             -   AP4 and AP5 cannot              and TKIP associations
                 support IEEE 802.1X         -   Help users to transition to
                 solution because WPA-           TKIP
    GC
                 Personal equipment uses     -   Once it is verified that all
                 PSK approach only               STAs are using TKIP, remove
             -   Users already                   WEP support to establish an
                 comfortable with use of         RSN
                 PSKs because they are       -   TSN should be operational for
                 deployed in existing WEP        as short a period as possible,
                 configuration                   preferably no more than 72
                                                 hours
             -   ESS is already an RSN       -   Keep as is                       -     Replace AP7 and AP8 with
                 using IEEE 802.1X                                                      new WPA2-Enterprise APs
             -   RSN is based on TKIP,                                            -     Continue to support smart
                 not CCMP, which is                                                     cards in long-term solution if
                 required in the long-term                                              feasible
                 solution                                                         -     Disallow TKIP
    BAR
             -   AP7 and AP8 are not
                 able to support CCMP
                 and need to be replaced
             -   Smart cards provide high
                 level of authentication
                 assurance
