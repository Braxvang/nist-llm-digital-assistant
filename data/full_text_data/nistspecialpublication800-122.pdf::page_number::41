                                 GUIDE TO PROTECTING THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION (PII)



5. What is the Privacy Act?

     The Privacy Act of 1974 is the foundation of public sector privacy law in the U.S. It applies only to
     Federal agencies and provides a statutory basis for the required use of Fair Information Practices.
     The Privacy Act pertains only to data maintained within a System of Records (SOR), which means
     any ―group of any records under the control of any agency from which information is retrieved by the
     name of the individual or by some identifying number, symbol, or other identifying particular
     assigned to the individual.‖86 Record is defined broadly to include any item of information about an
     individual, both paper and electronic.

     The basic provisions of the Privacy Act include the following:

      Provide notice to individuals that explains: 87

          –    The authority for the data collection

          –    The purpose of the data collection

          –    Routine uses for the data

          –    Effects, if any, of not providing the information
      Limit collection of data to the minimum necessary to accomplish the purpose of the agency
      Collect information directly from the person about whom the information pertains, if possible
      Maintain accuracy and completeness of the data
      Disclose the data to only those who need access for proper purposes, such as sharing for an
       identified routine use or to perform agency work
      Allow individuals to access data pertaining to them, request correction of wrong or incomplete
       data, and make an appeal for denials of requests for access and correction
      Maintain appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to ensure the security and
       confidentiality of the records.
     Violations of the Privacy Act can result in civil and criminal liability.
     Most information contained within a Privacy Act SOR is considered to be PII, but not all PII is
     contained within a Privacy Act SOR. Organizations that seek to protect systems (e.g., via security
     controls) containing PII may be able to realize efficiencies by coordinating with efforts to comply
     with the Privacy Act, as these activities will often be similar.

6. What is a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA)? When do I need to conduct a PIA?

     The E-Government Act of 2002 required Federal agencies to conduct PIAs, which are processes for
     identifying and mitigating privacy risks within an information system. PIAs should address risk at
     every stage of the system development life cycle (SDLC). Most organizations have established their

     The Privacy Act also requires publication of general notice in the Federal Register, which is called a System of Records
     Notice (SORN).
