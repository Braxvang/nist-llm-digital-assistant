SP 800-152                                                                A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


                     CP-10        A Federal CKMS shall support the recovery of a system from
PR:6.83
                                  backups after the detection of an unauthorized system
                                  modification.
                                  A Federal CKMS shall respond to a computer operating-
PR:6.84
                                  system compromise as specified in the Compromise Recovery
                                  Plan.

                                  A Federal CKMS could automatically detect and report some
PF:6.6
                                  compromise types, obtain upgrades that will deter or prevent
                                  similar future compromises, and then return the system to a
                                  known secure state.

6.8.6 Network Security Controls and Compromise Recovery
A compromise of any network security control that provides protection to the
communications within an FCKMS could result in the compromise of the FCKMS itself,
including its keys. See Section 6.8.6 of the Framework for additional information.

Whenever network security has been compromised, the incident should be fully investigated
to determine what other systems and which keys may have been compromised due to the
compromise of the network.

FR:6.116 The CKMS design shall specify how to recover from the compromise of the
network security controls used by the system. Specifically,
       a) The CKMS design shall specify the compromise scenarios considered for each
          network security control device,
       b) The CKMS design shall specify which of the mitigation techniques specified in this
          section8 are to be employed for each envisioned compromise scenario, and
       c) The CKMS design shall specify any additional or alternative mitigation techniques
          that are to be employed.

                                  If network passwords are compromised, a Federal CKMS
PR:6.85
                                  shall:
                                       a) Replace any passwords that are compromised or
                                          suspected of being compromised,
                                       b) Notify entities that may be affected by the
                                          compromise,
                                       c) Perform an assessment of any damage that could have
                                          resulted to the FCKMS, and
                                       d) Take corrective actions that would reduce the
                                          likelihood of similar failures.
