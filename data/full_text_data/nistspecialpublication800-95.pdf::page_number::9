Executive Summary

The advance of Web services technologies promises to have far-reaching effects on the Internet and
enterprise networks. Web services based on the eXtensible Markup Language (XML), SOAP, and related
open standards, and deployed in Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) allow data and applications to
interact without human intervention through dynamic and ad hoc connections. Web services technology
can be implemented in a wide variety of architectures, can co-exist with other technologies and software
design approaches, and can be adopted in an evolutionary manner without requiring major
transformations to legacy applications and databases.

The security challenges presented by the Web services approach are formidable and unavoidable. Many
of the features that make Web services attractive, including greater accessibility of data, dynamic
application-to-application connections, and relative autonomy (lack of human intervention) are at odds
with traditional security models and controls. The primary purpose of this publication is to inform people
about securing Web services. Difficult issues and unsolved problems exist, such as protecting the
following:

 Confidentiality and integrity of data that is transmitted via Web services protocols in service-to-
  service transactions, including data that traverses intermediary services
 Functional integrity of the Web services that requires the establishment of trust between services on a
  transaction-by-transaction basis
 Availability in the face of denial of service attacks that exploit vulnerabilities unique to Web service
  technologies, especially targeting core services, such as discovery service, on which other services
  rely.
Perimeter-based network security technologies (e.g., firewalls) are inadequate to protect SOAs for the
following reasons:

 SOAs are dynamic and can seldom be fully constrained to the physical boundaries of a single
  network.
 SOAP is transmitted over HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which is allowed to flow without
  restriction through most firewalls.
Moreover, Transport Layer Security (TLS), which is used to authenticate and encrypt Web-based
messages, is inadequate for protecting SOAP messages because it is designed to operate between two
endpoints. TLS cannot accommodate Web services' inherent ability to forward messages to multiple
other Web services simultaneously.

The Web service processing model requires the ability to secure SOAP messages and XML documents as
they are forwarded along potentially long and complex chains of consumer, provider, and intermediary
services. The nature of Web services processing makes those services subject to unique attacks, as well
as variations on familiar attacks targeting Web servers.

Ensuring the security of Web services involves augmenting traditional security mechanisms with security
frameworks based on use of authentication, authorization, confidentiality, and integrity mechanisms. This
document describes how to implement those security mechanisms in Web services. It also discusses how
to make Web services and portal applications robust against the attacks to which they are subject. The
following is a summary of security techniques for Web services:
