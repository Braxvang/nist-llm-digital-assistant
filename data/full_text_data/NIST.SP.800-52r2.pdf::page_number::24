NIST SP 800-52 REV. 2                                                               GUIDELINES FOR TLS IMPLEMENTATIONS


preference order, and it may be different from the clientâ€™s. Therefore, there is no guarantee that
the negotiation will settle on the strongest common suite. If no cipher suites are common to the
client and server, the connection is aborted.

The server shall be configured to only use cipher suites that are composed entirely of NIST-
approved algorithms (i.e., [6, 7, 9, 26-28, 44-46, 49]). A complete list of acceptable cipher suites
for general use is provided in this section, grouped by certificate type and TLS protocol version.
The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) value for each cipher suite is given after its
text description in parentheses. 19

In some situations, such as closed environments, it may be appropriate to use pre-shared keys.
Pre-shared keys are symmetric keys that are already in place prior to the initiation of a TLS
session and are used in the derivation of the premaster secret. For cipher suites that are
acceptable in pre-shared key environments, see Appendix C.

NIST is deprecating the use of RSA key transport as used in TLS. Some applications or
environments may require the use of RSA key transport during a transition period. Acceptable
cipher suites for use in this situation are located in Appendix D.

The following cipher suite listings are grouped by certificate type and TLS protocol version. The
cipher suites in these lists include the cipher suites that contain NIST-approved cryptographic
algorithms. Cipher suites that do not appear in this section, Appendix C, or Appendix D shall
not be used.

Cipher suites using ephemeral DH and ephemeral ECDH (i.e., those with DHE or ECDHE in the
second mnemonic) provide perfect forward secrecy. 20 When ephemeral keys are used to establish
the master secret, each ephemeral key-pair (i.e., the server ephemeral key-pair and the client
ephemeral key-pair) shall have at least 112 bits of security.

3.3.1.1 Cipher Suites for TLS 1.2 and Earlier Versions

The first revision of this guidance required support for a small set of cipher suites to promote
interoperability and align with TLS specifications. There are no longer any mandatory cipher
suite requirements. Cipher suites that comprise AES and other NIST-approved algorithms are
acceptable to use, although they are not necessarily equal in terms of security. Cipher suites that
use the Triple Data Encryption Aglorithm (TDEA, also written as 3DES) are no longer allowed
due to the limited amounts of data that can be processed under a single key. The server shall be
configured to only use cipher suites for which it has a valid certificate containing a signature
providing at least 112 bits of security.

20 Perfect forward secrecy is the condition in which the compromise of a long-term private key after it has been used to establish

     a session key does not cause the compromise of that session key.
