GUIDE TO INTRUSION DETECTION AND PREVENTION SYSTEMS (IDPS)



For most environments, a combination of network-based and host-based IDPSs is needed for an effective
IDPS solution. Wireless IDPSs may also be needed if the organization determines that its wireless
networks need additional monitoring or if the organization wants to ensure that rogue wireless networks
are not in use in the organizationâ€™s facilities. NBA products can also be deployed if organizations desire
additional detection capabilities for denial of service (DoS) attacks, worms, and other threats as discussed
in Section 6.

In addition to using multiple types of IDPS technologies, some organizations also use multiple products
of the same IDPS technology type. This is often done to improve detection capabilities. Because each
product uses somewhat different detection methodologies and detects some events that another product
cannot, using multiple products can allow for more comprehensive detection of possible incidents. Also,
having multiple products in use, particularly to monitor the same activity, makes it easier for analysts to
confirm the validity of alerts and identify false positives, and also provides redundancy, should one
product fail for any reason.

8.2     Integrating Different IDPS Technologies

Many organizations use multiple IDPS products, usually from different vendors (most vendors make
products in only one IDPS technology type). By default, these products function completely
independently of each other. This has some notable benefits, such as minimizing the impact that a failure
or compromise of one IDPS product has on other IDPS products. However, if the products are not
integrated in any way, the effectiveness of the entire IDPS implementation may be somewhat limited.
Data cannot be shared by the products, and IDPS users and administrators may have to expend extra
effort to monitor and manage multiple sets of products. IDPS products can be directly integrated, such as
one product feeding alert data to another product, or they can be indirectly integrated, such as all the IDPS
products feeding alert data into a security information and event management system. Sections 8.2.1 and
8.2.2 discuss the benefits and limitations of direct and indirect integration, respectively.

8.2.1    Direct IDPS Integration

Direct IDPS integration is most often performed when an organization uses multiple IDPS products from
a single vendor. For example, some vendors offer both network-based and host-based products. These
vendors frequently offer a single console that can be used to manage and monitor both types of products.
This can provide significant time savings to administrators and users because it streamlines their work.
Some products also share data; for example, a product might use host-based IDPS data to determine if an
attack detected by network-based IDPS sensors was successful, or if an attack stopped by network-based
IDPS data would have been successful if allowed to pass. This information can speed the analysis
process and help users to better prioritize threats. The primary disadvantage of using a fully integrated
solution is that a failure or compromise could endanger all the IDPS technologies that are part of the
integrated solution.

A more limited form of direct IDPS integration is having one IDPS product provide data for another IDPS
product. As mentioned previously, two products from the same vendor often share data with each other
for correlation purposes. Data can also be shared among products from different vendors, although
typically this simply involves one product providing data as input to the second product. For example, a
network-based IDPS could potentially provide network flow information to an NBA sensor. A host-
based IDPS could provide system configuration information to NBA or network-based IDPS sensors.
This data can be used for event correlation and better prioritization of alerts.
