APPENDIX F

SECURITY CONTROL CATALOG
SECURITY CONTROLS, SUPPLEMENTAL GUIDANCE, AND CONTROL ENHANCEMENTS




T
       he following catalog of security controls provides a range of safeguards and
       countermeasures for information systems. The security controls are organized into
       families for ease of use in the control selection and specification process. Each family
contains security controls related to the security functionality of the family. A standardized, two-
character identifier is assigned to uniquely identify each control family. To uniquely identify
each control, a numeric identifier is appended to the family identifier to indicate the number of
the control within the control family.

The security control structure consists of three key components: (i) a control section; (ii) a
supplemental guidance section; and (iii) a control enhancements section. The control section
provides a concise statement of the specific security capability needed to protect a particular
aspect of an information system. The control statement describes specific security-related
activities or actions to be carried out by the organization or by the information system. For some
controls in the control catalog, a degree of flexibility is provided by allowing organizations to
selectively define input values for certain parameters associated with the controls. This flexibility
is achieved through the use of assignment and selection operations within the control.

The supplemental guidance section provides additional information related to a specific security
control. Organizations are expected to apply the supplemental guidance as appropriate, when
defining, developing, and implementing security controls. In certain instances, the supplemental
guidance provides more detail concerning the control requirements or important considerations
(and the needed flexibility) for implementing security controls in the context of an organization’s
operational environment, specific mission requirements, or assessment of risk. In addition,
applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance
documents (e.g., OMB Circulars, FIPS, and NIST Special Publications) are listed in the
supplemental guidance section, when appropriate, for the particular security control. 50

The control enhancements section provides statements of security capability to: (i) build in
additional, but related, functionality to a basic control; and/or (ii) increase the strength of a basic
control. In both cases, the control enhancements are used in an information system requiring
greater protection due to the potential impact of loss or when organizations seek additions to a
basic control’s functionality based on the results of a risk assessment. Control enhancements are
numbered sequentially within each control so the enhancements can be easily identified when
selected to supplement the basic control. The numerical designation of a security control
enhancement is used only to identify a particular enhancement within the control structure. The
designation is neither indicative of the relative strength of the control enhancement nor assumes
any hierarchical relationship among enhancements.

  NIST Special Publications listed in the supplemental guidance sections of security controls are assumed to refer to
the most recent updates to those publications. For example, a reference to NIST Special Publication 800-18 refers to
the Special Publication 800-18, Revision 1, which is the latest version of the security planning guideline.
