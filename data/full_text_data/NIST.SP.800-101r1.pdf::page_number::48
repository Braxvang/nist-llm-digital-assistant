                                                                      Guidelines on Mobile Device Forensics

             device and obtain its specifications and features.15 Coverage is considerable, but not
             extensive nor complete, and may require consulting more than one repository before
             making a match.

            Device Interface – The power connector can be specific to a manufacturer and may
             provide clues for device identification. With familiarization and experience, the
             manufacturers of certain mobile devices may be readily identified. Similarly, the size,
             number of contacts, and shape of the data cable interface are often specific to a
             particular manufacturer and may prove helpful in identification.

            Device Label – For mobile devices that are inactive, information obtained from
             within the battery cavity may be of assistance, particularly when coupled with an
             appropriate database. The manufacturer’s label often lists the make and model number
             of the mobile device and also unique identifiers, such as the Federal Communications
             Commission Identification Number (FCC ID) and an equipment identifier (IMEI or
             MEID). The FCC and equipment identifiers may be found on mobile devices sold in
             the U.S. domestic market.

             For all mobile devices that use a UICC, the identity module is typically located under
             the battery and imprinted with a unique identifier called the Integrated Circuit Card
             Identification (ICCID). For powered on GSM and UMTS phones, the International
             Mobile Equipment Identifier (IMEI) may be obtained by keying in *#06#. Similar
             codes exist for obtaining the Electronic Serial Number (ESN) or Mobile Equipment
             Identifier (MEID) from powered on CDMA phones. Various sites on the Internet
             offer databases that provide information about the mobile device based on an
             identifier, such as the following:

                 The IMEI is a 15-digit number that indicates the manufacturer, model type, and
                  country of approval for GSM devices. The initial 8-digit portion of the IMEI,
                  known as the Type Allocation Code (TAC), gives the model and origin. The
                  remainder of the IMEI is manufacturer specific, with a check digit at the end
                  [GSM04]. A database lookup service is available from the GSM numbering plan
                  Web site.16

                 The ESN is a 32-bit identifier recorded on a secure chip in a mobile device by the
                  manufacturer. The first 8-14 bits identify the manufacturer and the remaining bits
                  represent the assigned serial number. Many mobile devices have codes that can be
                  input into the handset to display the ESN. Hidden menus may also be activated on
                  certain mobile devices by placing them in “test mode” through the input of a
                  code. Besides the ESN, other useful information such as the phone number of the
                  device may be obtained. Manufacturer codes may be checked online at the
                  Telecommunications Industry Association Web site.17
