                                                                  COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE



 Lack of Correlation. Correlation among multiple data sources is very important. If the intrusion
  detection system records an attempted attack against a web server, but the outsourcer has no access to
  the server’s logs, it may be unable to determine whether the attack was successful. To be efficient, the
  outsourcer will require administrative privileges to critical systems and security device logs remotely
  over a secure channel. This will increase administration costs, introduce additional access entry
  points, and increase the risk of unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information.
 Handling Incidents at Multiple Locations. Effective incident response work often requires a
  physical presence at the organization’s facilities. If the outsourcer is offsite, consider where the
  outsourcer is located, how quickly it can have an incident response team at any facility, and how
  much this will cost. Consider onsite visits; perhaps there are certain facilities or areas where the
  outsourcer should not be permitted to work.
 Maintaining Incident Response Skills In-House. Organizations that completely outsource incident
  response should strive to maintain basic incident response skills in-house. Situations may arise in
  which the outsourcer is unavailable, so the organization should be prepared to perform its own
  incident handling. The organization’s technical staff must also be able to understand the significance,
  technical implications, and impact of the outsourcer’s recommendations.
2.4.3   Incident Response Personnel

A single employee, with one or more designated alternates, should be in charge of incident response. In a
fully outsourced model, this person oversees and evaluates the outsourcer’s work. All other models
generally have a team manager and one or more deputies who assumes authority in the absence of the
team manager. The managers typically perform a variety of tasks, including acting as a liaison with upper
management and other teams and organizations, defusing crisis situations, and ensuring that the team has
the necessary personnel, resources, and skills. Managers should be technically adept and have excellent
communication skills, particularly an ability to communicate to a range of audiences. Managers are
ultimately responsible for ensuring that incident response activities are performed properly.

In addition to the team manager and deputy, some teams also have a technical lead—a person with strong
technical skills and incident response experience who assumes oversight of and final responsibility for the
quality of the team’s technical work. The position of technical lead should not be confused with the
position of incident lead. Larger teams often assign an incident lead as the primary POC for handling a
specific incident; the incident lead is held accountable for the incident’s handling. Depending on the size
of the incident response team and the magnitude of the incident, the incident lead may not actually
perform any actual incident handling, but rather coordinate the handlers’ activities, gather information
from the handlers, provide incident updates to other groups, and ensure that the team’s needs are met.

Members of the incident response team should have excellent technical skills, such as system
administration, network administration, programming, technical support, or intrusion detection. Every
team member should have good problem solving skills and critical thinking abilities. It is not necessary
for every team member to be a technical expert—to a large degree, practical and funding considerations
will dictate this—but having at least one highly proficient person in each major area of technology (e.g.,
commonly attacked operating systems and applications) is a necessity. It may also be helpful to have
some team members specialize in particular technical areas, such as network intrusion detection, malware
analysis, or forensics. It is also often helpful to temporarily bring in technical specialists that aren’t
normally part of the team.

It is important to counteract staff burnout by providing opportunities for learning and growth. Suggestions
for building and maintaining skills are as follows:
