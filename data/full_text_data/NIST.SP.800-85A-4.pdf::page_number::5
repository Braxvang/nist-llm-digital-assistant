                                  ALIGNING REVISION NUMBERS

       WHAT HAPPENED TO SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-85A REVISION 3 (SP 800-85A-3)?

     Revision numbers between NIST Special Publications 800-73 and 800-85A were misaligned
       from the start because the initial publication of SP 800-85A did not occur until after the
       publication of SP 800-73 Revision 1 (SP 800-73-1). This resulted in versions of the two
   documents corresponding as follows: SP 800-73-1 with SP 800-85A; SP 800-73-2 with SP 800-
                    85A-1 (i.e., Revision 1); and SP 800-73-3 with SP 800-85A-2.

    This revision numbering mismatch created ongoing uncertainty and confusion regarding which
       revision of SP 800-85A was consistent with which revision of SP 800-73. To reduce this
   uncertainty going forward, revision number 3 has been skipped for SP 800-85A, and the present
    version of SP 800-85A has been given revision number 4 (SP 800-85A-4) since this version is
   consistent with the updates to SP 800-73 Revision 4 (SP 800-73-4). Future revisions of SPs 800-
                    73 and 800-85A will maintain the revision number consistency.
