NIST SP 800-85A-4                                               PIV CARD APPLICATION & MIDDLEWARE
                                                                         INTERFACE TEST GUIDELINES

the VCI, then the card command shall fail. In each case, the security status and the retry
counter of the key reference shall remain unchanged.

Required Vendor Information

VE05.24A-R4.01: The vendor shall state in its documentation that the card supports the assertion
made in AS05.24A-R4.

Required Test Procedures

TE05.24A-R4.01: The tester shall validate that if the CHANGE REFERENCE DATA command is
submitted over the contactless interface (including SM or VCI) with key reference '81', the PIV Card
Application fails. The tester shall validate that if the CHANGE REFERENCE DATA command,
with key reference '00' or '80', is submitted over the contactless interface, but not the VCI, then the
card command fails. In both cases, the tester shall validate that the security status and the retry
counter of the key reference remain unchanged.

AS05.25: If the current value of the retry counter associated with the key reference is zero,
then the reference data associated with the key reference shall not be changed and the PIV
Card Application shall return the status word '69 83' (Reference data change operation
blocked). If the command is submitted over the contactless interface (VCI) and the current
value of the retry counter associated with the key reference is at or below the issuer-specified
intermediate retry value (see Section 3.2.1 of Part 2 of SP 800-73-4), then the reference data
associated with the key reference shall not be changed and the PIV Card Application shall
return the status word '69 83'.

Required Vendor Information

VE05.25.01: The vendor shall state in its documentation that the card supports the assertion made in
AS05.25.

Required Test Procedures

TE05.25.01: The tester shall validate that when the current value of the retry counter associated
with the key reference is zero, the reference data associated with the key reference does not change
and the PIV Card Application returns '69 83' (Reference data change operation blocked). The tester
shall validate that when the CHANGE REFERENCE DATA command is submitted over the VCI
and the current value of the retry counter associated with the key reference is at or below the issuer-
specified intermediate retry value, the reference data associated with the key reference does not
change and the PIV Card Application returns '69 83'.

AS05.25A-R4: If the authentication data in the command data field does not match the current
value of the reference data or if either the authentication data or the new reference data in the
command data field of the command does not satisfy the criteria in Section 2.4.3 of Part 2 of
SP 800-73-4, the PIV Card Application shall not change the reference data associated with the
key reference and shall return either status word '6A 80' or '63 CX', with the following
restrictions:
