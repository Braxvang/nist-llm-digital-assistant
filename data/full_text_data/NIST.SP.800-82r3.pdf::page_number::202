        •    [N][D] Hatch Nuclear Power Plant. 33 In 2008, the Hatch nuclear power plant in
             Georgia was forced into an emergency shutdown for forty-eight hours after a software
             update was installed on a single Windows computer. When the updated computer
             rebooted, it reset the data on the control system, causing safety systems to errantly
             interpret the lack of data as a drop in water reservoirs that cool the plant’s
             radioactive nuclear fuel rods. As a result, automated safety systems at the plant
             triggered a shutdown.
