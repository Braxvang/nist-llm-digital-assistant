of this document. In large federal systems, these functions are frequently handled by
system administrators or completed with direct guidance from system administrators. For
end users faced with these tasks on their own, an informative appendix has been included
with general information intended to point the end user in the right direction.

Since some of the infrastructures, protocols and applications addressed in this
Recommendation will be refined or replaced over time, the guidance provided herein will
become obsolete. Similarly, it is anticipated that new infrastructures, protocols, and
applications will be developed. Although this document will be updated as mechanisms
and techniques evolve, it may not always reflect a comprehensive view of current
products and technical specifications. Hence, references to version numbers or other
implementation status information are provided to enable an evaluation of the
applicability of particular elements of guidance to the specific version of an
infrastructure, protocol, or application into which a mechanism is integrated.

Note that many of the applications described in Part 3 are currently in use by U.S.
government agencies. Some of these applications were developed and implemented prior
to the release of Part 1 of this Recommendation, and therefore, may not follow all of the
principles identified in Part 1 [SP 800-57 Part 1]. The use of current implementations of
these applications may be necessary until more carefully designed applications are
available. It is very important that each implementation that does not comply with NIST
standards and guidelines be evaluated for associated risks and that steps be taken to
mitigate those risks as discussed in this Recommendation.


1.2 Requirement Terms
This Recommendation often uses “requirement” terms; these terms have the following
meaning in this document:
   1. shall: This term is used to indicate a requirement of a Federal Information
      Processing Standard (FIPS) or a requirement that must be fulfilled to claim
      conformance to this Recommendation. Note that shall may be coupled with not to
      become shall not.
   2. should: This term is used to indicate an important recommendation. Ignoring the
      recommendation could result in undesirable results. Ignoring recommendations to
      accommodate the acceptance of messages protected with commonly used,
      unapproved cryptography may create interoperability issues. Ignoring
      recommendations to select new products with approved, seldom-used
      cryptographic mechanisms may leave an organization ill-prepared to migrate
      away from mechanisms that will soon be inappropriate for the protection of
      federal systems. Note that should may be coupled with not to become should
      not.

1.3 General Protocol Considerations
There are a number of general issues associated with the protocols discussed in Part 3.
Four of these issues are briefly discussed in order to familiarize the reader with concepts
