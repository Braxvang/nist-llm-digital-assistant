Special Publication 800-85B                                  PIV Data Model Testing Specification


Precondition            1.    A valid PIV card is inserted into the contact reader.
                        2.    A valid PC/SC connection exists between the test application and
                              the contact reader.
                        3.    The test application is currently connected to the card application
                              which is accessible through card handle.
                        4.    A PIV authentication key and corresponding certificate are present
                              on the PIV card.
                        5.    A valid CHUID is present on the PIV card.
Test Steps              1. Set cardHandle := <<valid card handle>>
                        2. Set OID := <<PIV Authentication certificate
                           (2.16.840.1.101.3.7.2.1.1)>>
                        3. Call pivGetData w/
                           • (IN) cardHandle
                              • (IN) OID
                              • (OUT) data
                        4. Extract validity->notAfter->utcTime field value from
                           the certificate
                        5. Set OID := << CHUID (2.16.840.1.103.3.7.2.48.0)>>
                        6. Call pivGetData with the following parameters
                           • (IN) cardHandle
                              • (IN) OID
                              • (OUT) data
                        7. Parse the CHUID and extract the expiration date
Expected Result(s)      The expiration date of the PIV authentication certificate is not beyond
                        the expiration date of the CHUID i.e. the PIV card.


11.1.2.8 Verify RSA exponent

Purpose                 For RSA keys, confirms that the exponent of the RSA asymmetric key
                        for PIV authentication is greater than or equal to 65,537.

Precondition            1.    A valid PIV card is inserted into the contact reader.
                        2.    A valid PC/SC connection exists between the test application and
                              the contact reader.
                        3.    The test application is currently connected to the card application
                              which is accessible through card handle.
                        4.    A PIV authentication key and corresponding certificate are present
                              on the PIV card.
