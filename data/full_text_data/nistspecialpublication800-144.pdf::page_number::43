          Denial of Service. A denial of service attack involves saturating the target with bogus
           requests to prevent it from responding to legitimate requests in a timely manner. An
           attacker typically uses multiple computers or a botnet to launch an assault. Even an
           unsuccessful distributed denial of service attack can quickly consume large amounts of
           resources to defend against and cause charges to soar. The dynamic provisioning of a
           cloud in some ways simplifies the work of an attacker to cause harm. While the
           resources of a cloud are significant, with enough attacking computers they can become
           saturated [Jen09]. For example, a denial of service attack against a code hosting site
           operating over an IaaS cloud resulted in more than 19 hours of downtime [Bro09,
           Met09].

           In addition to attacks against publicly available services accessible via the Internet, denial
           of service attacks can occur against internally accessible services, such as those used in
           cloud management [Mee09, Sla09]. Internally assigned non-routable addresses, used to
           manage resources within a cloud provider’s network, may also be used as an attack
           vector. A worst-case possibility that exists is for elements of one cloud to attack those of
           another or to attack some of its own elements [Jen09].

4.9       Incident Response
As the name implies, incident response involves an organized method for dealing with the
consequences of an attack against the security of a computer system. The cloud provider’s role
is vital in performing incident response activities, including incident verification, attack analysis,
containment, data collection and preservation, problem remediation, and service restoration.
Each layer in a cloud application stack, including the application, operating system, network, and
database, generates event logs, as do other cloud components, such as load balancers and
intrusion detection systems; many such event sources and the means of accessing them are under
the control of the cloud provider.

The complexity of a cloud service can obscure recognition and analysis of incidents. For
example, it reportedly took one IaaS provider approximately eight hours to recognize and begin
taking action on an apparent denial of service attack against its cloud infrastructure, after the
issue was reported by a consumer of the service [Bro09, Met09]. Revising an organization’s
incident response plan to address differences between the organizational computing environment
and a cloud computing environment is an important, but easy-to-overlook prerequisite to
transitioning applications and data.

          Data Availability. The availability of relevant data from event monitoring is essential
           for timely detection of security incidents. Cloud consumers are often confronted with
           extremely limited capabilities for detection of incidents in public cloud environments
           [Gro10]. Prominent issues include insufficient access to event sources and vulnerability
           information under the control of the cloud provider, inadequate interfaces for accessing
           and processing event data automatically, inability to add detection points within the cloud
           infrastructure, and difficulty directing third-party reported abuses and incidents
           effectively back to the correct consumer or the cloud provider for handling. The situation
           varies among cloud service models and cloud providers [Gro10]. For example, PaaS
           providers typically do not make event logs available to consumers, who are then left
