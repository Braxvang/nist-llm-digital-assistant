implemented and the resulting effect(s) on the organization’s information security posture. For
example, the percentage of enterprise operating system vulnerabilities for which patches have
been applied or that have been otherwise mitigated is both an implementation and effectiveness
measure. It measures the implementation of the security control Flaw Remediation (SI-2) in SP
800-53 because the result of the measure demonstrates whether or not vulnerabilities are
mitigated through patches or other means. At the same time, the result indicates the effectiveness
of the Security Alerts and Advisories (SI-5) security control because any result less than the
target indicates a lack of ability to receive alerts and use them to successfully mitigate
vulnerabilities.

Effectiveness/efficiency measures address two aspects of security control implementation
results: the robustness of the result itself, referred to as effectiveness, and the timeliness of the
result, referred to as efficiency. For example, the effectiveness/efficiency measure—percentage
of information security incidents caused by improperly configured access controls—relies on
information regarding the implementation and effectiveness of the following security controls:
Incident Monitoring (IR-5); Audit Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting (AU-6); and Monitoring
Configuration Changes (CM-4).

Additionally, the effectiveness/efficiency measure—the percentage of system components that
undergo maintenance on schedule—relies on information regarding the efficiency of the
following security controls: Periodic Maintenance (MA-2) and Life Cycle Support (SA-3).

Effectiveness/efficiency measures provide key information for information security decision
makers about the results of previous policy and acquisition decisions. These measures can offer
insight for improving performance of information security programs. Furthermore,
effectiveness/efficiency measures can be used as a data source for continuous monitoring efforts
because they help determine the effectiveness of security controls. The results of
effectiveness/efficiency measures can be used to ascertain whether selected security controls are
functioning properly and are helping facilitate corrective action prioritization.

Effectiveness/efficiency measures may require fusing information security program activities
data with the data obtained from automated monitoring and evaluation tools in a manner that can
be directly tied to security controls implementation.

3.3.3   Impact Measures

Impact measures are used to articulate the impact of information security on an organization’s
mission. These measures are inherently organization-specific since each organization has a
unique mission. Depending upon the organization’s mission, impact measures can be used to
quantify:

    •   Cost savings produced by the information security program or through costs incurred
        from addressing information security events;

    •   The degree of public trust gained/maintained by the information security program; or

    •   Other mission-related impacts of information security.
