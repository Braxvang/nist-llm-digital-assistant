B.3            Notation

The sixteen hexadecimal digits shall be denoted using the alphanumeric characters 0, 1, 2, …, 9, A, B, C,
D, E, and F. A byte consists of two hexadecimal digits, for example, '2D'. The two hexadecimal digits are
represented in quotations '2D' or as 0x2D. A sequence of bytes may be enclosed in single quotation
marks, for example 'A0 00 00 01 16', rather than given as a sequence of individual bytes, 'A0' '00' '00' '01'
'16'.

A byte can also be represented by bits b8 to b1, where b8 is the most significant bit (MSB) and b1 is the
least significant bit (LSB) of the byte. In textual or graphic representations, the leftmost bit is the MSB.
Thus, for example, the most significant bit, b8, of '80' is 1 and the least significant bit, b1, is 0.

All bytes specified as RFU shall be set to '00' and all bits specified as RFU use shall be set to 0.

All lengths shall be measured in number of bytes unless otherwise noted.

The expression X & Y is a bitwise AND operation between bytes X and Y.

The symbol || means concatenation of byte strings. For example, if X is '00 01 02' and Y is '03 04 05', then
X || Y is '00 01 02 03 04 05'.

Data objects in templates are described as being mandatory (M), optional (O), or conditional (C).
'Mandatory' means the data object shall appear in the template. 'Optional' means the data object may
