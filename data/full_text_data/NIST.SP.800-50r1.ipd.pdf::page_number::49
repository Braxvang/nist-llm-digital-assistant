       NIST SP 800-50r1 ipd                                                       Building a Cybersecurity and
       August 2023                                                                  Privacy Learning Program

1426      •   Content and environmental scan (e.g., build or buy)
1427      •   A course outline, including high-level topics (e.g., number of lessons or modules and
1428          their length)
1429      •   An instructional strategy that includes media (e.g., audio, video, demonstrations,
1430          emulations, simulations), activities, and exercises
1431      •   Delivery medium (i.e., the learning environment – online, classroom, etc.)
1432      •   Types of assessments (e.g., participation, quiz with passing grade, performance-based
1433          skill assessment, etc.)
1434      •   Required measurements and metrics
1435      •   Signature page to document acceptance from the key stakeholders
1436   Based on its resources, the organization will determine whether it can build, have built, or utilize
1437   existing government or commercial off-the-shelf learning content, which is discussed further in
1438   Section 4.

1439          Conduct an Environmental Scan of Available Training
1440   The Learning Program Manager will need to determine what training materials have previously
1441   been used in their organization and are still available and appropriate for use. Additionally, there
1442   may be materials and programs available from elsewhere in the organization, agency, or partner
1443   agencies. Federal resources may have materials, presentations, and even speakers available to
1444   satisfy a variety of learning goals. An important result of the environmental scan effort will be
1445   insight into what is currently being done to meet learning requirements in the organization and
1446   the gap in needed program material.

1447   3.3.1. External Sources of CPLP Material
1448   There are a variety of external sources of cybersecurity and privacy learning program material
1449   that can be incorporated into a CPLP. Some possible sources include:
1450      •   Vendors: If the organization decides to outsource some or all of its CPLP course
1451          development, a number of vendors in the private sector offer “off-the-shelf” courses that
1452          are suitable for particular audiences or that can be developed for specific audiences. Prior
1453          to selecting a particular vendor, agencies should have a thorough understanding of their
1454          CPLP needs and be able to determine whether a prospective vendor’s material meets
1455          them. Also, consider who “owns” the material for the purposes of future updates and
1456          adaptations. Be sure to check with the agency contracting officer to ensure that
1457          organizational guidelines are met.
1458      •   Non-profit organizations and grant-based agreements: Federal organizations may
1459          have agreements with non-profit organizations, grants to universities, or other similar
1460          arrangements for the creation of educational materials on cybersecurity or privacy topics.
1461          Learning Program Managers should be aware of any such opportunities to leverage these
1462          materials.
