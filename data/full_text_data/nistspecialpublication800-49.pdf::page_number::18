                                Federal S/MIME V3 Client Profile


        establish certificate status for path validation. At a minimum, the following aspects of
        path validation MUST be implemented:
            • certificate policies, policy constraints, and policy mapping
            • basic constraints
            • name constraints for distinguished names and RFC822 names
            • DSA parameter inheritance
            • processing certification paths with multiple signature algorithms
            • name chaining
            • signature verification
            • validity date checking
            • revocation checking by processing CRLs
            • key usage/extended key usage
            • CRL distribution points
            • CRL entry extensions: invalidity date, reason code.

2.4.4   Path Building
        Although not described in [RFC3280], path building is an important aspect of PKI-
        enabled applications. S/MIME implementations MUST be able to construct certification
        paths between an accepted trust point and a sender's or a recipient's certificate(s). Path
        building algorithms are not specified in any standard or specification. However, a variety
        of resources are available to assist in path building using heuristic methods. These
        resources include standard directory attributes and a variety of supplementary
        information in certificate extensions. S/MIME implementations MUST be able to take
        advantage of this information to provide complete path building services. At a minimum,
        the following features MUST be supported:
        • retrieve CRLs using LDAP from the following directory attributes:
            • certificate revocation list, and
            • authority revocation list.
        • retrieve certificates using LDAP from the following directory attributes:
            • Cross certificate pair,
            • CA certificate, and
            • user certificate.
        • locate certificates in directory entries through at least one of the following methods:
            • Authority Information Access (AIA) extension,
            • Subject Information Access (SIA) extension, or
            • retrieval from a well-known directory.
        • locate CRLs in directory entries through both of the following methods:
            • CRL distribution point extension, and
            • retrieval from a well-known directory.

        The use of the above features is intended to allow implementations to build certification
        paths in non-hierarchical PKIs (e.g., across bridge PKIs.)
