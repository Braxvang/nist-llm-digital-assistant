SP 800-152                                                 A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


FR:10.4 The CKMS design shall specify the strategy for backup and recovery from
failures of hardware components and devices.

              CP-9 (+2)     A Federal CKMS shall perform initial and periodic tests of
PR:10.15
                            backup and recovery capabilities of its critical FCKMS
                            modules and devices.
                            A Federal CKMS shall test the backup and recovery of
PR:10.16
                            services requiring high availability at least annually or in
                            accordance with a Service Level Agreement.
                            A Federal CKMS shall perform tests of security-critical
PR:10.17
                            hardware monthly or in accordance with a Service Level
                            Agreement.
                            A Federal CKMS shall repair or replace failed critical
PR:10.18
                            hardware and be returned to operational status within 24
                            hours of a failure or in accordance with a Service Level
                            Agreement.

                            A Federal CKMS could repair or replace failed hardware and
PF:10.4
                            be returned to operational status within one hour of a failure
                            when high availability is required.
                            A Federal CKMS could automatically verify the operational
PF:10.5
                            readiness of its backup services.

10.5 System Software Failure

Software errors can have security results ranging from minor problems to catastrophic
failures. Corrupted software must be detected using integrity tests and replaced as soon
as possible if errors are found; such tests include the computation of cryptographic error-
detection codes (e.g., message authentication codes and digital signatures) and other
values determined by the code itself (i.e., known answers) that are periodically
recomputed on the currently used software for comparison with the originally computed
values to verify that the software is still correct. If an error is detected, an error state
should be entered, and an error report should be sent to the FCKMS management.

When a primary FCKMS facility is restored from backup, the most recent information
since the last secure state was backed up could be missing, since it was not included in
the backup. Full secure-state FCKMS backups should be performed on a regular basis,
and the latest FCKMS secure state should be reloaded into a repaired-and-ready FCKMS
component or device upon the detection of a software failure.

Note that when a primary FCKMS facility is restored from backup, the most recent
information since the last secure state was backed up could be missing, since it may have
not been included in the backup.
