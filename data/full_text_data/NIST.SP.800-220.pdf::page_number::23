•   NISTIR 8286B describes ways to apply risk analysis to help prioritize cybersecurity risk,
    evaluate and select appropriate risk responses, and communicate risk activities as part of an
    enterprise cybersecurity risk management strategy.
•   NISTIR 8286C describes the processes for aggregating information from cybersecurity risk
    management (CSRM) activities throughout the enterprise. As that information is integrated and
    harmonized, organizational and enterprise leaders monitor the achievement of risk objectives,
    consider any changes to risk strategy, and use the combined information to maintain awareness
    of risk factors and positive risks (or opportunities).
By ensuring that cybersecurity decisions are based on enterprise leaders’ expectations and
by ensuring effective communication at all levels (such as through the use of the CSRR), risk
management activities throughout the enterprise can be conducted in a more consistent manner
and will remain well aligned with enterprise objectives.
Advancing the Application of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework
NIST has continued to foster the adoption and application of the Framework for Improving Critical
Infrastructure Cybersecurity (NIST Cybersecurity Framework, Version 1.1). NIST has participated
in a range of public events to develop and assist users in using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, those events were held virtually and included a cybersecurity risk
management webinar series that was co-hosted by the Center for Cybersecurity Policy and Law.
NIST helps organizations use the Cybersecurity Framework by developing sector-specific
resources and by documenting the relationships among many NIST and non-NIST resources.
Additionally, NIST released a Cybersecurity Framework Quick Start Guide (NIST SP 1271) to help
any organization seeking to improve cybersecurity risk management by using the Cybersecurity
Framework.
The NIST Cybersecurity Framework website continues to expand with learning materials, success
stories, and other helpful resources. In 2021, NIST developed a specific website for international
cybersecurity and privacy resources that includes information on translations and adaptations of
the Cybersecurity Framework as well as ongoing international engagement and relevant standards
development efforts. This has contributed to progress in encouraging a global use of the framework
and interoperability with other cybersecurity models. The website now contains translations of the
framework into Arabic, Bulgarian, Indonesian, Japanese, Polish, Portuguese, and Spanish.
NIST also contributes to international standards development efforts related to cybersecurity
risk management and the development of cybersecurity frameworks, including the International
Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) Technical
Specification 27110:2021, Information technology, cybersecurity, and privacy protection –
Cybersecurity framework development guidelines, that was published in 2021. This document
specifies guidelines for developing a cybersecurity framework and notes that all cybersecurity
frameworks should have the following concepts that align with the Cybersecurity Framework’s five
functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover.
Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management (C-SCRM) Program
NIST continued work on the Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management (C-SCRM) program.
C SCRM is the process of identifying, assessing, and responding to risks associated with the
distributed and interconnected nature of information, communications, and operational technology
product and service supply chains. C-SCRM is integrated into systems security engineering (SSE)
