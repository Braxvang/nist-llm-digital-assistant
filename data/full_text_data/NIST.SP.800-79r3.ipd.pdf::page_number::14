      NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                   Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
      December 2023                                                          and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

329       Introduction
330   Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 [HSPD-12], Policy for a Common Identification
331   Standard for Federal Employees and Contractors, was issued on August 27, 2004, to enhance
332   security, increase Federal Government efficiency, reduce identity fraud, and protect personal
333   privacy. This Directive established a federal policy to create and use secure and reliable forms of
334   identification for federal employees and contractors. It further defined secure and reliable forms
335   of identification as those that:
336       •   Are issued based on sound criteria for verifying an individual’s identity;
337       •   Are strongly resistant to identity fraud, tampering, counterfeiting, and terrorist
338           exploitation;
339       •   Can be rapidly authenticated electronically; and
340       •   Are only issued by providers whose reliability has been established by an official
341           accreditation process.
342   NIST developed and published Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 201, Personal
343   Identity Verification (PIV) of Federal Employees and Contractors [FIPS201], and several
344   Special Publications that provide additional specifications in response to [HSPD-12]. These
345   documents provide the foundation for personal identification, verification, and access control
346   systems across the Federal Government.
347   To standardize the operations of PIV Card issuers, NIST developed a set of attributes to assess
348   reliability and published the first version of SP 800-79 in July of 2005. Lessons learned through
349   various implementation approaches, experience in credential management and PIV Card
350   issuance, and the introduction of mobile device-integrated PIV credentials (i.e., derived PIV
351   credentials) motivated NIST to update the set of issuer controls and associated methodology to
352   ensure that they were objective and efficient and would result in consistent and repeatable
353   authorization decisions. With advancements in technology and the need for flexibility, [FIPS201]
354   expanded the set of derived credentials beyond those that are PKI-based and broadened their use
355   to other types of devices in addition to mobile devices. The technical details for the expanded set
356   of derived PIV credentials is specified in SP 800-157r1, Guidelines for Derived Personal Identity
357   Verification (PIV) Credentials [SP800-157]. This revision of SP 800-79 (i.e., SP 800-79r3)
358   reflects the updates to [FIPS201], [SP800-157], and other supporting publications.
359   This document uses the common term “issuer” to refer to issuers of both PIV Cards and derived
360   PIV credentials unless it is necessary to differentiate them. An issuer is considered to be owned,
361   managed, or outsourced (in part or as a whole) by an organization that is a federal department or
362   agency. Ensuring the reliability of an issuer is of critical importance to establishing secure and
363   reliable forms of identification and protecting the privacy of millions of government employees
364   and contractors. Controlling access to physical and logical resources through the use of standard
365   credentials provides assurance that certain predefined levels of security can be achieved. All
366   relying-party organizations must also have confidence in the credentials that it issues to its own
367   employees and contractors as well as those issued by other organizations. This confidence can
368   only be established if the issuer’s functions in those other organizations are assessed and
369   authorized. Thus, authorization of the issuer plays a key role in meeting the objectives of
370   [HSPD-12].
