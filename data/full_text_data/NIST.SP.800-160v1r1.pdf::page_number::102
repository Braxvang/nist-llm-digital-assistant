Note: The selected response to a detected anomaly considers three factors to determine the effect that the
response has on the loss and the system:
-   The effectiveness and aggressiveness of the engineered response to directly address the anomaly and
    to prevent or limit the loss
-   The direct, residual, or side effect of the response on the system
-   The opportunities that remain to take other response actions should the selected response fail to
    achieve the intended result
Responses can be achieved by a combination of manual, semi-automated, fully automated, or autonomous
means. However, the response action is distinct from the determination that a response is necessary and
from the notification or signaling that invokes the response action.
Commensurate responses require consideration of the response-effect-consequence relationship
associated with a specific loss. Ideally, for any given need for a response, a single action taken will be
effective to resolve the loss concern and will have no associated adverse effect. Practically, due to
complexity and the limits of certainty, the response action may not have the desired effect, may
compound the problem, or may cause another problem. The balance required is one that determines if,
when, and how a response action should be taken to be initially more aggressive or initially less
aggressive. The severity of the problem and the time available for an effective response dictate a strategy
for a continuum of responses, characterized by two extremes:
-   Graduated Response: A graduated response is initially the least aggressive or impactful action
    possible to prevent the loss from continuing or escalating and does so with consideration of the
    possible side effects associated with the response action. The graduated response allows for taking
    increasingly more aggressive action should the loss situation persist or escalate.
-   Ungraduated Response: An ungraduated response is the most aggressive and impactful action to
    prevent the loss from continuing or escalating and does so without consideration of the potential side
    effects associated with the response action. The ungraduated response recognizes the severity of the
    loss as justifying the most aggressive action, even if that option provides no alternatives should it fail
    to have the intended or desired effect or if it causes other losses to occur.
Without early observability of potential loss, the option for a graduated response may not exist. A
commensurate response is aided by early detection, which in turn increases the options for a graduated
response.

E.5.    Commensurate Rigor
Principle: The rigor associated with the conduct of an engineering activity provides the
confidence required to address the most significant adverse effect that can occur.
Note: Rigor determines the scope, depth, and detail of an engineering activity. Rigor is a means of
providing confidence in the results of a completed engineering activity. Generally, an increase in rigor
translates to an increase in confidence in the results of the activity. Further, increased confidence reduces
the uncertainty that can also reduce risk or provide a better understanding of what to address to achieve
risk reduction. The relationship between rigor and the criticality of data and information used to make
decisions is recognized by systems analysis practices [4].
The principle of commensurate rigor helps to ensure that the concept of rigor is included as an equal
factor in the trade space of capability, adverse effect, cost, and schedule in the planning and conduct of
engineering activities, method and tool selection, and personnel selection. An increase in rigor may
