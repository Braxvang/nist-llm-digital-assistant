SP 800-130                                                                       August 2013




    o) Key Access Control List (ACL) 6: An access control list identifies the entities
       that can access and/or use the keys as constrained by the key and metadata
       management functions (see Section 6.7). This Framework does not specify the
       access control list structure. The following are examples of such structures: a
       Microsoft Windows file/folder access control list consisting of zero or more
       access control entries, a Sun File System access control list, and while not a list,
       the Unix protection bits. In cases where interoperability is desired, the following
       items may require standardization: the syntax and semantics of the separators
       among access control entries, the ordering of entity and “access modes” within an
       access control entry, the entity identifier, and the designation of bits for different
       “access modes”. If required for interoperability, these items should be included in
       an appropriately detailed design specification.

    p) Key Usage Count: This element indicates the number of times that the key has
       been used.

    q) Parent Key: This element points to the key from which the key associated with
       this metadata is derived. For example, a new key (i.e., the child key) could have
       been derived from a TLS master secret (i.e., the parent key) with its metadata.

         This element may have two sub-elements:
            i. Key Identifier: The identifier for the parent key (see item b) above).
           ii. Nature of the Relationship: This element identifies how the parent key is
                related to the child key. An example of the relationship is a mathematical
                function that was used to create the child key using the parent key as one
                of the inputs. The relationship might be indicated by the identification of
                the mathematical function.

    r) Key Sensitivity: This element specifies the sensitivity or importance of the key. It
       could relate to a risk level (e.g., Low, Moderate, or High) or a classification level
       (e.g., Confidential, Secret, or Top Secret)

    s) Key Protections 7: This element specifies the integrity, confidentiality, and source
       authentication protections applied to the key. A public key certificate is an
       example of key protection whereby the CA’s digital signature provides both the
       integrity protection and source authentication (see [X.509]). A symmetric key and
       its hash value encrypted together is an example of confidentiality and integrity
       protection. When a key and its metadata are received from an external entity, the

  An ACL includes identifiers for authorized parties, their access mode or permission or
authorization (such as create, initialize, use, entry, output, update, replace, revoke, delete, etc.),
delegation rights for each access mode, and validity period for each access mode.

  A key can have multiple types of protection (e.g., integrity and confidentiality). The Framework
permits the use of multiple cryptographic mechanisms for the same security service (e.g., digital
signature and MAC for integrity).
