November 2022

•    Defines system security requirements 48 and associated verification methods
•    Develops security views and viewpoints of the system architecture and design
•    Identifies and assesses susceptibilities and vulnerabilities to life cycle hazards and adversities
•    Designs preemptive and reactive features and functions included within a balanced strategy
     to control asset loss and associated loss consequences
•    Provides security considerations to inform systems engineering efforts with the objective to
     reduce errors, flaws, and weaknesses that may constitute a security vulnerability
•    Performs system security analyses and interprets the results of other system analyses in
     support of decision-making for engineering trades and risk management
•    Identifies, quantifies, and evaluates the costs and benefits of security features, functions, and
     considerations to inform assessments of alternative solutions, engineering trade-offs, and risk
     treatment 49 decisions
•    Demonstrates through evidence-based reasoning that security and trustworthiness claims for
     the system have been satisfied to the desired level of assurance
•    Leverages security and other specialties to address all feasible solutions


                    SECURITY – AN EMERGING PROPERTY OF AN ENGINEERING PROCESS
           A system is engineered to achieve a capability driven by stakeholder mission and business
           needs. Security is an emergent property of a system that is achieved through a principled
           engineering process that reflects the stakeholder’s protection needs and concerns. The
           engineered security capability contributes to the overall system capability that satisfies
           stakeholder mission and business needs. No system can provide absolute security due to
           the limits of human certainty, the uncertainty that exists in the life cycle of every system,
           and the constraints of cost, schedule, performance, feasibility, and practicality. As such,
           trade-offs made routinely across contradictory, competing, and conflicting needs and
           constraints are optimized to provide adequate security.

   It is important to understand the context in which the term system security requirement is being used in this publication. For example, due to
the complexity of system security, there are several types and purposes of system security requirements (Section 3.8 and Appendix C).
49
   The term risk treatment is used in [4] and defined in [28].
