                 The Technical Specification for the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.2



4.4.1     The Component Reports
The ARF report MUST contain a report object for each XCCDF, OVAL, and OCIL component executed
when a source data stream is evaluated against a target. It MAY contain additional report objects for other
results, such as <oval-var:oval_variables> or extended component results. Each component
result MUST be captured as a separate <arf:report> element in the <arf:asset-report-
collection> element, and when reporting on XCCDF, OVAL or OCIL, each component report
SHALL use the element specified in Table 17 as its root element.
                      Table 17 - SCAP Result Data Stream Component Document Elements

                                    Component          Document Element
                                   XCCDF          <xccdf:TestResult>
                                   OVAL           <oval-res:oval_results>
                                   OCIL           <ocil:ocil>


Each SCAP result data stream component SHOULD NOT use any constructs that are deprecated in its
associated specification. Validation of each component SHALL be done in accordance with the portions
of this document that define requirements for the component. See Section 3.1.2 for more information on
the SCAP Content Validation Tool, which can help validate the correctness of SCAP result data streams.
4.4.2     The Target Identification
The target asset MUST be represented in the ARF report using the <ai:assets> part of ARF. The
<ai:asset> element populated about a target asset SHOULD include the fields specified in Table 18,
where applicable.
                                 Table 18 â€“ Asset Identification Fields to Populate

                        Field                     Location within Asset Identification Computing Device
        Ethernet media access control address   connections/connection/mac-address
        Internet Protocol version 4 address     connections/connection/ip-address/ip-v4
        Internet Protocol version 6 address     connections/connection/ip-address/ip-v6
        Host name                               hostname
        Fully qualified domain name             fqdn


Additional identification information MAY be captured in the <ai:asset> element (asset tag, system
GUID, etc.) The guidelines specified in [AI] MUST be followed when populating the asset identification
information.
Currently, only the target asset of the SCAP evaluation is identified.

4.4.3     The Source Data Stream
The source data stream collection that was used to generate the results against the target SHOULD be
included in the ARF report as an <arf:report-request>.

4.4.4     The Relationships
Table 19 outlines the relationships that MUST be specified in the ARF report if the stated condition is
satisfied.
