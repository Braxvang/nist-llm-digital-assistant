                 The Technical Specification for the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.2



           </cpe2_dict:check>.
The general convention used when describing XML attributes within this document is to reference the
attribute as well as its associated element including the namespace alias, employing the general form
"@attributeName for the <prefix:localName>".
Indented references are intended to represent the form of actual XML content. Indented references
represent literal content by the use of a fixed-length font, and parametric (freely replaceable)
content by the use of an italic font. Square brackets ‘[]’ are used to designate optional content. Thus
"[Oval_inventory_definition_id]" designates optional parametric content.
Both inline and indented forms use qualified names to refer to specific XML elements. A qualified name
associates a named element with a namespace. The namespace identifies the XML model, and the XML
schema is a definition and implementation of that model. A qualified name declares this schema to
element association using the format ‘prefix:element-name’. The association of prefix to namespace is
defined in the metadata of an XML document and varies from document to document. In this
specification, the conventional mappings listed in Table 1 are used.
