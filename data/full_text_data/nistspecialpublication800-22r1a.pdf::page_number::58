A STATISTICAL TEST SUITE FOR RANDOM AND PSEUDORANDOM NUMBER GENERATORS FOR CRYPTOGRAPHIC APPLICATIONS



(6)     For each of the eight states of x, compute νk(x) = the total number of cycles in which state x
        occurs exactly k times among all cycles, for k = 0, 1, …, 5 (for k = 5, all frequencies ≥ 5 are
                                       5
        stored in ν5(x)). Note that ∑ ν k ( x ) = J .
                                     k =0


        For the example in this section,

                 •   ν0(-1) = 2 (the –1 state occurs exactly 0 times in two cycles),
                     ν1(-1) = 1 (the –1 state occurs only once in 1 cycle), and
                     ν2(-1) = ν3(-1) = ν4(-1) = ν5(-1) = 0 (the –1 state occurs exactly {2, 3, 4, ≥5} times
                               in 0 cycles).

                 •   ν0(1) = 1 (the 1 state occurs exactly 0 times in 1 cycle),
                     ν1(1) = 1 (the 1 state occurs only once in 1 cycle),
                     ν3(1) = 1 (the 1 state occurs exactly three times in 1 cycle), and
                     ν2(1) = ν4(1) = ν5(1) = 0 (the 1 state occurs exactly {2, 4, ≥5} times in 0 cycles).

                 •   ν0(2) = 2 (the 2 state occurs exactly 0 times in 2 cycles),
                     ν3(2) = 1 (the 2 state occurs exactly three times in 1 cycle), and
                     ν1(2) = ν2(2) = ν4(2) = ν5(2) = 0 (the 1 state occurs exactly {1, 2, 4, ≥5} times in 0
                              cycles).

                 •   ν0(-4) = 3 (the -4 state occurs exactly 0 times in 3 cycles), and
                     ν1(-4) = ν2(-4) = ν3(-4) = ν4(-4) = ν5(-4) = 0 (the -4 state occurs exactly {1, 2, 3, 4,
                              ≥5} times in 0 cycles).

                 And so on….

                 This can be shown using the following table:

                                                        Number of Cycles
                          State x          0      1        2      3        4           5
                            -4             3      0        0      0        0           0
                            -3             3      0        0      0        0           0
                            -2             3      0        0      0        0           0
                            -1             2      1        0      0        0           0
                             1             1      1        0      1        0           0
                             2             2      0        0      1        0           0
                             3             3      0        0      0        0           0
                             4             3      0        0      0        0           0

                                                                                   5   (ν k ( x ) − Jπ k ( x )) 2
(7)     For each of the eight states of x, compute the test statistic χ 2 ( obs ) = ∑                             ,
                                                                                  k =0         Jπ k ( x )
        where πk(x) is the probability that the state x occurs k times in a random distribution (see Section
        3.14 for a table of πk values). The values for πk(x) and their method of calculation are provided in
        Section 3.14. Note that eight χ2 statistics will be produced (i.e., for x = -4, -3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3, 4).
