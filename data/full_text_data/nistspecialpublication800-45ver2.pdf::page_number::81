8.      Securing Mail Clients

Hundreds to thousands of mail clients access every operational mail server. Regardless of the security in
place on mail servers, it is important to secure the client side. In many respects, the client side represents
a greater risk to security than the mail server. Numerous issues need to be carefully considered and
addressed to provide an appropriate level of security for mail clients. This section provides general
recommendations that apply to most mail client applications. Specific recommendations for securing
particular applications are not included in this document.

8.1       Installing and Configuring Client Applications

8.1.1     Patching and Updating Mail Clients

The most important step in securing a mail client is to ensure that all users are using the latest and/or most
secure version of the mail client with all necessary patches applied. 47 Most major mail clients have had
significant vulnerabilities. To identify the vulnerabilities of a particular mail client, see the NIST
National Vulnerability Database (NVD) (http://nvd.nist.gov/). The best resource for patches is the
appropriate manufacturerâ€™s Web site. Appendix E contains a list of mail client manufacturer Web sites.

Updating some mail clients is made slightly more complicated because they operate in conjunction with
Web browsers. For example, the close integration and bundling of Microsoft Outlook, a mail client, and
Internet Explorer, a Web browser, has allowed the configuration settings and vulnerabilities of the latter
to affect the former. In such situations, keeping both the mail client and Web browser updated to secure
versions and patch levels is particularly important. Failure to run a secure version of a mail client reduces
the effectiveness of the rest of the security measures discussed below.

8.1.2     Configuring Mail Client Security Features

Mail client applications may not be configured securely in their default configurations. Mail clients
should be configured to:

 Disable automatic message preview.
 Disable automatic opening of messages.
 Disable automatic loading of pictures in messages.
 Disable downloading and processing of active content. Examples include ActiveX controls, Java
  applets, and JavaScript. This may cause problems for mail applications that are bundled with Web
  browsers, because disabling this functionality could affect the Web browser, where such functionality
  may be required. In those cases, some selective and careful disabling/enabling of active content may
  be needed. In the case of Microsoft Outlook and Internet Explorer, separate Security Zones could be
  defined for each, which would allow Internet Explorer to have less restrictive security settings than
  Outlook.
 Enable anti-spam and anti-phishing features, if available. These features often have rather permissive
  settings by default, so it may be beneficial from a security perspective to set them to a higher level.
  Also, users should be educated on reviewing tagged or filtered messages to identify ones that have
