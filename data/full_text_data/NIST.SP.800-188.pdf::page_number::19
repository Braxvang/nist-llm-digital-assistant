    • US Code Title 13 §§ 8(b) and 9 governs the confdentiality of information provided
      to the Census Bureau and prohibits “any publication whereby the data furnished by
      any particular establishment or individual under this title can be identifed” [160].
    • US Code Title 26, Section 6103 governs the confdentiality of information provided
      to the U.S. Government on tax returns and other return information. These rules are
      now spelled out in IRS Publication 1075, “Tax Information Security Guidelines for
      Federal, State and Local Agencies,” published by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
      Offce of Safeguards [122].
    • The Privacy Act of 1974 covers the release of personal information of U.S. citizens
      and lawful permanent residents by the Government. The Act recognizes that the
      disclosure of records for statistical purposes is acceptable if the data are not “indi-
      vidually identifable” [133, at a(b)(5)].
Federal laws and regulations recognize that it is not possible to eliminate all privacy risk
when deidentifying data. Guidance from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Ser-
vices (HHS) on the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) de-
identifcation standards notes that “[b]oth methods [the Safe Harbor and expert determi-
nation methods for de-identifcation], even when properly applied, yield de-identifed data
that retains some risk of identifcation. Although the risk is very small, it is not zero, and
there is a possibility that de-identifed data could be linked back to the identity of the patient
to which it corresponds” [166].
U.S. law also balances privacy risk with other factors, such as transparency, accountabil-
ity, and the opportunity for public good. An example of this balance is the handling of
personally identifable information collected by the Census Bureau as part of the decennial
census. This information remains confdential for 72 years and is then transferred to the
National Archives and Records Administration, where it is released to the public [161, 5].
De-identifcation is “a general term for any process of removing the association between
a set of identifying data and the data subject”[85]. This document describes the use of
de-identifcation with the goal of preventing or limiting disclosure risks to individuals
and establishments while still allowing for the production of aggregate statistics.34 De-
identifcation is not a single technique but a collection of approaches, algorithms, and tools
that can be applied to different kinds of data with differing levels of effectiveness. In gen-
eral, the potential risk to privacy posed by a dataset’s release decreases as increasingly

3 This document uses a different defnition for de-identifcation than ISO/TS 25737:2008, which defnes de-

  identifcation as the “general term for any process of removing the association between a set of identifying
  data and the data subject” [85, p. 3]. This document intentionally adopts a broader defnition for de-
  identifcation that allows for noise-introducing techniques, such as differential privacy and the creation of
  synthetic datasets that are based on privacy-preserving models.
4 In Europe, the term data anonymization is frequently used as a synonym for de-identifcation, but the terms

  may have subtly different defnitions in some contexts. For a more complete discussion of de-identifcation
  and data anonymization, see NIST IR 8053, De-Identifcation of Personal Data [66].
