Figure 1 illustrates the differences in scope and control between the cloud consumer and cloud
provider for each of the service models discussed above. Five conceptual layers of a generalized
cloud environment are identified in the center diagram and apply to public clouds, as well as
each of the other deployment models. The arrows at the left and right of the diagram denote the
approximate range of the cloud provider’s and cloud consumer’s scope and control over the
cloud environment for each service model. In general, the higher the level of support available
from a cloud provider, the more narrow the scope and control the cloud consumer has over the
system.

The two lowest layers shown denote the physical elements of a cloud environment, which are
under the full control of the cloud provider, regardless of the service model. Heating,
ventilation, air conditioning (HVAC), power, communications, and other aspects of the physical
plant form the bottom layer, the facility layer, while computers, network and storage
components, and other physical computing infrastructure elements form the hardware layer
immediately above it.

The remaining layers denote the logical elements of a cloud environment. The virtualized
infrastructure layer entails software elements, such as hypervisors, virtual machines, virtual data
storage, and virtual network components used to realize the infrastructure upon which a
computing platform can be established. While virtual machine technology is commonly used at
this layer, other means of providing the necessary software abstractions are not precluded.
Similarly, the platform architecture layer entails compilers, libraries, utilities, middleware, and
other software tools and development components needed to implement and deploy applications.
The application layer represents deployed software applications that are targeted towards end-
user software clients or other programs, and made available via the cloud.
