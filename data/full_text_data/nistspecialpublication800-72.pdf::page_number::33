                                                                 Guidelines on PDA Forensics


        Return Evidence â€“ Ensure physical and digital property is returned to the proper
        owner.

Each of the above procedural models and evidential principals contains key points that should
be considered when dealing with digital evidence. Because every incident investigation is
distinct with its own unique set of circumstances, a single definitive procedural approach is
difficult to prescribe. Nevertheless, most models touch on the same key areas, though
stressing different aspects. The remaining sections follow a simple framework of four topical
areas: obtaining an exhibit, making a forensic copy of its contents, obtaining evidence from the
forensic copy, and reporting on the evidence obtained and process used. They are respectively
referred to within this document as preservation, acquisition, examination and analysis, and
reporting.
