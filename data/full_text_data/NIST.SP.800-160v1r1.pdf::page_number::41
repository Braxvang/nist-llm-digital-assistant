           Determining Protection Needs
Stakeholders need to achieve their mission or business objectives in a secure manner that
preserves assets and limits the extent of asset loss. Asset protection must be continuous, thereby
making it possible for stakeholders to have a realistic expectation of continuous success in the
ability of their systems to support and achieve their objectives.

The scope and expectations for the protection of assets is foundational to achieving the design
intent for a trustworthy secure system. Protection needs typically correlate to the severity of
consequences associated with the loss of an asset. The protection needs are determined from all
needs, concerns, priorities, and constraints to protect and preserve stakeholder and system assets.
There are three perspectives for protection needs: (1) the stakeholder perspective, (2) the system
perspective, and (3) the trades perspective. Figure 7 illustrates the key input sources used to
define protection needs and the outputs derived from the specification of those needs.

The purpose of establishing the need for protection is to decide what assets to protect and to
determine the priority given to such protection. This can be accomplished without considering a
cause or condition against which to protect. As shown in Figure 8, the need for protection is
derived from the relationship among the asset of interest, context of loss, type of loss, and the
consequences of loss. This approach establishes the need for protection that – once validated by
stakeholders across all assets of interest – provides the basis for developing security objectives
and requirements. 40

   Requirements provide a formal and clear expression of the needs, concerns, priorities, and constraints to be satisfied for system function,
operation, and maintenance. Each requirement is accompanied by verification methods for demonstrating that the requirement is satisfied.
Requirements must be accurate, unambiguous, comprehensive, evaluatable, and achievable.
