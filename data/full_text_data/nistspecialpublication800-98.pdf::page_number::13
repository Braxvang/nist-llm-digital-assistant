                                                                                        EXECUTIVE SUMMARY



Organizations need to assess the risks they face and choose an appropriate mix of management,
operational, and technical security controls for their environments. These organizational assessments
should take into account many factors, such as regulatory requirements, the magnitude of each threat, and
cost and performance implications of the technology or operational practice.

Privacy regulations and guidance are often complex and change over time. Organizations planning,
implementing, or managing an RFID system should always consult with the organization’s privacy
officer, legal counsel, and chief information officer.

When securing an RFID system, organizations should select security controls that are compatible
with the RFID technologies they currently deploy or purchase new RFID technologies that support
the necessary controls.

To be most effective, RFID security controls should be incorporated throughout the entire life cycle of
RFID systems—from policy development and design to operations and retirement. However, many
RFID products support only a fraction of the possible protection mechanisms. Tags, in particular, have
very limited computing capabilities. Most tags supporting asset management applications do not support
authentication, access control, or encryption techniques commonly found in other business IT systems.
RFID standards specify security features including passwords to protect access to certain tag commands
and memory, but the level of security offered differs across these standards. Vendors also offer
proprietary security features, including proprietary extensions to standards-based technologies, but they
are not always compatible with other components of the system. Careful planning and procurement is
necessary to ensure an organization’s RFID system meets its security objectives.
