Ease-of-use                A metric of satisfaction in using a product as established by
                           one or more individuals using the product.
Entity (party)             An individual (person), organization, device, or process.
Environmental testing      Evaluating the behavior of a device or system to obtain
                           assurance that it will not be compromised by environmental
                           conditions or fluctuations when operating outside the normal
                           environmental operating range.
Equivalent security        Two or more security domains that have FCKMS security
domains                    policies that have been determined to provide equivalent
                           protection for the information.
Error-detection code       A code computed from data and comprised of redundant bits
                           of information that have been designed to detect unintentional
                           changes in the data.
Facility (mobile device)   One or more CKMS devices contained within a physically
                           protected enclosure that is portable (e.g., a mobile phone or a
                           laptop computer). The user of the mobile facility may be
                           required to guard and protect the contents of the facility itself.
Facility (static device)   One or more CKMS devices contained within a physically
                           protected enclosure. A facility for a static device is typically a
                           room or building (including their contents) with locks, alarms,
                           and/or guards.
FCKMS                      Federal Cryptographic Key Management System. A CKMS
                           that conforms to the requirements of SP 800-152.
FCKMS (compromised)        An FCKMS whose data have been subjected to unauthorized
                           access, modification, or disclosure while contained within the
                           FCKMS.
FCKMS architecture         The structure of an operational FCKMS, including
                           descriptions and diagrams of the types and locations of all its
                           facilities, FCKMS modules, devices, support utilities, and
                           communications.
FCKMS Component            Any hardware, software, or firmware that is used to
(Component)                implement an FCKMS.
FCKMS Device               Any combination of FCKMS components that serve a specific
(Device)                   purpose (e.g., firewalls, routers, transmission devices,
                           cryptographic modules, and data storage devices).
FCKMS documentation        The documentation collected or produced by the FCKMS
                           service-providing organization (including the design
                           documentation of the CKMS that will be the foundation of the
                           FCKMS) that states what services and functions are to be
                           provided to FCKMS service-using organizations.
