    3.12 Approximate Entropy Test
    Approximate entropy characteristics [1] are based on repeating patterns in the string. If
    Yi ( m) = (εi ,…,εi+m−1 ) , set
                                          1
                              Cim =            # { j :1 ≤ j < n − m,Y j ( m) = Yi ( m)} = π l
                                      n + 1− m
€   and
                                                                n +1−m
                                                            1
                  €                           Φ(m ) =            ∑
                                                        n + 1− m i+1
                                                                     logCim ,


    Cim is the relative frequency of occurrences of the pattern Yi(m) in the string, and -Φ(m) is the entropy of
    the empirical distribution arising on the set of all 2m possible patterns of length m,
                                  €
                                                              2m

€                                                  Φ (m )
                                                            = ∑ π l log π l ,
                                                              l=1


    where πl is the relative frequency of pattern l = (i1, …,im) in the string.

    The approximate entropy ApEn €
                                 of order m, m ≥ 1 is defined as

                                                ApEn( m) = Φ(m ) − Φ(m +1)

    with ApEn(0) = -Φ(1). “ApEn(m) measures the logarithmic frequency with which blocks of length m that
    are close together remain close together for blocks augmented by one position. Thus, small values of
    ApEn(m) imply strong regularity,
                                 € or persistence, in a sequence. Alternatively, large values of ApEn(m)
    imply substantial fluctuation, or irregularity.” [1, p. 2083].

    Pincus and Kalman [2] defined sequence to be m-irregular (m-random) if its approximate entropy
    ApEn(m) takes the largest possible value. They evaluated quantities ApEn(m), m = 0, 1, 2 for binary and
    decimal expansions of e, π, 2 and 3 with the surprising conclusion that the expansion of 3
    demonstrated more irregularity than that of π.
