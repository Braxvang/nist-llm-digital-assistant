4.4.1   FIPS 199 Process for System Security Categorization

FIPS 199 recognizes that determining the security category of an information system requires
additional analysis and must consider the security categories of all information types resident on
the information system. For an information system, the potential security impact levels assigned
to each of the respective security objectives (confidentiality, integrity, availability) are the
highest level (i.e., high water mark) for any one of these objectives that has been determined for
the types of information resident on the information system.

Information systems are composed of both computer programs and information. Programs in
execution within an information system (i.e., system processes) facilitate the processing, storage,
and transmission of information and are necessary for the organization to conduct its essential
business functions and operations. These system-processing functions also require protection and
could be subject to security categorization as well. However, in the interest of simplification, it is
assumed that the security categorization of all information types associated with the information
system provide an appropriate worst case potential for the overall information system—thereby
obviating the need to consider the system processes in the security categorization of the
information system. This is in recognition of:

   •    The fundamental requirement to protect the integrity, availability, and, for key
        information such as passwords and encryption keys, the confidentiality of system-level
        processing functions and information at the high water mark; and
   •    The strong interdependence between confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
For this reason, FIPS 199 notes that, while the value (i.e., level) of not applicable can apply to a
security objective for specific information types processed by systems, this value cannot be
assigned to any security objective for an information system. There is a minimum provisional
impact (i.e., low water mark) for a compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability for
an information system. This is necessary to protect the system-level processing functions and
information critical to the operation of the information system.
The generalized format for expressing the security category, or SC, of an information system is:
        SC information system = {(confidentiality, impact), (integrity, impact), (availability, impact)},
where the acceptable values for potential impact are LOW, MODERATE, or HIGH.
The following examples illustrate the system security categorization process described in FIPS
199.
SYSTEM EXAMPLE 1: An information system used for large acquisitions in a contracting
organization contains both sensitive, pre-solicitation phase contract information and routine
administrative information. The management within the contracting organization determines
that: (i) for the sensitive contract information, the potential impact from a loss of confidentiality
is moderate, the potential impact from a loss of integrity is moderate, and the potential impact
from a loss of availability is low; and (ii) for the routine administrative information (non-
privacy-related information), the potential impact from a loss of confidentiality is low, the
potential impact from a loss of integrity is low, and the potential impact from a loss of
availability is low. The resulting security categories, or SC, of these information types are
expressed as:
