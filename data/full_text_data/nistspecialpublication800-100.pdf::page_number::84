8.6 Completion and Approval Dates
    The completion date of the system security plan should be provided. The
completion date should be updated whenever the plan is periodically reviewed and
updated. The system security plan should also contain the date the authorizing
official or the designated approving authority approves the plan. Approval
documentation, e.g., accreditation letter, should be on file or attached as part of the
plan.

8.7 Ongoing System Security Plan Maintenance
    Once the information system security plan is accredited, it is important to
periodically assess the plan; review any change in system status, functionality,
design, etc.; and ensure that the plan continues to reflect the correct information
about the system. This documentation and its accuracy are imperative for system
recertification and reaccreditation activity. All plans should be reviewed and updated,
if appropriate, at least annually. Some items to include in the review are:
     • Change in information system owner;
     • Change in information security representative;
     • Major change in system architecture;
     • Change in system status;
     • Additions/deletions of system interconnections;
     • Change in system scope; and
     • Change in authorizing official.
