 80   Call for Patent Claims
 81   This public review includes a call for information on essential patent claims (claims whose use
 82   would be required for compliance with the guidance or requirements in this Information
 83   Technology Laboratory (ITL) draft publication). Such guidance or requirements may be directly
 84   stated in this ITL Publication or by reference to another publication. This call also includes
 85   disclosure, where known, of the existence of pending U.S. or foreign patent applications relating
 86   to this ITL draft publication and of any relevant unexpired U.S. or foreign patents.
 87   ITL may require from the patent holder, or a party authorized to make assurances on its behalf,
 88   in written or electronic form, either:
 89      a) assurance in the form of a general disclaimer to the effect that such party does not hold
 90         and does not currently intend holding any essential patent claim(s); or
 91      b) assurance that a license to such essential patent claim(s) will be made available to
 92         applicants desiring to utilize the license for the purpose of complying with the guidance
 93         or requirements in this ITL draft publication either:
 94             i.   under reasonable terms and conditions that are demonstrably free of any unfair
 95                  discrimination; or
 96            ii.   without compensation and under reasonable terms and conditions that are
 97                  demonstrably free of any unfair discrimination.
 98   Such assurance shall indicate that the patent holder (or third party authorized to make assurances
 99   on its behalf) will include in any documents transferring ownership of patents subject to the
100   assurance, provisions sufficient to ensure that the commitments in the assurance are binding on
101   the transferee, and that the transferee will similarly include appropriate provisions in the event of
102   future transfers with the goal of binding each successor-in-interest.
103   The assurance shall also indicate that it is intended to be binding on successors-in-interest
104   regardless of whether such provisions are included in the relevant transfer documents.
105   Such statements should be addressed to: sp800-50-comments@nist.gov
