      NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                  Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
      December 2023                                                         and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

371   NIST has considerable experience in developing assessment and authorization methodologies,
372   most significantly with the widely accepted approach to authorization in SP 800-37r2 [SP800-
373   37] and its family of related documents. While [SP800-37] focuses on the authorization of the
374   security of information systems rather than the authorization of the reliability of an issuer, it
375   offers a practical foundation for the authorization programs envisioned by [HSPD-12]. This
376   document utilizes the various aspects of [SP800-37] and applies them to authorizing the
377   reliability of an issuer. The authorization of an issuer by a federal organization requires prior
378   assessment of the security of all information systems used by that issuer in accordance with
379   [SP800-37]. Since PIV Cards and derived PIV credentials are typically issued through the use of
380   information systems, an assessment of their security (through the methodology in [SP800-37]) is
381   critical for determining the ability to comply with [FIPS201] requirements.
382   One difference between the authorization of the security of information systems and the
383   authorization of the reliability of an issuer is that an organization has considerable flexibility in
384   how they prepare for an [SP800-37] authorization (particularly in implementing security
385   controls) but have little room for variation when it comes to the authorization of an issuer. Much
386   of the flexibility in [SP800-37] comes from the necessity of acceptable variations in security
387   controls since individual information systems within varied environments may have significantly
388   different security requirements. Conversely, the desire for standardization in [HSPD-12] has led
389   to the development of a stable set of requirements. There may be some flexibility in how a
390   requirement is met, but a majority of requirements must be satisfied in a uniform manner in order
391   for an issuer to be deemed reliable. Allowing too much latitude in how a requirement is met
392   undermines its reliability.
393   Although organizations may feel constrained by the uniformity required by [FIPS201],
394   standardization greatly contributes to achieving the objectives of [HSPD-12] across issuer
395   implementations. For all federal organizations to accept the PIV Cards and derived PIV
396   credentials of other federal organizations, one set of rules (i.e., [FIPS201]) must be followed by
397   all PIV system participants. This document provides a way to determine whether the participants
398   are following these rules. Assessment methods that are consistent, reliable, and repeatable
399   provide a basis for determining the reliability and capability of issuers of PIV Cards and derived
400   PIV credentials, which herein is defined as consistent adherence to the PIV standards. In
401   particular, if an issuer meets the requirements of [FIPS201] and relevant documents as verified
402   through applicable assessment procedures and maintains consistency in their operations with
403   respect to meeting these criteria, they can be considered reliable, as is required by [HSPD-12].
404   The objectives of this document are to:
405       •   Outline the requirements for PIV Card issuers and derived PIV credentials issuers,
406           including the rationale for the requirements and the assessment procedures for
407           determining the satisfaction of those requirements through a combination of policies,
408           procedures, and operations
409       •   Describe an authorization methodology that provides a framework for organizing the
410           requirements and assessment procedures stated above and meeting all of the control
411           objectives stated in [HSPD-12]
412       •   Emphasize the role of risk associated with an authorization decision based on assessment
413           outcomes that consider the organization’s mission
