Special Publication 800-78-4                             Cryptographic Algorithms and Key Sizes for PIV



    +   Section 2, Application of Cryptography in FIPS 201-2, identifies the cryptographic
        mechanisms and objects that employ cryptography as specified in FIPS 201-2 and its
        supporting documents.
    +   Section 3, On Card Cryptographic Requirements, describes the cryptographic
        requirements for cryptographic keys and authentication information stored on the PIV
        Card.
    +   Section 4, Certificate Status Information, describes the cryptographic requirements for
        status information generated by PKI certification authorities (CA) and Online Certificate
        Status Protocol (OCSP) responders.
    +   Section 5, PIV Card Application Administration Keys, describes the cryptographic
        requirements for management of information stored on the PIV Card.
    +   Section 6, Identifiers for PIV Card Interfaces, specifies key reference values and
        algorithm identifiers for the application programming interface and card commands
        defined in [SP800-73].
    +   Section 7, Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Testing Requirements, specifies the
        cryptographic algorithm validation testing that must be performed on the PIV Card based
        on the keys and algorithms that it supports.
    +   Appendix A, Acronyms, contains the list of acronyms used in this document.
    +   Appendix B, References, contains the list of documents used as references by this
        document.
