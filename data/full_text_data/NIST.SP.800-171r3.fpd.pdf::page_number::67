1903   3.14.2. Malicious Code Protection
1904             REQUIREMENT: 03.14.02
1905             a. Implement malicious code protection mechanisms at designated locations within the system
1906                to detect and eradicate malicious code.
1907             b. Update malicious code protection mechanisms as new releases are available in accordance
1908                with configuration management policy and procedures.
1909             c.   Configure malicious code protection mechanisms to:
1910                  1. Perform scans of the system [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and real-
1911                     time scans of files from external sources at endpoints or network entry and exit points
1912                     as the files are downloaded, opened, or executed; and
1913                  2. Block malicious code, quarantine malicious code, or take other actions in response to
1914                     malicious code detection.

1915             DISCUSSION
1916             Malicious code insertions occur through the exploitation of system vulnerabilities. Periodic
1917             scans of the system and real-time scans of files from external sources as files are downloaded,
1918             opened, or executed can detect malicious code. Malicious code can be inserted into the system
1919             in many ways, including by email, the Internet, and portable storage devices. Malicious code
1920             includes viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and spyware. Malicious code can be encoded in various
1921             formats, contained in compressed or hidden files, or hidden in files using techniques such as
1922             steganography. In addition to the above technologies, pervasive configuration management,
1923             comprehensive software integrity controls, and anti-exploitation software may be effective in
1924             preventing the execution of unauthorized code. Malicious code may be present in commercial
1925             off-the-shelf software and custom-built software and could include logic bombs, backdoors, and
1926             other types of attacks that could affect organizational mission and business functions.
1927             If malicious code cannot be detected by detection methods or technologies, organizations can
1928             rely on secure coding practices, configuration management and control, trusted procurement
1929             processes, and monitoring practices to help ensure that the software only performs intended
1930             functions. Organizations may determine that different actions are warranted in response to the
1931             detection of malicious code. For example, organizations can define actions to be taken in
1932             response to malicious code detection during scans, the detection of malicious downloads, or the
1933             detection of maliciousness when attempting to open or execute files.

1937   3.14.3. Security Alerts, Advisories, and Directives
1938             REQUIREMENT: 03.14.03
1939             a. Receive system security alerts, advisories, and directives from external organizations on an
1940                ongoing basis.
1941             b. Generate and disseminate internal system security alerts, advisories, and directives, as
1942                necessary.
1943             c.   Implement security directives in accordance with established time frames.
