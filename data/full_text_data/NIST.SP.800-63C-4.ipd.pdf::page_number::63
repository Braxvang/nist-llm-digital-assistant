1651   7.2. Front-Channel Presentation
1652   In the front-channel presentation model, the IdP creates an assertion and sends it to the
1653   subscriber after successful authentication. The assertion is presented by the subscriber to
1654   authenticate to the RP, usually through mechanisms within the subscriber’s browser such
1655   as redirects.

1656   An assertion is visible to the subscriber in the front-channel method, which could
1657   potentially cause leakage of system information included in the assertion. Further, it
1658   is possible but more awkward in this model for the RP to query the IdP for additional
1659   attributes after the presentation of the assertion using an identity API, as described in
1660   Sec. 6.3.
1661   Since the assertion is under the subscriber’s control, the front-channel presentation
1662   method also allows the subscriber to submit a single assertion to unintended parties,
