Governance and Management (Section 3) Managing de-identifcation includes identify-
     ing the goals of the de-identifcation process and considering risks to participants in
     the data release. To guide this process, this document describes several tools:
        • Consider all phases of the data life cycle ( Sec. 3.3).
        • Consider different data sharing models ( Sec. 3.4), including complementary
           protections like data use agreements, synthetic data, and enclaves.
        • Leverage the Five Safes ( Sec. 3.5), a methodology for evaluating risk.
        • Form a Disclosure Review Board ( Sec. 3.6) to oversee the implementation of
           de-identifcation policies.
        • Follow existing de-identifcation standards when possible ( Sec. 3.7).
Technical Steps (Section 4) The technical process of de-identifcation should leverage the
     best practices developed over the past several decades. In particular, NIST recom-
     mends that agencies:
        • Conduct a data survey ( Sec. 4.2) to identify de-identifcation requirements
           specifc to the data.
        • Identify identifers and quasi-identifers in the data, and select a method for
           de-identifying each one ( Sec. 4.3).
        • Consider the existing auxiliary data ( Sec. 4.3) that could be used to enable a
           re-identifcation attack.
        • Practice defense in depth by combining security measures with de-
           identifcation when possible, and consider using synthetic data ( Sec. 4.4) or
           an interactive query interface ( Sec. 4.5).
        • When possible, use formal privacy techniques to quantify privacy loss asso-
           ciated with the release of de-identifed data ( Sec. 4.4.7).
        • Validate the utility and privacy of the de-identifed data ( Sec. 4.6). In partic-
           ular, establish accuracy goals for de-identifcation so that the data are not more
           accurate than required for the intended purpose.
Software (Section 5) In general, agencies should:
        • Utilize automated, repeatable, software-based approaches for performing de-
           identifcation.
        • Carefully consider the software used to implement de-identifcation to ensure
           that the algorithms used have been validated and that the software correctly
           implements those algorithms.
        • Consider the effciency, scalability, and repeatability properties of software
           tools, and evaluate the accuracy of the tool’s output.
