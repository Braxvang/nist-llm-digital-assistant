   Overview of Elliptic Curves
Let E be an elliptic curve defined over the field GF(q).
The cardinality |E| of the curve is equal to the number of points defined over GF(q) on the curve
and satisfies the equation |E| = (q+1)−t, where |t| ≤ 2 �𝑞𝑞. Thus, |E| and q have the same order of
magnitude.
The integer t is called the trace of E over the field GF(q).
The points on E form a commutative group under addition (for the group law for each curve
form, see Appendix A). Any point P on the curve is the generator of a cyclic subgroup 〈P〉 = {kP
| k = 0, 1, 2, …} of E. The order of P in E is defined as the cardinality of 〈P〉. A curve is cyclic if
it is generated by some point on E. All curves of prime order are cyclic, while all curves of order
|E| = h⋅n, where n is a large prime number and h is a small number, have a large cyclic subgroup
of prime order n.
If R is a point on the curve that is also contained in 〈P〉, there is a unique integer k in the interval
[0, l−1] so that R = kP, where l is the order of P in E. This number is called the discrete logarithm
of R to the base P. The discrete logarithm problem is the problem of finding the discrete
logarithm of R to the base P for any two points P and R on the curve, if such a number exists.
A quadratic twist of E is a curve E’ related to E, with cardinality |E’| = (q+1)+t. If E is a curve in
one of the curve forms specified in this Recommendation, a quadratic twist of this curve can be
expressed using the same curve model, although with different curve parameters.

       Non-binary Curves

2.1.1. Curves in Short-Weierstrass Form
Let GF(q) denote the finite field with q elements, where q is an odd prime power and is not
divisible by three. Let Wa,b be the Weierstrass curve with the defining equation y2 = x3 + a x + b,
where a and b are elements of GF(q) with 4 a3 + 27 b2 ≠ 0. When selecting curve parameters, a
Seed value may be used to generate the parameters a and b as described in Appendix C.2.1.1.
The points of Wa,b are the ordered pairs (x, y) whose coordinates are elements of GF(q) and that
satisfy the defining equation (i.e., the affine points) together with the special point ∅ (the “point
at infinity”). This set forms a group under the operation of addition on elliptic curves via the
“chord-and-tangent” rule, where the point at infinity serves as the identity element. See
Appendix A.1.1 for details of the group operation.

2.1.2. Montgomery Curves
Let GF(q) denote the finite field with q elements, where q is an odd prime power. Let MA,B be the
Montgomery curve with defining equation B v2 = u (u2 + A u + 1), where A and B are elements
of GF(q) with A ≠ ± 2 and B ≠ 0. The points of MA,B are the ordered pairs (u, v) whose
coordinates are elements of GF(q) and that satisfy the defining equation (i.e., the affine points)
together with the special point ∅ (the “point at infinity”). This set forms a group under the
