controls that is sufficiently rich to satisfy the breadth and depth of security requirements 11 levied
on information systems and that is consistent with and complementary to other established
security standards.

The catalog of security controls provided in Special Publication 800-53 can be effectively used to
demonstrate compliance with a variety of governmental, organizational, or institutional security
requirements. It is the responsibility of organizations to select the appropriate security controls,
to implement the controls correctly, and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the controls in
satisfying their stated security requirements. The security controls in the catalog facilitate the
development of assessment methods and procedures that can be used to demonstrate control
effectiveness in a consistent and repeatable manner—thus contributing to the organization’s
confidence that there is ongoing compliance with its stated security requirements. 12

1.4 ORGANIZATIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES
Organizations 13 should use FIPS 199 to define security categories for their information systems.
This publication associates recommended minimum security controls with FIPS 199 low-impact,
moderate-impact, and high-impact security categories. For each information system, the
recommendation for minimum security controls from Special Publication 800-53 (i.e., the
baseline security controls defined in Appendix D, tailored in accordance with the tailoring
guidance in Section 3.3) is intended to be used as a starting point for and input to the
organization’s risk assessment process. 14 The risk assessment results are used to supplement the
tailored baseline resulting in a set of agreed-upon controls documented in the security plan for the
information system. While the FIPS 199 security categorization associates the operation of the
information system with the potential impact on an organization’s operations, assets, or
individuals, the incorporation of refined threat and vulnerability information during the risk
assessment facilitates supplementing the tailored baseline security controls to address
organizational needs and tolerance for risk. The final, agreed-upon set of security controls should
be documented with appropriate rationale in the security plan for the information system. 15

The use of security controls from Special Publication 800-53 and the incorporation of tailored
baseline controls as a starting point in the control selection process, facilitates a more consistent
level of security across federal information systems. It also offers the needed flexibility to

11
   Security requirements are those requirements levied on an information system that are derived from laws, Executive
Orders, directives, policies, instructions, regulations, or organizational (mission) needs to ensure the confidentiality,
integrity, and availability of the information being processed, stored, or transmitted.
12
   NIST Special Publication 800-53A, Guide for Assessing the Security Controls in Federal Information Systems
(Second Public Draft), April 2006, provides guidance on assessment methods and procedures for security controls
defined in this publication. Special Publication 800-53A can also be used to conduct self-assessments of information
systems.
13
   An organization typically exercises direct managerial, operational, and/or financial control over its information
systems and the security provided to those systems, including the authority and capability to implement the appropriate
security controls necessary to protect organizational operations, organizational assets, and individuals.
14
   Risk assessments can be accomplished in a variety of ways depending on the specific needs of the organization. The
assessment of risk is a process that should be incorporated into the system development life cycle. NIST Special
Publication 800-30, Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems, provides guidance on the
assessment and mitigation of risk as part of an overall risk management process.
15
  NIST Special Publication 800-18, Guide for Developing Security Plans for Federal Information Systems, provides
guidance on documenting information system security controls. The general guidance in Special Publication 800-18 is
augmented by Special Publication 800-53 with recommendations for information and rationale to be included in the
system security plan.
