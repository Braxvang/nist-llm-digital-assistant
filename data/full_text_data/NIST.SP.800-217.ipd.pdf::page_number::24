      NIST SP 800-217 ipd                          Guidelines for PIV Federation (Initial Public Draft)
      January 2023


611   In addition to its other requirements as part of a trust agreement, an identity proxy
612   in a PIV federation context acting as an IdP SHALL disclose to the RP or federation
613   authority:
614       • The proxy’s nature as a proxy and
615       • The list of PIV IdPs that the proxy connects to for accounts that the RP is able to
616         access.
617   Assertions created by a proxy SHALL include the identifier of the upstream IdP. Note
618   that this is separate from the required issuer field, which identifies the proxy itself. Since
619   the proxy is the issuer of federated assertions to its downstream RPs, these downstream
620   RPs SHALL view the proxy as the PIV IdP for accounts asserted through the proxy.

621   3.4. Shared Signaling
622   In addition to sharing account information for the purposes of federated login, additional
623   signals can be shared between the IdP and RP for the specific uses described in
624   [SP800-63C].
625   The IdP SHOULD inform the RP of significant status changes in a PIV identity account
626   that has been used at an RP, including:
627       • A suspected breach of the PIV identity account,
628       • The termination of the PIV identity account, or
629       • Changes to any part of the federated identifier.
630   When the RP receives such status changes, the RP SHOULD update its RP subscriber
631   account, as appropriate for the nature of the signal.
632   The IdP MAY additionally inform the RP of significant changes to the PIV identity
633   account’s information, including:
634       • A change in contact information attributes (email address, phone number),
635       • A change in primary authenticator status, or
636       • The addition or removal of secondary authenticator.
637   The RP SHOULD inform the IdP of significant status changes in the RP subscriber
638   account, including:
639       • A suspected breach of the RP subscriber account or its data,
640       • Suspicious behavior of the RP subscriber account (such as repeated attempts to
641         access unauthorized functions), or
642       • The addition or removal of RP-managed bound authenticators at FAL3.
643   When the IdP receives such status changes, the IdP SHOULD terminate, disable, or
644   update the PIV identity account or the RP’s access to the account as appropriate to the
645   nature of the signal.
