Information Technology Security Training Requirements


  •       Level of Success


          Measures of success should be derived from the individual's normal work products rather
          than from classroom testing. This directly ties the individual's performance to its impact on
          the organization's mission. Written behavioral objectives for a learning activity must
          include a stated level of success.   For quantitative skills, must the learner perform
          successfully every time, or 10 out of 100 times, or 5 out of 10 times in terms of performance
          requirements or consequences? Risk management requirements should be used to establish
          the criticality of quantitative skills. For qualitative skills, what distinguishes satisfactory
          performance from fciilure, or outstanding performance from satisfactory?        Measurements of
          qualitative skills might include the amount of re-work required, customer satisfaction, or
          peer recognition of the employee as a source of IT security information.


          The nature and purpose of the training activity, and whether it is at a beginning,
          intermediate, or advanced level, will influence the setting of success measures    —a    subjective
          goal. If success levels are not documented, an individual student's achievement of the
          behavioral objectives of the learning activity can not be evaluated, nor can the learning
          activity itself be evaluated within an organization's overall training program.


In addition to the written objectives suggested above, the evaluation plan should show how the
data to be collected are to be used to support the cost and effort of the data collection. This can
be related to levels of evaluation, presented below.


5.3.2 Levels of Evaluation


Four levels of evaluation, in order of complexity, are:

      •     Level 1   :   End-of-Course Evaluations (Student Satisfaction)


      •     Level 2: Behavior Objective Testing (Learning Effectiveness, which is also a measure of
            Teaching Effectiveness)

      •     Level 3: Job Transfer Skills (Performance Effectiveness)


      •     Level 4: Organizational Benefit (Training Program Effectiveness)


Altogether, the four levels match the four purposes of training evaluation (described in Section
5.2) in a staged manner.         These levels are as follows.
