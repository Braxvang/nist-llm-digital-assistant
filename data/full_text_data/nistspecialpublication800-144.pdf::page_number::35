       over the device [Jan08]. Smart phones are also treated more as fixed appliances with a
       limited set of functions, than as general-purpose systems. Moreover, cloud applications
       are often delivered to them through custom-built native applications (i.e., apps) rather
       than a Web browser. No single operating system dominates smart phones, and security
       patches and updates for system components are not as frequent as for desktop computers,
       making vulnerabilities more persistent and widening the window of opportunity for
       exploitation. As a safeguard, organizations can prohibit or strictly limit access to PII and
       other sensitive data from portable and mobile devices and reduce risk [Mcc10].

       The growing availability and use of social media, personal Webmail, and other publicly
       available sites also have associated risks that are a concern, since they increasingly serve
       as avenues for social engineering attacks that can negatively impact the security of the
       browser, its underlying platform, and cloud services accessed. For example, spyware was
       reportedly installed in a hospital system via an employee’s personal Webmail account
       and sent the attacker more than 1,000 screen captures, containing financial and other
       confidential information, before being discovered [Mcm09b]. Having a backdoor Trojan,
       keystroke logger, or other type of malware present on a client, runs counter to protecting
       the security and privacy of public cloud services, as well as other Internet-facing public
       services being accessed [Fre08, MRG10].

       As part of the overall security architecture for cloud computing, organizations need to
       review existing measures and employ additional ones, if necessary, to secure the client
       side. Banks are beginning to take the lead in deploying hardened browser environments
       that encrypt network exchanges and protect against keystroke logging [Dun10a, Dun10b].
       Security awareness training also is an important measure for an organization to apply,
       since the proper behavior of individuals is an essential safeguard against many types of
       attacks.

4.5   Identity and Access Management
Data sensitivity and privacy of information have become increasingly an area of concern for
organizations. The identity proofing and authentication aspects of identity management entail
the use, maintenance, and protection of PII collected from users. Preventing unauthorized access
to information resources in the cloud is also a major consideration. One recurring issue is that
the organizational identification and authentication framework may not naturally extend into a
public cloud and extending or changing the existing framework to support cloud services may
prove difficult [Cho09]. The alternative of employing two different authentication systems, one
for the internal organizational systems and another for external cloud-based systems, is a
complication that can become unworkable over time. Identity federation, popularized with the
introduction of service oriented architectures, is one solution.

Identity federation allows the organization and cloud provider to trust and share digital identities
and attributes across both domains, and to provide a means for single sign-on. For federation to
succeed, identity and access management transactions must be interpreted carefully and
unambiguously and protected against attacks. Clear separation of the managed identities of the
cloud consumer from those of the cloud provider must also be ensured to protect the consumer’s
resources from provider-authenticated entities and vice versa. Identity federation can be
