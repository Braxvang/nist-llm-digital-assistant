Privacy Act Information provisional impact levels are documented in the Personal Identity and
Authentication information type. In a few cases (e.g., where some employees are potential
targets for retaliation by criminal elements or targets of foreign intelligence organizations),
unauthorized disclosure of some compensation management information (e.g., name, address,
title, organization, dependents’ information) can have life-threatening consequences and has a
high confidentiality impact level.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for disclosure compensation management information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Compensation
management activities are not generally time-critical.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: An accumulation of small changes to data
or deletion of small entries can result in excessive disbursements of payroll, bonus and monetary
awards or affects pay changes, time and attendance, etc. In some cases, the adverse effects of
consequent negative publicity on mission functions or public confidence in the agency can be
serious. In some other cases, integrity compromises that adversely affect a significant subset of
the workforce can result in staff issues and work stoppages that adversely affect the agency’s
mission. Where interruptions to agency missions can have serious or life-threatening
consequences for individuals, the impacts of integrity compromises can be moderate or even
high.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
compensation management information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to compensation management
information. Compensation management processes are generally tolerant of delay. Typically,
disruption compensation management information can be expected to have only a limited
adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended
compensation management information is low.
C.3.3.5 Benefits Management Information Type

Benefits Management designs, develops, and implements benefit programs that attract, retain and
support current and former agency employees. This sub-function includes: establishing and
communicating benefits programs; processing benefits actions; and interacting as necessary with
third party benefits providers. The recommended provisional security categorization for benefits
management information is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}
