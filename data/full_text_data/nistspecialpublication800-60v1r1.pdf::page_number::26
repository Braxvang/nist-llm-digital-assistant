information type are identified in Table 6. Volume II, Appendix C.3, “Government Resource
Management Information,” recommends provisional impact levels for confidentiality, integrity,
and availability security objectives. Many departments and agencies operate their own support
systems. Others obtain at least some support services from other organizations. Some agencies’
missions are primarily to support other government departments and agencies in the conduct of
direct service missions. As indicated above, security objectives and associated security impact
levels for administrative and management information and systems are determined by the nature
of the supported direct services and constituencies being supported.

4.1.3   Legislative and Executive Information Mandates

During the identification of information types within an information system, agency personnel
should afford special consideration for applicable governances addressing the information
processed and the agency’s supported mission. Volume II, Appendix E lists legislative and
executive mandates establishing sensitivity and criticality guidelines for specific information
types.

4.1.4   Identifying Information Types Not Listed in this Guideline

The FEA BRM Information Types are provided only as a taxonomy guideline. Not all
information processed by an information system may be identified from Tables 4 through 6.
Therefore, an agency may identify unique information types not listed in this guideline or may
choose not to select provisional impact levels from Volume II, Appendix C (for management and
support information types) or Volume II, Appendix D (for mission-based information types).
Sections 4.2.1 through 4.2.3 of this guideline provide assistance to agencies in assigning
provisional security categories to agency-identified information types and information systems.
Additionally, SP 800-60 provides a management and support sub function, General Information
Type, which can be used by agencies as a means to identify and categorize information not

16
  The recommended information types provided in NIST SP 800-60 are established from the “business areas”
and “lines of business” from OMB’s Business Reference Model (BRM) section of Federal Enterprise
Architecture (FEA) Consolidated Reference Model Document Version 2.3, October 2007.
