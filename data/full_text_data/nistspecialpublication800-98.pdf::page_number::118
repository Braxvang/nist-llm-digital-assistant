                                                                                                                         Components         Should Consider         Status
                                             The appropriate disposal or destruction mechanism depends on the
                                             type of tag, the level of assurance required, and the cost of the
                                             destruction. When tags contain memory, this memory should be
                                             rendered inaccessible. Options include the kill command and
                                             physical destruction. Many tags can be rendered inoperable by
                                             cutting them with a box knife, scissors, or other sharp object. The
                                             antenna on some tags can be separated from their transmitters by
                                             tearing them by hand, although accessing the tag data is still possible
                                             through physical analysis. Even if a tag contains nothing but an
             When disposing of tags,         identifier, destruction may be advisable if there is the potential for an
     35                                                                                                                       Tags           Should Consider
             disable or destroy them.        adversary with knowledge of the tag encoding protocol to correlate
                                             the identifier with other information, such as tag ownership.
                                             This attack is particularly salient for EPCglobal tags, because of the
                                             potential to discern the identity of the EPC Manager from the pointers
                                             returned by the Root ONS. In many cases, the tag identifier also
                                             reveals the serial number of the asset. On the other hand, many
                                             organizations may determine that that this risk is acceptable,
                                             especially if database records corresponding to a particular identifier
                                             are erased or disabled when the tag is no longer needed.
                                             Information contained in the audit records may be needed even after
                                             an RFID component is discarded (e.g., for an investigation of a
                                             subsequently discovered security breach). Organizations should
                                             identify the legal requirements for data retention that apply to their
                                             operations. 88 When log events are forwarded to a central audit

             requirements.                   On the other hand, retention of audit records may raise a privacy
                                             concern in some applications. For example, records may reveal
                                             sensitive personal information or associate a person with particular
                                             items or transactions in a manner that violates privacy laws or policy.
                                             In these cases, the requirement may be to destroy the records after a
                                             certain period of time or after they are no longer needed.
