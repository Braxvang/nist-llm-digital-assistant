Special Publication 800-85B                                   PIV Data Model Testing Specification


Test Steps              1. Set cardHandle := <<valid card handle>>
                        2. Set OID := <<Digital Signature Certificate
                           (2.16.840.1.101.3.7.2.1.0)>>
                        3. Call pivGetData w/
                           • (IN) cardHandle
                              • (IN) OID
                              • (OUT) data
                        4. Extract the value of the keyUsage extension field from
                           the certificate

Expected Result(s)      The digitalSignature and nonRepudiation bits have been set.


11.2.2.2 Verify asymmetric key pair

Purpose                 Confirms that the public key that exists in the certificate corresponds to
                        the private key on the card.
Reference(s)            1.    FIPS201, Section 5
                        2.    AS07.02.07
Precondition            1.    A valid PIV card is inserted into the contact reader.
                        2.    A valid PC/SC connection exists between the test application and
                              the contact reader.
                        3.    The test application is currently connected to the card application
                              which is accessible through card handle.
                        4.    A digital signature key and corresponding certificate are present on
                              the PIV card.
