Each SOA security dimension has one or more security requirements. Each requirement may have any
number of standards that support it. For example, both SSL/TLS and WS-Security provide

requirement of the resource protection dimension does not have any supporting standards.

2.5     Core Services

The notion of core services has yet to be completely defined. Traditionally, these are services that can be
