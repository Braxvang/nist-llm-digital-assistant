 Test Assertion       TA-08.01.02.02
 Purpose              For a USB token that hosts a Derived PIV Application, confirm that the
                      token is compliant with the specifications in [SP800-96] for APDU
                      support for contact card readers.
 DTR(s)               • DTR-06.01.02.02
 Vendor               The vendor to provide evidence in its documentation that the USB token
 Documentation        is compliant with the specifications in [SP800-96] for APDU support
                      for contact card readers.

8.2   Derived PIV Application Data Object Access/Storage Conformance

8.2.1 General

8.2.1.1 Support for Contact Interface

 Test Assertion       TA-08.02.01.01
 Purpose              Confirms that the Derived PIV Application only supports a contact
                      interface.
 DTR(s)               • DTR-06.02.01.01
 Vendor               The vendor to provide evidence in its documentation that the Derived
 Documentation        PIV Application only supports a contact interface.

8.2.1.2 One Derived PIV Application

 Test Assertion       TA-08.02.01.02
 Purpose              Confirms that there is only one Derived PIV Application on any
                      hardware cryptographic token.
 DTR(s)               • DTR-06.02.01.02
 Vendor               The vendor to provide information in its documentation validating the
 Documentation        compliance with this requirement.



8.2.2 Derived PIV Application Data Objects and Representation

8.2.2.1 Derived PIV Application Data Objects

 Test Assertion       TA-08.02.02.01
 Purpose              Confirms the data objects (along with their access conditions) are
                      implemented by the vendor of the Derived PIV Application per the
                      specification.
