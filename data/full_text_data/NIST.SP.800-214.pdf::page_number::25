Cryptographic Programs and Laboratory Accreditation
Cryptographic Security Testing laboratories are key to assuring that government
systems protected by cryptography to meet the validation requirements. There are currently
20 laboratories around the world certified through the National Voluntary Laboratory
Accreditation Program (NVLAP). To better assess tester proficiency knowledge across all
laboratories, the Cryptographic Validation Program (CVP) Certification Exam was revamped
to update the older FIPS 140-2 exam and incorporate the 2019 FIPS 140-3 standard's
unique requirements.
Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP)
If the use of cryptography is needed for the protection of sensitive unclassified information,
federal agencies must use validated cryptographic modules. The Cryptographic Module
Validation Program (CMVP) was created to support the federal user community’s need
for strong, independently tested, and commercially available cryptographic modules. In FY
2020, the CMVP awarded 180 new validation certificates. In addition to working with
U.S. and Canadian agencies, NIST has begun incorporating standards from international
organizations that represent both public and private sectors within the cryptographic
community.
In order to remain effective, additional CMVP efforts included:
• Retooling automation to streamline the validation process and improve review consistency;
• Strengthening the relationship with the Cryptographic Module User Forum (CMUF)
  by collaborating on new and improved technical guidance and programmatic issues; the
  CMUF FIPS 140-3 working group contributed heavily to the development of training
  materials and implementation guidance for the new standard;
• Supporting the International Cryptographic Module Conference (ICMC) committee to build
  relationships with vendors and laboratories and participating in the 2020 ICMC conference;
• Hosting two virtual Lab Manager meetings to keep Cryptographic and Security Testing
  (CST) laboratories abreast of changes and developments; and
• Developing documents and processes to support the new FIPS 140-3 standard so that the
  CMVP can accept FIPS 140-3 submissions; the transition to the FIPS 140-3 standard
  continues as FIPS 140-2 begins to be phased out.
Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP)
The Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP) reached a milestone with the retirement
of the Cryptographic Algorithm Validation System (CAVS) test tool. CAVP now performs all
algorithm validations using the server-based Automated Cryptographic Validation Test System
(ACVTS), which implements the open standard Automated Cryptographic Validation
Protocol (ACVP). ACVTS effectively validates algorithm implementations and can make a
validation certificate publicly available in minutes. It also enables new testing techniques to be
explored and implemented.
At the 2020 RSA Conference, Researchers from NIST’s Security Testing, Validation
and Management (STVM) group presented a new test capable of detecting a denial-of-service
attack for hash functions and digital signature algorithms. STVM researchers have also
collaborated with industry researchers to generate high assurance cryptographic tests that
have been implemented on the ACVTS server.
