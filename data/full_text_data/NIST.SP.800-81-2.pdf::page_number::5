The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical leadership for the Nation’s
measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops tests, test methods, reference data, proof of
concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance the development and productive use of
information technology. ITL’s responsibilities include the development of management, administrative,
technical, and physical standards and guidelines for the cost-effective security and privacy of other than
national security-related information in Federal information systems. The Special Publication 800-series
reports on ITL’s research, guidelines, and outreach efforts in information system security, and its
collaborative activities with industry, government, and academic organizations.

The Domain Name System (DNS) is a distributed computing system that enables access to Internet
resources by user-friendly domain names rather than IP addresses, by translating domain names to IP
addresses and back. The DNS infrastructure is made up of computing and communication entities called
Name Servers each of which contains information about a small portion of the domain name space. The
domain name data provided by DNS is intended to be available to any computer located anywhere in the
Internet.This document provides deployment guidelines for securing DNS within an enterprise. Because
DNS data is meant to be public, preserving the confidentiality of DNS data. The primary security goals
for DNS are data integrity and source authentication, which are needed to ensure the authenticity of
domain name information and maintain the integrity of domain name information in transit. This
document provides extensive guidance on maintaining data integrity and performing source
authentication. DNS components are often subjected to denial-of-service attacks intended to disrupt
access to the resources whose domain names are handled by the attacked DNS components. This
document presents guidelines for configuring DNS deployments to prevent many denial-of-service
attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in various DNS components.
