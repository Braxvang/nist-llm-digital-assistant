2.4 Learning Styles and Effective Teaching l\1ethods


Exhibit 2-2 illustrates learning objectives and examples of teaching methods at each level of the
Learning Continuum. This section further develops the role and importance of teaching methods
relative to learning for users of this document who may not be training professionals.      The
Federal workforce is the intended audience for this guidance document, and it is not a single,
homogeneous entity. Therefore, no uniform teaching approach, or set of materials, is
appropriate. Course developers and trainers will need to select the training materials and
approaches that will best address the needs of given audiences in line with an organization's
culture and requirements, as well as with individual student needs as outlined below.


2.4.1     Ways of Learning and Implications for Instruction

Individuals learn in different ways.   The learning approach most effective for a particular
individual is a function of their preferred learning style, education, and prior experience.   While a
discussion of learning theory is beyond the scope of this document, it is important for subject
matter specialists who may serve as instructors to know that students will not all take in and
process information in the same way. Attention to these differences in the instructional process
is just as important as is attention to the subject matter itself.

                          I see and I remember.

                          I do and I understand."

Learning Style: Individuals learn in several ways but each person, as part of their personality,
has a preferred or primary learning style. Instruction can positively or negatively affect a
student's performance, depending on whether it is matched, or mismatched, with a student's
preferred learning style. In learning information or concepts, some students will do better
through reading (visual learning); others prefer to listen to a lecture (auditory learning); still
others need to participate in a discussion (kinesthetic or tactile learning) in order to refine and
finally grasp the material. In learning practical skills, some students prefer "how-to" pictures or
diagrams (visual learning); others prefer to hear verbal instructions (auditory learning); still
others ignore directions and prefer to jump in and figure things out as they go along (kinesthetic
or tactile learning).


Content specialists tend to make the mistake of equating teaching to telling. They find out the
