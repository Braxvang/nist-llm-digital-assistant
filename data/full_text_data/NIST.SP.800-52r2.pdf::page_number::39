NIST SP 800-52 REV. 2                                            GUIDELINES FOR TLS IMPLEMENTATIONS


Revocation information shall be obtained as described in Section 3.2.2.

The server shall be able to determine the certificate policies that the client certificate is trusted
for by using the certification path validation rules specified in Section 6 of RFC 5280 [19].
Server and back-end applications may use this determination to accept or reject the certificate.
Checking certificate policies assures the server that only client certificates that have been issued
with acceptable assurance, in terms of CA and registration system and process security, are
accepted.

Not all commercial products may support the public-key certification path validation and
certificate policy processing rules listed and cited above. When implementing client
authentication, federal agencies shall either use the commercial products that meet these
requirements or augment commercial products to meet these requirements.

The server shall be able to provide the client certificate and the certificate policies for which the
client certification path is valid to consuming applications in order to support access control
decisions.

3.5.2   Trust Anchor Store

Having an excessive number of trust anchors installed in the TLS application can expose the
application to all the PKIs emanating from those trust anchors. The best way to minimize the
exposure is to only include the trust anchors in the trust anchor store that are absolutely
necessary for client public-key certificate authentication.

The server shall be configured only with trust anchors that the system owner trusts and, of those,
only the ones that are required to authenticate the clients in the case where the server supports
client authentication in TLS. System administrators of a TLS server that supports certificate-
based client authentication shall perform an analysis of the client certificate issuers and use that
information to determine the minimum set of trust anchors required for the server. These trust
anchors are typically a small subset of the trust anchors that may be included on the server by
default. Also, note that this trust anchor store is distinct from the machine trust anchor store.
Thus, the default set of trust anchors shall be examined to determine if any of them are required
for client authentication. Some specific enterprise and/or PKI service trust anchors may need to
be added.

In the U.S. Federal Government environment, in most situations, the Federal Common Policy
Root or the agency root (if cross-certified with the Federal Bridge Certification Authority or the
Federal Common Policy Root) should be sufficient to build a certification path to the client
certificates.

3.5.3   Checking the Client Key Size

The only direct mechanism for a server to check whether the key size and algorithms presented
in a client public-key certificate are acceptable is for the server to examine the public key and
algorithm in the clientâ€™s certificate. An indirect mechanism is to check that the certificate
policies extension in the client public-key certificate indicates the minimum cryptographic
strength of the signature and hashing algorithms used and for the server to perform certificate
