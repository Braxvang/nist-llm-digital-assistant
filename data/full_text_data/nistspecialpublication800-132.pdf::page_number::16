SP 800-132      Recommendation for Password-Based Key Derivation           December 2010



A.2 PBKDF

Dictionary attacks aim to recover passwords by trying the most-likely strings, such as the
words in a dictionary. These attacks are less likely to succeed against passwords that
include random combinations of upper/lowercase letters and numeric values. Such
passwords can only be recovered using inefficient brute force attacks that try all possible
passwords.

The main idea of a PBKDF is to slow dictionary or brute force attacks on the passwords
by increasing the time needed to test each password. An attacker with a list of likely
passwords can evaluate the PBKDF using the known iteration counter and the salt. Since
an attacker has to spend a significant amount of computing time for each try, it becomes
harder to apply the dictionary or brute force attacks.

A.2.1 Length of the Salt

The purpose of the salt is to allow the generation of a large set of keys corresponding to
each password, for a fixed iteration count. For a given password, the number of possible
resulting keys is approximately 2sLen, where sLen is the length of the salt in bits.
Therefore, using a salt makes it difficult for the attacker to generate a table of resulting
keys, for even a small subset of the most-likely passwords.

Optionally, to avoid any possible interaction between other applications that use a salt, an
application-, message- or user-specific variable called purpose may be prefixed to the
randomly generated part of the salt as given below;

                                     S = purpose || rv.

A.2.2 Iteration Count

The purpose of the iteration count C is to increase the amount of computation needed to
derive a key from a password, significantly increasing the workload of dictionary attacks.
Using a PBKDF that requires C iterations to derive a key increases the computational
cost of performing a dictionary attack on a password with t bits of entropy from 2t
operations to Cï‚´2t operations, and therefore, makes dictionary and brute force attacks
