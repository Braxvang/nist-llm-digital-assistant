                                                                                           NIST Special Publication 800-35



4.2.1.2 Total Cost of Ownership

In conjunction with a metrics program, the IT security services decision makers need to identify the full
cost of the service. Metrics may be a part of this effort because they can help determine the dollar cost of
various actions (e.g., cost of downtime, costs of a virus attack). The principle of full cost is often referred
to as TCO. TCO includes not only implementation and operational costs but also related costs (e.g.,
overhead, salaries, benefits, technology upgrades, and software support, and maintenance). This
information will allow decision makers to compare the costs of other service arrangements with the
existing environment during the business case development in the solution phase. When the full cost is
identified, the decision makers will be able to accurately relate the value of one service option over
another.

4.2.2   Analyze Opportunities and Barriers

Once the organization understands the current environment from a performance and cost perspective, it
can begin to analyze opportunities and barriers. Analyzing opportunities and barriers allows the
organization to identify functions and areas that can change, those that cannot, and reasons for each. IT
security stakeholders should participate in the process and approve analysis results. Properly performed,
an analysis should include the following:

Strategic/Mission             •   Identify how critical the service/function is to the business.

Budgetary/Funding             •   Articulate a rational, executable fiscal program, in accordance with all
                                  applicable regulations and legislation to secure approval and funding by budget
                                  authorities

Technical/Architectural       •   Determine and understand the importance of maintaining an organization’s
                                  technical competencies

Organizational                •   Determine which service arrangements would be appropriate for the
                                  organization’s work environment and values.
                              •   Allow management to incorporate intangible benefits to all stakeholders (e.g.,
                                  improved employee morale, organizational image) into the business case that
                                  will be developed.

Personnel                     •   Allow all stakeholders to develop and translate overarching performance goals
                                  and specific needs into specific service level requirements, such as Request for
                                  Proposal (RFP)/SOW/Service Level Agreement (SLA) requirements.

Policy/Process                •   Begin to address integration/transition efforts for the desired future service
                                  arrangement strategy.
