3.       IPv6 Overview

From the standpoint of header design, IPv6 is both more powerful and more flexible than its IPv4
predecessor. Section 2.3 introduced a number of enhancements and features in IPv6. Most significant is
the vast amount of address space, along with support for orderly address assignment and efficient network
address aggregation on the Internet. Illustrated in Table 3-1 are some of the major differences between
IPv4 and IPv6 followed by basic IPv6 terminology used later in this guide. These differences can have
implications for IPv6 security and are discussed throughout this and subsequent sections.

Address configuration                  devices configured manually or         devices configure themselves

Basic Terms (RFC 2460, RFC 4862)

The following basic IPv6 definitions are important for any IPv6 discussion.

         Address. An IPv6-layer identifier for an interface or a set of interfaces.

         Node. A device on the network that sends and receives IPv6 packets

         Deprecated address. An address, assigned to an interface, whose use is discouraged, but not
          forbidden (e.g., site-local addresses such as FEC0::/10). A deprecated address should no
