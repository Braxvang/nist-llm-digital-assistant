                                Figure 2: An Example VLAN Configuration

A logical group of VMs is created with the traffic among the members of that group being isolated from
traffic belonging to another group. The logical separation of network traffic provided by VLAN
configuration can be based on any arbitrary criteria. Thus all of the following can be achieved:

    (a)   Management VLAN for carrying only management traffic (used for sending
          management/configuration commands to the hypervisor);
    (b)   VM Migration VLAN for carrying traffic generated during VM migration (migrating VMs from
          one virtualized host to another for availability and load balancing reasons);
    (c)   Logging VLAN for carrying traffic used for fault-tolerant logging;
    (d)   Storage VLAN for carrying traffic pertaining to Network File System (NFS) or iSCSI storage;
    (e)   Desktop VLAN for carrying traffic from VMs running Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI)
          software; and
    (f)   A set of production VLANs for carrying traffic between the production VMs (the set of VMs
          hosting the various business applications). These days, enterprise application architectures are
          made up of three tiers: webserver, application, and database. A separate VLAN can be created
          for each of these tiers with traffic between them regulated using firewall rules. Further, in a
          cloud data center, VMs may belong to different consumers or cloud users, and the cloud
          provider can provide isolation of traffic belonging to different clients using VLAN
          configuration. In effect, one or more logical or virtual network segments are created for each
          tenant by assigning/connecting VMs belonging to each of them to different VLAN segments. In
