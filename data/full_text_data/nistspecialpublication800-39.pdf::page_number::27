their mission/business processes. Providing greater clarity and understanding of the information
technology infrastructure of organizations including the design and development of the associated
information systems is a prerequisite for maximizing the resilience and wise use of these systems
in the face of increasingly sophisticated threats. This type of clarity and understanding can be
effectively achieved through the development and implementation of enterprise architecture.

Enterprise architecture is a management practice employed by organizations to maximize the
effectiveness of mission/business processes and information resources in helping to achieve
mission/business success. Enterprise architecture establishes a clear and unambiguous connection
from investments (including information security investments) to measurable performance
improvements whether for an entire organization or portion of an organization. Enterprise
architecture also provides an opportunity to standardize, consolidate, and optimize information
technology assets. These activities ultimately produce information systems that are more
transparent and therefore, easier to understand and protect. In addition to establishing a roadmap
for more efficient and cost-effective usage of information technology throughout organizations,
enterprise architecture provides a common language for discussing risk management issues
related to missions, business processes, and performance goals—enabling better coordination and
integration of efforts and investments across organizational and business activity boundaries. A
well-designed enterprise architecture implemented organization-wide, promotes more efficient,
cost-effective, consistent, and interoperable information security capabilities to help organizations
better protect missions and business functions—and ultimately more effectively manage risk.

The Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA) defines a collection of interrelated reference models
including Performance, Business, Service Component, Data, and Technical as well as more
detailed segment and solution architectures that are derived from the enterprise architecture.36
Organizational assets (including programs, processes, information, applications, technology,
investments, personnel, and facilities) are mapped to the enterprise-level reference models to
create a segment-oriented view of organizations. Segments are elements of organizations
describing mission areas, common/shared business services, and organization-wide services.
From an investment perspective, segment architecture drives decisions for a business case or
group of business cases supporting specific mission areas or common/shared services. The
primary stakeholders for segment architecture are mission/business owners. Following closely
from segment architecture, solution architecture defines the information technology assets within
organizations used to automate and improve mission/business processes. The scope of solution
architecture is typically used to develop and implement all or parts of information systems or
business solutions, including information security solutions. The primary stakeholders for
solution architectures are information system developers and integrators, information system
owners, information system/security engineers, and end users.


  The FEA concepts that define needs‐driven, performance‐based business processes are applied by
  organizations, recognizing that effectively managing risk arising from operating in a cyberspace
  environment with sophisticated, high‐end threats is a key need and measure of performance.

   The Federal Enterprise Architecture is described in a series of documents published by the OMB FEA Program
Management Office. Additional information on the FEA reference models and the segment and solution architectures
can be found in the FEA Consolidated Reference Model Document and FEA Practice Guidance, respectively.
