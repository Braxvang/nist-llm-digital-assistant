NIST SP 800-58                                             Voice Over IP Security

       highlighting the tradeoff between security and voice quality, and emphasizing a
       need for speed.

       VOIP is still an emerging technology, so it is difficult to develop a complete
       picture of what a mature worldwide VOIP network will one day look like. As the
       emergence of SIP has shown, new technologies and new protocol designs have
       the ability to radically change VOIP. Although there are currently many different
       architectures and protocols to choose from, eventually a true standard will
       emerge. Unless a widely used open standard emerges, solutions will be likely to
       include a number of proprietary elements, which can limit an enterprise’s future
       choices. The most widely used of the competing standards are SIP and H.323.
       Some observers believe that SIP will become dominant. Major vendors are
       investing an increasing portion of their development effort into SIP products. An
       extension of SIP, the SIP for Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging
       Extensions (SIMPLE) standard, is being incorporated into products that support
       Instant Messaging. Until a truly dominant standard emerges, organizations
       moving to VOIP should consider gateways and other network elements that
       support both H.323 and SIP. Such a strategy helps to ensure a stable and robust
       VOIP network in the years that come, no matter which protocol prevails.

       Designing, deploying, and securely operating a VOIP network is a complex effort
       that requires careful preparation. The integration of a VOIP system into an
       already congested or overburdened network could create serious problems for the
       organization. There is no easy “one size fits all” solution to the issues discussed
       in these chapters. An organization must investigate carefully how its network is
       laid out and which solution fits its needs best.

NIST recommendations.

Because of the integration of voice and data in a single network, establishing a
secure VOIP and data network is a complex process that requires greater effort
than that required for data-only networks. In particular, start with these general
guidelines, recognizing that practical considerations, such as cost or legal requirements,
may require adjustments for the organization:

1. Develop appropriate network architecture.

       •   Separate voice and data on logically different networks if feasible. Different
           subnets with separate RFC 1918 address blocks should be used for voice and
           data traffic, with separate DHCP servers for each, to ease the incorporation of
           intrusion detection and VOIP firewall protection

       •   At the voice gateway, which interfaces with the PSTN, disallow H.323, SIP,
           or other VOIP protocols from the data network. Use strong authentication and
           access control on the voice gateway system, as with any other critical network
           component. Strong authentication of clients towards a gateway often presents
