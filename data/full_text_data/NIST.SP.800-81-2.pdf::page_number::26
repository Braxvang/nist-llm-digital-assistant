in its own zone file. A caching name server (also called a resolving/recursive name server), by contrast,
provides responses either through a series of queries to authoritative name servers in the hierarchy of
domains found in the name resolution query or from a cache of responses built by using previous queries.

3.2.1    Authoritative Name Servers

There are two types of authoritative name servers: master (or primary) name server and slave (or
secondary) name server. To improve fault tolerance, there could be several slave name servers in an
enterprise. A master name server contains zone files that are created and edited manually by the zone
administrator. Sometimes a master name server allows the zone file to be dynamically updated by
authorized DNS clients. A master name server that is configured with this feature usually is called the
primary master name server. A slave (secondary) name server also contains authoritative information for
a zone, but its zone file is a replication of the one in the associated master name server. The replication is
enabled through a transaction called zone transfer that transfers all RRs from the zone file of a master
name server to the slave name server. Because a name resolution query is for a specific RR, a zone
transfer actually is treated as a category of name resolution query with type code AXFR, which means
“all RRs for the zone that is being queried.” Whenever the contents of a zone file are changed in the
master name servers, the slave name servers are notified of the change through a transaction called DNS
NOTIFY. When a slave name server receives this request, it initiates a zone transfer request to the master
name server.

3.2.2    Caching Name Servers

A caching name server generally is the local name server in the enterprise that performs the name
resolution function on behalf of the various enterprise clients. A caching name server also is called a
resolving/recursive name server. The name resolution function is performed by a caching name server in
response to queries from a stub resolver. The search process involved in name resolution may involve
searching its own cache, recursively querying various authoritative name servers through a set of iterative
queries, or a combination of these methods.

A specific name server can be configured to be both an authoritative and a recursive name server. In this
configuration, the same name server provides authoritative information for queries pertaining to
authoritative zones while it performs the resolving functions for queries pertaining to other zones. To
perform the resolving function, it has to support recursive queries. Any server that supports recursive
queries is more vulnerable to attack than a server that does not support such queries (see following
sections). As a result, authoritative information might be compromised. Hence, it is not a good security
practice to configure a single name server to perform both authoritative and recursive functions.

3.3     Resolvers (DNS Software)

Software such as Web browsers and e-mail clients that require access to Internet resources make use of
the DNS client, called the client resolver or stub resolver. The stub resolver formulates a name resolution
query for the resource sought by the Internet-accessing software and sends it to a caching (resolving)
name server in the enterprise. Stub resolvers generally are configured to send queries to two or more
resolving name servers to provide some fault tolerance for their operation. A stub resolver often is
referred to as simply a resolver. A caching (resolving) name server that receives a query from a stub
resolver also formulates queries for sending them to authoritative name servers (if it is not able to respond
to the query from its cache) and hence also sometimes is referred to as a resolver because it has a
resolving component and a caching (name server) component.
