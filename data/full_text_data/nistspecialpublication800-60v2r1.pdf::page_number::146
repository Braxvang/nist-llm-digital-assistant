International Affairs and Commerce involves the non-military activities that promote U.S.
policies and interests beyond our national borders, including the negotiation of conflict
resolution, treaties, and agreements. In addition, this function includes: foreign economic
development and social/political development; diplomatic relations with other Nations;
humanitarian, technical and other developmental assistance to key Nations; and global trade.
Information that is protected by procedures established and authorized under criteria specified in
an Executive Order or an Act of Congress to be kept classified in the interests of foreign policy
are national security related 35 . Security objectives and impact levels associated with such
national security information are determined by the head of each agency exercising control of
the system and are outside the scope of this guideline.

D.5.1 Foreign Affairs Information Type

Foreign Affairs refers to those activities associated with the implementation of foreign policy
and diplomatic relations, including the operation of embassies, consulates, and other posts;
ongoing membership in international organizations; the development of cooperative frameworks
to improve relations with other Nations; and the development of treaties and agreements.
Conflict resolution involves the mitigation and prevention of disputes stemming from inter and
intra-state disagreements.

Some conflict resolution information is subject to security classification. This classified
information is treated under separate rules established for national security information and is
outside the scope of this guideline.

Treaties and agreements involves the negotiation and implementation of accords with foreign
governments and organizations in efforts related to arms reduction and regulation, trade matters,
criminal investigations and extraditions, and other various types of foreign policy. When treaties
and agreements information affects intelligence gathering and/or law enforcement cooperation,
impacts to such information and the information systems that process and store the information
could result in negative impacts on protection of a broad range of critical infrastructures and key
national assets.

Some information associated with treaties and agreements is subject to security classification.
This classified information is treated under separate rules established for national security
information. The recommended categorization for unclassified foreign affairs information
follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, High), (integrity, High), (availability, Moderate)}
