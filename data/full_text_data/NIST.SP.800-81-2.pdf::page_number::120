SECURE DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM (DNS) DEPLOYMENT GUIDE



trust anchor will not be able to validate the responses about external services and vice-versa (using the
external zone key as a trust anchor will result in validation failures for internal DNS zone responses).

In these cases, it may be necessary for a mobile systems to configure its valiadator when migrating from
the enterprise to an external network and vice-versa. Or, if the enterprise network is trusted, the mobile
host can rely on the enterprise validator when on the enterprise network, and perform its own validation
when on external networks. Ideally, network administrators can avoid this problem by using alternative
names for internal and external zones, thus having different trust anchors.

If the mobile host cannot perform its own validation, it must have a secure tunnel back to the enterprise
network and use an enterprise managed validator. Many enterprises already have a means for mobile
hosts to access internal resources (like file servers, etc.); a validating recursive server should be added as
one of the services provided to mobile hosts through a secure channel.


13.2 Establishing Initial Trust Anchors

Each DNSSEC validator must have one or more public keys stored locally to use in building
authentication chains. These public keys are often referred to as trust anchors. There is nothing
particularly special about a trust anchor to anyone other than the client that has configured it as a trusted
public key.

Since DNSSEC validation builds upon the DNS hierarchy for trust, the public key for the DNS root zone
and TLD’s are more valuable because they can (assuming a fully signed DNS domain tree), be used to
validate the widest number of nodes (thus a larger portion of the domain name space) and thus provide
coverage for a wider range of DNS responses. Validator administrators should identify the set of keys
they believe they would need to provide DNSSEC validation for the segments of the name space deemed
most important. For most administrators, this would be the DNS root zone key, but may possible include
one or more TLD keys (such as the keys for their local ccTLD or similar). Administrators should obtain
the public keys (usually the KSK) in a trusted manner (e.g., a SSL secure webpage) and configure the key
(or in some cases, a hash of the key) in the implementation specific manner. In BIND, trusted keys are
configured using the “trusted-keys” statement in the named configuration file. The format for these keys
are:

<zone name>      <flags> <protocol> <algorithm> <base 64 encoded key material>;

Where the <flags>, <protocol> and <algorithm> numbers are taken from the DNSKEY RDATA values.
So that in the named configuration file, an example root key would appear as:
