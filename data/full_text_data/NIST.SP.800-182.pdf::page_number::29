     A number of technical contributions towards the
development of ANSI/NIST and international standards
were submitted. They included technical contributions on
international biometric data interchange formats and their
associated conformance testing methodologies, as well
as on SP 500-290 Revision 1 and the associated National
Information Exchange Model (NIEM) Extensible Markup
Language (XML) Schema (see https://tools.niem.gov).
