      Port Restricted Cone
            A port restricted cone NAT is like a restricted cone NAT, but the
            restriction includes port numbers. Specifically, an external host can send a
            packet, with source IP address X and source port P, to the internal host
            only if the internal host had previously sent a packet to IP address X and
            port P. It is used to enable sharing of external IP addresses.

      Symmetric NAT
           A symmetric NAT is one where all requests from the same internal IP
           address and port, to a specific destination IP address and port, are mapped
           to the same external IP address and port. If the same host sends a packet
           with the same source address and port, but to a different destination, a
           different mapping is used. Furthermore, only the external host that
           receives a packet can send a UDP packet back to the internal host.


      All of these benefits of NAT come at a price. NATs “violate the fundamental
      semantic of the IP address, that it is a globally reachable point for
      communications” [25]. This design has significant implications for VOIP. For
      one thing, an attempt to make a call into the network becomes very complex when
      a NAT is introduced. The situation is analogous to a phone network where
      several phones have the same phone number, such as in a house with multiple
      phones on one line (see
      Figure 9). There are also several issues associated with the transmission of the
      media itself across the NAT, including an incompatibility with IPsec detailed in
      section 8.4.

      Conceptually, the easiest solution to these incompatibilities is to do away with
