                                           ESTABLISHING WIRELESS ROBUST SECURITY NETWORKS: A GUIDE TO IEEE 802.11I

EAP traffic can be transmitted in the clear between the AP and AS and still not violate IEEE 802.11i
specifications. If attackers have access to that communications link, they might be able to view or
manipulate traffic in a manner that would allow them to compromise WLAN security. Also, since the
key is distributed from the AS to the AP, the key distribution mechanism must be secure. To prevent
attackers from viewing or manipulating traffic, organizations should ensure that traffic between the AP
and AS is protected sufficiently through cryptography. Ways to accomplish this are as follows:

      Establish a dedicated virtual private network (VPN) between the AP and AS using a VPN
       protocol such as IPsec. 88
      Use tunneled EAP methods only, such as EAP-TLS, EAP-TTLS, EAP-FAST, and PEAP.
      Use appropriate key wrapping mechanisms to distribute the key. 89

     One example can be found in RADIUS Attributes for Key Delivery (http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-zorn-radius-
     keywrap-xx.txt). AES Key Wrap is specified in RFC 3394, Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Key Wrap Algorithm,
     available at http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3394.txt.
