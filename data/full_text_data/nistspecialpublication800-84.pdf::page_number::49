[Insert table of contents]


SAMPLE INTRODUCTION

In an effort to validate [insert organization name] [insert name of plan being exercised 23 ], [insert
organization name] will conduct a tabletop exercise to examine processes and procedures associated with
the implementation of the [insert plan name]. This discussion-based exercise will be a [insert number of
hours]-hour event that will begin at [insert start time] and will last until [insert end time].

The exercise is designed to facilitate communication among select personnel regarding the
implementation of recovery operations at [insert organization name] following an event causing the
outage of mission critical systems that are housed in the [insert facility name]. This exercise is designed
to improve the readiness of the [insert organization name] and help validate existing [insert plan name]
procedures.

Participants should come to the exercise prepared to discuss high-level issues related to the recovery of
mission critical systems at the [insert facility name]. To achieve the exercise’s stated objectives,
discussion will focus on the following [insert facility name] contingency planning elements:

      What would be done to recover each class of system (e.g., Messaging, Web) at the [insert facility
       name]?
      How will system recovery be accomplished and what is the priority/optimal chronology of
       restoration?
      What is the time required for restoration and how can this be optimized?
      What are the expected results and action items that will assist system teams and improve
       readiness after the exercise?
Participants may choose to bring back-up reference material that will aid in answering the above
questions.

SAMPLE CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS

A tabletop exercise is a discussion-based event in which participants meet in a “classroom” setting to
address the actions they would take in response to an emergency situation. Tabletops are an effective
initial step for personnel to discuss the full range of issues related to a crisis scenario. These exercises
provide an excellent forum to examine roles and responsibilities, unearth interdependencies, and evaluate
plans.

Participants will be presented with a scenario affecting the [insert facility name]. A facilitator will help
guide discussion by asking questions designed to address the exercise’s objectives.

SAMPLE OBJECTIVES

The exercise objectives are as follows:

      Validate the team’s ability to recover IT operations at alternate facility
