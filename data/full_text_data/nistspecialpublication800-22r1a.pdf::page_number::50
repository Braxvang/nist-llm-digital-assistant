                  ∇ 2 ψ 2m = ψ 2m − 2ψ 2m−1 + ψ 2m−2 = Ψ32 − 2Ψ22 + Ψ12 = 2.8 − 2(1.2)+ 0.4 = 0.8

(5)       Compute: P-value1 = igamc  2 m−2 ,∇ψ 2m  and
                                                         
                                                        2
                      P-value2 = igamc  2 m −3 ,∇ 2 ψ m  .
                                                          

          For the example in this section,
                                                1.6 
                             P-value1 = igamc  2,    = 0.9057
                                                2 
                                               0.8 
                             P-value2 = igamc 1,    = 0.8805.
                                               2 

2.11.5 Decision Rule (at the 1% Level)
If the computed P-value is < 0.01, then conclude that the sequence is non-random. Otherwise, conclude
that the sequence is random.

2.11.6 Conclusion and Interpretation of Results
Since the P-value obtained in step 5 of Section 2.11.4 is ≥ 0.01 (P-value1 = 0.808792 and P-value2 =
0.670320), the conclusion is that the sequence is random.

Note that if ∇2ψ2m or ∇ψ2m had been large then non-uniformity of the m-bit blocks is implied.

2.11.7 Input Size Recommendation
Choose m and n such that m < log2 n -2.

2.11.8 Example
(input)     ε = 1,000,000 bits from the binary expansion of e

(input)           m = 2; n = 1000000 = 106

(processing)      #0s = 499971; #1s = 500029
                  #00s = 250116; #01s = #10s = 249855; #11s = 250174

(processing)      ψ22 = 0.343128; ψ21 = 0.003364; ψ20 = 0.000000

(processing)      ∇ψ22 = 0.339764; ∇2ψ22 = 0.336400

(output)P-value1 = 0.843764; P-value2 = 0.561915

(conclusion)      Since both P-value1 and P-value2 were ≥ 0.01, accept the sequences as random for both
                  tests.
