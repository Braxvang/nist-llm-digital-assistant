5.4    Using the Derived Master Key to Protect Data

In this section, two options will be provided to protect data using an MK. In both options,
a DPK is used to protect electronically-stored data, and the correctness of the DPK shall
be verified. Figure 3 summarizes a general procedure for password-based key derivation
to access protected data (or apply protection to the data) with the two options.

Note that if the DPK is compromised, it is necessary to recover (e.g., decrypt) the data
and re-protect (e.g., re-encrypt) that data using a new password and/or a new DPK.

Option 1:

In this option, there are two ways to derive DPKs from MKs: in Option 1a, the MK (or a
segment of the MK) is used directly as the DPK, whereas in Option 1b, the DPK is
derived from the MK using a KDF. Note that the DPK may be a set of keys used for
encryption and integrity.
