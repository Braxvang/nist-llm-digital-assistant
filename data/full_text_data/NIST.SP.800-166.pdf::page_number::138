                                                                         DATA MODEL TEST GUIDELINES

Appendix Aâ€”Testing of Derived PIV Credentials on Embedded Tokens

Embedded hardware tokens are not removable from the mobile device, but may be accessed by
software using the underlying cryptographic interface of the mobile device. Since these tokens
are built into the mobile device, they do not require an application interface definition to enable
communication between the token and the mobile device native environment. Nevertheless,
embedded tokens can be tested for the service they provide. Two types of testing are described
below:

A.1   Functional Testing

In order to ensure that an embedded Derived PIV Credential follows the specification, test
entities may develop test assertions to test these credentials within their operating environment.
For example, in order to determine if a Derived PIV Authentication certificate and associated
private key on the mobile device can be used for authentication, a test entity may set up an TLS-
enabled test website and test whether a mobile device with an embedded Derived PIV
Authentication certificate can successfully authenticate to the site. Similarly, for testing digital
signature and encryption capabilities, a native email client on a mobile device may be setup to
sign or decrypt Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) messages and the
results reviewed to determine suitable functionality.

A.2   Data Model Testing

In order to perform data model conformance testing, test entities need to obtain the certificates
(i.e., Derived PIV Authentication, digital signature, and key management). Methods for
obtaining the certificates include, but are not limited to, (i) performing a functional test and
acquiring the certificate by means of that test, (ii) using vendor-specific interface commands to
extract the certificates, or (iii) requesting the certificates from the issuer directly.

Once the certificates have been obtain, test entities can follow (as appropriate) the test assertions
from Section 9.3 to verify that the certificates conform to the appropriate profiles.
