methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance
the development and productive use of information technology. ITL’s responsibilities include the
development of management, administrative, technical, and physical standards and guidelines for
the cost-effective security and privacy of other than national security-related information in
federal information systems. The Special Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research,

                                           Abstract

The purpose of this Special Publication is to provide appropriate and useful guidelines for
assessing the reliability of issuers of Personal Identity Verification (PIV) Cards and Derived PIV
Credentials. These issuers store personal information and issue credentials based on Office of
Management and Budget (OMB) policies and on the standards published in response to
Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12) and therefore are the primary target of
the assessment and authorization under this guideline. The reliability of an issuer is of utmost
importance when one organization (e.g., a federal agency) is required to trust the identity
credentials of individuals that were created and issued by another federal agency. This trust will
only exist if organizations relying on the credentials issued by a given organization have the
necessary level of assurance that the reliability of the issuing organization has been established
through a formal authorization process.
