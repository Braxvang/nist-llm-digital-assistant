A STATISTICAL TEST SUITE FOR RANDOM AND PSEUDORANDOM NUMBER GENERATORS FOR CRYPTOGRAPHIC APPLICATIONS




(conclusion)         Since P-value ≥ 0.01, accept the sequence as random.


2.10 Linear Complexity Test

2.10.1 Test Purpose
The focus of this test is the length of a linear feedback shift register (LFSR). The purpose of this test is to
determine whether or not the sequence is complex enough to be considered random. Random sequences
are characterized by longer LFSRs. An LFSR that is too short implies non-randomness.

2.10.2 Function Call
LinearComplexity(M, n), where:

           M         The length in bits of a block.

           n         The length of the bit string.

Additional input used by the function, but supplied by the testing code:

           ε         The sequence of bits as generated by the RNG or PRNG being tested; this exists as a
                     global structure at the time of the function call; ε = ε1, ε2, … , εn.

           K         The number of degrees of freedom; K = 6 has been hard coded into the test.

2.10.3 Test Statistic and Reference Distribution
χ2(obs):      A measure of how well the observed number of occurrences of fixed length LFSRs
              matches the expected number of occurrences under an assumption of randomness.

The reference distribution for the test statistic is the χ2 distribution.

2.10.4 Test Description
(1)    Partition the n-bit sequence into N independent blocks of M bits, where n = MN.

(2)        Using the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm5, determine the linear complexity Li of each of the N
           blocks (i = 1,…,N). Li is the length of the shortest linear feedback shift register sequence that
           generates all bits in the block i. Within any Li-bit sequence, some combination of the bits, when
           added together modulo 2, produces the next bit in the sequence (bit Li + 1).

           For example, if M = 13 and the block to be tested is 1101011110001, then Li = 4, and the
           sequence is produced by adding the 1st and 2nd bits within a 4-bit subsequence to produce the next
           bit (the 5th bit). The examination proceeded as follows:
