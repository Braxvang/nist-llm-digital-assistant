can be particularly serious because specific modifications to system changes can be difficult to
identify.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: The consequences of undetected or
unauthorized modification or destruction of system maintenance information may depend on the
maximum aggregate sensitivity and criticality of the information and processes associated with
the system. The Recommended Integrity Impact Level can range from low to high to national
security information (outside the scope of this guideline).

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
system maintenance information is moderate.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to maintenance information.
Functions and processes supported by most maintenance information are not time-critical.
That is, temporary disruption of access to maintenance information will usually have only a
limited adverse effect on agency operations (including mission functions and public
confidence in the agency), agency assets, or individuals.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
system maintenance information is low.
C.3.5.4 IT Infrastructure Maintenance Information Type

IT infrastructure maintenance involves the planning, design, implementation, and maintenance of
an IT Infrastructure to effectively support automated needs (i.e. operating systems, applications
software, platforms, networks, servers, printers, etc.). IT infrastructure maintenance also
includes information systems configuration and security policy enforcement information. This
information includes password files, network access rules and implementing files and/or switch
setting, hardware and software configuration settings, and documentation that may affect access
to the information systemâ€™s data, programs, and/or processes. The impact levels associated with
IT infrastructure maintenance information are primarily a function of the information processed
in and through that infrastructure.

The IT Maintenance Information type represents a complex set of data elements that are used to
secure the design, implementation, and maintenance of systems and networks. The security of
each of these data elements is dependent on the security of the other data elements. Security
compromise of one data element type will propagate to others.

The recommended security categorization for the IT infrastructure maintenance information type
is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of IT infrastructure
maintenance information on the ability of responsible agencies to plan, design, implement, and
maintain an IT Infrastructure to effectively support automated needs (i.e. operating systems,
