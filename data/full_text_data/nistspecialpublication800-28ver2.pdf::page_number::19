3.    Threats

Threats are possible dangers to a computer system, which may result in the interception, alteration,
obstruction, destruction, or other disruption of computational resources. Understanding the nature of the
threats associated with active content and mobile code is the first step towards reducing them. Reducing
threats minimizes the possibility of attacks, which are the realizations of specific threats that impact the
confidentiality, integrity, accountability, or availability of a computational resource.

3.1   Threat Sources

Organizationsâ€™ increasing reliance on networked computing systems for critical functions has revealed a
number of shortcomings in the original design of the networking protocols in use on the Internet. While
some security features were foreseen and built into these protocols, a number of others were not
addressed, including:

 Data confidentiality. Data passed across the Internet using the Internet Protocol (IP) travel in
  packets that can be captured easily and viewed to reveal their contents.
 Data integrity. Data traversing the Internet may be intercepted and modified before reaching the
  recipient or replayed later. While IP provides a limited checksum feature, it is not cryptographically
  bound to data packets and can be modified easily.
 User identification and authentication. IP packets do not provide user identification or
  authentication. Due to the layered model of the Internet, the responsibility for user authentication
  falls to the application layer protocol (e.g., HTTP [HTTP], Simple Mail Transfer Protocol [SMTP],
  FTP [FTP]). Unfortunately, many of these protocols rely on cleartext passwords, which are
  susceptible to being captured by eavesdroppers.
 System identification and authentication. IP packets contain Internet addresses identifying the host
  or gateway system that sent the packet, but these addresses are not protected (e.g., by cryptography)
  and can easily be spoofed.
 Reliable domain name translation. The Domain Name System (DNS) used to translate names to
  host addresses on the Internet relies on truthful and accurate reporting of mappings by all
  components, which is difficult to ensure. DNS was not designed to provide integrity or authentication
  services.
 Mobile code security. Many Web sites supply code that the Web browser must process. Some of
  the most common forms of mobile code are JavaScript, Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX),
  Java applets, ActiveX, and Flash. Each form of mobile code has a different security model and
  configuration management process, increasing the complexity of securing mobile code hosts and the
  code itself.
These omissions provide one source of vulnerabilities intruders use to devise attacks against hosts on the
Internet. Other vulnerabilities in an operating system, Web server software, or a Web protocol may also
be present in many, if not most, Web sites at a given time, creating further opportunity for attack. The
nature of the Internet amplifies the risks associated with vulnerabilities in connected hosts. Many
initiatives to mitigate threats are underway or reaching maturity. Standards for Internet Protocol Security
(IPsec), Secure DNS, and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) have been implemented in products.
Government-certified security evaluation laboratories have been established under regional and
worldwide mutual recognition schemes. Organizations have established incident response teams, which
have improved their effectiveness in combating intrusions. Commercial software for detecting and
