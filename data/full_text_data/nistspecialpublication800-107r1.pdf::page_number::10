       2.    Preimage resistance 2: Given a randomly chosen hash value, hash_value, it is
            computationally infeasible to find an x so that hash(x) = hash_value. This
            property is also called the one-way property. Preimage resistance is measured by
            the amount of work that would be needed to have a high probability of finding a
            preimage for a hash function. If the amount of work is 2N, then the preimage
            resistance is N bits. The expected preimage-resistance strength of a hash function
            is the length of the hash value produced by that hash function, i.e., for an L-bit
            hash function, the expected security strength for preimage resistance is L bits. For
            example, SHA-256 produces a (full-length) hash value of 256 bits; SHA-256
            provides an expected preimage resistance of 256 bits (see Table 1 in Section 4.2).
       3. Second preimage resistance: It is computationally infeasible to find a second input
          that has the same hash value as any other specified input. That is, given an input
          x, it is computationally infeasible to find a second input x’ that is different from x,
          such that hash(x) = hash(x’). Second preimage resistance is measured by the
          amount of work that would be needed to have a high probability of finding a
          second preimage for a hash function. If the amount of work is 2N, then the second
          preimage resistance is N bits. In general, the expected second preimage strength
          of a hash function is the length of the hash value produced by that hash function,
          i.e., for an L-bit hash function, the expected security strength for second preimage
          resistance is L bits. For example, SHA-256 produces a (full-length) hash value of
          256 bits; SHA-256 provides an expected second preimage resistance of 256 bits
          (see Table 1 in Section 4.2). However, for some hash functions, the second
          preimage resistance strength also depends on the message length processed by the
          hash function. More details can be found in Appendix A.
The security strength of a hash function is determined by its collision resistance strength,
preimage resistance strength or second preimage resistance strength, depending on the
property(ies) that the cryptographic application needs from the hash function. If an
application requires more than one property from the hash function, then the weakest
property is the security strength of the hash function for that application. For instance, the
security strength of a hash function for digital signatures is defined as its collision
resistance strength, because digital signatures require both collision resistance and second
preimage resistance from the hash function, and the collision resistance strength of the
hash function (L/2) is less than its second preimage resistance strength (i.e., L).
A hash function that is not suitable for one application might be suitable for other
cryptographic applications that do not require the same security properties. SHA-1 is not
suitable for general-purpose digital signature applications (as specified in FIPS 186-3)
that require 112 bits of security. In the case of digital signatures, SHA-1 does not provide
the 112 bits of collision resistance (see Table 1 in Section 4.2) needed to achieve the
security strength. On the other hand, SHA-1 does provide the 112 bits of preimage
resistance that is needed to achieve the 112-bit security strength for HMAC. The security
strengths of the approved hash functions for different applications can be found in SP
800-57, Part 1 [SP 800-57].

    There are slightly different definitions of preimage resistance of hash functions in the literature.
