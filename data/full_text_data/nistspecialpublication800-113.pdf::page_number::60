                                                                                          GUIDE TO SSL VPNS



applications are accessible in each commonly used browser and operating system. It is impossible to test
every single permutation of client environment because of the wide variety of possible configuration
settings on each machine, but at least a default configuration of each commonly used operating system
and browser should be tested.

Disk imaging technologies could be helpful in the interoperability testing process. Baseline images of
each operating system could be created and then restored to the baseline after each iteration of testing.
This practice helps to ensure consistency during the testing process and may help to identify specific
configurations that result in interoperability problems. Virtual machine technology could also be helpful
in a similar way, where a “snapshot” of the baseline operating system running in a virtual machine is
created and then restored after each testing iteration. Virtual machine technology streamlines the
interoperability testing process by vastly reducing the time to restore a machine to its initial baseline
condition.

If interoperability problems are discovered, the organization should work with the SSL VPN device
vendor to troubleshoot them. Helping the vendor to replicate these problems is essential for this process.
The problems may be solved by configuration changes, patches provided by the vendor, or modifications
to the application or operating system that is causing the problem. If an interoperability problem with an
application cannot be solved, the organization may have to reconsider whether it will be possible to
enable remote access for the application.

4.5   Deploy the Solution

Once testing is complete and any issues have been resolved, the next phase of the SSL VPN planning and
implementation model involves deploying the solution. It is important to launch a pilot program before
enterprise-wide deployment. A pilot program should consist of users who will be helpful for testing the
SSL VPN solution for interoperability, functionality, and usability. Pilot users should fall in a broad
range of technical knowledge levels to evaluate the organization’s ability to answer a wide variety of
technical questions regarding the SSL VPN solution. At the same time, the limited nature of a pilot
program helps to identify a set of problems that could potentially affect a greater audience, while offering
the opportunity to fix these problems before the SSL VPN is used by the entire enterprise.

Part of the pilot program includes end user training and help desk support to assist users in understanding
and using the SSL VPN’s features. End users can either be trained in hands-on sessions or larger lectures.
Users also require documentation that serves as a reference in supplementing the training. Help desk
personnel should receive more detailed technical training so they can help users to troubleshoot problems
and walk them through the process of establishing VPN connectivity. If the pilot program is small
enough, the group deploying the SSL VPN solution may provide technical support to pilot users, with
training for help desk personnel occurring later.

After the pilot program has been launched, it is recommended that the organization gradually migrate
existing network infrastructure, applications, and users to the new SSL VPN solution. This phased
deployment provides administrators an opportunity to evaluate the impact of the SSL VPN solution and
resolve issues before enterprise-wide deployment. Most of the issues that can occur during SSL VPN
deployment are the same type of issues that occur during any large IT deployment.

The organization should also produce technical documentation somewhere in the deployment phase. The
documentation should include the following:
