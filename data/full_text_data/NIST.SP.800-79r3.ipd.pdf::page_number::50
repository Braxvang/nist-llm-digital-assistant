       NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                    Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
       December 2023                                                           and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

1567           Monitoring Phase
1568   The Monitoring Phase consists of two tasks: (i) operations plan maintenance and (ii) an annual
1569   life cycle walkthrough. Based on the importance of reliably creating and issuing PIV Cards and
1570   derived PIV credentials, it is imperative that once the authorization is completed, the issuer’s
1571   operations are monitored to ensure that policies, procedures, and processes remain in effect as
1572   originally intended. There can be significant changes in an issuer’s policies, management,
1573   operations personnel, and available technology during a three-year ATO. These changes need to
1574   be monitored so that the organization minimizes exposing itself to security and privacy threats
1575   that exist or arise after the authorization of the issuer. For example, if there is significant staff
1576   turnover, the organization needs to be sure that new staff are performing the PIV functions using
1577   the same reliable processes that were previously approved. The overall responsibility for
1578   monitoring lies with the EIMO and the DAO.
1579   An annual life cycle walkthrough of issuer operations involves reviewing all of the services and
1580   functions of an issuer and its facilities for continued reliability. The annual walkthrough covers
1581   the life cycle of PIV Card and derived PIV credential from sponsorship to maintenance.
1582   Observation of the full life cycle ensures that all processes are still reliably operating as assessed
1583   during the authorization.
1584           Task 8: Operations Plan Update
1585           An operations plan serves as the primary description on how PIV Cards or derived PIV
1586           credentials are being issued by the issuer. It is essential that this document be updated as
1587           changes occur in the issuer’s operations. Management will be able to analyze the impacts
1588           of changes as they occur and be significantly better prepared when reauthorization is
1589           required.
1590                    Subtask 8.1: Document all relevant changes in the issuance processes within the
1591                    operations plan.
1592                    Responsibility: EIMO
1593                    Guidance: If changes are made to the information system, the issuer needs to
1594                    update the operations plan, PIV Card, derived PIV credential, privacy policies,
1595                    roles and responsibilities, and issuer controls.
1596                    Subtask 8.2: Analyze the proposed or actual changes to the issuer, and determine
1597                    the impacts of such changes.
1598                    Responsibility: EIMO
1599                    Guidance: If the results of the impact analysis indicate that changes to the issuer
1600                    affect the reliability of its operations, the changes and impacts need to be reported
1601                    to the DAO, corrective actions need to be initiated, and the CAP needs to be
1602                    updated. If major changes have occurred, the issuer will need to be reauthorized.
1603           Task 9: Annual Life Cycle Walkthrough
1604           The annual life cycle walkthrough is a monitoring activity to be performed by the issuer
1605           when its PIV Card or derived PIV credential issuing services begin and annually
1606           thereafter. The EIMO (or designated appointee) is responsible for observing and
1607           reviewing the entire life cycle of the PIV Card or derived PIV credential. This
