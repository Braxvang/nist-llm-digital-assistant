    IMPERATIVE 3
    Strengthening Cryptographic Standards and Validation

    Cryptography—the technological foundation for most cybersecurity functions—
    is constantly under attack by a multiplying array of adversaries that range from
    individual criminals seeking financial gains to terrorist groups and nation states. If the
    cryptographic protection for an organization’s information technology is defeated or
    bypassed, the organization—and, potentially, our nation’s entire infrastructure system—
    may be wide open to malicious attack.
    NIST is responsible for developing U.S. federal cryptographic standards as well as the
    technologies and programs used to determine and validate correct implementation of
    those standards. This has been a mainstay of NIST’s computer security work for nearly 50
    years. In FY18, NIST continued to work with partners in government, the private sector,
    and academia in the United States and around the globe to confront a variety of urgent
    technical and implementation challenges to cryptographic security. These included:
          •   Post-Quantum Cryptography. In recent years, there has been a substantial amount
              of research on quantum computers—machines that exploit quantum mechanical
              phenomena to solve mathematical problems that are difficult or intractable for
              conventional computers. If large-scale quantum computers are ever built, they will
              be able to break many of the public key cryptosystems currently in use, seriously
              compromising the confidentiality and integrity of digital data. During FY18, NIST
              continued to prioritize work on post-quantum cryptography (also called quantum-
              resistant cryptography) with the ambitious goal of developing cryptographic
              systems that are secure against both quantum and classical computers and can
              interoperate with existing communications protocols and networks.
              After an earlier call to the public to submit post-quantum algorithms11 that
              could resist a quantum computer’s onslaught, from FY18 to FY19 NIST worked
              with the larger cryptography community to narrow the field from 69 submitted
              algorithms to 26. The remaining algorithms are those which NIST mathematicians
              and computer scientists consider to be the strongest candidates. Next, NIST is
              asking the cryptography community to focus on analyzing how these algorithms
              will perform in the real world (e.g., how they will fit into the internet protocols
              currently in use). This second round of analysis focuses more heavily on evaluating
              the submissions’ performance across a wide variety of systems, not just in big
              computers and smartphones.
