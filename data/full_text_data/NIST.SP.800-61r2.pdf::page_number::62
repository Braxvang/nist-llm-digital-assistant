A.2 Scenarios

Scenario 1: Domain Name System (DNS) Server Denial of Service (DoS)
On a Saturday afternoon, external users start having problems accessing the organization’s public
websites. Over the next hour, the problem worsens to the point where nearly every access attempt fails.
Meanwhile, a member of the organization’s networking staff responds to alerts from an Internet border
router and determines that the organization’s Internet bandwidth is being consumed by an unusually large
volume of User Datagram Protocol (UDP) packets to and from both the organization’s public DNS
servers. Analysis of the traffic shows that the DNS servers are receiving high volumes of requests from a
single external IP address. Also, all the DNS requests from that address come from the same source port.
The following are additional questions for this scenario:
    1. Whom should the organization contact regarding the external IP address in question?
    2. Suppose that after the initial containment measures were put in place, the network administrators
       detected that nine internal hosts were also attempting the same unusual requests to the DNS
       server. How would that affect the handling of this incident?
    3. Suppose that two of the nine internal hosts disconnected from the network before their system
       owners were identified. How would the system owners be identified?

Scenario 2: Worm and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Agent Infestation
On a Tuesday morning, a new worm is released; it spreads itself through removable media, and it can
copy itself to open Windows shares. When the worm infects a host, it installs a DDoS agent. The
