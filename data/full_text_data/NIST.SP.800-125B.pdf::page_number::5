NIST SP 800-125B                                                SECURE VIRTUAL NETWORK CONFIGURATION
                                                                                   FOR VM PROTECTION


Executive Summary

Data center infrastructures are rapidly becoming virtualized due to increasing deployment of virtualized
hosts (also called hypervisor hosts). Virtual machines (VMs) are the key resources to be protected in this
virtualized infrastructure since they are the compute engines hosting mission-critical applications of the
enterprise. VMs are the end nodes of a virtual network, so the virtual networkâ€™s configuration is an
important element in the overall security strategy for VMs.

The purpose of this NIST Special Publication (SP) is to provide an analysis of various virtual network
configuration options for protection of virtual machines (VMs) and present recommendations based on
the analysis. The relevant configuration areas discussed in this publication are network segmentation,
network path redundancy, traffic control through firewalls, and VM traffic monitoring. Each
configuration option in each of these areas has different advantages and disadvantages, which are
identified in this publication. Analysis of these has led to the development of one or more security
recommendations for each configuration area.

The motivation for this document is the trend in U.S. Federal Government agencies to deploy server
virtualization within their internal information technology (IT) infrastructures and to use VMs from cloud
service providers for agency applications. The target audience for the document is Chief Information
Security Officers (CISOs) and other agency personnel and contractors involved in providing the
necessary security protections for agency applications through appropriate virtual network configurations.
The intended goal is that the analysis of the configuration options provided in this report, along with the
security recommendations, will facilitate making informed decisions with respect to architecting the
virtual network configuration. Such a configuration is expected to ensure the appropriate level of network
protection for all VMs and the application workloads running in them.
