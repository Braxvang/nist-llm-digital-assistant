NIST SP 800-160v1r1                                                  Engineering Trustworthy Secure Systems
November 2022

H.11.1.        Security Purpose
    Provide objective evidence that the system, when in use, fulfills the protection needs
    associated with its business or mission objectives and the stakeholder requirements, thereby
    achieving its intended use in its intended operational environment in a trustworthy secure
    manner.

H.11.2.        Security Outcomes
-   Security validation criteria are defined.
-   The availability of security services required by stakeholders is confirmed.
-   Security-relevant validation constraints that influence system requirements, architecture, or
    design are identified.
-   Security aspects of the system, system element, or artifact are validated.
-   Enabling systems or services for the security aspects of validation are available.
-   Security-focused validation results and anomalies are identified.
-   Objective evidence of the successful validation of security aspects is provided.
-   Traceability of the validated security aspects of the system, system elements, and artifacts is
    established.

H.11.3.        Security Activities and Tasks
VA-1   PREPARE FOR VALIDATION
       VA-1.1 Identify the security aspects within the validation scope and corresponding security
              validation actions.
       Note: The security aspects of validation focus on the stakeholders’ protection needs, concerns,
       and associated security requirements. The scope includes system elements, the entire system,
       or any artifact that impacts the stakeholder’s confidence in the system and the decision to
       accept the system as being trustworthy for its intended use.
       VA-1.2 Identify the constraints that can potentially limit the feasibility of the security validation
              actions.
       Note: Constraints may include the level of assurance and the availability of business or mission
       stakeholders to support validation activities; the availability of sufficient, relevant, and credible
       threat data; the limits on conducting validation activities in actual operational conditions across
       all business and mission modes and associated system states and modes; the technology
       employed; the size and complexity of the system element or artifact; and the cost and time
       allotted for validation activities.
       VA-1.3 Select appropriate security validation methods and the associated success criteria for
              each security validation action.
       Note: Adversity emulation, including penetration testing and emulating abuse and misuse, is
       included.
