NIST SP 800-160v1r1                                                  Engineering Trustworthy Secure Systems

•   Be absent of self-induced, emergent, erroneous, unsafe, and non-assured control actions

The protection characteristics for mechanisms must account for but not depend on having
detailed knowledge of the capability, means, and methods of an adversary.

D.4.3. Security Function Failure Analysis
The design principle of Protective Failure states that a failure of a particular system element
should neither result in an unacceptable loss nor invoke another loss scenario. The failure of a
security function is of special concern, given the need for security functions to always be
invoked and operating correctly. Consequently, failure analyses must be performed during
system design to determine the impacts of security function failure on the system capabilities.

Failure analyses consider the assets that may be impacted by security function failure and the
associated loss consequences. Failure analyses also consider the function allocation to system
elements and the way the system function and element combination interacts with other system
function and element combinations, independent of specific events and conditions that might
lead to the failure. The principles for trustworthy secure design in Appendix E serve to guide and
inform the analyses.

The outcomes of the security function failure analyses also drive assurance levels and objectives,
as well as the fidelity and rigor of architecture, design, and implementation methods employed to
achieve those objectives. Assurance considerations are discussed in Appendix F.


                                       THE SCIENCE BEHIND SECURITY
           “Each of these [design] requirements [for mechanisms] is significant, for without
           them, the mechanism cannot be considered secure. The [need to be tamper-
           proof] is obvious, since if the reference validation mechanism can be tampered
           with, its validity is destroyed, as is any hope of achieving security through it. The
           [third] requirement of always invoking the reference validation mechanism simply
           states that if the reference validation is (or must be) suspended for some group of
           programs, then those programs must be considered part of the security apparatus
           and be [tamper-proof and evaluatable]. The [evaluatable] requirement is equally
           important. It states that because the reference validation mechanism is the
           security mechanism in the system, it must be possible to ascertain that it works
           correctly in all cases and is always invoked. If this cannot be achieved, then there
           is no way to know that the reference validation correctly takes place in all cases,
           and therefore there is no basis for certifying a system as secure.”
