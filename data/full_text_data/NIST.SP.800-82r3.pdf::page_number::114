NIST SP 800-82r3                                          Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security

6.2.1. Identity Management and Access Control (PR.AC)
Identity Management and Access Control (PR.AC) identifies outcomes around establishing and
managing the identification mechanisms and credentials for users, devices, and services. Identity
management supports the cybersecurity principle of positively and uniquely identifying and
authorizing a person, process, or device before granting physical or logical access to resources
such as the system, information, or location being protected. Access controls represent the
policies, processes, and technologies for specifying the use of system resources by only
authorized users, programs, processes, or other systems. PR.AC controls allow organizations to
manage logical and physical access to support system risk management requirements.
Supplemental guidance for implementing identity management and access control outcomes can
be found in the following documents:
   •   NIST SP 800-63-3, Digital Identity Guidelines
   •   NIST SP 800-73-4, Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification
   •   NIST SP 800-76-2, Biometric Specifications for Personal Identity Verification
   •   NIST SP 800-100, Information Security Handbook: A Guide for Managers
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Organizations should consider the life cycle for managing OT
            credentials, including issuance, revocation, and updates across the OT
            environment.
            Organizations should also consider the centralization of identification
            and authentication for users, devices, and processes within the OT
            environments to improve account management and monitoring
            capabilities. Common network technologies – such as Active Directory,
            Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), and similar
            technologies – can be utilized to support the centralization of identity
            management across environments. Organizations should weigh the
            increased risks of authenticated accounts from IT environments having
            access within the OT environment against the benefits of using
            centralized accounts.
            When OT cannot support authentication or the organization determines
            that it is not advisable due to adverse impacts on performance, safety, or
            reliability, the organization should select compensating countermeasures,
            such as the use of physical security (e.g., control center keycard access
            for authorized users) to provide an equivalent security capability or level
            of protection for the OT. This guidance also applies to the use of session
            lock and session termination in an OT.
            A unique challenge in OT is the need for immediate access to an HMI in
            emergency situations. The time needed to enter a user’s credentials may
            impede response or intervention by the operator, resulting in negative
            consequences to safety, health, or the environment.
