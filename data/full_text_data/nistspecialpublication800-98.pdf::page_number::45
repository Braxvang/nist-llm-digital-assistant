                                                            SECTION 3: RFID APPLICATIONS AND APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS



3.1.7    Automated Payment 27

RFID technology automates a variety of financial transactions, including fare collection on public transit
systems, 28 toll collection on roads, fuel charges at gas station pumps, and retail payment using credit
cards with embedded RFID tags. The US General Services Administration (GSA) Smart Card Program
provides RFID-based cards that support financial transactions. 29 The main advantages over other
payment forms are speed and convenience; RFID-based automated payment systems do not require users
to physically exchange cash or cards with clerks or machines.

Automated payment systems are a specialized form of access control in which access is granted to credit
or debit a financial account. Like other access control systems, they require additional security
protections to prevent fraud and abuse. In the case of automated payment, integrity and confidentiality
controls are needed as well as protection against duplicating or modifying tags; users should not be able
to alter debit and credit amounts, and bystanders should not be able to record account numbers or other
transaction details. For these reasons, the protocols and cryptography that support automated payment
systems typically are considerably more complex than those that support physical access control systems.

Automated payment systems can be online or offline. Online systems, which are the most common, store
and process the financial data in a central system networked with the readers. Offline systems require the
smart card to store “electronic cash” and handle debit and credit transactions, which involve more
sophisticated computing and increase the cost of each card. One advantage of offline systems is that they
can support the same user anonymity achieved with cash, while centralized systems must link users to
their accounts. However, because most users do not demand complete anonymity, the additional
complexity and expense of offline systems make them relatively uncommon.

One example of an automated payment system is currently being used by large resorts and cruise ships.
Guests are issued RFID-enabled identification cards upon check-in. These cards are linked to credit card
accounts and enable passengers to pay for meals and gift shop items. They are also used for identification
when guests disembark the ship or leave the resort grounds.

3.1.8    Supply Chain Management

Supply chain management involves the monitoring and control of products from manufacture to
distribution to retail sale. Supply chain management typically bundles several application types,
including asset management, tracking, process control, and payment systems. An important
distinguishing feature of supply chain management systems is that they span multiple organizations, each
of which uses RFID technology that interoperates with the others. When a system is not under one
organization’s control, it is referred to as an open system. The previously discussed systems are closed
systems because a single organization manages them. 30 Open systems are inherently more vulnerable
than closed systems because the network, application and operational interfaces between organizations
provide an adversary with more potential avenues to attack the system.

     This document does not describe or discuss in detail the multi-layered security controls required for RFID-based automated
     payment systems. Automated payment systems, point-of-sale systems, and financial transaction systems typically have
     complex security systems with a variety of controls and safeguards.

     Chicago, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C. use RFID-based fare collection. For additional information see Permanent
     Citizens Advisory Committee to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, "In your pocket: using smart cards for seamless
     travel," October 2004, http://www.pcac.org/reports/pdf/Smart%20Card%20Exec%C9ive%20Summary.pdf.

     Another common term is a closed loop system, which refers to RFID systems that recycle their tags for reuse. Open loop
     systems could refer to RFID systems that use disposable tags, which is the case in most supply chains.
