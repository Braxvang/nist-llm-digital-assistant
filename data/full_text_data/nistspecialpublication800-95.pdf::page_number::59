     Web browser or a SAML-aware client or proxy, a profile for discovery identity providers, a profile
     for single logout, and a profile for managing identifiers among multiple service providers.
 Artifact resolution. This profile defines how SAML-aware providers should retrieve the SAML
  assertion associated with a SAML artifact provided by a requester.
 Assertion query/request. This profile describes how to use the SAML assertion query/request
  protocol over a synchronous protocol, such as SOAP.
 Name identifier mapping. This profile describes how to use the SAML name identifier mapping
  protocol.
 Attribute. These profiles define how to represent attributes from common attribute stores in SAML
  assertions.
3.5.3.5 SAML Attributes

In Web services, attributes are usually disseminated using either SAML attribute assertions or X.509
certificates containing the required attributes. While X.509 certificates only provide a limited set of
attributes, SAML attributes can encompass any type of attribute. In most enterprise systems, user
attributes are stored in various Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) or X.500 directories,
Relational Data Base Management Systems (RDBMS), or Active Directories (AD). In the SAML
architecture, these are referred to as attribute stores. By abstracting the various forms of attribute stores
into a single entity, the SAML request/response protocol can be used to query any attribute store,
regardless of its underlying structure.

Through the SAML attribute profiles, interoperability between the attribute storeâ€™s SAML interface and
the Web service accessing it is guaranteed. SAML V2.0 provides attribute profiles for X.500/LDAP
attributes, Universally Unique Identifiers (UUID), DCE PAC attributes, and XACML attributes. The
X.500/LDAP, UUID, and DCE PAC attribute profiles detail how to convert between SAML attributes
and the structures of the individual attribute stores. While XACML is not an attribute store, the XACML
attributes profile details how SAML assertions can be used as input to XACML authorization decisions.
SAML can be extended to support any other form of attribute store, allowing attributes to be accessed in a
Web services environment.

While SAML provides a mechanism for accessing attributes, it does not provide a mechanism for
updating attributes in a SOA. As of this writing, there is no Web services standard for modifying the
contents of data stores used by a SOA. For Web services to alter the contents of the various attribute
stores, custom Web services would have to be developed using appropriate WS-Security and
authorization techniques.

3.5.3.6 SAML Security

The Security and Privacy Considerations for the OASIS Security Assertion Markup Language 41
document 42 outlines the threats faced when using SAML and provides guidance in securing a SAML-
based architecture. In particular, it is important to recognize that once a SAML assertion has been issued,
it is not possible to control its dissemination. An entity that receives a SAML assertion may pass it on to
other, potentially malicious entities as part of the system. It is important to ensure that all SAML
