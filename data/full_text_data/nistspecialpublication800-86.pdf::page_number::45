jumper from the system’s motherboard or using a manufacturer’s backdoor password. 54 Of course,
bypassing a password might mean rebooting the system, which might be undesirable. Another possibility
is to attempt to capture the password through network or host-based controls (e.g., packet sniffer,
keystroke logger), with proper management and legal approval. If a boot-up password has been set on a
hard drive, it might be possible to guess it (i.e., a default password from a vendor) or to circumvent it with
specialized hardware and software.

4.3.3    Using a Forensic Toolkit

Analysts should have access to various tools that enable them to perform examinations and analysis of
data, as well as some collection activities. Many forensic products allow the analyst to perform a wide
range of processes to analyze files and applications, as well as collecting files, reading disk images, and
extracting data from files. Most analysis products also offer the ability to generate reports and to log all
errors that occurred during the analysis. Although these products are invaluable in performing analysis, it
is critical to understand which processes should be run to answer particular questions about the data. An
analyst may need to provide a quick response or just answer a simple question about the collected data.
In these cases, a complete forensic evaluation may not be necessary or even feasible. The forensic toolkit
should contain applications that can accomplish data examination and analysis in many ways and can be
run quickly and efficiently from floppy disks, CDs, or a forensic workstation. The following processes
are among those that an analyst should be able to perform with a variety of tools:

     ! Using File Viewers. Using viewers instead of the original source applications to display the
       contents of certain types of files is an important technique for scanning or previewing data, and is
       more efficient because the analyst does not need native applications for viewing each type of file.
       Various tools are available for viewing common types of files, and there are also specialized tools
       solely for viewing graphics. If available file viewers do not support a particular file format, the
       original source application should be used; if this is not available, then it may be necessary to
       research the file’s format and manually extract the data from the file.55
     ! Uncompressing Files. Compressed files may contain files with useful information, as well as
       other compressed files. Therefore, it is important that the analyst locate and extract compressed
       files. Uncompressing files should be performed early in the forensic process to ensure that the
       contents of compressed files are included in searches and other actions. However, analysts
       should keep in mind that compressed files might contain malicious content, such as compression
       bombs, which are files that have been repeatedly compressed, typically dozens or hundreds of
       times. Compression bombs can cause examination tools to fail or consume considerable
       resources; they might also contain malware and other malicious payloads. Although there is no
       definite way to detect compression bombs before uncompressing a file, there are ways to
       minimize their impact. For instance, the examination system should use up-to-date antivirus
       software and should be standalone to limit the effects to just that system. In addition, an image of
       the examination system should be created so that, if needed, the system can be restored.
     ! Graphically Displaying Directory Structures. This practice makes it easier and faster for
       analysts to gather general information about the contents of media, such as the type of software
       installed and the likely technical aptitude of the user(s) who created the data. Most products can
       display Windows, Linux, and UNIX directory structures, whereas other products are specific to
       Macintosh directory structures.
