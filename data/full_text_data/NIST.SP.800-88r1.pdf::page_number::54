NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1                                                                Guidelines for Media Sanitization


Appendix C—Tools and Resources

Many different government, U.S. military, and academic institutions have conducted extensive
research in sanitization tools, techniques, and procedures in order to verify them to a certain level
of assurance. NIST does not conduct an evaluation of any tool set to verify its ability to Clear,
Purge, or Destroy information contained on any specific medium.

Organizations are encouraged to seek products that they can evaluate on their own. They can use
a trusted service or other federal organizations’ evaluation of tools and products, and they should
continually monitor and verify the effectiveness of their selected sanitization tools as they are
used.

If an organization has a product that they trust and have tested, then they are strongly encouraged
to share this information through public forums, such as the Federal Computer Security
Managers’ Forum 22.

C.1        NSA Media Destruction Guidance

This guide also recommends that the user consider the National Security Agency (NSA) devices
posted in the Media Destruction Guidance area of the public NSA website 23. NSA states that
“the products on these lists meet specific NSA performance requirements for sanitizing,
destroying, or disposing of media containing sensitive or classified information. Inclusion on a
list does not constitute an endorsement by NSA or the U.S. Government.” The evaluated
products lists provided on NSA’s website cover:

          Crosscut paper shredders,

          Optical media,

          Degaussers,

          Storage devices, and

          Disintegrators.

C.2        Open Source Tools

There are a variety of open source tools available that support leveraging the sanitize commands
based on standardized interfaces. As with any sanitization tool, independent validation should be
performed to ensure the desired functionality is provided. However, the availability of open
source tools helps organizations understand how the commands work and allows testing of
sanitize commands on a drive, as well as supporting the ability of home users to apply
sanitization to their personal media.
