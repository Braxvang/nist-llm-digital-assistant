                                                                       GUIDELINES ON ELECTRONIC MAIL SECURITY



However, vulnerability scanners have some significant weaknesses. Generally, they identify only surface
vulnerabilities and are unable to address the overall risk level of a scanned mail server. Although the scan
process itself is highly automated, vulnerability scanners can have a high false positive error rate
(reporting vulnerabilities when none exist). This means an individual with expertise in mail server
security and administration must interpret the results. Furthermore, vulnerability scanners cannot
generally identify vulnerabilities in custom code or applications.

Vulnerability scanners rely on periodic updating of the vulnerability database to recognize the latest
vulnerabilities. Before running any scanner, mail server administrators should install the latest updates to
its vulnerability database. Some vulnerability scanner databases are updated more regularly than others
(the frequency of updates should be a major consideration when choosing a vulnerability scanner).

Vulnerability scanners are often better at detecting well-known vulnerabilities rather than more esoteric
ones because it is impossible for any one scanning product to incorporate all known vulnerabilities in a
timely manner. In addition, manufacturers want to keep the speed of their scanners high (more
vulnerabilities detected requires more tests, which slows the overall scanning process). Therefore,
vulnerability scanners may be of little use to mail server administrators operating less popular mail
servers, operating systems, or custom-coded applications.

Vulnerability scanners provide the following capabilities:

 Identifying active hosts on the network
 Identifying active services (ports) on hosts and which of these are vulnerable
 Identifying applications and banner grabbing
 Identifying operating systems
 Identifying vulnerabilities associated with discovered operating systems and applications
 Testing compliance with host application usage/security policies.
Organizations should conduct vulnerability scanning to validate that operating systems and mail server
applications are up to date on security patches and software versions. Vulnerability scanning is a labor-
intensive activity that requires a high degree of human involvement to interpret the results. It may also be
disruptive to operations by taking up network bandwidth, slowing network response times and potentially
impacting the availability of the scanned server or its applications. However, vulnerability scanning is
extremely important for ensuring that vulnerabilities are mitigated as soon as possible, before they are
discovered and exploited by adversaries. Vulnerability scanning should be conducted on a weekly to
monthly basis. Many organizations also run a vulnerability scan whenever a new vulnerability database is
released for the organization’s scanner application. Vulnerability scanning results should be documented
and discovered deficiencies corrected.

Organizations should also consider running more than one vulnerability scanner. As previously
discussed, no scanner is able to detect all known vulnerabilities; however, using two scanners generally
increases the number of vulnerabilities detected. A common practice is to use one commercial and one
freeware scanner. Network- and host-based vulnerability scanners are available for free or for a fee.

9.4.2   Penetration Testing

“Penetration testing is security testing in which evaluators attempt to circumvent the security features of a
system based on their understanding of the system design and implementation” [NISS99]. The purpose
