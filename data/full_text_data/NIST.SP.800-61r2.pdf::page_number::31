communication and coordination mechanisms. An organization should have multiple (separate and
different) communication and coordination mechanisms in case of failure of one mechanism.

Incident Handler Communications and Facilities:

 Contact information for team members and others within and outside the organization (primary and
  backup contacts), such as law enforcement and other incident response teams; information may
  include phone numbers, email addresses, public encryption keys (in accordance with the encryption
  software described below), and instructions for verifying the contact’s identity
 On-call information for other teams within the organization, including escalation information
 Incident reporting mechanisms, such as phone numbers, email addresses, online forms, and secure
  instant messaging systems that users can use to report suspected incidents; at least one mechanism
  should permit people to report incidents anonymously
 Issue tracking system for tracking incident information, status, etc.
 Smartphones to be carried by team members for off-hour support and onsite communications
 Encryption software to be used for communications among team members, within the organization
  and with external parties; for Federal agencies, software must use a FIPS-validated encryption
  algorithm20
 War room for central communication and coordination; if a permanent war room is not necessary or
  practical, the team should create a procedure for procuring a temporary war room when needed
 Secure storage facility for securing evidence and other sensitive materials
Incident Analysis Hardware and Software:
 Digital forensic workstations21 and/or backup devices to create disk images, preserve log files, and
  save other relevant incident data
 Laptops for activities such as analyzing data, sniffing packets, and writing reports
 Spare workstations, servers, and networking equipment, or the virtualized equivalents, which
  may be used for many purposes, such as restoring backups and trying out malware
 Blank removable media
 Portable printer to print copies of log files and other evidence from non-networked systems
 Packet sniffers and protocol analyzers to capture and analyze network traffic
 Digital forensic software to analyze disk images
 Removable media with trusted versions of programs to be used to gather evidence from systems
 Evidence gathering accessories, including hard-bound notebooks, digital cameras, audio recorders,
  chain of custody forms, evidence storage bags and tags, and evidence tape, to preserve evidence for
  possible legal actions

     A digital forensic workstation is specially designed to assist incident handlers in acquiring and analyzing data. These
     workstations typically contain a set of removable hard drives that can be used for evidence storage.
