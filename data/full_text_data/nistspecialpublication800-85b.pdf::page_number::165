C.1      Glossary of Terms

  Term                        Meaning

                              Offline tests use previously captured images as inputs to core biometric implementations.
                              Such tests are repeatable and can readily be scaled to very large populations and large
  Offline Test                numbers of competing products. They institute a level-playing field and produce robust
                              estimates of the core biometric power of an algorithm. This style of testing is particularly
                              suited to interoperability testing of a fingerprint template (see [ISOSWAP]).

                              Scenario testing is intended to mimic an operational application and simultaneously
                              institute controls on the procedures. Scenario testing requires members of a human test
  Scenario Test               population to transact with biometric sensors. Scenario tests are appropriate for capturing
                              and assessing the effects of interactions human users have with biometric sensors and
                              interfaces.

                              Operational tests involve a deployed system and are usually conducted to measure in-the-
  Operational Test            field performance and user-system interaction effects. Such tests require the members of a
                              human test population to transact with biometric sensors. False acceptance rates may not
                              be measurable, depending on the controls instituted.

                              Interoperability tests measure the performance associated with the use of standardized
  Interoperability Test       biometric data records in a multiple vendor environment. It involves the production of the
                              templates by N enrollment products and authentication of these against images processed
                              by M others.

                              In the PIV context a matcher is a software library providing for the comparison of images
  Template Matcher            conformant to FINGSTD and templates conformant to MINUSTD. The output of the
                              matcher, a similarity score, will be the basis of accept or reject decision.

                              In the PIV context a template generator is a software library providing facilities for the
  Template Generator          conversion of images conformant to FINGSTD to templates conformant to MINUSTD for
                              storage on the PIV card.
