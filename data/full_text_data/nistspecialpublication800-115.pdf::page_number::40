outside the network. Penetration testing is an iterative process that leverages minimal access to gain
greater access.

Insider scenarios simulate the actions of a malicious insider. An internal penetration test is similar to an
external test, except that the testers are on the internal network (i.e., behind the firewall) and have been
granted some level of access to the network or specific network systems. Using this access, the
penetration testers try to gain a greater level of access to the network and its systems through privilege
escalation. Testers are provided with network information that someone with their level of access would
normally have—generally as a standard employee, although depending on the goals of the test it could
instead be information that a system or network administrator might possess.

Penetration testing is important for determining the vulnerability of an organization’s network and the
level of damage that can occur if the network is compromised. It is important to be aware that depending
on an organization’s policies, testers may be prohibited from using particular tools or techniques or may
be limited to using them only during certain times of the day or days of the week. Penetration testing also
poses a high risk to the organization’s networks and systems because it uses real exploits and attacks
against production systems and data. Because of its high cost and potential impact, penetration testing of
an organization’s network and systems on an annual basis may be sufficient. Also, penetration testing can
be designed to stop when the tester reaches a point when an additional action will cause damage. The
results of penetration testing should be taken seriously, and any vulnerabilities discovered should be
mitigated. Results, when available, should be presented to the organization’s managers. Organizations
should consider conducting less labor-intensive testing activities on a regular basis to ensure that they are
maintaining their required security posture. A well-designed program of regularly scheduled network and
vulnerability scanning, interspersed with periodic penetration testing, can help prevent many types of
attacks and reduce the potential impact of successful ones.

5.3   Social Engineering

Social engineering is an attempt to trick someone into revealing information (e.g., a password) that can be
used to attack systems or networks. It is used to test the human element and user awareness of security,
and can reveal weaknesses in user behavior—such as failing to follow standard procedures. Social
engineering can be performed through many means, including analog (e.g., conversations conducted in
person or over the telephone) and digital (e.g., e-mail, instant messaging). One form of digital social
engineering is known as phishing, where attackers attempt to steal information such as credit card
numbers, Social Security numbers, user IDs, and passwords. Phishing uses authentic-looking emails to
request information or direct users to a bogus Web site to collect information. Other examples of digital
social engineering include crafting fraudulent e-mails and sending attachments that could mimic worm
activity.

Social engineering may be used to target specific high-value individuals or groups in the organization,
such as executives, or may have a broad target set. Specific targets may be identified when the
organization knows of an existing threat or feels that the loss of information from a person or specific
group of persons could have a significant impact. For example, phishing attacks can be targeted based on
publicly available information about specific individuals (e.g., titles, areas of interest). Individual
targeting can lead to embarrassment for those individuals if testers successfully elicit information or gain
access. It is important that the results of social engineering testing are used to improve the security of the
organization and not to single out individuals. Testers should produce a detailed final report that
identifies both successful and unsuccessful tactics used. This level of detail will help organizations to
tailor their security awareness training programs.
