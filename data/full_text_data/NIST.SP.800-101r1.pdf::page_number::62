                                                                          Guidelines on Mobile Device Forensics

      and reported, and the amount of effort needed. The search engine plays a significant role in the
      discovery of information used for the creation of bookmarks and final reporting. For example,
      some tools used to search for textual evidence identify and categorize files based on file
      extension, where others use a file signature database. The latter feature is preferable since it
      eliminates the possibility of missing data because of an inconsistent file name extension (e.g.,
      eliminating a text file whose extension was changed to that of a graphics or image file).
      Similarly, the ability for the tool to find and gather images automatically into a common
      graphics library for examination is extremely useful.

      Searching data for information on incriminating or exculpatory evidence takes patience and
      can be time consuming. Some tools have a simple search engine that matches an input text
      string exactly, allowing only for elementary searches to be performed. Other tools incorporate
      more intelligent and feature rich search engines, allowing for generalized regular expression
      patterns (grep) type searches, including wildcard matches, filtering of files by extension,
      directory and batch scripts that search for specific types of content (e.g., e-mail addresses,
      URLs). The greater the toolâ€™s capabilities, the more the forensic examiner benefits from
      experience with and knowledge of the tool.


6.3   Call and Subscriber Records

      Records maintained by the service provider capture information needed to accurately bill a
      subscriber or, in the case of a prepaid service plan, debit the balance. The records collected are
      referred to as call detail records (CDRs), which are generated by the switch handling an
      originating call or SMS message from a mobile device. For some service providers, the records
      may also include fixed line, international gateway, and voice over IP transaction information.
      While the content and format of these records differ widely from one service provider to
      another, the fundamental data needed to identify the subscriber/device initiating the call, the
      initial cell servicing the call, the number dialed, and the duration of the call is captured.
      Detailed information such as the identifier of the cell (i.e., the BTS) and the sector involved are
      often included. Appendix C gives an example of the data elements of a CDR, specified in the
      GSM standards [ETS99]. As one can see, considerable discretion about what is implemented
      is left open to the service providers and network operators.

      The retention period for maintaining call detail and other types of records varies among service
      providers [GSM05]. However, the period is generally limited, requiring immediate action to
      avoid data loss. One should act quickly to have the cellular carrier preserve any data that can
      be used to identify communications that have occurred and are linked to the parties of interest,
      stressing non-disclosure of that action to the account subscriber [Ala03, Ala04]. The data
      available may include subscriber records, the content of email servers (i.e., undelivered email),
      email server logs, or other IP address authentication logs, the content of SMS and MMS
      message servers, and the content of voicemail servers. Note that certain types of undelivered
      content, such as voicemail, may be considered in transit from a legal standpoint in some
      jurisdictions, and obtaining or listening to them without the proper authority may be treated as
      an illegal interception of communications [Ala03]. While the USA PATRIOT Act eliminated
      this issue at the federal level, state statutes may be intentionally more restrictive or not yet be
      realigned completely with the federal statute.23
