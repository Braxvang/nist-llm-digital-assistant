     practice management, operational, and technical security controls; (ii) maintaining an
     awareness of the security state of information systems on an ongoing basis through
     enhanced monitoring processes; and (iii) providing essential information to senior
     leaders to facilitate credible decisions regarding the acceptance of risk to
     organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation
     arising from the operation and use of information systems.

25. [SP 800-38A]
    SP 800-38A: Recommendation for Block Cipher Modes of Operation - Methods and
    Techniques, December 2001, http://www.csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html.
    SP 800-38A defines five confidentiality modes of operation for use with an
    underlying symmetric key block cipher algorithm: Electronic Codebook (ECB),
    Cipher Block Chaining (CBC), Cipher Feedback (CFB), Output Feedback (OFB), and
    Counter (CTR). SP 800-38A is used with an approved block cipher algorithm.
    Compliance with this Recommendation is validated under the NIST Cryptographic
    Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP).

26. [SP 800-38B]
    SP 800-38B: Recommendation for Block Cipher Modes of Operation - the CMAC
    mode for Authentication, May 2005,
    http://www.csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html.
    SP 800-38B specifies a message authentication code (MAC) algorithm based on a
    symmetric key block cipher algorithm. This block cipher-based MAC algorithm,
    called CMAC, may be used to provide assurance of the authenticity and, hence, the
    integrity of binary data. Compliance with this Recommendation is validated under the
    NIST Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP).

27. [SP 800-38C]
    SP 800-38C Recommendation for Block Cipher Modes of Operation: the CCM Mode
    for Authentication and Confidentiality, May 2004,
    http://www.csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html.
    SP 800-38C defines a mode of operation, called CCM, for a symmetric key block
    cipher algorithm. CCM may be used to provide assurance of the confidentiality and
    the authenticity of computer data by combining the techniques of the Counter (CTR)
    mode and the Cipher Block Chaining-Message Authentication Code (CBC-MAC)
    algorithm 23. Compliance with this Recommendation is validated under the NIST
    Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP).

28. [SP 800-38D]
    SP 800-38D: Recommendation for Block Cipher Modes of Operation:
    Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) and GMAC, November 2007,
    http://www.csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html.

  CBC-MAC is not currently an approved mode of operation except as a component of
the CCM mode.
