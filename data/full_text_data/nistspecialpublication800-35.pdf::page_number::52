                     Figure 5-1. Information Technology Security Learning Continuum

The model illustrates a three-dimensional array that integrates the following:

 Three types of training—awareness, training, and education,
 Six functional security roles—manage, acquire, design and develop, implement and operate, review
  and evaluate and use
 Three levels of training—beginning, intermediate, and advanced.
The NIST SP 800-50, Building an Information Technology Security Awareness and Training Program,
provides detailed guidance on designing, developing, implementing, and maintaining an awareness and
training program within an organization's IT security program. This guide builds upon NIST SP 800-16
by describing four steps in designing and implementing an IT security training and awareness program.
