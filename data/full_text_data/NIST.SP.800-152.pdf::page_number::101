SP 800-152                                                  A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


8.4   Cryptographic Module Controls

A cryptographic module is a set of hardware, software and/or firmware that implements
cryptographic-based security functions (e.g., cryptographic algorithms and key-establishment
schemes). [FIPS 140] specifies requirements on cryptographic modules that are used by the
Federal government. This Profile requires the use of FIPS 140-validated cryptographic
modules (see Section 2.10).

Two primary security issues should be addressed regarding the security of the contents of
cryptographic modules: the integrity of the security functions and the protection of the
cryptographic keys and metadata. Since cryptographic keys are present in plaintext form for
some period of time within the module, physical security measures are necessary to protect
keys from unauthorized disclosure, modification, and substitution.

Each [FIPS 140] cryptographic module must be used in accordance with the cryptographic
module’s security policy. This detailed security policy specifies the rules for operating the
cryptographic module, including the security rules that were applicable to the module and
derived from [FIPS 140], and those imposed by the module developer.

FR:8.19 The CKMS design shall identify the cryptographic modules that it uses and their
respective security policies, including:
   a) The embodiment of each module (software, firmware, hardware, or hybrid),
   b) The mechanisms used to protect the integrity of each module,
   c) The physical and logical mechanisms used to protect each module’s cryptographic
      keys, and
   d) The third-party testing and validation that was performed on each module (including
      the security functions) and the protective measures employed by each module.

PR:8.24                    A Federal CKMS shall use cryptographic modules in
                           accordance with the security policy of that module.

8.5   Federal CKMS Security-Control Selection and Assessment Process

Federal CKMS security controls should be selected, implemented, and used in a manner that
protects the FCKMS modules and cryptographic keys and metadata in accordance with [FIPS
199], [FIPS 200], [SP 800-53], and [SP 800-53A].

The process specified in the following requirements is defined and explained in [FIPS 199],
[FIPS 200], [SP 800-53], and [SP800-53A]. The process will be used in Section 11 to
perform a security assessment.

The results of previous device and subsystem assessments complying with the procedures of
this section may be used with the approval of the System Authority without repeating the
assessments.
