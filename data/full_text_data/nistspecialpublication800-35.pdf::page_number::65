Appendix C—SERVICE AGREEMENT OUTLINE

A service agreement can take many different forms depending upon the type and scope of the service, the
service arrangement, and type of organization. The sample service agreement outline provided in this
appendix is intended solely as a guide; the specific format, clauses, and terms will be unique to each
organization. IT security managers should develop their service agreements only after negotiations with
the service provider and, most importantly, in consultation with their organization’s legal and contractual
experts.

1. Introduction–introduces the purpose, participants, and service.

    1.1. Purpose
    1.2. Participants
    1.3. General Service Description

2. Service Environment–describes the environment in which the organization will perform the service,
   from physical location, to hardware/software being used, to the policy and procedures the service
   provider will need to follow.

    2.1. Equipment
    2.2. Facilities
    2.3. Entities and Locations
    2.4. Policies, Procedures and Standards
    2.5. Agreements and Licenses

3. Roles and Responsibilities–describes the roles and responsibilities of all major participants. The
   service provider responsibilities need to articulate not just the service tasks, but also the
   documentation of their services, reporting their actions, and support functions (e.g., if the new service
   will likely initiate trouble calls, the service agreement should articulate who and how these calls will
   be handled).

    3.1. Service Provider Responsibilities
        3.1.1. Service Tasks
        3.1.2. Documentation
        3.1.3. Service Support
        3.1.4. Reporting Requirements

    3.2. Client Organization Responsibilities

4. Service Level–identifies the metric, the service level, and methodology for assessing the service level.
   For further guidance on developing metrics, NIST Special Publication 800-55, Security Metrics
   Guide for Information Technology Systems, provides guidance on developing and gathering metrics,
   as well as sample IT security metrics. Organizations may choose to articulate the service level in a
   range: from unacceptable to minimum to interim to target, or they may choose to set varying service
   levels for various user groups or schedule times. If so, each service level will need to be articulated.

    4.1. Objectives
    4.2. Metric(s)
    4.3. Service Level
    4.4. Service Level Assessment
