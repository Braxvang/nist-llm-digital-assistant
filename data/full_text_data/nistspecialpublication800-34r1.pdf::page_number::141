contingency plan procedures and technical recovery strategy. Exercises and tests should be conducted on
a scheduled basis to ensure that procedures continue to be effective. Full and incremental backups should
be routinely conducted, stored offsite, rotated, and periodically validated. The contingency plan should
be updated to reflect changes to procedures based on lessons learned from tests, exercises, and actual
disruptions. When the information system undergoes upgrades or other modifications, such as changes to
external interfaces, these modifications should be reflected in the contingency plan. Coordinating and
documenting changes in the plan should be performed in a timely manner to maintain an effective plan.

Contingency Planning controls to be addressed during this phase include:
    CP 2 Contingency Plan;
    CP 3: Contingency Training;
    CP 4: Contingency Plan Testing and Exercise;
    CP 9: Information System Backup; and
    CP 10: Information System Recovery and Reconstitution.

Disposal Phase. Contingency considerations should not be neglected because an information system is
retired and another system replaces it. Until the new system is operational and fully tested (including its
contingency capabilities), the original system’s ISCP should be maintained in a ready state for
implementation. As legacy systems are replaced, they may provide a valuable capability as a redundant
system if a loss or failure of the new information system should occur. In some cases, equipment parts
(e.g., hard drives, power supplies, memory chips, or network cards) from hardware that has been replaced
can be used as spare parts for new operational equipment. In addition, legacy information systems can be
used as test systems for new applications, allowing potentially disruptive system flaws to be identified
and corrected in a nonproduction environment.

Contingency Planning controls to be addressed during this phase include:
    CP 2 Contingency Plan;
    CP 9: Information System Backup; and
    CP 10: Information System Recovery and Reconstitution.
