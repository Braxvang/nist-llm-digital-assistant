Information security measurement results described in this guide will provide inputs into the
information security program activities described in a number of NIST publications, including:

      •   NIST SP 800-100, Information Security Handbook: A Guide for Managers; and

      •   NIST SP 800-65, Integrating IT Security into the Capital Planning and Investment
          Control Process.

These measures can also be used to assist with prioritization for the continuous monitoring of
security controls, as described in NIST SP 800-37, Guide for the Security Certification and
Accreditation of Federal Information Systems.

1.6       Document Organization

The remaining sections of this guide discuss the following:

      •   Section 2, Roles and Responsibilities, describes the roles and responsibilities of agency
          staff that have a direct interest in the success of the information security program, and in
          the establishment of an information security measurement program.

      •   Section 3, Information Security Measures Background, provides guidelines on the
          background and definition of information security measures, the benefits of
          implementation, various types of information security measures, and the factors that
          directly affect success of an information security measurement program.

      •   Section 4, Legislative and Strategic Drivers, links information security to strategic
          planning through relevant legislation and guidelines.

      •   Section 5, Measures Development Process, presents the approach and process used for
          development of information security measures.

      •   Section 6, Information Security Measurement Implementation, discusses those factors
          that can affect the implementation of an information security measurement program.

This guide contains four appendices. Appendix A, Candidate Measures, provides practical
examples of information security measures that can be used or modified to meet specific agency
requirements. Appendix B provides a list of acronyms used in this document. Appendix C lists
references. Appendix D lists specifications for minimum security requirements taken from
Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 200, Minimum Security Requirements for
Federal Information and Information Systems.
