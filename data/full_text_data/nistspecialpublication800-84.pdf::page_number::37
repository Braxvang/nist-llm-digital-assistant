                                   GUIDE TO TEST, TRAINING, AND EXERCISE PROGRAMS FOR IT PLANS AND CAPABILITIES



Comprehensive tests involve much larger portions of the organization, potentially all personnel, and
require more extensive coordination and planning.

6.2.2   Identify the Objectives

The design team should define the tests that will be conducted and specify the expected results or
outcomes. The test plan could consist of a series of smaller individual tests each designed to examine a
part of the component, system, or group of components and systems being tested. The objectives for each
test should be to measure, check, or verify whether the component, system, or group of components and
systems satisfies its intended purpose and functions adequately. Where possible, the expected results or
outcomes should be expressed in an objective and measurable manner, with subjective measurements
being minimized. The results should be quantifiable and repeatable to the extent reasonably possible.

Tests are often performed as part of standard operational activities, such as restoring a backup, moving a
server from one room to another, upgrading or patching operating systems or applications, or changing
hardware components (e.g., swapping hard drives, replacing a failed power supply). Combining tests
with operational activities is generally more efficient than performing them separately and is also less
likely to negatively impact operations.

Other examples of common tests are activating call tree cascades and determining if they can be executed
within prescribed time limits, and removing power from a system or system component.

6.2.3   Determine the Testing Tools

The design team should specify the assessment tools and procedures needed to accomplish the test. The
specific tools needed may vary greatly depending upon the scope of the test. Tools might range from
specialized software or hardware tools (e.g., network sniffers, vulnerability scanners) to measurement and
recording devices (e.g., stopwatches, cameras, video recorders) to checklists used to measure adherence to
defined processes and procedures. Tools might also include items needed by the test team for logistical
support (e.g., radios, cell phones, badges).

6.2.4   Identify the Participants

The participants in a test vary based on the scope of the test to be performed. Participation in testing
events can be thought of in two levels:

     The first level of participant consists of the individuals who are operating the components or
      systems being tested.
     The second level of participant consists of those individuals who are not directly involved in the
      test, but who might be impacted by the test or related activities. For example, if the test included
      an evacuation drill, the involved participants would be all personnel who were forced to evacuate,
      while affected individuals would include those individuals who might be trying to contact the
      evacuated people but could not reach them because they were not in their offices.
The design team should attempt to identify both levels of participants, although for larger tests the
affected individuals might have to be identified in groups instead of individually. Individuals in the first
level of participants should be notified well in advance of the test through an e-mail or memorandum.
Individuals and groups in the second level of participants should be notified before the test occurs;
examples of this include an announcement to the participants of possible disruptions to the systems being
tested and a message on a help desk phone number stating that disruptions may occur to the systems
being tested between certain hours.
