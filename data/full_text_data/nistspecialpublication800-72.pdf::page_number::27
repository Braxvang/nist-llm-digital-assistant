                                                                                  Guidelines on PDA Forensics


       documentation features.21 Although more widely used for examining PCs, EnCase also
       supports Palm OS devices. Currently, support for Pocket PC is not available, but the ability to
       import a data dump of Linux-based PDAs exists. EnCase allows for the creation of a complete
       physical bit-stream image of a Palm OS device. Throughout the process, the integrity of the
       bit-stream image is continually verified by CRC (Cyclical Redundancy Check) values, which
       are calculated concurrent to acquisition. The resulting bit-stream image, called an EnCase
       evidence file, is mounted as a read-only file or “virtual drive” from which EnCase proceeds to
       reconstruct the file structure using the logical data in the bit-stream image. This allows the
       examiner to search and examine the contents of the device using either a logical or physical
       perspective.

       EnCase allows for files, folders, or sections of a file to be highlighted and saved for later
       reference. These marks are called bookmarks. All bookmarks are saved in case files, with
       each case having its own bookmark file. Bookmarks can be viewed anytime and can be made
       from anywhere data or folders exist. Reporting features allows examiners to view information
       from a number of perspectives: all acquired files, single files, results of a string search, a
       report, or the entire case file created.

3.6   Duplicate Disk (dd)

       The duplicate disk (dd) utility is similar to pdd insofar as it allows examiners to create a bit-by-
       bit image of the device. As one of the original Unix utilities, dd has been around in one form
       or another for decades. Unlike the other tools described above, dd executes directly on the
       PDA. An image of the device can be obtained by connecting to the PDA, issuing the dd
       command, and dumping the contents elsewhere, for example, to auxiliary media such as a
       memory card or across a network session to a forensic workstation. Caution should be
       exercised, since dd may destroy parts of the filesystem (e.g., overwriting data) if used
       incorrectly. As with pdd, dd produces binary data output, some of which contains ASCII
       character information. Images created from dd may be imported for examination into a
       forensic tool, such as EnCase, if the filesystem is supported. A dd created image may also be
       mounted in loopback mode on a filesystem-compatible Linux machine for analysis. The
       standard version of dd does not provide hash values for the information acquired. However, a
       separate procedure can be used to obtain needed hash values. Modified versions of dd exist
       that incorporate hash value computation, but would require cross compilation and installation
       to use.

3.7   Miscellaneous Tools

       Other tools available from a hardware or software manufacturer to backup data or develop
       software for a device or device family may aid an investigation. For example, Microsoft has
       developed a tool called ActiveSync Remote Display (ASRDisp) that allows ActiveSync to
       connect to a Pocket PC device and display its full functionality in a virtual device window on
       the desktop, as if one were performing actions on the physical device itself. After data has
       been acquired from the target device, a full backup via ActiveSync could be done to restore the
