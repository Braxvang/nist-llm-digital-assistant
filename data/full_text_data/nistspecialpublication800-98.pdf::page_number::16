This document has been created for executives, planners, systems analysts, security and privacy
professionals, and engineers who are responsible for Federal government business processes or
information technology (IT) systems. Professionals with similar responsibilities outside the government
should also benefit from the information this document provides. The document addresses both the needs
of those considering an RFID implementation and those with an existing RFID system. The document is
also useful for researchers, students, market analysts and others who seek an overview of RFID
technology and related security issues.

1.3     Document Structure

The remainder of this document is organized into seven major sections:

 Section 2 provides an introduction to RFID technology and the major components of RFID systems.
 Section 3 provides an overview of types of RFID applications. It then explains how organizations can
  identify application requirements to help determine which RFID technology would be most effective
  for a particular application.
 Section 4 discusses some of the major business risks associated with implementing RFID technology.
 Section 5 explains the various RFID security controls, including their benefits and limitations.
 Section 6 provides a brief overview of privacy regulations and controls, particularly as they pertain to
  Federal agencies.
 Section 7 provides recommendations that organizations using RFID systems can follow throughout
  the system life cycle, from initiation through operations to disposition.
 Section 8 presents two hypothetical case studies that illustrate how the concepts and
  recommendations introduced earlier in the document could work in practice.
Readers that are already familiar with RFID and primarily are interested in the security aspects of the
technology may wish to skip Sections 2 and 3 of this document and start with Section 4.

The document also contains several appendices with supporting material:

 Appendix A contains more detailed information on common RFID standards and their security
  mechanisms.
 Appendix B contains a glossary.
 Appendix C contains an acronym list.
 Appendix D lists print resources and online tools and resources that may be useful references for
  gaining a better understanding of RFID technology and security.
 Appendix E contains information on permissible radio exposure limits.

      The distinction between RFID tags and contactless smart cards is becoming more difficult to define because the computing
      resources and security functionality of RFID tags is increasing over time. RFID tags and contactless smartcards often use
      the same air interface standards and techniques for wireless communication.
