SP 800-152                                                   A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


use Configuration 1. They could use Configuration 2 if only Option A was selected, but they
could never use Configuration 3 for sensitive U.S. Government data.

Ultimately, it is the responsibility of the organization that owns the data to assure that the
data is properly protected. That organization is often the FCKMS service-using organization.
An FCKMS service-using organization must use an FCKMS that supports a security policy
that is consistent with its higher-level policies (e.g., its Information Management Policy and
Information Security Policy) and other applicable U.S. Government requirements. A Federal
organization that is considering the procurement of a CKMS or the services of a CKMS
provider should review the security policy of each candidate CKMS and verify that the
CKMS has the necessary capabilities. An appropriate FCKMS Security Policy should then be
created. The FCKMS Security Policy should specify the rules that can assure the availability,
confidentiality, and integrity of the organizationâ€™s cryptographic keys and bound metadata
that will be used to protect the sensitive information to be protected by the FCKMS. An
FCKMS service-using organization should verify that its security policies are consistent with,
and can be supported by, an FCKMS service provider, both administratively and technically.

The FCKMS Security Policy should specify how to protect each type of key and its
associated metadata throughout their lifecycles, including when they are stored, transported,
or used.

An FCKMS service-using organization should assist in adopting, supporting, and enforcing
its own security policies and implementation rules by providing for tutorials to new managers
and users on how services should be managed and used. If a user can select and initiate
security services for an application or category of information, then the FCKMS service-
providing organization should assist in selecting appropriate security services by informing
the user of the rules and how the rules can and should be followed. The FCKMS should be
configured so as to minimize the likelihood that a user could select an inappropriate option.

FR:4.1 The CKMS design shall specify the CKMS Security Policy, including the
configurable options and sub-policies that it is designed to enforce.

FR:4.2 The CKMS design shall specify how the CKMS Security Policy is to be enforced by
the CKMS (e.g., the mechanisms used to provide the protection required by the policy).

FR:4.3 The CKMS design shall specify how any automated portions of the CKMS Security
Policy are expressed in an unambiguous tabular form or a formal language (e.g., XML or
ASN.1), such that an automated security system (e.g., table driven or syntax-directed
software mechanisms) in the CKMS can enforce them.

                PL-1       A Federal CKMS shall have an FCKMS Security Policy that

                           is consistent with the higher-level security policies of its
                           service-using organization(s).
                           A Federal CKMS shall support its FCKMS Security Policy.
