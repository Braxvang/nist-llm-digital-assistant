MP-3      MEDIA LABELING

          Control: The organization: (i) affixes external labels to removable information system media and
          information system output indicating the distribution limitations, handling caveats and applicable
          security markings (if any) of the information; and (ii) exempts [Assignment: organization-defined
          list of media types or hardware components] from labeling so long as they remain within
          [Assignment: organization-defined protected environment].
          Supplemental Guidance: An organizational assessment of risk guides the selection of media
          requiring labeling. Organizations document in policy and procedures, the media requiring labeling
          and the specific measures taken to afford such protection. The rigor with which this control is
          applied is commensurate with the FIPS 199 security categorization of the information contained
          on the media. For example, labeling is not required for media containing information determined
          by the organization to be in the public domain or to be publicly releasable.
          Control Enhancements: None.
