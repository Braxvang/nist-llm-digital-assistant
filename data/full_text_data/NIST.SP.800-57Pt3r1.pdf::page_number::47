6.2 Security and Compliance Issues
     1. Kerberos version 5 was initially specified in [RFC 1510]. More recently, the
        security was updated in version 5 ([RFC 4120] and [RFC 6649]); however, many
        existing implementations still correspond to the initial RFC.
     2. Many current Kerberos implementations based on [RFC 1510] rely on DES for
        symmetric encryption functions. DES is no longer approved for use in protecting
        Federal Government information and has been deprecated as well in Kerberos
        [RFC 6649].
     3. If a keyless checksum computation is used for the data integrity of Kerberos
        messages, the integrity of the message may be inadequate.
     4. Some Kerberos implementations rely solely on the entropy (i.e., randomness)
        provided by the user password to generate the symmetric client key (the client key
        is a hash of the user’s password). Passwords, in general, do not provide enough
        randomness for generating a key. In such cases, a dictionary attack28 is feasible. If
        passwords are used to generate cryptographic keys, they should be selected to
        maximize the difficulty of a password guessing attack, thus increasing the
        difficulty of an off-line dictionary attack [SP 800-118].29
     5. Compromising the client, KDC, or TS could compromise the symmetric keys that
        they contain and thereby compromise parts of the system. In particular, the KDC
        stores keying information for all the KDC users, the TGS, and any TS that
        communicates directly with the KDC TGS. These symmetric keys require
        protection that is commensurate with the protection required for the data that they
        protect (e.g., tickets, other keys, authentication information, and shared data).
     6. The TGS has read-only access to the KDC database. If the TGS and database do
        not reside on the same machine, a secure channel is required for the TGS to obtain
        the required TS keys.
     7. A failure of the AS or the TGS would prevent all AS users from obtaining new
        tickets and corresponding new services.
     8. Clocks must be synchronized in order to accurately assess the validity of clock
        authentication information and tickets. If the TS’s clock is running behind the
        clock of the KDC (or AS), then previous authentication information and tickets
        could be played back to the TS after they have expired.
     9.    If a Kerberos implementation has a TLS capability, then it should be used when
          the DH key agreement or RSA key transport method discussed above is not used.

  A dictionary attack is a technique for guessing a password by selecting candidate passwords from a list
of words commonly found in a dictionary, or derived from words commonly found in a dictionary. Each
selected candidate is tested as though it were the actual password until the result of the test indicates that
the correct password has been selected.

  Draft SP 800-118, Guide to Enterprise Password Management, is currently under development [SP 800-
118].
