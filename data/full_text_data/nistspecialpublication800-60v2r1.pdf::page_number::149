socio-economic and political development missions. However, the premature disclosure of this
information may adversely affect agency credibility or give unfair competitive advantages to
some candidates for mission support activities. These secondary effects may have a negative
effect on the intended beneficiaries and can result, in extreme cases, in threats to human life,
major assets, or the ability of the agency to perform future missions. Some information that has
supported an international development and humanitarian aid process can even undo the results
of previously completed foreign socio-economic and political development processes. Where
there is a possibility of catastrophic consequences such as threats to human life and major
property assets, a high confidentiality impact level must be assigned.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for international development and humanitarian aid information is moderate.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of international development and
humanitarian aid information depend on whether the information is time-critical. Unauthorized
modification or destruction of information affecting external communications (e.g., web pages,
electronic mail) may adversely affect operations and/or public confidence in the agency, but the
damage to the mission would usually be limited.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: The consequences of unauthorized
modification or destruction of information can be very serious or catastrophic if the modification
is to time-critical operational information. In such cases, the impact level assigned would be
moderate or high.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
most international development and humanitarian aid information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to international development and
humanitarian aid information.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Generally, international development
and humanitarian aid missions are tolerant of delays. Where this is not the case, the
availability impact associated with international development and humanitarian aid
information may be moderate or high.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
international development and humanitarian aid information is low.
