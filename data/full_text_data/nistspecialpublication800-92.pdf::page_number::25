                                                                  GUIDE TO COMPUTER SECURITY LOG MANAGEMENT



       Provide adequate support for all staff with log management responsibilities. While defining
        the log management scheme, organizations should ensure that they provide the necessary training
        to relevant staff regarding their log management responsibilities as well as skill instruction for the
        needed resources to support log management. Support also includes providing log management
        tools and tool documentation, providing technical guidance on log management activities, and
        disseminating information to log management staff.
2.5     Summary

Many logs within an organization contain records related to computer security events occurring within
systems and networks. For example, most organizations use several types of security software, such as
antivirus software, firewalls, and intrusion prevention systems, to detect malicious activity and protect
systems and data from damage. Security software is usually the primary source of computer security
logs. OSs for servers, workstations, and networking equipment usually log a variety of information
related to security, such as system events and audit records. Another common type of log generator is
applications, which may send information to OS logs or application-specific logs.

The number, volume, and variety of computer security logs has increased greatly, which has created the
need for computer security log managementâ€”the process for generating, transmitting, storing, analyzing,
and disposing of computer security log data. Log management helps to ensure that computer security
records are stored in sufficient detail for an appropriate period of time. Routine log analysis is beneficial
for identifying security incidents, policy violations, fraudulent activity, and operational problems. Logs
are also useful for establishing baselines, performing auditing and forensic analysis, supporting internal
investigations, and identifying operational trends and long-term problems. Organizations may also store
and analyze certain logs for compliance with FISMA, HIPAA, GLBA, SOX, and other key regulations,
guidelines, and standards.

The fundamental problem with log management is balancing a limited amount of log management
resources with a continuous supply of log data. Log generation and storage is complicated mainly by a
high number of log sources, inconsistent log formats among sources, and a large volume of log data on a
daily basis. Log management also involves protecting logs from breaches of their confidentiality and
integrity, as well as supporting their availability. Another problem with log management is having
network and system administrators perform regular, efficient, and effective analysis of log data. Key
practices recommended to meet the main challenges in log management are as follows:

       Prioritize log management appropriately throughout the organization
       Establish policies and procedures for log management
       Create and maintain a secure log management infrastructure
       Provide proper training for all staff with log management responsibilities.
