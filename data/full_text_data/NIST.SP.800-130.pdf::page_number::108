   random numbers when required by applications using cryptography. The methods
   provided are based on hash functions, block cipher algorithms or number theoretic
   problems. Compliance with this Recommendation is validated under the NIST
   Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP).

    SP 800-102: Recommendation for Digital Signature Timeliness, September 2009,
    http://www.csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html.
    SP 800-102 describes techniques for providing evidence of the time that a message
    was signed with a digital signature.

    SP 800-108: Recommendation for Key Derivation Using Pseudorandom Functions.
    October 2009, http://www.csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html.
    SP 800-108 specifies several families of key derivation functions that use
    pseudorandom functions. These key derivation functions can be used to derive
    additional keys from a key that has been established through an automated key
    establishment scheme (e.g. as defined in [SP 800-56A] and [SP 800-56B]]), or from a
    pre-shared key (e.g., a manually distributed key).

    SP 800-115: Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment,
    September 2008, http://www.csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html.
    SP 800-115 is a guide to the basic technical aspects of conducting information
    security assessments. The document presents technical testing and examination
    methods and techniques that an organization might use as part of an assessment, and
    offers insights to assessors on their execution and the potential impact they may have
    on systems and networks. For an assessment to be successful and have a positive
    impact on the security posture of a system (and ultimately upon the entire
    organization), elements beyond the execution of testing and examination must
    support the technical process. Suggestions for these activities—including a robust
    planning process, root cause analysis, and tailored reporting—are also presented in
    this guide.

    Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.2, September 2011,
    http://www.csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html.
    SP 800-126-r2 defines the technical composition of SCAP Version 1.2 in terms of its
    component specifications, their interrelationships and interoperation, and the
    requirements for SCAP content. The technical specification for SCAP in this
    publication describes the requirements and conventions that are to be employed to
