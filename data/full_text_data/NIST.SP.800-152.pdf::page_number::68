SP 800-152                                                                 A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


                                 A Federal CKMS operating at the Low impact-level should
PA:6.15
                                 output keys and/or sensitive metadata from cryptographic
                                 modules by means of a trusted channel.

6.4.21 Validate Public-Key Domain Parameters
This function performs certain validity checks on the public domain parameters of some
public-key algorithms (e.g., Diffie-Hellman key establishment and ECDSA).

FR:6.63 The CKMS design shall specify how, where, and the circumstances under which,
public-key domain parameters are validated.

                                 For applicable public-key algorithms, a Federal CKMS shall
PR:6.56
                                 validate a public keyâ€™s domain parameters as specified in [SP
                                 800-56A] or [SP 800-89] before using them.

6.4.22 Validate a Public Key
This function performs certain validity checks on a public key to provide some assurance that
it is arithmetically correct.

FR:6.64 The CKMS design shall specify how, where, and the circumstances under which,
public keys are validated.

                                 A Federal CKMS shall validate public keys as specified in
PR:6.57
                                 [SP 800-56A], [SP 800-56B] or [SP 800-89] before using
                                 them.

6.4.23 Validate a Public Key Certification Path
This function validates the certification path (also known as a certificate chain) from the
relying entity's trust anchor5 to a public key in which the relying entity needs to establish
trust (i.e., the public key of the other entity in a transaction). Validation of the certification
path provides assurance that the identity of the originating entity, as specified in the
certificate, is the owner of the public key in the certificate and is the holder of the
corresponding private key. The latter assumes that a trusted certificate authority obtained
proof of private-key possession.

FR:6.65 The CKMS design shall specify how, where, and the circumstances under which, a
key certification path is validated.

                  IA-5 (2)       A Federal CKMS shall validate the certification path of a
PR:6.58
                                 public key certificate prior to using the public key in the
                                 certificate.

  Technically, a trust anchor is a CA with a trusted certificate containing the CA's public key. However, the term
is also commonly used to refer to that certificate, which is usually cached locally in a trust-anchor store. In this
document, the term refers to a certificate.
