                                               TECHNICAL GUIDE TO INFORMATION SECURITY TESTING AND ASSESSMENT



An older Linux live OS distribution and open source security toolset is Knoppix STD, which is based on
Knoppix Linux. It was created by a security professional to assist with teaching security techniques to
others. Knoppix STD was first released in May 2004 as Knoppix-STD 0.1 and has not been updated
since. The lack of a newer version is due to its creator leaving the project. Version 0.1 is the version
referred to for this publication. Before BackTrack, Knoppix STD was the benchmark security toolset and
it remains widely used.

Similar to BackTrack, Knoppix STD enables network discovery, port and service identification, network
sniffing, password cracking, forensics, and remote access testing. While there is some overlap between
the distributions, there are some differences as well. Knoppix contains some tools that BackTrack does
not, such as Netcat and Nessus; addresses technology areas such as cryptography; and offers more tools
for computer forensics and sniffing. It does not provide Metasploit, and compared to BackTrack is weak
on wireless security tools. Table A-2 provides a sample of the tools available on the Knoppix STD
distribution.
