          required for critical organizational operations. For example, if disruptive processing
          operations (e.g., load rebalancing due to site failure or emergency maintenance) are
          performed by the cloud provider at the same time as peak organizational processing
          occurs, a denial of service condition could arise [All88]. A denial of service attack
          targeted at the cloud provider could also affect the organization’s applications and
          systems operating in the cloud or at the organization’s data center.

Assurances furnished to the organization by the cloud provider to support security claims, or by a
certification and compliance review entity paid by the cloud provider, should be verified
whenever possible through independent assessment by the organization. Moreover, a third-party
certification or other assurances from the cloud provider do not necessarily grant a tenant
application or system that same level of certification or compliance; those elements would likely
require a separate certification assessment for that specific cloud environment.19

Other noteworthy concerns, which are indirectly related to security and privacy, also exist with
outsourcing to public clouds. One of the most prevalent and challenging concerns is called the
principal-agent problem. Another is the attenuation of an organization’s technical expertise.

         Principal-Agent Problem. The principal-agent problem occurs when the incentives of
          the agent (i.e., the cloud provider) are not aligned with the interests of the principal (i.e.,
          the organization) [Row07]. Because it can be difficult to determine the level of effort a
          cloud provider is exerting towards security and privacy administration and remediation,
          the concern is that the organization might not recognize if the service level is dropping or
          has dropped below the extent required. One confounding issue is that increased security
          efforts are not guaranteed to result in noticeable improvements (e.g., fewer incidents), in
          part because of the growing amounts of malware and new types of attacks [Row07].

         Attenuation of Expertise. Outsourced computing services can, over time, diminish the
          level of technical knowledge and expertise of the organization, since management and
          staff no longer need to deal regularly with technical issues at a detailed level [Gon09].
          As new advancements and improvements are made to the cloud computing environment,
          the knowledge and expertise gained directly benefit the cloud provider, not the
          organization. Unless precautions are taken, an organization can lose its ability to keep up
          to date with technology advances and related security and privacy considerations, which
          in turn can affect its ability to plan and oversee new information technology projects
          effectively and to maintain accountability over existing cloud-based systems.

An organization may be able to employ compensating security and privacy controls to work
around identified shortcomings in a public cloud service. Non-negotiable service agreements
generally limit the range of risk-mitigation activities available to an organization, while

  The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program has been established to provide a standard approach to assessing
and authorizing cloud computing services and products that results in a joint authorization of cloud providers with respect to a
common security risk model. The joint authorization issued can be reused and leveraged and across the Federal Government in
cloud computing deployments for which the security risk model applies - http://www.cio.gov/modules/fedramp/demo.cfm.
