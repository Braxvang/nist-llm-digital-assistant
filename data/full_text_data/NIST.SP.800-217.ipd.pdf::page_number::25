      NIST SP 800-217 ipd                          Guidelines for PIV Federation (Initial Public Draft)
      January 2023


646   3.5. Home IdPs
647   Only the agency responsible for issuing PIV identity accounts SHALL declare the home
648   IdP for those accounts. Operation of the home IdP MAY be outsourced to a third party.
649   A home IdP SHALL have access to relevant information for the PIV identity accounts
650   that it asserts, including the following:
651       • All attributes available for federation,
652       • All PIV credentials bound to the account, and
653       • The current status of the PIV identity account (active/terminated).
654   The effect of these requirements is that the home IdP needs to be coupled to the
655   management of the PIV identity accounts that it represents. This can be accomplished
656   with a variety of technological means, such as attachment to the issuing agency’s
657   enterprise identity and access management system or the use of a provisioning protocol to
658   synchronize account state with the IdP system.
659   The issuing agency responsible for declaring its home IdP SHALL publish its home IdP
660   information in a publicly available location to allow for discovery and configuration by
661   RPs. The home IdP publication record SHALL include all of the following:
662       • A canonical issuer identifier for the IdP (this is generally a URI in federation
663         protocols),
664       • A list of agency identifiers covered by the IdP,
665       • A list of federation protocols supported by the IdP along with any profiles of those
666         protocols,
667       • The location of a machine-readable discovery document for each federation
668         protocol supported by the IdP, and
669       • Technical contact information for the IdP.
670   The format for this record and the means by which it is published are out of scope for this
671   specification and subject to technical profiles and federation trust agreements.
