willingness to accept risk.58 For example, assume two organizations are working together to
create a common security service intended to address the advanced persistent threat. The culture
of one of the organizations may result in a focus on preventing unauthorized disclosure of
information, while the nature of the other organization may result in an emphasis on mission
continuity. The differences in focus and emphasis resulting from organizational culture can
generate different priorities and expectations regarding what security services to procure, because
the organizations perceive the nature of the threat differently. Such culture-related disconnects do
not occur solely between organizations but can also occur within organizations, where different
organizational components (e.g., information technology components, operational components)
have different values and perhaps risk tolerances. An example of an internal disconnect can be
observed in a hospital that emphasizes different cultures between protecting the personal privacy
of patients and the availability of medical information to medical professionals for treatment
purposes.

Culture both shapes and is shaped by the people within organizations. Cultural influences and
impacts can be felt across all three tiers in the multitiered risk management approach. Senior
leaders/executives both directly and indirectly in Tier 1 governance structures set the stage for
how organizations respond to various approaches to managing risk. Senior leaders/executives
establish the risk tolerance for organizations both formally (e.g., through publication of strategy
and guidance documents) and informally (e.g., through actions that get rewarded and penalized,
the degree of consistency in actions, and the degree of accountability enforced). The direction set
by senior leaders/executives and the understanding of existing organizational values and priorities
are major factors determining how risk is managed within organizations.

2.8 RELATIONSHIP AMONG KEY RISK CONCEPTS
As indicated by the discussions above, there are a variety of risk-related concepts (e.g., risk
tolerance, trust, and culture), all of which have an impact on risk management. The concepts do
not operate in a vacuum; rather, there is often a strong interplay among the concepts (e.g., an
organization’s culture along with its governance structures and processes, often influences the
pace of change and the implementation of its risk management strategy). For this reason, the risk
executive (function) and other parties involved in organizational risk-based decisions, need to
have an awareness and appreciation for all of the concepts. Several examples of the relationships
among the risk-related concepts are provided below. The list of relationships is not exhaustive
and serves only to illustrate how combining risk-related concepts can produce unintended
consequences, both positive and negative in scope.

2.8.1 Governance, Risk Tolerance, and Trust
As part of implementing the organization’s risk management strategy at Tier 1, the risk executive
(function) establishes practices for sharing risk-related information with external entities. With
regard to the demonstration of due diligence for managing risk, organizations that are less risk
tolerant are likely to require more supporting evidence than organizations that are more risk
tolerant. Such organizations may only trust (and hence partner with) organizations with which
they have had a long and successful relationship (see direct historical trust model in Appendix G).
The amount of centralization59 within an organization may be reflective of the organizational risk
tolerance and/or its willingness to trust partnering organizations. Some organizations select a

  A similar situation can exist between subordinate elements of an organization when these elements are afforded a fair
amount of autonomy and operational authority.
