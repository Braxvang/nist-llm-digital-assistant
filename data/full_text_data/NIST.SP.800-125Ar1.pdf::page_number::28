                                                                       SERVER-BASED HYPERVISOR PLATFORMS

7. SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HY-BF5

Secure operation of administrative functions is critical for any server class software, and hypervisor is no
exception to this. The outcome is a secure configuration that can provide the necessary protections against
security violations. In the case of hypervisor, impact of insecure configuration can be more severe than in
many server software instances since the compromise of a hypervisor can result in the compromise of many
VMs operating on top of it. While the composition of the configuration parameters depends upon the design
features of a hypervisor offering, the latitude in choosing the values for each individual parameter results in
different configuration options. Many configuration options relate functional features and performance.
However, there are some options that have a direct impact on the secure execution of the hypervisor, and it is
those configuration options that are discussed in this document.

The following are some security practices that are generic for any server class software. Although applicable
to the hypervisor, these are not addressed in this document:

 (a) Control of administrative accounts on the hypervisor host itself and least privilege assignment for
     different administrators
 (b) Patch management for hypervisor software and host OS
 (c) Communicating with the hypervisor through a secure protocol such as TLS or Secure Shell (SSH)


7.1 Centralized Administration

The administration of a hypervisor and hypervisor host can be performed in two ways:

 •   Having administrative accounts set up in each hypervisor host
 •   Centralized administration of all hypervisors and hypervisor hosts through enterprise virtualization
     management software.

Central management of all hypervisor platforms in the enterprise through enterprise virtualization
management software (EVMS) is preferable since a gold-standard configuration for all hypervisors in the
enterprise can be defined and easily enforced through EVMS. For any IT data center to operate efficiently,
it is necessary to implement load balancing and fault tolerance measures, which can be realized by defining
hypervisor clusters. Creation, assignment of application workloads, and management of clusters can be
performed only with a centralized management software, making the deployment and usage of an enterprise
virtualization management software mandatory.

Hence the recommendation for the architecture for hypervisor administration is as follows:

Security Recommendation HY-SR-19: The administration of all hypervisor installations in the
enterprise should be performed centrally using an enterprise virtualization management system
(EVMS). Enterprise gold-standard hypervisor configurations for different types of workloads and
clusters must be managed and enforced through EVMS. The gold-standard configurations should, at
minimum, cover CPU, Memory, Storage, Network bandwidth, and Host OS hardening, if required.


7.2 Securing the Management Network

To connect multiple VMs to each other and to the enterprise network in which the virtualized host is a node,
the hypervisor allows for a software-defined communication fabric, or a virtual network, through its
management console or command line interface (CLI). This capability can be provided by a dedicated
                                                      21
