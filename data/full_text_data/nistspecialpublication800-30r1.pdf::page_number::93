Special Publication 800-30                                            Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments
________________________________________________________________________________________________


         -    How the use of a specific information technology would potentially change the risk
              to organizational missions/business functions if employed in information systems
              supporting those missions/business functions; or
         -    How the risk assessment results are to be used in the context of the RMF (e.g., an
              initial risk assessment to be used in tailoring security control baselines and/or to
              guide and inform other decisions and serve as a starting point for subsequent risk
              assessments; subsequent risk assessment to incorporate results of security control
              assessments and inform authorization decisions; subsequent risk assessment to
              support the analysis of alternative courses of action for risk responses; subsequent
              risk assessment based on risk monitoring to identify new threats or vulnerabilities;
              subsequent risk assessments to incorporate knowledge gained from incidents or
              attacks).
    •    Identify assumptions and constraints.
    •    Describe risk tolerance inputs to the risk assessment (including the range of consequences
         to be considered).
    •    Identify and describe the risk model and analytic approach; provide a reference or include
         as an appendix, identifying risk factors, value scales, and algorithms for combining
         values.
    •    Provide a rationale for any risk-related decisions during the risk assessment process.
    •    Describe the uncertainties within the risk assessment process and how those uncertainties
         influence decisions.
    •    If the risk assessment includes organizational missions/business functions, describe the
         missions/functions (e.g., mission/business processes supporting the missions/functions,
         interconnections and dependencies among related missions/business functions, and
         information technology that supports the missions/business functions).
    •    If the risk assessment includes organizational information systems, describe the systems
         (e.g., missions/business functions the system is supporting, information flows to/from the
         systems, and dependencies on other systems, shared services, or common infrastructures).
    •    Summarize risk assessment results (e.g., using tables or graphs), in a form that enables
         decision makers to quickly understand the risk (e.g., number of threat events for different
         combinations of likelihood and impact, the relative proportion of threat events at different
         risk levels).
    •    Identify the time frame for which the risk assessment is valid (i.e., time frame for which
         the assessment is intended to support decisions).
    •    List the risks due to adversarial threats (see Table F-1).
    •    List the risks due to non-adversarial threats (see Table F-2).
Appendices
    •    List references and sources of information.
    •    List the team or individuals conducting the risk assessment including contact information.
    •    List risk assessment details and any supporting evidence (e.g., Tables D-7, D-8, E-5, F-3,
         F-6, H-4), as needed to understand and enable reuse of results (e.g., for reciprocity, for
         subsequent risk assessments, to serve as input to Tier 1 and Tier 2 risk assessments).
