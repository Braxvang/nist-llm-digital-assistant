GUIDE TO INTRUSION DETECTION AND PREVENTION SYSTEMS (IDPS)



 For products that track state (e.g., stateful protocol analysis of network connections), how many
  activities (e.g., connections) can they track state for simultaneously? How long is state information
  maintained normally and under maximum load?
 For products that process the actual events, not copies of the events (e.g., inline network-based IDPS
  sensors), how much latency does the processing cause? For example, there might be a delay of 50
  microseconds between when a network-based IDPS sensor receives a packet and when the IDPS
  retransmits that packet to continue to its destination. A host-based IDPS might delay the execution of
  system calls for a similarly short time. Under high loads, IDPS products might experience
  significantly higher latency, so it is important to consider latency under both typical and extreme
  loads.
 For products that process copies of events, not the actual events (e.g., passive network-based IDPS
  sensors, NBA software analyzing network flow logs sent by routers), how long does it take from the
  occurrence of an event to the eventâ€™s detection and reporting by the IDPS?
9.4     Management Requirements

Evaluating the management capabilities of each IDPS product is very important because if a product is
hard to manage or does not offer the necessary management functionality, then it is likely that the product
will not be used as effectively as originally intended. This section presents IDPS management capability
considerations in three categories:

 Design and implementation
 Operation and maintenance
 Training, documentation, and technical support.
Section 9.6 provides guidance on collecting data on IDPS management capabilities as part of an
evaluation.

9.4.1    Design and Implementation

Most aspects of IDPS design and implementation are specific to each IDPS technology type; Sections 4
through 7 contain detailed information on design and implementation considerations. In addition to
those, organizations should also consider general criteria related to reliability, interoperability, scalability,
and security.

9.4.1.1 Reliability

Organizations should ensure that the IDPS products they select will be sufficiently reliable to meet their
requirements. Possible considerations for reliability include the following:

 What types of redundant hardware are included or available separately for appliances, such as
  duplicate power supplies, network interface cards, storage devices (e.g., hard drives, flash ROMs),
  and CPUs?
 What software redundancy features are incorporated into the products, especially for agents and
  sensors, such as the product automatically restarting itself and/or supporting services when they fail?
 Can the product use multiple management servers so that if one fails, sensors or agents automatically
  fail over to another one? How disruptive is the failover process?
