                The Technical Specification for the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.2



expand in support of the growing needs to define and measure effective security controls, assess and
monitor ongoing aspects of that information security, and successfully manage systems in accordance
with risk management frameworks such as NIST Special Publication 800-534, Department of Defense
(DoD) Instruction 8500.2, and the Payment Card Industry (PCI) framework.
By detailing the specific and appropriate usage of the SCAP 1.2 components and their interoperability,
NIST encourages the creation of reliable and pervasive SCAP content and the development of a wide
array of products that leverage SCAP.
Organizations that develop SCAP 1.2-based content or products should comply with the following
recommendations:
Follow the requirements listed in this document and in the associated component specifications.
Organizations should ensure that their implementation and use of SCAP 1.2 is compliant with the
requirements detailed in each component specification and this document.
If requirements are in conflict between component specifications, this document will provide clarification.
If a component specification is in conflict with this document, the requirements in this document take
precedence.
When creating SCAP content, adhere to the conventions specified in this document.
Security products and checklist authors assemble content from SCAP data repositories to create SCAP-
conformant security guidance. For example, a security configuration checklist can document desired
security configuration settings, installed patches, and other system security elements using a standardized
SCAP format. Such a checklist would use XCCDF to describe the checklist, CCE to identify security
configuration settings to be addressed or assessed, and CPE to identify platforms for which the checklist
is valid. The use of CCE and CPE entries within XCCDF checklists is an example of an SCAP
conventionâ€”a requirement for valid SCAP usage. These conventions are considered part of the definition
of SCAP 1.2. Organizations producing SCAP content should adhere to these conventions to ensure the
highest degree of interoperability. NIST provides an SCAP Content Validation Tool that organizations
can use to help validate the correctness of their SCAP content. The tool checks that SCAP source and
result content is well-formed, all cross references are valid, and required values are appropriately set.5
