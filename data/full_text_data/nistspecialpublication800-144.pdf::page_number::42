    performance slowdowns [Lea09]. A number of examples illustrate this point. In
    February 2008, a popular storage cloud service suffered a three-hour outage that affected
    its consumers, including Twitter and other startup companies [Dig08, Kri08, Mil08]. In
    June 2009, a lightning storm caused a partial outage of an IaaS cloud that affected some
    users for four hours, and in April 2011, a network upgrade attempt caused a serous
    outage lasting more than twenty-four hours [Met11, Mil09, Pep11a]. Similarly, in
    February 2008, a database cluster failure at a SaaS cloud caused an outage for several
    hours, and in January 2009, another brief outage occurred due to a network device failure
    [Fer09, Goo09a, Mod08]. In March 2009, a PaaS cloud experienced severe degradation
    for about twenty-two hours due to networking issues related to an upgrade [Cla09,
    Mic09].

    At a level of 99.95% availability, 4.38 hours of downtime are to be expected in a year.
    Periods of scheduled maintenance are usually excluded as a source of downtime in SLAs
    and may be scheduled with short notice from the cloud provider. The level of availability
    of a cloud service and its capabilities for data backup and disaster recovery need to be
    addressed in the organization’s contingency and continuity planning to ensure the
    recovery and restoration of disrupted cloud services and operations, using alternate
    services, equipment, and locations, if required. Cloud storage services may represent a
    single point of failure for the applications hosted there. In such situations, the services of
    a second cloud provider could be used to back up data processed by the primary provider
    to ensure that during a prolonged disruption or serious disaster at the primary’s facilities,
    the data remains available for immediate resumption of critical operations.

   Prolonged and Permanent Outages. The possibility exists for a cloud provider to
    experience serious problems, like bankruptcy or facility loss, which affect service for
    extended periods or cause a complete shutdown. For example, in April 2009, the Federal
    Bureau of Investigation raided computing centers in Texas and seized hundreds of
    servers, when investigating fraud allegations against a handful of companies that operated
    out of the centers [Zet09a]. The seizure disrupted service to hundreds of other businesses
    unrelated to the investigation, but who had the misfortune of having their computer
    operations collocated at the targeted centers [Zet09a]. A similar raid with much the same
    result occurred more recently [Sch11]. Other examples of outages are the major data loss
    experienced in 2009 by a bookmark repository service, and the abrupt failure of an on-
    line storage-as-a-service provider, who closed without warning to its users in 2008
    [Cal09, Gun08]. Changing business conditions may also cause a cloud provider to
    disband its services, as occurred recently with an online cloud storage service [Sto10].

    If an organization relies on a cloud service for data storage and processing, it must be
    prepared to carry on mission critical operations without the use of the service for periods
    when the cloud experiences a serious outage. The organization’s contingency plan
    should address prolonged and permanent system disruptions and support continuity of
    operations that effect the restoration of essential functions elsewhere. Having policy,
    plans, and standard operating procedures in place avoids creating an undue reliance on
    employing cloud services without sufficient recourse.
