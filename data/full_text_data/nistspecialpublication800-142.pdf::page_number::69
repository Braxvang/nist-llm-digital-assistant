Number of Tests Required

The challenge in computing covering arrays is to find the smallest possible array that
covers all configurations of t variables. If every new test generated covered all previously
uncovered combinations, then the number of tests needed would be
       vt ⎛⎜⎜ n ⎞⎟⎟ = vt
          ⎝t ⎠
           ⎛n⎞
           ⎜⎜ ⎟⎟
            ⎝t ⎠

         Since this is not generally possible, the covering array will be significantly larger
than vt, but still a reasonable number for testing. It can be shown that the number of tests in
a t-way covering array will be proportional to

        vt log n                                                             (2)

for n variables with v values each.

       It’s worth considering the components of this expression to gain a better
understanding of what will be required to do combinatorial testing. First, note that the
number of tests grows exponentially with the interaction strength t. The number of tests
required for t+1-way testing will be in the neighborhood of v times the number required for
t-way testing. The table below shows how vt, grows for values of v and t. Although the
number of tests required for high-strength combinatorial testing can be very large, with
advanced software and cluster processors it is not out of reach.
