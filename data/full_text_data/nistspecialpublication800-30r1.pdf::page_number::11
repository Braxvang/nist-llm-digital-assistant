Special Publication 800-30                                                       Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments
________________________________________________________________________________________________


1.1 PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY
The purpose of Special Publication 800-30 is to provide guidance for conducting risk assessments
of federal information systems and organizations, amplifying the guidance in Special Publication
800-39. Risk assessments, carried out at all three tiers in the risk management hierarchy, are part
of an overall risk management process—providing senior leaders/executives with the information
needed to determine appropriate courses of action in response to identified risks. In particular,
this document provides guidance for carrying out each of the steps in the risk assessment process
(i.e., preparing for the assessment, conducting the assessment, communicating the results of the
assessment, and maintaining the assessment) and how risk assessments and other organizational
risk management processes complement and inform each other. Special Publication 800-30 also
provides guidance to organizations on identifying specific risk factors to monitor on an ongoing
basis, so that organizations can determine whether risks have increased to unacceptable levels
(i.e., exceeding organizational risk tolerance) and different courses of action should be taken.

This publication satisfies the requirements of FISMA and meets or exceeds the information
security requirements established for executive agencies 9 by the Office of Management and
Budget (OMB) in Circular A-130, Appendix III, Security of Federal Automated Information
Resources. The guidelines in this publication are applicable to all federal information systems
other than those systems designated as national security systems as defined in 44 U.S.C., Section
3542. The guidelines have been broadly developed from a technical perspective to complement
similar guidelines for national security systems and may be used for such systems with the
approval of appropriate federal officials exercising policy authority over such systems. State,
local, and tribal governments, as well as private sector organizations are encouraged to consider
using these guidelines, as appropriate.

1.2 TARGET AUDIENCE
