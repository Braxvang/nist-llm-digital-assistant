4.2.2    Uniform Distribution of P-values
                                                   The distribution of P-values is examined to ensure
                                                   uniformity. This may be visually illustrated using a
                                                   histogram (see Figure 4-2), whereby, the interval
                                                   between 0 and 1 is divided into 10 sub-intervals, and the
                                                   P-values that lie within each sub-interval are counted
                                                   and displayed.

                                                   Uniformity may also be determined via an application of
                                                   a χ2 test and the determination of a P-value
                                                   corresponding to the Goodness-of-Fit Distributional Test
                                                   on the P-values obtained for an arbitrary statistical test
                                                   (i.e., a P-value of the P-values). This is accomplished
                                                                        10 ( Fi − s        )2
                                                   by computing χ 2 = ∑               10        , where Fi is the
        Figure 4-2: Histogram of P-values                               i=1     s
                                                                                    10
                                                   number of P-values in sub-interval i, and s is the sample
                                                   size. A P-value is calculated such that P-valueT =
              2
igamc( 9 2 , χ 2 ) . If P-valueT ≥ 0.0001, then the sequences can be considered to be uniformly
distributed. Additionally, to provided statistically meaningful results at least 55 sequences must be
processed.


4.3 General Recommendations and Guidelines
In practice, many reasons can be given to explain why a data set has failed a statistical test. The following
is a list of possible explanations. The list was compiled based upon NIST statistical testing efforts.

         (a) An incorrectly programmed statistical test.

             Unless otherwise specified, it should be assumed that a statistical test was tailored to handle a
             particular problem class. Since the NIST test code has been written to allow the selection of
             input parameters, the code has been generalized in any number of ways. Unfortunately, this
             doesn't necessarily translate to coding ease.

             A few statistical tests have been constrained with artificial upper bounds. For example, the
             random excursions tests are assumed to be no more than max{1000, n/128} cycles.
             Conceivably, fixed parameters may have to be increased, depending on experimental
             conditions.

         (b) An underdeveloped (immature) statistical test.

             There are occasions when either probability or complexity theory isn’t sufficiently developed
             or understood to facilitate a rigorous analysis of a statistical test.

             Over time, statistical tests are revamped in light of new results. Since many statistical tests
             are based upon asymptotic approximations, careful work needs to be done to determine how
             good an approximation is.
