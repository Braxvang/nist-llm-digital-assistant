Information System Monitoring). Hence, assessing the effectiveness of these controls results in
monitoring the security status of the related metric.

Staff report assessment results in accordance with organizational policies and procedures.
Reporting on additional metrics and/or assessment results may be required by higher-level
organizations such as OMB. Organizations define security status reporting requirements in the
ISCM strategy. This includes the specific staff/roles to receive ISCM reports, the content and
format of the reports, the frequency of reports, and any tools to be used.

Tier 3 officials report on findings, document any system-level mitigations made, and/or provide
recommendations to officials at Tiers 1 and 2. Organizational officials at Tiers 1 and 2 review
Tier 3 findings to determine aggregate security status and the effectiveness and adequacy of all
controls in meeting mission/business and organizational information security requirements.
Information contained within a report will vary based on its recipient, frequency, purpose,
supported tool sets, and metrics used. For example, the risk executive (function) may receive a
general report on all systems annually and a detailed report on specific high-impact systems
quarterly. The reports provided to the CIO and SISO may contain more granular technical data on
all systems quarterly, and the AO may receive monthly comprehensive reports on the systems for
which s/he is responsible. The computer incident response team (CIRT) lead may receive
exception reports when alerts are generated, and network administrators may review dashboards
showing network activity that is updated every minute, with summary metrics that are updated
hourly or daily. 40 Organizations may consider more frequent reports for specific controls with
more volatility or on controls for which there have been weaknesses or lack of compliance.

Organizations also define requirements for reporting results of controls, such as PM controls, that
are not easily automated. Organizations develop procedures for collecting and reporting
assessment and monitoring results, including results that are derived via manual methods, and for
managing and collecting information from POA&Ms to be used for frequency determination,
status reporting, and monitoring strategy revision.
