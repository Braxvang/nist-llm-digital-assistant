             types of PII and should consider such obligations when determining the PII
             confidentiality impact levels and appropriate safeguards.23

             The sensitivity of other types of data held by an organization is also an important factor
             when analyzing risk.24 The range of data an organization deals with is sometimes not
             fully appreciated. While data repositories containing PII or classified information are
             more easily recognized and taken into account, pockets of other types of sensitive data
             with different rules for handling may also exist. They include data items such as the
             following:

                      Law enforcement and investigative unit data
                      System security information, such as network schematics, configuration
                       settings, and vulnerability reports
                      Licensed source code and libraries, used in application development
                      Digital documents and materials obtained under a non-disclosure
                       agreement or memorandum of agreement
                      Laboratory and research data whose collection, storage, and sharing are
                       regulated
                      Culturally sensitive data related to resource protection and management of
                       Indian tribal land.

             An understanding of the underlying technologies the cloud provider uses to provision
             services is essential for conducting an accurate risk analysis. The security and privacy
             issues from the previous chapter identified important technology areas to review:

                      Logical isolation techniques employed in the multi-tenant software
                       architecture of the cloud
                      Facilities for backup and recovery of data, and for sanitization of data
                      Capabilities and processes for electronic discovery
                      Mechanisms used to control access to data, to protect data while at rest, in
                       transit, and in use, and to expunge data when no longer needed
                      Facilities available for cryptography and cryptographic key management
                      Mechanisms for secure authentication, authorization, and other identity
                       and access management functions
                      Facilities for incident response and disaster recovery.

             As mentioned previously, if the results of a risk analysis show that the level is too high,
             the organization may be able to apply compensating controls to reduce risk to an
             acceptable level. Otherwise, it must either reject use of the service or accept a greater
             degree of risk. As an alternative to rejecting the service and not going forward, it might

     The sensitivity of data from other organizations may also be a factor, if collocated with organizational data.
