Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to survivor compensation information.
The effects of disruption of access to most survivor compensation information or information
systems would have a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
survivor compensation information is low.

D.16 Law Enforcement
Law enforcement involves the protection of people, places, and things from criminal activity
resulting from non-compliance with U.S. laws. This includes patrols, undercover operations,
response to emergency calls, as well as arrests, raids, and seizures of property. Impacts to
some information and information systems associated with law enforcement missions may
affect the security of a broad range of critical infrastructures and key national assets. Some
information associated with Federal law enforcement is categorized as national security
information. Rules governing establishment of impact levels and controls associated with
national security information are governed by a separate set of policies and are outside the
scope of this guideline. Confidentiality and integrity impacts are often determined by
statutory and regulatory requirements that vary by violation.

D.16.1 Criminal Apprehension Information Type

Criminal apprehension supports activities associated with the tracking and capture of groups or
individuals believed to be responsible for committing Federal crimes. The recommended
provisional categorization of the criminal apprehension information type follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Moderate)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of criminal apprehension
information on the ability of responsible agencies to track and capture groups or individuals
believed to be responsible for committing Federal crimes, on public safety, and on the safety of
law enforcement officers. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of criminal
apprehension information depend 1) on the seriousness of the crime involved, 2) on the
capability and predisposition of the criminal to injure or kill civilians or law enforcement
officials, 3) timing (e.g., the ability of the criminal to access the information and use it to
facilitate a crime or evade capture), and 4) statutory and regulatory requirements which vary by
violation.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: In cases where 1) the crimes are not
violent and do not involve large property losses, and 2) there is no history of violence on the part
of the criminal, the confidentiality impact may be low or moderate. For many crimes that are the
responsibility of Federal law enforcement agencies, the consequences associated with
unauthorized disclosure of criminal apprehension information must often be assumed to pose a
