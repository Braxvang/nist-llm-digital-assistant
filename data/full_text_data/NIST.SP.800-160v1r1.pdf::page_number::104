-    Trustworthy System Control: Every controlled action is constrained by the mechanism, and the
     mechanism can protect itself from tampering. Sufficient assurance of the correctness and
     completeness of the mechanism can be ascertained from analysis and testing.
-    Protective Failure and Protective Recovery: A protective state is preserved during error, fault, failure,
     and successful attack, as well as during the recovery of assets or of recovery to normal, degraded, or
     alternative operational modes.
Continuous protection applies to all configurations, states, and modes of the system, as well as the
transitions between those configurations, states, and modes. The system design must ensure that
protections are coordinated and composed in a non-conflicting and mutually supportive manner across the
non-behavioral aspects of the system structure and the behavioral aspects of system function and data
flow.
While the design for continuous protection applies for the entire time that the protection is required, the
protection capability is sometimes intentionally disabled (e.g., Battleshort 79 intentional override). The
intentional disabling/override of protection is an exception case and, therefore, does not violate this
principle. That is, the principle of continuous protection applies only for the entirety of time that the
protection is required and not knowingly and intentionally disabled. 80

E.9.       Defense In Depth
Principle: Loss is prevented or minimized by employing multiple coordinated mechanisms.
Note: The coordinated deployment of multiple protective mechanisms for a system helps to avoid single
points of failure. The principle of defense in depth has three pillars:
-    Multiple lines of defenses or barriers should be placed along loss scenario sequences.
-    Loss control should not rely on a single defensive element.
-    The successive barriers should be diverse in nature and include technical, operational, and
     organizational barriers [52].
Defense in depth requires the use of coordinated mechanisms (active) within an architectural structure
(passive) that achieves the depth characteristic. 81 Ideally, the initial lines of defense prevent loss, while
subsequent lines of defense block loss scenario escalation and/or contain loss and potential consequences
when needed. A defense-in-depth strategy examines loss scenarios for those points of opportunity to
prevent or contain loss. It also leverages the opportunities to use active or passive mechanisms or
constraints to meet loss control objectives.
The coordination of defense-in-depth mechanisms (i.e., combinations of structural, data, and control flow
coordination) in conjunction with other design principles (e.g., Anomaly Detection, Commensurate
Response) reflects a design strategy to satisfy the specified loss control objectives.
While defense in depth distributes the protection capability to many components, a defense-in-depth
strategy may also consider a distributed composition to a line of defense. A protection capability provided
by a single system component is a potential single point of failure or bottleneck to system performance. It

   Battleshort is the capability to bypass normal interlocks in mission-critical equipment (e.g., equipment that must not be shut down or the
mission function will fail) during battle conditions [51].

   However, the inclusion of a capability for intentionally disabling/overriding protection requires additional control features, devices, and
associated analysis for the enforcement of constraints to prevent the inadvertent actuation of the override capability.

   While the discussion in this section is limited to the machine, defense in depth may involve a combination of technical, operational, and
organizational elements. Additional discussion on defense in depth can be found in [52].
