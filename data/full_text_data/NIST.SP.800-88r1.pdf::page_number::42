NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1                                                              Guidelines for Media Sanitization


                             may be available:
                                  a. The OVERWRITE service action. Apply one write pass of a fixed pattern
                                       across the media surface. Some examples of fixed patterns include all zeros
                                       or a pseudorandom pattern. A single write pass should suffice to Purge the
                                       media.
                                       Optionally: Instead of one write pass, use three total write passes of a
                                       pseudorandom pattern, leveraging the invert option so that the second write
                                       pass is the inverted version of the pattern specified.
                                  b. If the device supports encryption, the CRYPTOGRAPHIC ERASE service
                                       action.
                                       Optionally: After Cryptographic Erase is successfully applied to a device, use
                                       the overwrite command (if supported) to write one pass of zeros or a
                                       pseudorandom pattern across the media. If the overwrite command is not
                                       supported, the Clear procedure could alternatively be applied.
                        2.   Cryptographic Erase through the TCG Opal SSC or Enterprise SSC interface by
                             issuing commands as necessary to cause all MEKs to be changed. Refer to the TCG
                             and vendors shipping TCG Opal or Enterprise storage devices for more information.
                             Optionally: After Cryptographic Erase is successfully applied to a device, use the
                             overwrite command (if supported) to write one pass of zeros or a pseudorandom
                             pattern across the media. If the overwrite command is not supported, the Clear
                             procedure could alternatively be applied.
                        3.   Degauss in an organizationally approved automatic degausser or disassemble the hard
                             disk drive and Purge the enclosed platters with an organizationally approved
                             degaussing wand. The degausser/wand should be rated sufficient for the media.

   Destroy:      Shred, Disintegrate, Pulverize, or Incinerate by burning the device in a licensed incinerator.


   Notes:        Verification must be performed for each technique within Clear and Purge as described in the
                 Verify Methods subsection, except degaussing. The assurance provided by degaussing
                 depends on selecting an effective degausser, applying it appropriately and periodically spot
                 checking the results to ensure it is working as expected.
                 When using the three pass SCSI sanitize overwrite procedure with the invert (also known as
                 complement) option, the verification process would simply search for the original pattern (which
                 would have been written again during the third pass). While it is widely accepted that one pass
                 of overwriting should be sufficient for Purging the data, the availability of a dedicated command
                 that incorporates the ability to invert the data pattern allows an efficient and effective approach
                 that mitigates any residual risk associated with variations in implementations of magnetic
                 recording features across device manufacturers.
                 The storage device may support configuration capabilities that artificially restrict the ability to
                 access portions of the media, such as “SCSI mode parameter block descriptor’s NUMBER OF
                 LOGICAL BLOCKS field (accessible with the SCSI MODE SENSE and MODE SELECT
                 commands”. Even when a dedicated sanitization command addresses these areas, their
                 presence may affect the ability to reliably verify the effectiveness of the sanitization procedure if
                 left in place. Any configuration options limiting the ability to access the entire addressable area of
                 the storage media should be reset prior to applying the sanitization technique.
                 When Cryptographic Erase is applied, verification must be performed prior to additional
                 sanitization techniques (if applicable), such as a Clear or Purge technique applied following
                 Cryptographic Erase, to ensure that the cryptographic operation completed successfully. A quick
                 sampling verification as described in the Verify Methods subsection should also be performed
                 after any additional techniques are applied following Cryptographic Erase.
                 Not all implementations of encryption are necessarily suitable for reliance upon Cryptographic
                 Erase as a Purge mechanism. The decision regarding whether to use Cryptographic Erase
                 depends upon verification of attributes previously identified in this guidance and in Appendix D.
                 This guidance applies to Legacy Magnetic media only, and it is critical to verify the media type
                 prior to sanitization. Note that emerging media types, such as HAMR media or hybrid drives may
                 not be easily identifiable by the label. Refer to the manufacturer for details about the media type
                 in a storage device.
