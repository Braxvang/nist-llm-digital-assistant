                                                                         Guidelines on PDA Forensics


       The remaining subsections provide supplemental information related to PDAs, following the
       paradigm of search, recognition, documentation, and collection.

5.1   Search

       When an investigative team arrives at the scene with the appropriate authorization to examine
       a suspect’s surroundings (e.g., a search warrant, consent from the owner), they should proceed
       cautiously and follow the necessary steps to ensure that the device arrives at the forensics
       laboratory without data depletion. Incorrect procedures during the seizure can cause critical
       information to be lost. Awareness of device specific issues and an understanding of various
       families of devices and their characteristics and accessories (e.g., power consumption, battery
       type, cradles, and power supplies) are essential.

       For PDAs, evidence sources include the device, device cradle, power supply, and associated
       peripherals, media, and accessories. Removable media varies from the size of a stamp to a
       stick of gum, which can be hidden and extremely difficult to find. Most often removable
       media can be identified through the number and placement of pins or pin receptacles located
       on the media that establish an interface with the device. The surrounding area and rooms other
       than where the device was found should be searched to ensure related evidence is not
       overlooked. Equipment associated with the PDA, such as memory cards or personal
       computers synched with the PDA, may be more valuable than the PDA itself.

       By accident or deliberate action, electronic equipment may be found in a damaged state.
       Devices or media with visible external damage do not necessarily prevent data from being
       extracted from them. Damaged equipment should be taken back to the lab for further
       investigation. Repairing damaged components on a device and restoring it to working order
       for examination and analysis may be possible. The memory components may also be
       repaired/examined locally, or removed and examined by a specially trained examiner.

       Legal advisors should be contacted for assistance, if needed, with the following two critical
       legal considerations [DOJ04]:

               Determining the extent of the authority to search and what additional legal process
               may be necessary to continue the search (e.g., warrant, amended consent form), if
               evidence is located that was not authorized in the original search authority.

               Identifying possible concerns related to applicable local policies and laws, and
               International, Federal, or State statutes, such as the Electronic Communications
               Privacy Act of 1986 (ECPA) and the Cable Communications Policy Act (CCPA).

5.2   Recognition

       To proceed effectively, the exact type of device must be identified. Individuals may attempt to
       thwart specialists by altering the device to conceal its true identity. Device alteration could
       range from removing manufacturer labels to filing off logos. In addition, the operating system
       may be modified or completely replaced and appear differently, as well as behave differently
       than before.

       If digital devices such as PDAs are in the “on” state the type of device can be identified by the
       operating system, which is more consistent in device identity rather than a logo. Though the
