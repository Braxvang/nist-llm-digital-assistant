NIST SP 800-166                                                   DERIVED PIV APPLICATION AND
                                                                  DATA MODEL TEST GUIDELINES

 Precondition(s)        •   A token with the Derived PIV Application is inserted into an
                            appropriate token reader.
                        •   Suitable drivers have been loaded between the test system and
                            an instance of the reader.
                        •   A digital signature certificate is present within the Derived PIV
                            Application.
 Test Scenario          1. Send the SELECT command with
                              • AID == 'A0 00 00 03 08 00 00 20 00 01 00'
                        2. Send the GET DATA command with
                              • Data field of the command containing the tag
                                 ('5FC10A') of the X.509 Certificate for
                                 Digital Signature data object
                        3. Extract the cRLDistributionPoints extension from the
                           certificate.
 Expected Result(s)     1. From Step 1, the command returns the application property
                           template with the status word '90 00'.
                        2. From Step 2, the command returns the requested data object
                           along with the status word '90 00'.
                        3. From Step 3, a URI with either the “LDAP” or “HTTP” scheme
                           that can be used to access CRL information is present.

9.3.2.9 RSA Exponent

 Test Assertion         TA-09.03.02.09
 Purpose                Verifies that for RSA keys, the exponent of the asymmetric key for
                        digital signature is equal to 65 537.
 DTR(s)                 • DTR-07.03.02.11
 Issuer Documentation   None.

 Precondition(s)        •   A token with the Derived PIV Application is inserted into an
                            appropriate token reader.
                        •   Suitable drivers have been loaded between the test system and
                            an instance of the reader.
                        •   A digital signature certificate is present within the Derived PIV
                            Application.
 Test Scenario          1. Send the SELECT command with
                              • AID == 'A0 00 00 03 08 00 00 20 00 01 00'
                        2. Send the GET DATA command with
                              • Data field of the command containing the tag
                                 ('5FC10A') of the X.509 Certificate for
                                 Digital Signature data object
                        3. Extract the subjectPublicKeyInfo->subjectPublicKey
                           from the certificate.
                        4. Parse the exponent from the extracted public key.
 Expected Result(s)     1. From Step 1, the command returns the application property
                           template with the status word '90 00'.
