reserved for authentication and integrity protection purposes, or a key derived from a
Traffic-Encryption Key (TEK) using a key wrapping algorithm. In this latter case, note
that the TEK might be used for both encryption and for key derivation. In order to
comply with the recommendation to use a key for only one purpose, the MAC key shall
be a key reserved for a single purpose.


7.2.4 Backup
The KMF should backup all keying material shared with and among the mobile radios so
that it can be recovered if necessary. When a key is no longer required, it should be
deleted from both normal operational storage and backup storage.


7.2.5 Rekeying
Procedures shall be in place to rekey all radios in the network in the event of a key
compromise. If a radio is lost, procedures shall enable rekeying other radios in the
network so that the lost radio no longer has the capability of communicating securely
with other radios in the network.


7.2.6 Random bit generators
Keys shall be generated at the KMF using an approved random bit generator that
provides sufficient randomness for the desired security strength of the cryptographic
processes. NIST-approved random bit generation methods are specified in [SP 800-90A],
[SP 800-90B] and [SP 800-90C] (under development).


7.3 Procurement Guidance
The following recommendations are for any individual(s) that makes a purchasing
decision for acquiring OTAR equipment.

1. Ensure that the AES or TDEA algorithm is included.

2. If TDEA is provided in an implementation, ensure that the three-key version is
   included, and the implementation is capable of limiting the number of uses of a single
   TDEA key bundle to 1 000 000.35

3. Ensure that KMFs and radios conform to OTAR and OTAR1.

4. When keys are generated within KMFs, ensure that they are generated using
   approved random bit generators.

5. Ensure that cryptographic modules used by the KMF and the mobile radios are
   validated at FIPS 140-2 Level 1 or higher [FIPS 140-2].
