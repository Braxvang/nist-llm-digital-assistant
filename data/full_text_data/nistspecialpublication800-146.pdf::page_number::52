                                                           CLOUD COMPUTING SYNOPSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



Generally, the Cloud Manager and the Cluster Managers shown in Figure 17 will be connected by fast
networks of IP routers: this reflects the need to add capacity in the form of new data centers as a cloud
expands. Communications between Computer Managers, in contrast, tend to be local and very fast (e.g.,
10GB Ethernet). While there is nothing to prevent all of the links in a cloud from being implemented in
fast local networks, that approach is not scalable and makes a cloud vulnerable to local events that can
disrupt service, e.g., natural disasters. Similarly, there is nothing to prevent a cloud from being
completely dispersed over wide area links, but such a cloud could suffer a performance disadvantage.

The following subsections summarize the operation of the three main layers: the cloud manager, the
cluster manager, and the computer manager.

7.3.1   Operation of the Cloud Manager

The Cloud Manager is the public access point to the cloud where consumers sign up for accounts, manage
the resources they rent from the cloud, and access data stored in the cloud. The Cloud Manager includes
mechanisms for authenticating consumers, and for generating or validating access credentials (e.g.,
cryptographic keys) that consumers then employ when communicating with their virtual machines. The
Cloud Manager also performs top-level resource allocation; when a consumer issues a command to rent a
number of resources, the Cloud Manager must determine if the cloud has enough free resources to satisfy
the request, and if so, which Cluster Manager (or Managers) have some or all the resources. If the request
can be satisfied, the Cloud Manager must commit to the allocation of the resources at the participating
Cluster Managers, and must coordinate the setup of virtual networking so that the consumer can
uniformly access all resources. The Cloud Manager will also enforce any cloud-global policies governing
resource requests.

In addition to coordination with Cluster Managers, Figure 17 shows the Cloud Manager connected to the
cloudâ€™s Data Object Storage (DOS) repository. In actual implementations, the DOS could be distributed
or put on different networks; however, the DOS services need to be available both to running virtual
machines in the cloud and to systems from outside the cloud, and must be coordinated sufficiently with
the Cloud Manager to keep track of valid consumer identities both to allow their administrative actions in
the DOS and for billing. These constraints imply a structure with close ties between the DOS and the
Cloud Manager, and with wide-area network access from the DOS to both running virtual machines and
external systems.

7.3.2   Operation of the Cluster Managers

Each Cluster Manager is responsible for the operation of a collection of computers that are connected via
high speed local area networks. A computer cluster may contain hundreds or thousands of computers. A
Cluster Manager receives resource allocation commands and queries from the Cloud Manager, and
calculates whether part or all of a command can be satisfied using the resources of the computers in the
cluster. A Cluster Manager queries the Computer Managers for the computers in the cluster to determine
resource availability, and returns messages to the Cloud Manager on whether part, or all, of a request can
be satisfied in a cluster. If subsequently directed by the Cloud Manager, a Cluster Manager then instructs
the Computer Managers to perform resource allocation, and reconfigures the virtual network
infrastructure to give the consumer uniform access.

In addition to being connected to individual computers via LAN links, Figure 17 shows each Cluster
Manager also connected to Persistent Local Storage (PLS). As discussed above, virtual machines need
persistent disk-like storage to preserve their work while virtual machines are de-allocated and later
reallocated. The most natural location for this storage is where very high speed connections to virtual
machines are available, but where the storage is not permanently bound to any specific computer system.
