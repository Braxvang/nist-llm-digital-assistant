Different devices have different technical and physical characteristics (e.g., size, weight,
processor speed, memory capacity). Devices may also use different types of expansion
capabilities (e.g., I/O and memory card slots, device expansion sleeves, and external hardware
interfaces) to provide additional functionality. Furthermore, PDA capabilities are sometimes
combined with those of other devices such as cell phones, global positioning systems, and
cameras to form new types of hybrid devices. Table 1 highlights the general characteristics of
selected Palm OS, Pocket PC (rebranded as Windows Mobile in 2003), and Linux PDA
models, which highlight this diversity. Characteristics of a wider range of PDAs can be found
on manufacturer and vendor Web sites, as well as product review sites. 3,4
