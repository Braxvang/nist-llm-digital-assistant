                                                 TECHNICAL GUIDE TO INFORMATION SECURITY TESTING AND ASSESSMENT



       Technique                                                 Capabilities
                           •   Identifies hosts and open ports
 Vulnerability Scanning    •   Identifies known vulnerabilities (note: has high false positive rates)
                           •   Often provides advice on mitigating discovered vulnerabilities
                           •   Identifies unauthorized wireless devices within range of the scanners
 Wireless Scanning         •   Discovers wireless signals outside of an organization’s perimeter
                           •   Detects potential backdoors and other security violations

There are risks associated with each technique and combination of techniques. To ensure that all are
executed safely and accurately, each assessor should have a certain baseline skill set. Table 4-2 provides
guidelines for the minimum skill set needed for each technique presented in Section 4.

                Table 4-2. Baseline Skill Set for Target Identification and Analysis Techniques
