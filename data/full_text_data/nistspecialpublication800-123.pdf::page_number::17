                                                                                       GUIDE TO GENERAL SERVER SECURITY



3.        Server Security Planning

The most critical aspect of deploying a secure server is careful planning before installation, configuration,
and deployment. Careful planning will ensure that the server is as secure as possible and in compliance
with all relevant organizational policies. Many server security and performance problems can be traced to
a lack of planning or management controls. The importance of management controls cannot be
overstated. In many organizations, the IT support structure is highly fragmented. This fragmentation
leads to inconsistencies, and these inconsistencies can lead to security vulnerabilities and other issues.

3.1       Installation and Deployment Planning

Security should be considered from the initial planning stage at the beginning of the systems development
life cycle to maximize security and minimize costs. It is much more difficult and expensive to address
security after deployment and implementation. Organizations are more likely to make decisions about
configuring hosts appropriately and consistently if they begin by developing and using a detailed, well-
designed deployment plan. Developing such a plan enables organizations to make informed tradeoff
decisions between usability and performance, and risk. A deployment plan allows organizations to
maintain secure configurations and aids in identifying security vulnerabilities, which often manifest
themselves as deviations from the plan.

In the planning stages of a server, the following items should be considered: 6

 Identify the purpose(s) of the server.

      –    What information categories will be stored on the server?

      –    What information categories will be processed on or transmitted through the server?

      –    What are the security requirements for this information?

      –    Will any information be retrieved from or stored on another host (e.g., database server, directory
           server, Web server, Network Attached Storage (NAS) server, Storage Area Network (SAN)
           server)?

      –    What are the security requirements for any other hosts involved?

      –    What other service(s) will be provided by the server (in general, dedicating the host to only one
           service is the most secure option)?

      –    What are the security requirements for these additional services?

      –    What are the requirements for continuity of services provided by the server, such as those
           specified in continuity of operations plans and disaster recovery plans?

      –    Where on the network will the server be located?

 Identify the network services that will be provided on the server, such as Hypertext Transfer Protocol
  (HTTP), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), Network File System
