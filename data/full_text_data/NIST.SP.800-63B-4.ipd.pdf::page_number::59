       NIST SP 800-63B-4 ipd                                              Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022                                       Authentication and Lifecycle Management


1773   email, telephone, postal) and suspend authenticators reported to have been compromised.
1774   The suspension SHALL be reversible if the subscriber successfully authenticates to the
1775   CSP using a valid (i.e., not suspended) authenticator and requests reactivation of an
1776   authenticator suspended in this manner. The CSP MAY set a time limit after which a
1777   suspended authenticator can no longer be reactivated.

1778   6.3. Expiration
1779   CSPs MAY issue authenticators that expire. If and when an authenticator expires, it
1780    SHALL NOT be usable for authentication. When an authentication is attempted using
1781   an expired authenticator, the CSP SHOULD give an indication to the subscriber that the
1782   authentication failure is due to expiration rather than some other cause.
1783   The CSP SHALL require subscribers to surrender or prove destruction of any physical
1784   authenticator containing attribute certificates signed by the CSP as soon as practical after
1785   expiration or receipt of a renewed authenticator.

1786   6.4. Invalidation
1787   Invalidation of an authenticator (sometimes referred to as revocation or termination) refers
1788   to removal of the binding between an authenticator and a subscriber account.
1789   CSPs SHALL invalidate authenticators promptly when a subscriber account ceases to
1790   exist (e.g., subscriberâ€™s death, discovery of a fraudulent subscriber), when requested
1791   by the subscriber, or when the CSP determines that the subscriber no longer meets its
1792   eligibility requirements.
1793   The CSP SHALL require subscribers to surrender or certify destruction of any physical
1794   authenticator containing subscriber attributes, such as certificates signed by the CSP, as
1795   soon as practical after invalidation takes place. This is necessary to protect the privacy
1796   of the subscriber and to block the use of any certificates in offline situations between
1797   invalidation and expiration of the certificates.
1798   Further requirements on the invalidation of PIV authenticators are found in [FIPS201].
