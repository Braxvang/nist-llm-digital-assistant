operating system and application-specific guidelines.24 The following text, however, provides a brief
overview of some of the main recommended practices for securing networks, systems, and applications:

 Risk Assessments. Periodic risk assessments of systems and applications should determine what
  risks are posed by combinations of threats and vulnerabilities.25 This should include understanding the
  applicable threats, including organization-specific threats. Each risk should be prioritized, and the
  risks can be mitigated, transferred, or accepted until a reasonable overall level of risk is reached.
  Another benefit of conducting risk assessments regularly is that critical resources are identified,
  allowing staff to emphasize monitoring and response activities for those resources.26
 Host Security. All hosts should be hardened appropriately using standard configurations. In addition
  to keeping each host properly patched, hosts should be configured to follow the principle of least
  privilege—granting users only the privileges necessary for performing their authorized tasks. Hosts
  should have auditing enabled and should log significant security-related events. The security of hosts
  and their configurations should be continuously monitored.27 Many organizations use Security
  Content Automation Protocol (SCAP)28 expressed operating system and application configuration
  checklists to assist in securing hosts consistently and effectively.29
 Network Security. The network perimeter should be configured to deny all activity that is not
  expressly permitted. This includes securing all connection points, such as virtual private networks
  (VPNs) and dedicated connections to other organizations.
 Malware Prevention. Software to detect and stop malware should be deployed throughout the
  organization. Malware protection should be deployed at the host level (e.g., server and workstation
  operating systems), the application server level (e.g., email server, web proxies), and the application
  client level (e.g., email clients, instant messaging clients).30
 User Awareness and Training. Users should be made aware of policies and procedures regarding
  appropriate use of networks, systems, and applications. Applicable lessons learned from previous
  incidents should also be shared with users so they can see how their actions could affect the
  organization. Improving user awareness regarding incidents should reduce the frequency of incidents.
  IT staff should be trained so that they can maintain their networks, systems, and applications in
  accordance with the organization’s security standards.
