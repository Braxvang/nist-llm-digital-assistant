Special Publication 800-53, Revision 1              Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________

IR-3      INCIDENT RESPONSE TESTING AND EXERCISES

          Control: The organization tests and/or exercises the incident response capability for the information
          system [Assignment: organization-defined frequency, at least annually] using [Assignment:
          organization-defined tests and/or exercises] to determine the incident response effectiveness and
          documents the results.
          Supplemental Guidance: NIST Special Publication 800-84 provides guidance on test, training, and
          exercise programs for information technology plans and capabilities.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization employs automated mechanisms to more thoroughly and effectively test/exercise
                the incident response capability.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Automated mechanisms can provide the ability to more
                thoroughly and effectively test or exercise the capability by providing more complete
                coverage of incident response issues, selecting more realistic test/exercise scenarios and
                environments, and more effectively stressing the response capability.

           LOW Not Selected              MOD IR-3                   HIGH IR-3 (1)



IR-4      INCIDENT HANDLING

          Control: The organization implements an incident handling capability for security incidents that
          includes preparation, detection and analysis, containment, eradication, and recovery.
          Supplemental Guidance: Incident-related information can be obtained from a variety of sources
          including, but not limited to, audit monitoring, network monitoring, physical access monitoring,
          and user/administrator reports. The organization incorporates the lessons learned from ongoing
          incident handling activities into the incident response procedures and implements the procedures
          accordingly. Related security controls: AU-6, PE-6.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization employs automated mechanisms to support the incident handling process.


           LOW IR-4                      MOD IR-4 (1)               HIGH IR-4 (1)



IR-5      INCIDENT MONITORING

          Control: The organization tracks and documents information system security incidents on an
          ongoing basis.
          Supplemental Guidance: None.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization employs automated mechanisms to assist in the tracking of security incidents
                and in the collection and analysis of incident information.


           LOW Not Selected              MOD IR-5                   HIGH IR-5 (1)
