NIST SP 800-82r3                                          Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

The Subcategories (outcomes) that fall within the CSF Supply Chain Risk Management Category
provide the basis for developing processes and procedures for managing supply chain risk. These
risks include the insertion of counterfeits, unauthorized production, malicious insiders,
tampering, theft, and the insertion of malicious software and hardware, as well as poor
manufacturing and development practices in the cyber supply chain. These risks must be
identified, assessed, and managed. The CSF Category also addresses supplier and third-party
partner contracts, assessments, evaluations, and response and recovery planning.
Additionally, organizations should investigate SBOMs and distributed ledger (e.g., blockchain)
technologies to support supply chain risk management. For example, SBOM information can
identify software components and their relationships or dependencies on other components.
Having this information available can help an organization determine whether a device is
affected by reported software vulnerabilities.
Supplemental guidance for Supply Chain Risk Management can be found in the following
documents:
   •   NIST SP 800-161, Supply Chain Risk Management Practices for Federal Information
       Systems and Organizations
   •   NIST IR 8276, Key Practices in Cyber Supply Chain Risk Management: Observations
       from Industry
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Organizations should consider documenting and tracking serial numbers,
            checksums, digital certificates/signatures, or other identifying features
            that can enable them to verify the authenticity of vendor-provided OT
            hardware, software, and firmware. Organizations should also consider
            whether OT is purchased directly from the original equipment
            manufacturer (OEM) or an authorized third-party distributor or reseller.
            Suppliers should be assessed or reviewed to ensure that they continue to
            follow best practices.
            Many OT components and devices utilize open-source libraries to
            support their functional capabilities. Organizations should identify the
            open-source dependencies for their OT components and establish
            monitoring for open-source information, such as vendor websites or
            cyber news sources, to ensure that no known vulnerabilities or
            counterfeits have been disclosed. Additionally, organizations might
            consider utilizing an industry-recognized certification process for OT
            products to support supply chain risk management.

       Protect (PR)
The Protect Function supports the ability to limit or contain the impact of a potential
cybersecurity event. Examples of outcome Categories within this Function include: Identity
Management and Access Control; Awareness and Training; Data Security; Information
Protection Processes and Procedures; Maintenance; and Protective Technology
