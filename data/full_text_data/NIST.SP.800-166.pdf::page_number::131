                                  • Data field of the command containing the tag
                                    ('5FC10B') of the X.509 Certificate for Key
                                    Management data object
                           3. Extract the subjectPublicKeyInfo->subjectPublicKey
                              from the certificate.
                           4. Parse the exponent from the extracted public key.
 Expected Result(s)        1. From Step 1, the command returns the application property
                              template with the status word '90 00'.
                           2. From Step 2, the command returns the requested data object
                              along with the status word '90 00'.
                           3. From Step 4, the exponent of the RSA asymmetric key for key
                              management is equal to 65 537.

9.3.4 X.509 Certificate of the Derived PIV Credential Issuer (Content Signing)

9.3.4.1 Signature Algorithm

 Test Assertion            TA-09.03.04.01
 Purpose                   Verifies that the signature field of the Derived PIV Credential
                           Issuer's (content signing) certificate specifies one of the following
                           algorithm OIDs: 1.2.840.113549.1.10 (id-RSASSA-PSS),
                           1.2.840.113549.1.11 (Sha256WithRSAEncryption),
                           1.2.840.10045.4.3.2 (edsa-with-Sha256), 1.2.840.10045.4.3.3
                           (edsa-with-Sha384).
 DTR(s)                    • DTR-07.03.04.01
                           • DTR-07.03.04.02
 Issuer Documentation      None.
 Precondition(s)           • A token with the Derived PIV Application is inserted into an
                               appropriate token reader.
                           • Suitable drivers have been loaded between the test system and
                               an instance of the reader.
                           • A Security Object is present within the Derived PIV
                               Application.
 Test Scenario             1. Send the SELECT command with
                                 • AID == 'A0 00 00 03 08 00 00 20 00 01 00'
                           2. Send the GET DATA command with
                                 • Data field of the command containing the tag
                                    ('5FC106') of the Security Object
                           3. Extract and parse the certificates field contents
                              from the Security Object.
                           4. Extract signature->algorithm field value from the
                              certificate.
 Expected Result(s)        1. From Step 1, the command returns the application property
                              template with the status word '90 00'.
                           2. From Step 2, the command returns the requested data object
                              along with the status word '90 00'.
                           3. From Step 4, the algorithm value is in accordance with Table 3-
                              3 of [SP800-78]. If the algorithm value is id-RSASSA-PSS,
