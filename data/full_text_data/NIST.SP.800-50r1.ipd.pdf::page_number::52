       NIST SP 800-50r1 ipd                                                      Building a Cybersecurity and
       August 2023                                                                 Privacy Learning Program

1540                  actions, whether they possessed the skill, or whether additional ISPO/ISPMs were
1541                  needed. This issue may require discussion and review with senior leadership to be
1542                  fully resolved.
1543              •   Financial office employees are designated as employees with significant
1544                  cybersecurity and privacy responsibilities and receive an annual one-hour self-
1545                  paced training course. Based on the analysis, it was determined that the financial
1546                  office employees lacked a basic understanding of the policies and procedures for
1547                  protecting sensitive and privacy-related information. Since this could have
1548                  immediate and damaging consequences, this lack of knowledge will be addressed
1549                  with a customized training solution and by including the topic in updates to the
1550                  annual one-hour self-paced training course.
1551          Design Phase: Create Learning Objectives Based on Knowledge and Skill Gaps
1552          The learning goals and objectives for this example are:
1553              •   The briefing material for the system owners contained two learning objectives:
1554                      o To be able to identify the elements of the privacy notice that relates to the
1555                        PII being processed in their systems
1556                      o To be able to verify with systems engineers that the PII processing
1557                        comports with the appropriate elements of the privacy notice
1558              •   No training gap was determined at this time.
1559              •   A webinar was scheduled with the financial office employees with the following
1560                  learning objectives:
1561                      o To be able to describe what is considered sensitive or personally
1562                        identifiable information
1563                      o To be able to describe the policies and procedures for protecting sensitive
1564                        and personally identifiable information
1565                      o To be able to adequately protect information while in use and while it is
1566                        stored on the system when given an online form containing privacy-related
1567                        information
1568   As in the examples, the learning content should be designed based on the user segments, such as
1569   All Users, Privileged Users, and Users with Significant Cybersecurity or Privacy
1570   Responsibilities.

1571          Summarize CPLP or Element Requirements
1572   Before moving to the development phase, the Learning Program Manager must consolidate their
1573   requirements for development using the results of the analysis and design phases. They should be
1574   able to fully articulate the Learning Gaps being targeted (per audience) and the related Learning
1575   Objectives.
1576   Additional CPLP requirements that are important to consider are:
1577      •   Material must accommodate all learning styles.
