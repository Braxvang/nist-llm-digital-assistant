determining how to provide the necessary equipment. Agencies must also plan for
an alternate site that, at a minimum, provides workspace for all contingency plan
personnel, equipment, and the appropriate IT infrastructure necessary to execute IT
contingency plan and system recovery activities.
   The level of operational readiness of the alternate site is an important
characteristic to determine when developing the recovery strategy. NIST SP 800-34
provides an overview of the common types of alternate sites.
    The recovery strategy requires personnel to implement the procedures and test
operability. Generally, a member of the organization’s senior leadership is selected
to activate the plan and lead overall recovery operations. Appropriate teams of
personnel (at least two people to ensure there is a primary and alternate available to
execute procedures) are identified to be responsible for specific aspects of the plan.
    Personnel should be chosen to staff the teams based on their normal
responsibilities, system knowledge, and availability to recover the system on an on-
call basis. A line of succession should be defined to ensure that someone can
assume the role of senior leadership if the plan leader is unable to respond.
   Having selected choices for each component of the recovery strategy, the final
consideration should be given to cost. The recovery strategy must meet criticality,
availability, and RTO requirements while remaining within budget. Less obvious
costs—such as shipping, awareness programs, tests and exercises, travel, labor
hours, and contracted services—must also be incorporated into the evaluation.

9.5 Step 5: Develop IT Contingency Plan
   Procedures for executing the recovery strategy are outlined in the IT contingency
plan. The plan must be written in a format that will provide the users (recovery
team leadership and members) the context in which the plan is to be implemented
and the direct procedures, based on role, to execute. IT contingency plans are
constructed using five components as depicted in Figure 9-2.
