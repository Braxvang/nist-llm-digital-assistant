Inverse Cipher Function       The inverse function of the forward cipher function for a given
                              cryptographic key.

Least Significant Bit(s)      The right-most bit(s) of a bit string.

Message                       A cryptographic checksum on data that is designed to reveal both
Authentication Code           accidental errors and intentional modifications of the data.
(MAC)

Mode of Operation             An algorithm for the cryptographic transformation of data that
(Mode)                        features a symmetric key block cipher algorithm.

Most Significant Bit(s)       The left-most bit(s) of a bit string.

Nonce                         A value that is used only once within a specified context.

Octet                         A string of eight bits.

Octet Length                  The number of octets in an octet string.

Octet String                  An ordered sequence of octets.

Payload                       The input data to the CCM generation-encryption process that is both
                              authenticated and encrypted.

Valid Data Element            A payload, an associated data string, or a nonce that satisfies the
                              restrictions of the formatting function.
