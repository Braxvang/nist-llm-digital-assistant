      The Computer Security Division (CSD), a division of the Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute
of Standards and Technology (NIST) is responsible for developing cybersecurity standards, guidelines, tests, and metrics for the
protection of non-national security federal information systems. CSD’s standards, guidelines, tools and references are developed
in an open, transparent, traceable and collaborative manner that enlists broad expertise from around the world. While developed
for federal agency use, these resources are voluntarily adopted by other organizations because they are effective and accepted
globally.
    The need for cybersecurity standards, best practices, tools and references that also address interoperability, usability
and privacy continue to be critical for the Nation. CSD aligns its resources to enable greater development and application of

and information security challenges. Our foundational research and applied cybersecurity programs continue to advance in
many areas, including cryptography, automation, roots of trust, identity and access management, advanced security testing and
measurement, Internet of Things (IoT), cyber-physical systems, and public safety networks.
    Trust is crucial to the broad adoption of our standards and guidelines, including our cryptographic standards and guidelines.
To ensure that our cryptography resources have been developed according the highest standard of inclusiveness, transparency
and security, NIST conducted an internal and external formal review of our cryptographic standards development efforts in
2014. We documented and solicited public comment on the principles and rigorous processes we use to engage stakeholders
and experts in industry, academia, and government to develop and revise these standards. The final report is now published and
serves as a basis for all CSD’s cryptographic development efforts.
     Increasing the trustworthiness and resilience of the IT infrastructure is a significant undertaking that requires a substantial
investment in the architectural design and development of our systems and networks. A disciplined and structured set of
systems security engineering processes that starts with and builds on well-established international standards provides an
important starting point. Draft Special Publication 800-160, Systems Security Engineering: An Integrated Approach to Building
Trustworthy Resilient Systems, which was issued in May 2014, helps organizations to develop a more defensible and survivable
information technology infrastructure. This resource, coupled with other NIST standards and guidelines, contributes to systems
that are more resilient in the face of cyber attacks and other threats.
    Strong partnerships with diverse stakeholders are vital to the success of our technical programs. In February 2014, NIST
issued the Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity as directed in Executive Order 13636. The Framework,
created through collaboration between industry and government, consists of standards, guidelines, and practices to promote
the protection of the critical infrastructure. Its approach helps owners and operators of the critical infrastructure to manage
cybersecurity-related risk.
    Active engagement with diverse stakeholders continues to be critical to our success. In the federal space, this interaction
is most prominent in our strengthened collaborations with the Department of Defense, the Intelligence Community, and
the Committee on National Security Systems to establish a common foundation for information security across the Federal
Government. Our cybersecurity awareness, training, and education programs also exemplify the importance of engagements
with academic institutions, federal agencies, small and medium businesses and others to increase awareness and enhance the
overall cybersecurity posture of the Nation. CSD’s work with Health and Human Services, Department of Transportation, Federal
Communications Commission and others are all examples of an active and strong engagement, applying security to multiple
government mission areas.
    For many years, CSD, in collaboration with our global partners across industry, academia, standards bodies, and
government, has made great contributions to help secure the nation’s critical information and infrastructure. We look forward to
strengthening these relationships as we lead the development and practical application of scalable and sustainable information
security standards and practices.
