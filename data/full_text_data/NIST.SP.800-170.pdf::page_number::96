            The Federal Cloud Strategy, February 8, 2010,
         outlines a federal cloud computing program that
         identifies program objectives aimed at accelerating
         the adoption of cloud computing across the Federal
         Government. NIST, along with other agencies, was
         tasked with a key role and specific activities in support
         of that effort, including the delivery of the NIST Cloud
         Computing Technology Roadmap and the publication of
         other Special Publications that address the reference
         architecture, definitions, and security aspects of cloud
         computing. In order to achieve adoption of cloud
         computing for the Federal Government, it is necessary
         to address the security and privacy concerns that
         federal agencies have when migrating their services
         to a cloud environment. To further exacerbate the
         situation, there are few documented details that
         directly address how to achieve some security aspects
         in a cloud environment. The purpose of this document
         is to provide an overview of the high-priority security
         and privacy challenges perceived by federal agencies
         as impediments to the adoption of cloud computing.
         The document provides descriptions of the existing
         mitigations to these security and privacy impediments.
         If no mitigations are listed, then ongoing efforts that
         could lead to mitigations are described. In the cases
         where no ongoing efforts were identified, the document
         makes recommendations for possible mitigation or
         references existing best practices.
