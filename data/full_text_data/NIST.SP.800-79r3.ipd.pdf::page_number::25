      NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                       Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
      December 2023                                                              and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

740   provision under Sec. 2.7.2, one person MAY perform more than one role if needed. If an
741   organization has established multiple issuers, an individual MAY be assigned the same role in
742   several or all of them. For example, an issuing facility manager MAY be responsible for a
743   number of issuing facilities. Of the roles described, the SAO, DAO, EIMO, AR, assessor, and
744   PO SHALL be employees of the organization that owns the PCI or DPCI (e.g., federal
745   employees.)

746   2.7.10.          Assessment and Authorization Roles
747   Figure 2 illustrates a possible role structure when an issuer has multiple issuing facilities.

750   The SAO has the primary authority and responsibility for the organization. The EIMO and the
751   DAO report to the SAO. An issuing facility manager is responsible for managing operations at
752   each issuing facility and reports to the EIMO. The dotted lines leading to the PO and the assessor
753   indicate their independence from the day-to-day operations of the issuer. Depending on the
754   structure of the PCI or DPCI, operators MAY work at the issuing facilities under the supervision
755   and guidance of the issuing facility manager or MAY report directly to the EIMO.

756           Relationship Between SP 800-79 and SP 800-37
757   While authorization is the major topic of both SP 800-79 and [SP800-37], the goals of
758   authorization are different in each. Authorization compliant with [SP800-37], as mandated by
759   Appendix III of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, focuses on
760   authorizing the processing of information systems based on an assessment of security at the
761   information system level. An authorization decision granted under [SP800-37] signifies that an
762   organization official accepts responsibility for the security (i.e., the confidentiality, integrity, and
