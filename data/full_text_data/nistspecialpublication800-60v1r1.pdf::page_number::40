Information System Name: SCADA System [and Agency specific identifier]
Business and Mission Supported: The SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) system provides real-
time control and information supporting the main power plant. The power plant provides critical distribution of
electric power to the military installation.
Information Types
                     Sensor data monitoring the availability of energy for the Military installation and its soldiers
                     and command authority. This function includes control of distribution and transfer of power.
[D.7.1] Energy
                     The SCADA remote control capabilities can take action such as initiating necessary switching

                     actions to alleviate an overloading power condition. The impacts to this information and the
                     SCADA system may affect the installation’s critical infrastructures.
[C.2.8.12]General
                     The SCADA information system processes routine administrative information.

In addition, agencies may consider enhancing their SSPs with other analyses, decisions,
assignments, and or approvals that were used in the categorization process. Examples may
include:
    •     Agency’s business and mission areas (Step 1 in Table 1)
    •     Legislative and executive information mandates affecting the information impact
          assignment or adjustment (Section 4.1.3)
    •     Indicating whether the information is time-critical in rationales for assigning availability
          impact levels (Section 4.2.2.3)
    •     Rationales for assigning information to the General Information Type (Section 4.1.2,
          Implementation Tip)
    •     Results of reviews of the appropriateness of the provisional impact levels for information
          (Section 4.3)
