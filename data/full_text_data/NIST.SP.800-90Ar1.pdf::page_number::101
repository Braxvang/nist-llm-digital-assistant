NIST SP 800-90A Rev. 1                                        Recommendation for Random Number
                                                               Generation Using Deterministic RBGs


Algorithm Choices. The choice of block cipher algorithms and key sizes that may be used by
CTR_DRBG is discussed in Section 10.2.1.

C.4 Summary for DRBG Selection

Table C-1 provides a summary of the costs and constraints of the DRBG mechanisms in this
Recommendation.
