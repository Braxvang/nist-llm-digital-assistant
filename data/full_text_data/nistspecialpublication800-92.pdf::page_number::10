GUIDE TO COMPUTER SECURITY LOG MANAGEMENT



considerations over usability and resource usage, and also allows for better decision-making in some
cases. When establishing requirements and recommendations, organizations should strive to be flexible
since each system is different and will log different amounts of data than other systems.

The organization’s policies and procedures should also address the preservation of original logs. Many
organizations send copies of network traffic logs to centralized devices, as well as use tools that analyze
and interpret network traffic. In cases where logs may be needed as evidence, organizations may wish to
acquire copies of the original log files, the centralized log files, and interpreted log data, in case there are
any questions regarding the fidelity of the copying and interpretation processes. Retaining logs for
evidence may involve the use of different forms of storage and different processes, such as additional
restrictions on access to the records.

Organizations should prioritize log management appropriately throughout the organization.

After an organization defines its requirements and goals for the log management process, it should then
prioritize the requirements and goals based on the organization’s perceived reduction of risk and the
expected time and resources needed to perform log management functions. An organization should also
define roles and responsibilities for log management for key personnel throughout the organization,
including establishing log management duties at both the individual system level and the log management
infrastructure level.

Organizations should create and maintain a log management infrastructure.

A log management infrastructure consists of the hardware, software, networks, and media used to
generate, transmit, store, analyze, and dispose of log data. Log management infrastructures typically
perform several functions that support the analysis and security of log data. After establishing an initial
log management policy and identifying roles and responsibilities, an organization should next develop
one or more log management infrastructures that effectively support the policy and roles. Organizations
should consider implementing log management infrastructures that includes centralized log servers and
log data storage. When designing infrastructures, organizations should plan for both the current and
future needs of the infrastructures and the individual log sources throughout the organization. Major
factors to consider in the design include the volume of log data to be processed, network bandwidth,
online and offline data storage, the security requirements for the data, and the time and resources needed
for staff to analyze the logs.

Organizations should provide proper support for all staff with log management responsibilities.

To ensure that log management for individual systems is performed effectively throughout the
organization, the administrators of those systems should receive adequate support. This should include
disseminating information, providing training, designating points of contact to answer questions,
providing specific technical guidance, and making tools and documentation available.

Organizations should establish standard log management operational processes.

The major log management operational processes typically include configuring log sources, performing
log analysis, initiating responses to identified events, and managing long-term storage. Administrators
have other responsibilities as well, such as the following:

     Monitoring the logging status of all log sources
     Monitoring log rotation and archival processes
