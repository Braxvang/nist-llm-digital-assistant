GUIDE TO INTEGRATING FORENSIC TECHNIQUES INTO INCIDENT RESPONSE



The guidelines and procedures should support the admissibility of evidence into legal proceedings,
including information on gathering and handling evidence properly, preserving the integrity of tools and
equipment, maintaining the chain of custody, and storing evidence securely.7 Although it may not be
feasible to record every event or action taken in response to an incident, having a record of the major
events and actions taken helps ensure that nothing has been overlooked, and helps explain to others how
the incident was handled. This documentation can be useful for case management, report writing, and
testifying. Keeping a record of the dates and times that people worked on an incident, including the time
needed to recover systems, can also help calculate the costs of damages. Also, handling evidence in a
forensically sound manner puts decision makers in a position where they can confidently take the
necessary actions.

It is also important to maintain the guidelines and procedures once they are created so that they remain
accurate. Management should determine how frequently the guidelines and procedures should be
reviewed (generally, at least annually). Reviews should also be conducted whenever the teamâ€™s policies,
guidelines, and procedures undergo significant changes. When a guideline or procedure is updated, the
previous version should be archived for possible future use in legal proceedings. Guideline and procedure
reviews should include the same teams that participate in their creation. In addition to performing
reviews, organizations might choose to conduct exercises that help to validate the accuracy of certain
guidelines and procedures.

2.6     Recommendations

The key recommendations on establishing and organizing a forensic capability are as follows:

      ! Organizations should have a capability to perform computer and network forensics.
        Forensics is needed for various tasks within an organization, including investigating crimes and
        inappropriate behavior, reconstructing computer security incidents, troubleshooting operational
        problems, supporting due diligence for audit record maintenance, and recovering from accidental
        system damage. Without such a capability, an organization will have difficulty determining what
        events have occurred within its systems and networks, such as exposures of protected, sensitive
        data. Also, handling evidence in a forensically sound manner puts decision makers in a position
        where they can confidently take the necessary actions.
      ! Organizations should determine which parties should handle each aspect of forensics. Most
        organizations rely on a combination of their own staff and external parties to perform forensic
        tasks. Organizations should decide which parties should take care of which tasks based on skills
        and abilities, cost, response time, and data sensitivity.
      ! Incident handling teams should have robust forensic capabilities. More than one team
        member should be able to perform each typical forensic activity. Hands-on exercises and IT and
        forensic training courses can be helpful in building and maintaining skills, as can demonstrations
        of new tools and technologies.
      ! Many teams within an organization should participate in forensics. Individuals performing
        forensic actions should be able to reach out to other teams and individuals within an organization,
        as needed, for additional assistance. Examples of teams that may provide assistance in these
        efforts include IT professionals, management, legal advisors, human resources personnel,
        auditors, and physical security staff. Members of these teams should understand their roles and
