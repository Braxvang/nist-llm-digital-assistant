6.1.1.1.       Mapping Data Flows (ID.AM-3)
Data flow diagrams help a manufacturer understand the flow of data between networked
components. Documenting data flows enables organizations to understand the expected behavior
of their networks. This understanding of how devices communicate assists with troubleshooting
as well as response and recovery activities. This information can be leveraged during forensic
activities or used for analysis to identify anomalies.
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Organizations should consider the impact of the use of automated data
            flow mapping tools that use active scanning or require network
            monitoring tools (e.g., in-line network probes) on OT systems. Impacts
            could be due to the nature of the information, the volume of network
            traffic, or the momentary disconnection of manufacturing system
            components from the network. Consider using data flow mapping tools
            that utilize these methods during planned downtime.

6.1.1.2.     Network Architecture Documentation (Supports the Outcome of
       ID.AM)
Network architecture documentation tools help a manufacturer identify, document, and diagram
the interconnections between networked devices, corporate networks, and other external
connections. A comprehensive understanding of the interconnections within the environment is
critical for the successful deployment of cybersecurity controls. This information is equally
important for effective network monitoring.
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Network architecture documentation tools that use automated topology
            discovery technologies can only capture details from IP-based networked
            devices. Many OT environments contain isolated systems, components,
            or systems connected on non-IP networks. The OT environment may not
            be technically capable of using automated network architecture
            documentation tools, and manual processes may be required to document
            these components.
            Asset owners may also want to consider how automated scanning
            activities may potentially impact the OT system by testing automation
            tools in a non-production environment. Based on testing results, asset
            owners should consider utilizing automated OT network architecture
            documentation tools during planned downtime.
            Organizations may also want to consider physically inspecting OT
            network connections or analyzing network logs to document the OT
            network architecture, especially if the network is not large or
            complicated. Incorporating OT network activity monitoring may help
            organizations identify the addition or removal of devices within the
            environment between planned scanning activities.
