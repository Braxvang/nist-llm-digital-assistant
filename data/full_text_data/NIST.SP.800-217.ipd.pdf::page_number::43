       NIST SP 800-217 ipd                        Guidelines for PIV Federation (Initial Public Draft)
       January 2023


1153   source of the federation transaction through the proxy is appropriate for the PIV identity
1154   account in question.
1155   The proxy is not regarded as a home IdP for any RP in the system, even if the IdPs
1156   connecting in to the proxy are themselves home IdPs.

1157   A.6. FAL3 With a PIV Card
1158   The PIV Card and certain PKI-based derived PIV credentials can be used as IdP-managed
1159   bound authenticators for use at FAL3. The home IdP authenticates the PIV identity
1160   account using an authenticator bound to the account and then creates an assertion that
1161   is flagged as FAL3. The assertion also contains the certificate common name (CN) and
1162   thumbprint of the certificate to be used as a bound authenticator.
1163   When the RP receives the assertion, it processes it as usual and sees the FAL3 flag and
1164   the certificate attributes. The RP matches the CN against attributes in the RP Subscriber
1165   Account to ensure that the certificate being identified is appropriate for the PIV identity
1166   account being represented. The RP then prompts the subscriber to authenticate using a
1167   certificate and compares that certificate against the provided CN and thumbprint, ensuring
1168   that they match. When the certificate has been validated, the RP creates a secure session
1169   at FAL3. From this point forward in the session, the RP no longer requires presentation of
1170   the certificate in order to access the RPâ€™s services.

1171   A.7. FAL3 With an RP-Bound Authenticator
1172   The home IdP authenticates the PIV identity account using an authenticator bound to the
1173   account, and then creates an assertion that is flagged as FAL3 and using an RP-bound
1174   authenticator.
1175   When the RP receives the assertion, it processes it as usual and sees the FAL3 flag. The
1176   RP looks up the bound authenticator associated with the RP Subscriber Account and
1177   prompts the subscriber for this authenticator. When the authenticator has been verified,
1178   the RP creates a secure session at FAL3.
