Level 1   :   End-of-Course Evaluations (Student Satisfaction)


  A common term for this type of evaluation is "the 'Smiley Face' evaluation." Likert Scale-
  type forms ask the student to check a range of options from "poor" to "excellent" (or vice
  versa) to indicate how he/she felt about the class, the computer-based courseware, or whatever
  the learning activity was.     The response data is an indicator of how the learning activity is
  received by the student.      The responses also reveal if the conditions for learning were correct.
  Some of the questions in this level of evaluation ask about the student's satisfaction with the
  training facility and instructor (if classroom training), the manner of presentation of the
  content, and whether or not course objectives were met in relation to the student's
  expectations. Although this type of evaluation does not provide in-depth data, it does provide
  rapid feedback from the learner's perspective.


  Measurement of training effectiveness depends on an understanding of the background and
  skill level of the training audience.   For example, technical training provided to an audience of
  systems analysts and programmers will have a different level of effect than that provided to an
  audience of accountants. Basic demographic data may be collected at either course
  commencement or conclusion, but information regarding the learners' satisfaction with the
  course and course material should be collected at the end of the course.


Level 2: Behavior Objective Testing (Learning and Teaching Effectiveness)


  This level of evaluation measures how much information or skill was transmitted from the,
  training activity to the learner.   The evaluation should be in various formats relative to the
  level of training. In an IT Security Basics and Literacy course, for example, participants could
  be given a pre-test and a post-test of multiple choice items or fill-in-the-blank statements. At
  an intermediate or advanced training level, participants should be given some sort of
  performance test, such as a case study to solve. At the education level, essay questions
  exploring concepts would be appropriate. The evaluation format must relate back to the
  behavioral objectives of the learning activity which, in turn, drive the content being presented.
  The Level 2 evaluation also provides instant feedback, but it is more objective than a Level 1
  evaluation: it assesses how much the student remembered or demonstrated by skill
                                             â€”
  performance by the end of the program not how he/she felt about it. As previously noted.
  Level 2 evaluation can be built into each block of instruction and does not need to wait until
  the end of a course.


  A Level 2 evaluation measures success in transference of information and skills to the student.
  It enables the evaluator to determine if a given student    may need to repeat the course, or
   perhaps attend a different type of learning activity presenting the same material in a different
   format.     The evaluator should be able to see if a pattern of transference problems emerges, and
   determine whether or not the course itself may need to be reconfigured or perhaps dropped
   from an organization's training program.
