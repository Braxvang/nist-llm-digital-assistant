Special Publication 800-79-2                                 Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card Issuers
                                                                              and Derived PIV Credential Issuers



Unlike for a PIV Card Issuer, not all issuer controls are applicable to a Derived PIV Credential
Issuer. Certain issuer controls are applicable to only Level of Assurance 3 (LOA-3) or to only
LOA-4 Derived PIV Credentials and therefore must be implemented by the issuer only if they
are issuing that level of a Derived PIV Credential. This is represented via the “applicability”
column within Table G.2 for DPCIs as seen in Table 3. Controls with an applicability column
marked with DPCI (e.g., without LOA-4 or 3 postfix) applies to both LOA-3 and LOA-4
Derived PIV Credential.

All issuer controls apply, regardless of an individual system’s FIPS 199 Standards for Security
Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems [FIPS199] impact level.
Furthermore, nothing precludes an issuer from implementing additional controls to ensure a
higher level of confidence in mitigating risks associated with issuing PIV Cards or Derived PIV
Credentials.

3.2 Implementing Issuer Controls

Each issuer control must be properly implemented, managed, and monitored in order for the
issuer to be authorized. Depending on how an organization decides to implement their [HSPD-
12] program, the authority to implement some of the controls may not directly come under the
management of the issuer organization (due to outsourcing of certain PIV processes or using the
issuing facilities of other organizations). However, it is still the responsibility of the
management of the issuer organization to ensure that these issuer controls are being deployed,
enforced, and maintained by its service provider.

3.2.1 Issuer Controls implemented at the Organization or Facility Level
The nature of each issuer control dictates where it is implemented. Controls that are common to
or impact multiple PIV processes are implemented at the organization level. The development of
the operations plan is an example of an issuer control implemented at the organizational level.
Generally, controls specific to a process are implemented at the issuing facility where that
process or function is carried out. For example, the control that states that a “1:1 biometric match
of the applicant against the biometric included in the PIV Card or in the PIV enrollment record
