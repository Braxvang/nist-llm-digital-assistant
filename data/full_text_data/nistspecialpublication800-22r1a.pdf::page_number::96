A STATISTICAL TEST SUITE FOR RANDOM AND PSEUDORANDOM NUMBER GENERATORS FOR CRYPTOGRAPHIC APPLICATIONS



5.3   How to Get Started

To setup a copy of the NIST test code on a workstation, follow the instructions below.

       • Copy the sts.tar file into the root directory. Use the instruction, tar -xvf sts.tar, to
         unbundle the source code.

       • Six subdirectories and one file should have been created. The subdirectories are:
         data/, experiments/, include/, obj/, src/ and templates/. The file is makefile.

       • The data/ subdirectory is reserved for pre-existing RNG data files that are under
         investigation. Currently, two formats are supported, i.e., data files consisting of
         ASCII zeroes and ones, and binary data files.

       • The experiments/ subdirectory will be the repository of the empirical results for the
         statistical tests. Several subdirectories should be contained in it. These include
         AlgorithmTesting/, BBS/, CCG/, G-SHA1/, LCG/, MODEXP/, MS/, QCG1/,
         QCG2/, and XOR/. All but the first of these subdirectories is meant to store the
         results for the corresponding PRNG. The AlgorithmTesting/ subdirectory is the
         default subdirectory for empirical results corresponding to RNG data stored in the
         data/ subdirectory.

       • The include/ subdirectory contains the header files for the statistical tests, pseudo-
         random number generators, and associated routines.

       • The obj/ subdirectory contains the object files corresponding to the statistical tests,
         pseudo random number generators and other associated routines.

       • The src/ subdirectory contains the source codes for each of the statistical tests.

       • The templates/ subdirectory contains a series of non-periodic templates for varying
         block sizes that are utilized by the NonOverlapping Templates statistical test.

       • User prescribed modifications may be introduced in several files. This will be
         discussed subsequently in Section 5.5.2 and Appendix A.

       • Edit the makefile. Modify the following lines:
             (a) CC (your ANSI C compiler)
             (b) ROOTDIR (the root directory that was prescribed earlier in the process, e.g.,
                 rng/)

       • Now execute makefile. An executable file named assess should appear in the project
         directory.

       • The data may now be evaluated. Type the following: assess <sequenceLength>, e.g.,
         assess 1000000.

       Follow the menu prompts.
