information to be moderate or high. Particularly during fire season, the availability of land
management information critical to fire-fighting operations can affect the safety of human life
and large-scale property damage. Such information can have a high availability impact level.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
most conservation, marine, and land management information is low.

D.6.3 Recreational Resource Management and Tourism Information Type

Recreational Resource Management and Tourism involves the management of national parks,
monuments, and tourist attractions as well as visitor centers, campsites, and park service
facilities. Impacts to some information and information systems associated with tourism
management may affect the security of some key national assets (e.g., some national monuments
and icons). The recommended provisional categorization of the recreational resource
management and tourism information type follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of recreational resource
management and tourism information on the ability of responsible agencies to manage national
parks, monuments, and tourist attractions as well as visitor centers, campsites, and park service
facilities. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of most recreational resource
management and tourism information would have a limited adverse effect on agency operations,
agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Recreational resource management
and tourism include enforcement functions (e.g., protective and enforcement functions of the
National Park Service). Confidentiality impacts associated with criminal apprehension, criminal
investigation and surveillance, citizen protection, and property protection may cause the
confidentiality impact of enforcement-related information to be moderate or high. The
consequences of unauthorized disclosure of property and tourist protection information can be
particularly severe in the case of protection of national monuments and icons.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for most recreational resource management and tourism information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of recreational resource management
and tourism information depends on whether the information is time-critical. Unauthorized
modification or destruction of information affecting external communications associated with
recreational resource management and tourism information (e.g., web pages, electronic mail)
may adversely affect operations and/or public confidence in the agency, but the damage to the
mission would usually be limited.
