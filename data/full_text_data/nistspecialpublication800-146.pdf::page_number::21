                                                            CLOUD COMPUTING SYNOPSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



The various cloud deployment models in the NIST cloud definition have implications for the locations of
consumer-controlled security perimeters and hence for the level of control that consumers can exercise
over resources that they entrust to a cloud.




                                      Figure 2: The Security Perimeter

The NIST cloud definition lists four deployment models: private, community, public, and hybrid. The
private and community deployment models, however, admit of two variants that should be discussed
separately because they affect the security perimeter: on-site, and outsourced. The hybrid deployment
model is a combination of the others and therefore a hybrid deployment may be subject to the
implications of all of its building blocks as well as unique implications that arise when multiple systems
are composed into more complex integrated systems.

4.2   The On-site Private Cloud Scenario

Figure 3 presents a simple view of an on-site private cloud. As shown in the figure, the security perimeter
extends around both the consumer's on-site resources and the private cloud's resources. The private cloud
may be centralized at a single consumer site or may be distributed over several consumer sites. The
security perimeter will exist only if the consumer implements it. If implemented, the security perimeter
will not guarantee control over the private cloud's resources, but its existence gives an opportunity for a
consumer to exercise control over resources entrusted to the on-site private cloud.
