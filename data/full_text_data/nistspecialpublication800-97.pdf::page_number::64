ESTABLISHING WIRELESS ROBUST SECURITY NETWORKS: A GUIDE TO IEEE 802.11I



5.4     Authentication Phase

Upon successful completion of the discovery phase, the STA and AP enter the second phase in the
establishment of an RSNA: the authentication phase. This phase provides the means for a STA to prove
its identity to the WLAN. This security service is critical for preventing unauthorized access to network
resources. In an infrastructure WLAN, authentication provides protection against unauthorized users in
the DS, since the AP is the entry point into the ESS. Improper authentication can undermine all security
measures in an enterprise. Mutual authentication also allows the WLAN to prove its identity to the STA,
which allows the STA to validate positively that it is communicating with a legitimate WLAN, as
opposed to an unauthorized or “rogue” WLAN.

Figure 5-9 depicts the concept of authentication that occurs during this phase. As shown, the
authentication occurs between the STA and the AS, which is located in the DS. This authentication
procedure is designed to disallow all stations from using the network except for those that are explicitly
authorized to do so. It also provides a level of confidence to the STA’s user that the STA is
communicating with the legitimate network.

5.4.1    The IEEE 802.1X Framework: Port-Based Access Control

As described in Section 3, the IEEE 802.11 standard uses the IEEE 802.1X standard to provide mutual
authentication between STAs and ASs. IEEE 802.1X is a general-purpose, extensible framework for
authenticating users. The actual authentication mechanism incorporated into the framework is
implemented by the STA and the AS using EAP. EAP provides a framework that allows the use of
multiple methods for achieving authentication, including static passwords, dynamic passwords (e.g., one-
time passwords, token generators), and public key cryptography certificates (on the AS only or on both
the AS and STAs). Dozens of standard and proprietary EAP methods exist; Section 6 provides more
information on the most commonly used ones.

IEEE 802.1X authentication has three main components: a client (also known as a supplicant), an
authenticator, and an AS. The authenticator simply passes authentication traffic between the client and
AS. IEEE 802.1X controls the flow of data between the DS and STAs by use of a controlled/uncontrolled
port model. EAP authentication occurs through the IEEE 802.1X uncontrolled port on the authenticator;
non-EAP data frames are passed or blocked via the IEEE 802.1X controlled port, depending upon the
success or failure of IEEE 802.1X authentication (which includes EAP). This model is known as port-
