1226           Using an RBG1 Construction with Subordinate DRBGs (Sub-DRBGs)
1227   Figure 15 depicts an example of the use of optional subordinate DRBGs (sub-DRBGs) within the
1228   security boundary of an RBG1 construction. The RBG1 construction is used as the randomness
1229   source to provide separate outputs to instantiate each of its sub_DRBGs.

1231                                 Fig. 15. RBG1 Construction with Sub-DRBGs

1232   The RBG1 construction and each of its sub-DRBGs shall be implemented as separate physical or
1233   logical entities (see Figure 15).
1234       •   When implemented as separate physical entities, the DRBG algorithms used by the RBG1
1235           construction and a sub-DRBG shall be the same DRBG algorithm (e.g., the RBG1
1236           construction and all of its sub_DRBGs use HMAC_DRBG and SHA-256).
1237       •   When implemented as separate logical entities, the same software or hardware
1238           implementation of a DRBG algorithm is used but with a different internal state for each
1239           logical entity (e.g., the RBG1 construction has an internal state whose state handle is
1240           RBG1_state_handle, while the state handle for Sub-DRBG 1’s internal state is sub-
1241           DRBG1_state_handle).
1242   The sub-DRBGs have the following characteristics:
1243       1. A sub-DRBG cannot be reseeded or provide prediction resistance.
1244       2. Sub-DRBG outputs are considered outputs from the RBG1 construction.
1245       3. The security strength that can be provided by a sub-DRBG is no more than the security
1246          strength of its randomness source (i.e., the RBG1 construction).
1247       4. Each sub-DRBG has restrictions on its use (e.g., the number of outputs) as specified for its
1248          DRBG algorithm in [SP800-90A].
1249       5. Sub-DRBGs cannot provide output with full entropy.
1250       6. The number of sub-DRBGs that can be instantiated by a RBG1 construction is limited only
1251          by practical considerations associated with the implementation or application.
