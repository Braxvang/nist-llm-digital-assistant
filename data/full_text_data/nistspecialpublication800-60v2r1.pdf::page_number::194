individuals. The basic nature of this information type is to support the public and consumer
market with information and supporting education.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: The most serious adverse effects are
likely to involve premature release of health planning and management information, disclosure
of sensitive mission support information [agenciesâ€™ means to combat spread of diseases or
reacting to terrorist attacks on food, water, and other public consumables], or the exposure of
information that is proprietary to an organization being evaluated by the agency [Unauthorized
disclosure of some information can have serious economic impact on both individual companies
and the broader market place. The consequences of such unauthorized disclosures may have an
adverse effect on public confidence in the agency.] This can result in assignment of a moderate
impact level to such information.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for disclosure of Health Management and Consumer Safety information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of population health management and
consumer safety information can be serious if the public is exposed to mislabeled, tainted, or
otherwise harmful food, drugs, or consumer products.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Impacts to some population health
management and consumer safety information and supporting information systems associated
with quality assurance of food, animal, plant and pharmaceuticals may affect the security of
critical agriculture and food and public health infrastructures. Additionally, unauthorized
modification or destruction of information affecting external communications (e.g., web pages,
electronic mail) may adversely affect operations and public confidence in the agency and the
agency mission. In such cases, unauthorized modification or destruction of information can result
in loss of human life. This can result in assignment of a high impact level to such information.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
population health management and consumer safety information is moderate.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish population health management and consumer
safety. Population health management and consumer safety are generally tolerant of delay.
Typically, disruption of population health management and consumer safety information can be
expected to have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or
individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Delays in the communication of product
deficiencies or issues associated with food, plant and animal sources may be life threatening.
Delays in agency response to public health issues involving humans, animals, animal products,
