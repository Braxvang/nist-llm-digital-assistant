Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: In the case of Secret Service operations,
missions supported by leadership protection information are not tolerant of delays with resultant
catastrophic consequences for mission capability and human life. In such cases, the availability
impact level is high.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
most leadership protection information is low.

D.16.5 Property Protection Information Type

Property protection entails all activities performed to ensure the security of civilian and
government property. The recommended provisional categorization of the property protection
information type follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of property protection
information on the ability of responsible agencies to ensure the security of civilian and
government property. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of property protection
information are generally dependent on the nature of the property being protected. Where the
property being protected is neither critical to agency operations nor of such value that its loss
would degrade mission capability or place the agency at a significant disadvantage, unauthorized
disclosure would have a limited adverse effect.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Where critical infrastructure facilities
or key national assets are being protected, the consequences of unauthorized disclosure of
property protection information might reveal vulnerabilities in protection measures to terrorists
or other adversaries. Where unauthorized disclosure of property protection information
associated with critical infrastructures, large groups of people, or key national assets is expected
to be of direct use to terrorists, the confidentiality impact level is high.

Most protected facilities are not part of national security, the critical infrastructure, or key
national asset categories. If unauthorized disclosure of property protection information resulted
in damage to these facilities, serious adverse effects on agency operations and assets could
reasonably be expected to result. This can result in assignment of a moderate or high impact
level to such information.

Where the property being protected involves classified information, the property protection
information itself might be classified. Some examples include command and control and other
military facilities, foreign intelligence collection or processing facilities, weapons or weapons
facilities, and cryptographic activities. National security information is outside the scope of this
guideline.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for property protection information is low.
