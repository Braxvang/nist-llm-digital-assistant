     Access Control and Privilege Management

        ªªAccess Control and Privilege
             Management Research
   With the advance of current computing technologies and
 the diverse environments in which these technologies are
 used, security issues, such as situational awareness, trust
 management, preservation of privacy in access control, and
 privilege management systems, are becoming increasingly
 complex. Practical and conceptual guidance for these topics is
 needed.
   In FY 2013, the following research was accomplished for this
                                                                               Figure 12: Access Control and Privilege Management
