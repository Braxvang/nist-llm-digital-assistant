            often receive the highest priority for shipment. The details of these negotiations should be
            documented in the SLA, which should be maintained with the contingency plan.
           Equipment Inventory. Required equipment may be purchased in advance and stored at a secure
            offsite location, such as an alternate site where recovery operations will take place (warm or
            mobile site) or at another location where they will be stored and then shipped to the alternate site.
            This solution has certain drawbacks. An organization must commit financial resources to
            purchase this equipment in advance, and the equipment could become obsolete or unsuitable for
            use over time because system technologies and requirements change.
           Existing Compatible Equipment. Equipment currently housed and used by the contracted hot
            site or by another organization within the organization may be used. Agreements made with hot
            sites and reciprocal internal sites stipulate that similar and compatible equipment will be available
            for contingency use by the organization.

 When evaluating the choices, the ISCP Coordinator should consider that purchasing equipment when
 needed is cost-effective but can add significant overhead time to recovery while waiting for shipment and
 setup; conversely, storing unused equipment is costly, but allows recovery operations to begin more
 quickly. When selecting the most appropriate strategy, note that the availability of transportation may be
 limited or temporarily halted in the event of a catastrophic disaster. Based on impacts discovered through
 the BIA, consideration should be given to the possibility of a widespread disaster entailing mass
 equipment replacement and transportation delays that would extend the recovery period. Regardless of
 the strategy selected, detailed lists of equipment needs and specifications should be maintained within the
 contingency plan. Documentation of equipment lists is discussed further in Section 4.1.

 3.4.5      Cost Considerations

 The ISCP Coordinator should ensure that the strategy chosen can be implemented effectively with
 available personnel and financial resources. The cost of each type of alternate site, equipment
 replacement, and storage option under consideration should be weighed against budget limitations. The
 coordinator should determine known contingency planning expenses, such as alternate site contract fees,
 and those that are less obvious, such as the cost of implementing an agency-wide contingency awareness
 program and contractor support. The budget must be sufficient to encompass software, hardware, travel
 and shipping, testing, plan training programs, awareness programs, labor hours, other contracted services,
 and any other applicable resources (e.g., desks, telephones, fax machines, pens, and paper). The
 organization should perform a cost-benefit analysis to identify the optimum contingency strategy. Table
 provides a template for evaluating cost considerations.
