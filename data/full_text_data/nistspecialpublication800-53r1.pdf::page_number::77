AU-9      PROTECTION OF AUDIT INFORMATION

          Control: The information system protects audit information and audit tools from unauthorized
          access, modification, and deletion.
          Supplemental Guidance: Audit information includes all information (e.g., audit records, audit
          settings, and audit reports) needed to successfully audit information system activity.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The information system produces audit records on hardware-enforced, write-once media.


           LOW AU-9                      MOD AU-9                  HIGH AU-9



AU-10     NON-REPUDIATION

          Control: The information system provides the capability to determine whether a given individual
          took a particular action.
          Supplemental Guidance: Examples of particular actions taken by individuals include creating
          information, sending a message, approving information (e.g., indicating concurrence or signing a
          contract), and receiving a message. Non-repudiation protects against later false claims by an
          individual of not having taken a specific action. Non-repudiation protects individuals against later
          claims by an author of not having authored a particular document, a sender of not having
          transmitted a message, a receiver of not having received a message, or a signatory of not having
          signed a document. Non-repudiation services can be used to determine if information originated
          from an individual, or if an individual took specific actions (e.g., sending an email, signing a
          contract, approving a procurement request) or received specific information. Non-repudiation
          services are obtained by employing various techniques or mechanisms (e.g., digital signatures,
          digital message receipts, time stamps).
          Control Enhancements: None.


           LOW Not Selected              MOD Not Selected          HIGH Not Selected



AU-11     AUDIT RECORD RETENTION

          Control: The organization retains audit records for [Assignment: organization-defined time period]
          to provide support for after-the-fact investigations of security incidents and to meet regulatory and
          organizational information retention requirements.
          Supplemental Guidance: The organization retains audit records until it is determined that they are no
          longer needed for administrative, legal, audit, or other operational purposes. This includes, for
          example, retention and availability of audit records relative to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)
          requests, subpoena, and law enforcement actions. Standard categorizations of audit records
          relative to such types of actions and standard response processes for each type of action are
          developed and disseminated. NIST Special Publication 800-61 provides guidance on computer
          security incident handling and audit record retention.
          Control Enhancements: None.
