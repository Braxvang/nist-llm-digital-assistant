                                       GUIDE TO TEST, TRAINING, AND EXERCISE PROGRAMS FOR IT PLANS AND CAPABILITIES



Executive Summary

Organizations have information technology (IT) plans in place, such as contingency and computer
security incident response plans, so that they can respond to and manage adverse situations involving IT.
These plans should be maintained in a state of readiness, which should include having personnel trained
to fulfill their roles and responsibilities within a plan, having plans exercised to validate their content, and
having systems and system components tested to ensure their operability in an operational environment
specified in a plan. These three types of events can be carried out efficiently and effectively through the
development and implementation of a test, training, and exercise (TT&E) program. Organizations should
consider having such a program in place because tests, training, and exercises are so closely related. For
example, exercises and tests offer different ways of identifying deficiencies in IT plans, procedures, and
training.

This document provides guidance on designing, developing, conducting, and evaluating TT&E events so
that organizations can improve their ability to prepare for, respond to, manage, and recover from adverse
events that may affect their missions. The scope of this document is limited to TT&E events for single
organizations, as opposed to large-scale events involving multiple organizations, involving internal IT
operational procedures for emergencies. This document does not address TT&E for a specific type of IT
plan; rather, the TT&E methodology described in this document can be applied to TT&E events built
around any IT plan or around an IT emergency-handling capability that is not necessarily documented in a
plan, such as computer security incident response.

As part of creating a comprehensive TT&E program, a TT&E plan should be developed that outlines the
steps to be taken. The TT&E plan should define the organization’s roadmap for ensuring a viable
capability, and outline the organization’s approach to maintaining plans, as well as enhancing and
managing the capability. Enhancing emergency plans, policies, and procedures will promote more
efficient utilization of capabilities in responding to cyber attacks. In addition, the TT&E plan should
identify resource and budget requirements that enable organizations to achieve an effective, proven
capability, and provide a schedule for conducting various types of TT&E events. Creating the TT&E
program should also involve several other steps, including developing a TT&E policy, identifying roles
and responsibilities, and documenting a TT&E event methodology.

The TT&E program should include several types of events to ensure the availability of a wide range of
methods for validating various planning elements in the context of cyber incidents. The types of events
covered in this guide are as follows:

     Tests. 1 Tests are evaluation tools that use quantifiable metrics to validate the operability of an IT
      system or system component in an operational environment specified in an IT plan. For example,
      an organization could test if call tree cascades can be executed within prescribed time limits;
      another test would be removing power from a system or system component. A test is conducted
      in as close to an operational environment as possible; if feasible, an actual test of the components
      or systems used to conduct daily operations for the organization should be used. The scope of
      testing can range from individual system components or systems to comprehensive tests of all
      systems and components that support an IT plan. Tests often focus on recovery and backup
      operations; however, testing varies depending on the goal of the test and its relation to a specific
      IT plan.

    Many people use the terms “test” and “exercise” interchangeably, such as “performing testing through exercises”. However,
    there are distinctions between the two terms. For the purpose of this document, the term “test” is reserved for testing
    systems or system components; it is not used to describe “exercising” plans.
