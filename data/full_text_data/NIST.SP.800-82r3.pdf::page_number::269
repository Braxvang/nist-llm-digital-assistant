NIST SP 800-82r3                                               Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security

F.7.7. IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION â€“ IA
Tailoring Considerations for the Identification and Authentication Family
Before implementing controls in the IA family, consider the trade-offs among security, privacy,
latency, performance, and throughput. For example, the organization considers whether latency
induced from the use of authentication mechanisms that employ cryptography would adversely
impact the operational performance of the OT.
When the OT cannot support the specific identification and authentication requirements of a
control, the organization employs compensating controls in accordance with the general tailoring
guidance. Examples of compensating controls are given with each control as appropriate.

OT Discussion: When shared accounts are required, compensating controls include providing
increased physical security, personnel security, and auditing measures. For certain OT, the
capability for immediate operator interaction is critical. Local emergency actions for OT are not
hampered by identification or authentication requirements. Access to these systems may be
restricted by appropriate physical controls.
Control Enhancement: (1) (2) OT Discussion: As a compensating control, physical access
restrictions may sufficiently represent one authentication factor, provided that the system is not
remotely accessible.
Control Enhancement: (5) OT Discussion: For local access, physical access controls and logging
may be used as an alternative to individual authentication on an OT system. For remote access,
