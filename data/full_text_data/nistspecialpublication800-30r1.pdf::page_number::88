                                                              If the relevance of the threat event does not meet the organization’s criteria for further
                                                              consideration, do not complete the remaining columns.
        7      Likelihood of Attack Initiation                Determine likelihood that one or more of the threat sources initiates the threat event, taking into
                                                              consideration capability, intent, and targeting. (Task 2-4; Table G-1; Table G-2; Table I-5.)
        8      Vulnerabilities and                            Identify vulnerabilities which could be exploited by threat sources initiating the threat event and
               Predisposing Conditions                        the predisposing conditions which could increase the likelihood of adverse impacts. (Task 2-5;
                                                              Table F-1; Table F-3; Table F-4; Table F-6; Table I-5.)
        9      Severity                                       Assess severity of vulnerabilities and pervasiveness of predisposing conditions. (Task 2-5;
               Pervasiveness                                  Table F-1; Table F-2; Table F-5; Table F-6; Table I-5.)
     10        Likelihood Initiated Attack                    Determine the likelihood that the threat event, once initiated, will result in adverse impact,
               Succeeds                                       taking into consideration threat source capability, vulnerabilities, and predisposing conditions.
                                                              (Task 2-4; Table G-1; Table G-4; Table I-5.)
     11        Overall Likelihood                             Determine the likelihood that the threat event will be initiated and result in adverse impact (i.e.,
                                                              combination of likelihood of attack initiation and likelihood that initiated attack succeeds). (Task

     12        Level of Impact                                Determine the adverse impact (i.e., potential harm to organizational operations, organizational
                                                              assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation) from the threat event. (Task 2-5; Table
