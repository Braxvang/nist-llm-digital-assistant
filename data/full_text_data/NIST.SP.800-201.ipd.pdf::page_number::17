      NIST SP 800-201 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                  Cloud Computing Forensic
      February 2023                                                                  Reference Architecture

476       Overview of CSA’s Enterprise Architecture
477   The Cloud Security Alliance’s Enterprise Architecture (CSA’s EA) [2] is both a methodology
478   and a set of tools that enable security architects, enterprise architects, and risk management
479   professionals to leverage a common set of solutions and controls. These solutions and controls
480   fulfill common requirements that risk managers must assess regarding the operational status of
481   internal IT security and cloud provider controls. These controls are expressed in terms of security
482   capabilities and designed to create a common roadmap to meet the security needs of businesses.
483   CSA designed the EA understanding that business requirements must guide the architecture. In
484   the case of the Enterprise Architecture, these requirements come from a controls matrix partly
485   driven by regulations such as Sarbanes-Oxley [17] and Gramm-Leach-Bliley [18], standards
486   frameworks such as ISO-27002 [7], the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards [19],
487   and the IT Audit Frameworks such as COBIT [20], all in the context of cloud service delivery
488   models such as software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a
489   service (IaaS).
490   From these requirements, a set of security capabilities have been defined and organized
491   according to the following best practice architecture frameworks. The Sherwood Applied
492   Business Security Architecture (SABSA) [12] defines a security model from a business
493   perspective. The Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) [11] specifies the schema
494   needed to manage a company’s IT services, including the security guidelines to manage those
495   services securely. The Jericho Forum [21] designates technical security specifications that arise
496   from the reality of traditional technology environments in the data center and shift to one where
497   solutions span the internet across multiple data centers, some owned by the business and some
498   purely used as outsourced services. Lastly, The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF)
499   [13] provides an enterprise architecture framework and methodology for planning, designing,
500   and governing information architectures, concluding in a common framework to integrate the
501   work of the security architect with the enterprise architecture of an organization.
502   The CSA EA is reproduced in Appendix C, and the domains covered are:
503       1. Business Operation Support Services (BOSS) – These functional capabilities are
504          associated with cloud IT services that support an organization’s business needs. BOSS
505          embodies the direction of the business and objectives of the cloud consumer. BOSS
506          capabilities cover compliance, data governance, operational risk management, human
507          resources security, security monitoring, internal investigations, and legal services.
508       2. Information Technology Operation and Support (ITOS) – These functional capabilities
509          are associated with managing the cloud IT services of an organization. ITOS capabilities
510          cover IT operation, service delivery, and service support.
511       3. Security and Risk Management (S&RM) – These functional capabilities are associated
512          with safeguarding cloud IT assets and detecting, assessing, and monitoring cloud IT risks.
513          S&RM capabilities cover identity and access management, GRC (governance, risk
514          management, and compliance), policies and standards, threat and vulnerability
515          management, and infrastructure and data protection.
516       4. Presentation Services – These functional capabilities are associated with the end user
517          interacting with a cloud IT solution. The capabilities cover presentation modalities and
518          presentation platforms (including end points, handwriting, and speech recognition).
