GUIDE TO COMPUTER SECURITY LOG MANAGEMENT



System-level and infrastructure administrators have other responsibilities as well, such as ensuring that
old logs are destroyed when no longer needed, in compliance with the organization’s logging, data
retention, and media sanitization policies. They also need to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and
availability of logs on systems, in storage, and in transit. Another duty is to provide ongoing support for
systems’ logging operations, such as monitoring logging status, monitoring log rotation and archival
processes, and acquiring, testing, and deploying updates to logging software.

Organizations need to decide how to divide log analysis duties between the system level and the
infrastructure level, and then provide adequate support to the administrators so that log management is
performed effectively throughout the organization. When determining how to divide analysis
responsibilities, organizations should focus on the relative importance of different types of entries and the
context necessary to understand each log entry’s true meaning. The key to performing analysis is
understanding the typical activity associated with each system. The most effective way to gain this
understanding is to review and analyze portions of the log data every day. Daily log entries should
include those entries that have been deemed most likely to be important, as well as some of the entries
that are not yet fully understood. Understanding typical log entries is also helpful in configuring
automated filtering of log entries. To assist in focusing attention on the most important log entries,
organizations should consider assigning their own priorities to each log entry based on a combination of
several factors.

System-level administrators need to perform analysis of their log data in essentially the same way as
infrastructure administrators. System-level administrators usually perform analysis for log entries that are
not sent to the infrastructure, as well as entries that cannot be understood without context that is only
available at the system level. When administrators performing analysis find an event of significance, they
should follow the organization’s incident response procedures to ensure it is addressed appropriately, or
perform their own response if it is a non-incident event, such as a minor operational problem.
Administrators should be prepared to alter their logging configurations as part of a response, either to
prevent an event from overwhelming the system and its logs, or to collect additional information on an
event.

Organizations should perform testing and validation activities periodically to confirm that that the
organization’s logging policies, processes, and procedures are being followed both at the infrastructure
level and the system level throughout the organization. Organizations should also review the design of
the log management infrastructure periodically and implement changes as needed. Periodic reviews of
log management processes and procedures should also be conducted so that log management continues to
be effective at detecting the latest threats in changing environments.
