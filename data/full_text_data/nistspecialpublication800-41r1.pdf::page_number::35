5.      Firewall Planning and Implementation

This section focuses on the planning and implementation of firewalls in the enterprise. As with any new
technology deployment, firewall planning and implementation should be addressed in a phased approach.
A successful firewall deployment can be achieved by following a clear, step-by-step planning and
implementation process. The use of a phased approach for deployment can minimize unforeseen issues
and identify potential pitfalls early on. This section explores in depth each of the firewall planning and
implementation phases, including:

1. Plan. The first phase of the process involves identifying all requirements that an organization should
   consider when determining which firewall to implement to enforce the organization’s security policy.
2. Configure. The second phase involves all facets of configuring the firewall platform. This includes
   installing hardware and software as well as setting up rules for the system.
3. Test. The next phase involves implementing and testing a prototype of the designed solution in a lab
   or test environment. The primary goals of testing are to evaluate the functionality, performance,
   scalability, and security of the solution, and to identify any issues—such as interoperability—with
   components.
4. Deploy. Once testing is completed and all issues are resolved, the next phase focuses on deployment
   of the firewall into the enterprise.
5. Manage. After the firewall has been deployed, it is managed throughout its lifecycle to include
   component maintenance and support for operational issues. This lifecycle process is repeated when
   enhancements or significant changes need to be incorporated into the solution.
5.1     Plan

The planning phase for choosing and implementing a firewall should begin only after an organization has
determined that a firewall is needed to enforce the organization’s security policy. This typically occurs
following a risk assessment of the overall system. A risk assessment includes (1) the identification of
threats and vulnerabilities in the information system; (2) the potential impact or magnitude of harm that a
loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability would have on the organization’s assets or operations
(including mission, function, image, or reputation) in the event of a threat exploitation of identified
vulnerabilities; and (3) the identification and analysis of security controls for the information system 20 .

Basic principles that organizations should follow in the planning of firewall deployments include:

 Use devices as they were intended to be used. Firewalls should not be constructed of equipment not
  meant for firewall use. For example, routers are meant to handle routing, not highly complex filtering,
  which can cause an excess burden on the router’s processor. Additionally, firewalls should not be
  expected to provide non-security services, such as acting as a web server or email server.
 Create defense-in-depth. Defense-in-depth involves creating multiple layers of security. This allows
  risk to be better managed, because if one layer of defense becomes compromised, another layer is
  there to contain the attack. In the case of firewalls, defense-in-depth can be accomplished by using
  multiple firewalls throughout an organization, including at the perimeter, in front of sensitive internal
  departments, and on individual computers. For defense-in-depth to be truly effective, firewalls should
