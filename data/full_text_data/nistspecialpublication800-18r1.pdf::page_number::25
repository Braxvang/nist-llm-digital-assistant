                    Guide for Developing Security Plans for Federal Information Systems


While the concept of security control partitioning into common security controls and
system-specific controls is straightforward and intuitive, the application of this principle
within an agency takes planning, coordination, and perseverance. If an agency is just
beginning to implement this approach or has only partially implemented this approach, it
may take some time to get the maximum benefits from security control partitioning and
the associated reuse of assessment evidence. Because of the potential dependence on
common security controls by many of an agency's information systems, a failure of such
common controls may result in a significant increase in agency-level riskâ€”risk that
arises from the operation of the systems that depend on these controls.
