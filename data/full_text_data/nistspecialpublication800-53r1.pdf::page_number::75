Special Publication 800-53, Revision 1               Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________

AU-3      CONTENT OF AUDIT RECORDS

          Control: The information system produces audit records that contain sufficient information to
          establish what events occurred, the sources of the events, and the outcomes of the events.
          Supplemental Guidance: Audit record content includes, for most audit records: (i) date and time of
          the event; (ii) the component of the information system (e.g., software component, hardware
          component) where the event occurred; (iii) type of event; (iv) user/subject identity; and (v) the
          outcome (success or failure) of the event. NIST Special Publication 800-92 provides guidance on
          computer security log management.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The information system provides the capability to include additional, more detailed information in
                the audit records for audit events identified by type, location, or subject.
          (2)   The information system provides the capability to centrally manage the content of audit records
                generated by individual components throughout the system.


           LOW AU-3                      MOD AU-3 (1)                HIGH AU-3 (1) (2)



AU-4      AUDIT STORAGE CAPACITY

          Control: The organization allocates sufficient audit record storage capacity and configures auditing
          to reduce the likelihood of such capacity being exceeded.
          Supplemental Guidance: The organization provides sufficient audit storage capacity, taking into
          account the auditing to be performed and the online audit processing requirements. Related
          security controls: AU-2, AU-5, AU-6, AU-7, SI-4.
          Control Enhancements: None.


           LOW AU-4                      MOD AU-4                    HIGH AU-4



AU-5      RESPONSE TO AUDIT PROCESSING FAILURES

          Control: The information system alerts appropriate organizational officials in the event of an audit
          processing failure and takes the following additional actions: [Assignment: organization-defined
          actions to be taken (e.g., shut down information system, overwrite oldest audit records, stop
          generating audit records)].
          Supplemental Guidance: Audit processing failures include, for example, software/hardware errors,
          failures in the audit capturing mechanisms, and audit storage capacity being reached or exceeded.
          Related security control: AU-4.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The information system provides a warning when allocated audit record storage volume reaches
                [Assignment: organization-defined percentage of maximum audit record storage capacity].
          (2)   The information system provides a real-time alert when the following audit failure events occur:
                [Assignment: organization-defined audit failure events requiring real-time alerts].


           LOW AU-5                      MOD AU-5                    HIGH AU-5 (1) (2)
