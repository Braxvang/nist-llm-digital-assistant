      NIST SP 800-63A-4 ipd                                                 Digital Identity Guidelines
      December 2022                                                   Enrollment and Identity Proofing


613   on the evidence or the attribute data objects. The CSP SHALL use the public key of
614   the issuing authority of the evidence to verify digitally signed evidence or attribute data
615   objects.

616   4.3.4.2. Attribute Validation
617   All core attributes, whether obtained from identity evidence or applicant self-assertion,
618   must be validated. This subsection provides guidance on acceptable methods for
619   validating evidence and collected attributes.

620   4.3.4.3. Evidence and Attribute Validation Methods
621   Acceptable methods for validating presented evidence include:
622       • Visual and tactile inspection by trained personnel for in-person identity proofing,
623       • Visual inspection by trained personnel for remote identity proofing,
624       • Automated document validation processes using appropriate technologies,
625       • Validation of attributes contained on the evidence with an authoritative or credible
626         source.
627       • Verification of the digital signature protecting digital evidence or attribute data
628         objects using the public key of the issuing authority of the evidence.

629   4.3.4.4. Validation Sources
630   Core attributes that are contained on identity evidence that has been validated according
631   to Sec. 4.3.4.1 can be considered validated, in which case no further validation is
632   required.
633   An authoritative source is an entity that can provide or validate the accuracy of
634   identity attribute information through one or more of the following characteristics. An
635   authoritative source:
636       • Is the original source of the identity attribute(s); or
637       • Is the issuer of identity evidence containing identity attribute information and
638         the issuer confirmed the claimed identity through documented identity proofing
639         processes that are subject to recurring oversight by regulatory or publicly
640         accountable institutions, such as the Customer Identification Program guidelines
641         established under the [PatriotAct]; or
642       • Collected and validated attribute information through an identity proofing process
643         that can confirm the claimed identity through direct interaction with individuals
644         (either in-person or remotely); or
645       • Has access to evidence and attribute information that can be traced to the issuing
646         source of a piece of identity evidence.
