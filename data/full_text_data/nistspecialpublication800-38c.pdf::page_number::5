                                          Abstract

This Recommendation defines a mode of operation, called CCM, for a symmetric key block
cipher algorithm. CCM may be used to provide assurance of the confidentiality and the
authenticity of computer data by combining the techniques of the Counter (CTR) mode and the
Cipher Block Chaining-Message Authentication Code (CBC-MAC) algorithm.

KEY WORDS: authenticated encryption; authentication; block cipher; confidentiality;
cryptography; encryption; information security; message authentication code; mode of operation.
