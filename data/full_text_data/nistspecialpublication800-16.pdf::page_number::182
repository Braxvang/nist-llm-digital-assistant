Information Technology Security Training Requirements



5.5   Summary

Evaluation is undertaken to measure the effectiveness of an agency's or organization's IT
security training program, i.e., the extent to which the overall program and its respective
components are either meaningful or a waste of the organization's limited training resources.
The employee (student) must be asked their view of each learning event (Level 1 and Level 2),
the supervisor their view of the event (Level 3), and the organization its view of the event (Level
4) in relation to return on investment. In this process, both quantitative and qualitative data will
be collected. At Levels 3 and 4, data collection will be longitudinal. As important as it is for the
evaluator to collect the raw data, analysis and application of the collected data is where the IT
Security Program Manager and senior officials get the organization's money's worth out of its IT
security training program. Evaluation planning in advance of the event(s) to be evaluated is
essential.


To assist in this regard. Exhibit 5-4 on the following page illustrates and correlates the elements
of training effectiveness evaluation that have been discussed in this chapter, i.e., the four
purposes of evaluation and four types of data needed for measurement (from section 5.2), the
three behavioral objectives (from subsection 5.3.1), and the four levels of evaluation (from
subsection 5.3.2) along with the evaluation tools or instruments associated with each level (from
section 5.4).
