                       Figure 3-6. Use of SAML and XACML in Implementing ABAC

In Figure 3-6, the requester’s authentication assertion is provided by the identity provider before
accessing the resource. The following steps describe how SAML and XACML use the requester’s
attributes to determine whether access should be granted:

    1. The requester attempts to access the resource and supply the authentication assertion.

    2. The Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) sends a SAML authorization decision request to the PDP.

    3. The PDP requests certain attribute assertions that are associated with the requester.

    4. The AA returns the appropriate attribute assertions.

    5. The PDP requests the XACML policy from the policy store.

    6. The PDP receives the XACML policy.

    7. After querying the XACML policy, the PDP sends an authorization decision assertion to the PEP.

    8. Based on the authorization decision assertion, the PEP grants the requester access to the resource.

3.5.1.3 Policy-Based Access Control

Policy-based access control (PBAC) is a logical and somewhat bounded extension of ABAC that is useful
for enforcing strict environment-level access control policies. PBAC introduces the notion of a policy
authority, which serves as the access decision point for the environment in question. PBAC leverages the
granular policy rule functions inherent to ABAC; it focuses more on automatically enforcing mandatory
access controls (MAC), which are traditionally much more bounded than discretionary controls.
