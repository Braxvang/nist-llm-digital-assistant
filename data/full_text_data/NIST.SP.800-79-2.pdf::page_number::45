Special Publication 800-79-2                            Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card Issuers
                                                                         and Derived PIV Credential Issuers



                 Assessor may reuse the results of a previous assessment for the organization level
                 issuer controls and then assess a random sample of the new issuing facilities.

                 Subtask 4.4: Prepare the assessment report.
                 Responsibility: Assessor
                 Guidance: The assessment report contains— (i) the results of the assessment; (ii)
                 recommendations for correcting deficiencies; and (iii) the residual risk to the
                 organization if those deficiencies are not corrected or mitigated. The assessment
                 report is the Assessor’s statement of the results of analyzing and evaluating the
                 issuer’s implementation of controls. The sample assessment report template in
                 Appendix E should be used as a format for documenting the results after assessing
                 the issuer controls.
        Task 5: Assessment Documentation
This task consists of the Assessor submitting the assessment report to the OIMO and the latter
adding the issuer’s operations plan (revised if necessary) and the corrective actions plan (CAP)
to generate an authorization submission package for the DAO. In situations where the assessment
report contains deficiencies, the OIMO may choose to address some deficiencies based on the
recommendations by the Assessor and revise the operations plan (if needed), even before
submitting the package for authorization.

                 Subtask 5.1: Provide the OIMO with the assessment report.
                 Responsibility: Assessor
                 Guidance: The OIMO relies on the expertise, experience, and judgment of the
                 Assessor to: (i) provide recommendations on how to correct deficiencies in the
                 planned or performed operations; and (ii) to understand the potential impacts of
                 those deficiencies. The OIMO may choose to act on selected recommendations of
                 the Assessor before the authorization package is finalized. To optimize the
                 utilization of resources organization-wide, any actions taken by the OIMO prior to
                 the final authorization decision must be coordinated with the DAO. The Assessor
                 reviews any changes made in response to the corrective actions and revises the
                 assessment report, as appropriate.

                 Subtask 5.2: Revise the operations plan (if necessary) and implement its new
                 provisions.
                 Responsibility: OIMO
                 Guidance: The revised operations plan must include all changes made in
                 response to recommendations for corrective actions from the Assessor.

                 Subtask 5.3: Prepare the corrective actions plan (CAP).
                 Responsibility: OIMO
                 Guidance: The CAP, one of the three primary documents in the authorization
                 submission package, describes actions that must be taken by the OIMO to correct
                 deficiencies identified in the Assessment phase. The CAP identifies— (i) the
