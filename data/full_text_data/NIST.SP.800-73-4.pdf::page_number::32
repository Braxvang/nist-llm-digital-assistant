Secure Messaging (SM) is defined in Section 5.4 and VCI is defined in Section 5.5. Table 2 of Part 2
specifies the security conditions for each command.

When represented as a byte, the key reference occupies bits b8 and b5-b1, while b7 and b6 shall be
set to 0. If b8 is 0 then the key reference names global reference data. If b8 is 1, then the key
reference names application-specific reference data.

The access control rules for PIV data object access shall reference the PIV Card Application PIN and
may optionally reference the cardholder Global PIN or OCC data. If the Global PIN is used by the
PIV Card Application then the Global PIN format shall follow the PIV Card Application PIN format
defined in Section 2.4.3 of Part 2.

PIV Card Applications with the Discovery Object and Bit 6 of the first byte of the PIN Usage Policy
value set to one, as per Section 3.3.2, shall reference the PIV Card Application PIN as well as the
cardholder Global PIN in the access control rules for PIV data object access. Additionally, the PIV

16 A card may optionally have a symmetric CAK in addition to the mandatory asymmetric CAK, in which case both keys

would share the same key reference and access control rules.
