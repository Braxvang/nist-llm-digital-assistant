D.5.   Conferences and Working Groups

D.5.1. Digital Bond’s SCADA Security Scientific Symposium (S4)
Since 2007, S4 has hosted an ICS security conference that was initially founded to showcase
advanced and highly technical content to the ICS audience. S4 has since grown to accommodate
other ICS security content but remains a premier venue to present technical findings within OT
security.

D.5.2. Industrial Control Systems Joint Working Group (ICSJWG)
CISA hosts a bi-annual working group to facilitate communication and partnerships between
federal agencies and departments and private asset owners and operators of industrial control
systems across all critical infrastructure (CI) sectors. The goal of the ICSJWG is to enhance the
collaborative efforts of the industrial control systems stakeholder community in securing CI by
accelerating the design, development, and deployment of secure industrial control systems.
