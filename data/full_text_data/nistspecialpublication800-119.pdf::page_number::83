                                                             GUIDELINES FOR THE SECURE DEPLOYMENT OF IPV6




                           Figure 4-3. IKEv1 Identifiers used between a MN and its HA

RFC 4877 specifies the entire IKEv2 exchange. Figure 4-4 shows the IKEv2 Identifiers used between a
MN and its HA.




                       Figure 4-4. IKEv2 identifiers used between a MN and its HA

The MN inserts its identity (e.g., its HoA or FQDN) in the IDi payload in the third message, which is
encrypted and authenticated. The HoA and traffic selectors for protecting BUs and BUAs are included in
the TSi (traffic selectorâ€”initiator). The MN or HA can then send CREATE_CHILD_SA exchanges to
protect other traffic. Again, the MN uses its HoA in the TSi.
