NIST SP 800-82r3                                           Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security

            and can be applied to a wide range of OT environments, including ICS,
            SCADA, Internet of Things (IoT), IIoT, and hybrid environments.
            Defense in depth requires an integration of people, processes, and
            technology to be effective. Additionally, cybersecurity defenses are not
            static and require changes and updates as risks change for the
            environment. To help establish and support an effective defense-in-depth
            architecture, organizations should consider:
                   •   Training people to support the security environment and reduce
                       risky behaviors
                   •   Implementing appropriate and sustainable cybersecurity
                       technology
                   •   Implementing procedures to monitor, respond, and adapt
                       cybersecurity defenses to changing conditions

5.1.3. Other Cybersecurity Strategy Considerations
Traditional OT systems were designed to operate industrial processes safely and reliably without
connections to external networks. However, due to the need for business agility and cost
reduction for OT infrastructures, OT systems and networks are becoming more integrated into
business networks and cloud infrastructures. Additionally, the introduction of IIoT systems into
OT environments may have unintended cybersecurity consequences.
Similarly, cloud computing capabilities (e.g., infrastructure as a service, platform as a service,
software as a service, and security as a service) are increasingly being utilized by organizations.
While the use of these capabilities to support IT services is relatively well understood, the ability
to utilize these services to support OT environments may have additional availability challenges
resulting from increased sensitivity to system performance levels or connection issues. As a
result, the adoption of a security architecture strategy may be impacted by the current state of
existing OT environments. For example, based on the architectural strategy, procurement
decisions might be adjusted to include migrating specific components to support the new
strategy. Organizations may also find that existing systems already support some or most of the
security architecture strategy, so building on these existing capabilities could accelerate the
strategy implementation. Additionally, new OT environments provide an opportunity to evaluate
cyber risk early on and build cybersecurity into the design.
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Organizations should ensure that their security architecture strategy
            provides the required flexibility to evolve their environment while also
            carefully considering the impacts to operations and cybersecurity.
