                                                                                       SECTION 5: RFID SECURITY CONTROLS



Examples of each of these types of controls are discussed in depth in Sections 5.3.1 through 5.3.3,
respectively.

5.3.1    Authentication and Data Integrity

While a wide variety of authentication methods exists for IT systems, the most common techniques for
the RF subsystem of RFID systems are passwords, keyed-hash message authentication codes (HMAC),
and digital signatures. In some cases, the primary objective of the authentication technology is to prevent
unauthorized reading from or writing to tags. In other cases, the objective is to detect cloning of tags.
Authentication techniques based on cryptography often provide integrity services for data included in the
authentication transaction; in other words, an adversary cannot modify data in the transaction without the
reader or tag detecting the change.

5.3.1.1 Password Authentication

Control: A tag does not permit password-protected commands to be executed unless they are
accompanied by the correct password. Protected commands may include those that support reading and
writing of tag data, memory access control (Section 5.3.3.1), and the kill feature (Section 5.3.3.3).

Organizations properly implementing this control will develop a password management system to support
it. The password management system addresses all stages of the password, including generation,
conveyance, and storage. From a security perspective, effective password generation involves random
selection of each password. 47 Whenever possible, the passwords are assigned to each tag in a physically
secure environment to reduce the likelihood of eavesdropping. Tags should not share passwords,
although this may not be administratively feasible in some environments, such as those in which the
reader is not expected to have access to a networked database of tag passwords. In inter-enterprise
applications such as supply chains, multiple organizations may need to access databases that contain tag
identifiers and passwords. Authenticating external entities likely will require additional security systems.
While in traditional IT systems, passwords are often changed on a periodic basis (e.g., every 90 days); in
RFID systems, such changes may be infeasible, especially if the tags are not always accessible to the
organization assigning the passwords.

Applicability: Any application where authorized execution of a particular command represents a
business process, business intelligence, privacy, or externality risk.

Benefits: The likelihood that tags will be used for unauthorized purposes is greatly reduced.

Weaknesses:

 Password management for RFID systems is complex, particularly if the application deploys large
  number of tags or if passwords must be shared across organizational boundaries as might be the case
  in supply chains.
 Adversaries can intercept passwords transmitted over the air and then use them at a later time to
  perform unauthorized transactions. 48

     Number Generation Using Deterministic Random Bit Generators, NIST Special Publication 800-90, June 2006.

     RFID passwords are often transmitted “in the clear” (i.e., without cryptography to hide them), which makes them
     particularly vulnerable to eavesdropping. The cover-coding technique described in Section 5.3.2.1 mitigates this risk for
     tags that support cover coding, but this technique is not without its own limitations.
