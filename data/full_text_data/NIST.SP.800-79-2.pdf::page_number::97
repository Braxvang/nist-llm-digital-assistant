Authorization
Focus Area         Identifier                             Issuer Control                                Source
                                Determine that:
                                   (i) the issuer performs a 1:1 biometric match of the
                                       cardholder against the biometric included in the PIV Card
                                       or in the chain of trust prior to providing the reset PIV Card
                                       back to the cardholder (observe, test);
                                  (ii) The same type of biometric used for the match is not the
                                       same as the type of biometric data that is being reset
                                       (observe, test);
                                 (iii) the issuer has alternate processes in place for situations
                                       where biometric matches are not possible (review,
                                       observe).
