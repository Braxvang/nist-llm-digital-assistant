SP 800-152                                                             A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


9 Testing and System Assurances
Prior to the procurement of an FCKMS or FCKMS services, an FCKMS should be
subjected to and pass several types of testing to ensure that it 1) conforms to its design
and required standards, 2) operates according to its design specifications, 3) rejects
service requests that could compromise its security, and 4) is interoperable with peer
FCKMSs (if required). Various types and levels of testing should be conducted to obtain
assurance that the FCKMS, including its modules and devices, performs as desired. The
results of all testing should be made available to Federal government officials (perhaps as
vendor-proprietary information15) in order to complete the evaluation processes.

                                   The results of all testing shall be provided to a Federal
PR:9.1               SA-11
                                   procurement authority for review prior to the acquisition of an
                                   FCKMS.

                     SA-11         A Federal CKMS should pass procurement and user
PA:9.1
                                   acceptance testing performed by the FCKMS service provider
                                   and any third-party before procurement of the service.

 9.1       CKMS and FCKMS Testing

A CKMS, including its modules and devices, should undergo tests by its vendor to verify
that the CKMS performs according to its design and the CKMS Security Policy.
Similarly, an FCKMS should undergo tests by the FCKMS service provider to verify that
the FCKMS performs according to the FCKMS Security Policy.

FR:9.1 A CKMS design shall specify the non-proprietary vendor testing that was
performed on the system and passed.

                                   service provider shall review all vendor tests that have been
                                   performed on the CKMS and its devices.

PR:9.3
                                   service-using organization shall review all FCKMS service
                                   provider tests that have been performed on the FCKMS.

 9.2       Third-Party Testing

An FCKMS vendor, service provider or service-using organization could initiate third-
party testing of an FCKMS module or device for conformance to selected standards or to
obtain specific information about the FCKMS. Third-party testing is intended to provide
confidence that the designer and implementer did not overlook some flaw in their own
testing procedures or error in the testing results. For example, the National Institute of
Standards and Technology has established several programs for validating conformance

     Proprietary test results must be marked appropriately, packaged separately, and handled securely.
