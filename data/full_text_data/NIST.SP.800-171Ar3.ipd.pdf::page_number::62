1922           ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS
1923           Examine
1924           [SELECT FROM: physical protection policy and procedures; media protection policy and
1925           procedures; procedures for media marking; list of system media marking security attributes;
1926           system security plan; other relevant documents or records]
1927           Interview
1928           [SELECT FROM: personnel with system media protection and marking responsibilities; personnel
1929           with information security responsibilities]
1930           Test
1931           [SELECT FROM: processes for marking information media; mechanisms for supporting and/or
1932           implementing media marking]

1935   3.8.5. Media Transport
1936           REQUIREMENT: 03.08.05

1937           ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE
1938           Determine if:
1939           A.03.08.05.a[01]: system media that contain CUI are protected during transport outside of
1940           controlled areas.
1941           A.03.08.05.a[02]: system media that contain CUI are controlled during transport outside of
1942           controlled areas.
1943           A.03.08.05.b: the accountability of system media that contain CUI is maintained during transport
1944           outside of controlled areas.
1945           A.03.08.05.c: cryptographic mechanisms are implemented to prevent the unauthorized disclosure
1946           of CUI stored on digital media during transport.

1947           ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS
1948           Examine
1949           [SELECT FROM: physical protection policy and procedures; media protection policy and
1950           procedures; procedures for media storage; access control policy and procedures; authorized
1951           personnel list; system media; designated controlled areas; system and communications
1952           protection policy and procedures; cryptographic mechanisms and configuration documentation;
1953           procedures for the protection of information at rest; system design documentation; system
1954           configuration settings; list of information at rest requiring confidentiality protections; system audit
1955           records; system security plan; other relevant documents or records]
1956           Interview
1957           [SELECT FROM: personnel with system media protection and storage responsibilities; personnel
1958           with information security responsibilities; system developers; system administrators]
