                                                                                             is often difficult to assure, as summarized in Section 1.2 and described in detail in [8].

                                                                                             Instead, stateful HBS schemes are primarily intended for applications with the following

                                                                                             the implementation will have a long lifetime; and 3) it would not be practical to transition to a

                                                                                             In a stateful HBS scheme, an HBS private key consists of a large set of one-time signature (OTS)
                                                                                             private keys. The signer needs to ensure that no individual OTS key is ever used to sign more
                                                                                             than one message. If an attacker were able to obtain digital signatures for two different messages
                                                                                             that were created using the same OTS key, then it would become computationally feasible for
                                                                                             that attacker to forge signatures on arbitrary messages [13]. Therefore, as described in [8], when
                                                                                             a stateful HBS scheme is implemented, extreme care needs to be taken in order to ensure that no
