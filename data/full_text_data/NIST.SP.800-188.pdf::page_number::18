NIST SP 800-188
September 2023



In 2018, the U.S. Congress passed three laws that signifcantly increased the need for ex-
pertise regarding privacy-preserving data analysis and data publishing techniques, such as
de-identifcation:
   1. The Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018 [2], commonly
      called the Evidence Act, requires federal agencies to track all of their data in data
      inventories, report public datasets to https://data.gov, perform systematic evidence-
      making and evaluation activities, and engage in capacity-building so that the federal
      workforce can meet the requirements of data-centric, evidence-based operations. The
      Evidence Act is based on the fndings of the U.S. Commission on Evidence-Based
      Policymaking [34] and is implemented in part by Offce of Management and Budget
      (OMB) Memorandum M-19-23 [168].
      The Evidence Act contains specifc guidance requiring that agencies publishing data
      take into account “(A) risks and restrictions related to the disclosure of personally
      identifable information, including the risk that an individual data asset in isolation
      does not pose a privacy or confdentiality risk but when combined with other available
      information may pose such a risk;” and “(B) security considerations, including the
      risk that information in an individual data asset in isolation does not pose a security
      risk but when combined with other available information may pose such a risk” [2].
      The Evidence Act incorporated and reauthorized The Confdential Information
      Protection and Statistical Effciency Act of 2002, now called the 2018 CIPSEA.
      Part B, “Confdential Information Protection,” provides for the legal protection of
      “data or information acquired by an agency under a pledge of confdentiality for ex-
      clusively statistical purposes shall not be disclosed by an agency in identifable form
      for any use other than an exclusively statistical purpose, except with the informed
      consent of the respondent.”
      Finally, the 2018 CIPSEA promotes Offce of Management and Budget Statistical
      Policy Directive 1, “Fundamental Responsibilities of Federal Statistical Agencies
      and Recognized Statistical Units,”[100] to statute as 44 U.S. Code §§ 3561-4.”
   2. The Open, Public, Electronic and Necessary (OPEN) Government Data Act,
      which was passed as part of the Evidence Act, requires that the U.S. Government
      publish data in machine-readable, open, non-proprietary formats when possible. This
      act largely codifed presidential Executive Order 13642 of May 9, 2013, “Making
      Open and Machine Readable the New Default for Government Information” [115]
      and its implementation in OMB Memorandum M-13-13 [24].
   3. The Geospatial Data Act of 2018 requires that government agencies make invento-
      ries of their geospatial data and that public geospatial data be registered on the U.S.
      Government’s public geospatial platform at https://www.geoplatform.gov/.
Other laws, regulations, and policies that govern the release of statistics and data to the
public enshrine this principle of confdentiality. For example:

                                             4
