                                                                                       GUIDE TO GENERAL SERVER SECURITY



      –    Password hash files and other files used in authentication

      –    Files containing authorization information used in controlling access

      –    Cryptographic key material used in confidentiality, integrity, and non-repudiation services

 Server log and system audit files

 System software and configuration files

 Server content files.

It is vital that the server application executes only under a unique individual user and group identity with
very restrictive access controls. New user and group identities should be established for exclusive use by
the server software. The new user and new group should be independent from all other users and groups
and unique. This is a prerequisite for implementing the access controls described in the following steps.
During initialization, the server may have to run with root (Unix) or administrator/system (Windows)
privileges; ensure that the server is configured to reduce its privileges to those of the server user after
performing its initialization functions.

In addition, use the server OS to limit which files can be accessed by the service processes. These
processes should have read-only access to those files necessary to perform the service and should have no
access to other files, such as server log files. Use server host OS access controls to enforce the
following: 28

 Service processes are configured to run as a user with a strictly limited set of privileges (i.e., not
  running as root, administrator, or equivalent).

 Service processes can only write to server content files and directories if necessary.

 Temporary files created by the server software are restricted to a specified and appropriately
  protected subdirectory (if possible). Access to these temporary files is limited to the server processes
  that created the files (if possible).

It may also be necessary to ensure that the server software cannot save (or, in some cases, read) files
outside the specified file structure dedicated to server content. This may be a configuration choice in the
server software, or it may be a choice in how the server process is controlled by the OS. Ensure that such
directories and files (outside the specified directory tree) cannot be accessed both directly and through the
server software.

5.3       Server Resource Constraints

To mitigate the effects of certain types of DoS attacks, configure the server to limit the amount of OS
resources it can consume. Some examples include—

 Installing server content on a different hard drive or logical partition than the OS and server software.
