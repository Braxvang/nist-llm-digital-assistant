      NIST SP 800-217 ipd                          Guidelines for PIV Federation (Initial Public Draft)
      January 2023


341   The RPs in a federation relationship transitively benefit from the security practices of the
342   IdP. Instead of relying on all RPs to manage authenticators and accounts for many users
343   over time, the IdP can act as a dedicated identity management device within the network.
344   This also means that an IdP would be aware of the usage of a given PIV identity account
345   under its control at different RPs within its trust networks. While this has positive benefits
346   for security, it does pose a privacy tradeoff wherein the IdP needs to be trusted with this
347   usage information.

348   1.4. Audience
349   This document is intended for stakeholders who are responsible for procuring, designing,
350   implementing, and managing deployments of PIV federation in both the IdP and RP roles.

351   1.5. Notations
352   This Standard uses the following typographical conventions in text:
353       • Specific terms in CAPITALS represent normative requirements. When these same
354         terms are not in CAPITALS , the term does not represent a normative requirement.
355            – The terms “ SHALL ” and “ SHALL NOT ” indicate requirements to be followed
356              strictly in order to conform to the publication and from which no deviation is
357              permitted.
358            – The terms “ SHOULD ” and “ SHOULD NOT ” indicate that among several
359              possibilities, one is recommended as particularly suitable without mentioning
360              or excluding others, that a certain course of action is preferred but not
361              necessarily required, or that (in the negative form) a certain possibility or
362              course of action is discouraged but not prohibited.
363            – The terms “ MAY ” and “ NEED NOT ” indicate a course of action permissible
364              within the limits of the publication.
365            – The terms “ CAN ” and “ CANNOT ” indicate a possibility and capability—
366              whether material, physical, or causal—or, in the negative, the absence of that
367              possibility or capability.

368   1.6. Document Structure
369   This document is organized as follows. Each section is labeled as either normative (i.e.,
370   mandatory for compliance) or informative (i.e., not mandatory).
371       • Section 2 describes a general architecture for PIV federation. This section is
372         informative.
373       • Section 3 describes the trust agreements in a PIV federation. This section is
374         normative.
