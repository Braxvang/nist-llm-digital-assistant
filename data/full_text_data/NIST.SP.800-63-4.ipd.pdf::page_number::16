      NIST SP 800-63-4 ipd                                               Digital Identity Guidelines
      December 2022


388   more authenticators used to claim a digital identity and establishes confidence that a
389   subject attempting to access a digital service: (1) is in control of the technologies being
390   used for authentication, and (2) is the same subject that previously accessed the service.
391   Finally, the federation process allows for identity information to be shared in support of
392   authentication across systems.
393   The composition, model, and availability of identity services has significantly
394   changed since the first version of SP 800-63 was released, as have the considerations
395   and challenges of deploying secure, private, and equitable services to diverse user
396   communities. This revision addresses these challenges while facilitating the new models
397   and architectures for identity services that have developed by clarifying requirements
398   based on the function an entity may serve under the overall digital identity model.
399   Additionally, this publication provides instruction for credential service providers (CSPs),
400   verifiers, and relying parties (RPs) and it describes the risk management processes
401   that organizations should follow for implementing digital identity services and that
402   supplement the NIST Risk Management Framework [NISTRMF] and its component
403   special publications. The publication expands upon the NIST RMF by outlining how
404   equity and usability considerations should be incorporated into digital identity risk
405   management processes and it highlights the importance of considering impacts, not only
406   on the enterprise operations and assets, but also on individuals, other organizations, and,
407   more broadly, society. Further, while digital authentication supports privacy protection
408   by mitigating risks of unauthorized access to individuals’ information, given that identity
409   proofing, authentication, authorization, and federation often involve the processing of
410   individuals’ information, these functions can also create privacy risks. These guidelines,
411   therefore, include privacy requirements and considerations to help mitigate potential
412   associated privacy risks.
413   Finally, while this publication provides organizations with technical requirements and
414   recommendations for establishing, maintaining, and authenticating the digital identity
415   of subjects in order to access digital systems over a network, additional support options
416   outside the purview of information technology teams may need to be provided to address
417   barriers and adverse impacts, foster equity, and successfully deliver on mission objectives.

418   2.1. Scope & Applicability
419   Not all digital services require identity proofing or authentication; however, this guidance
420   applies to all online transactions for which some level of digital identity is required,
421   regardless of the constituency (e.g., citizens, business partners, and government entities).
422   These guidelines primarily focus on organizational services that interact with external
423   users, such as citizens accessing public benefits or private sector partners accessing
424   collaboration spaces. However, it also applies to federal systems accessed by employees
425   and contractors. The Personal Identity Verification (PIV) of Federal Employees and
426   Contractors standard [FIPS201] and its corresponding set of special publications and
