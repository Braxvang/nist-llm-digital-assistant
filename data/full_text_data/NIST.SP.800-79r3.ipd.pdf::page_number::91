December 2023                                                                             and Derived PIV Credential Issuers


   Identifier                                  Issuer Control                                                   Source

                        (e.g., microtext, UV-fluorescent images, IR-fluorescent ink, nano and
                        micro images, and chemical taggants) (interview, observe).
                   (ii) The incorporation of security features (i) are in accordance with
                        durability requirements; (ii) are free of defects, such as fading and
                        discoloration; (iii) do not obscure printed information; and (iv) do not
                        impede access to machine-readable information (interview,
                        observe).
                  (iii) The presence of security features does not prevent the recognition
                        of white as the principal card body color by a person with normal
                        vision (corrected or uncorrected) at a working distance of 50 cm to
                        200 cm. (observe).
     CP-2       The PIV Card is not embossed other than for security and accessibility             [FIPS201], Sec. 4.1.3 – Physical
                features.                                                                          Characteristics and Durability

                Assessment
                Determine that:
                  (i) The PIV Card is not embossed other than for security and
                      accessibility features (review, observe).
     CP-3       Decals are not adhered to the PIV Card.                                            [FIPS201], Sec. 4.1.3 – Physical
                                                                                                   Characteristics and Durability
                Assessment
                Determine that:
                  (i) Decals are not adhered to the PIV Card (review, observe).
     CP-4       If organizations choose to punch an opening in the card body to enable the [FIPS201], Sec. 4.1.3 – Physical
                card to be oriented by touch or to be worn on a lanyard, all such alterations Characteristics and Durability
                are closely coordinated with the card vendor and/or manufacturer to ensure
                that the card’s material integrity is not adversely impacted.

                Assessment
                Determine that:
                   (i) Card body durability requirements and characteristics are not
                       compromised by a punched opening (test).
                  (ii) Printed information, including the photograph, are not altered or
                       interfered with (test).
                 (iii) Machine-readable technology, such as the embedded antenna, is
                       not interfered with or damaged (test).
                 (iv) Documentation shows that card manufacturer warranties or other
                       product claims are not invalidated (review).
     CP-5       Requirements for tactilely discernible markers (e.g., edge ridging, notched        -
                corner, laser engraving) are covered under of AI-3.

     CP-6       PIV Cards that contain topographical defects (e.g., scratches, poor color,         [FIPS201], Sec. 2.8 – PIV Card
                fading, etc.) or are improperly printed are destroyed.                             Issuance Requirements

                Assessment
                Determine that:
                   (i) The issuing facility has a procedure to destroy PIV Card that contain
                       topographical defects or are improperly printed (review).
                  (ii) The issuing facility destroys PIV Cards that contain topographical
                       defects or are improperly printed (observe).
     CP-7       PIV Cards are printed using the color representation specified in Table 4-2        [FIPS201], Sec. 4.1.5 – Color
                Color Representation in [FIPS201], Sec. 4.1.5.                                     Representation

                Assessment
