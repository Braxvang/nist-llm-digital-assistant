SECURE DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM (DNS) DEPLOYMENT GUIDE



                file “zonedb.example.com”;
                update-policy { grant sales.example.com. self
           sales.example.com.; };
           };

All dynamic updates from sales.example.com could be restricted to only A and MX RR types of that
domain as follows:

           zone “example.com” {
                type master;
                file “zonedb.example.com”;
                update-policy {
                  grant sales.example.com. self sales.example.com. A MX; };
           };

To allow clients with the TSIG key sales.example.com to update all records pertaining to subdomains of
NEsales.example.com except the name server records (RR Type NS):

           zone “example.com” {
                type master;
                file “zonedb.example.com”;
                update-policy {
                      deny sales.example.com. subdomain NE
           sales.example.com. NS;
                      grant sales.example.com. subdomain NE
           sales.example.com. ANY; };
           };

For Microsoft Windows, authentication is provided using GSS-TSIG. System administrators of Windows
Servers should consult their implementation’s documentation on how to integrate secure dynamic update
using GSS-TSIG.

8.3       Recommendations Summary

The following items provide a summary of the major recommendations from this section:

      •    Checklist item 7: It is recommended that the administrator create a named list of trusted hosts (or
           blacklisted hosts) for each of the different types of DNS transactions. In general, the role of the
           following categories of hosts should be considered for inclusion in the appropriate ACL:

           –   DMZ hosts defined in any of the zones in the enterprise

           –   All secondary name servers allowed to initiate zone transfers

           –   Internal hosts allowed to perform recursive queries.

      •    Checklist item 8: The TSIG key (secret string) should be a minimum of 112 bits in length if the
           generator utility has been proven to generate sufficiently random strings [800-57P1]. 128 bits
           recommended.

      •    Checklist item 9: A unique TSIG key should be generated for each set of hosts (i.e. a unique key
           between a primary name server and every secondary server for authenticating zone transfers).
