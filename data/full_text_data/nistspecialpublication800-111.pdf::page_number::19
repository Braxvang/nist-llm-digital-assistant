applications’ file/folder encryption features. Appendix A presents additional examples of applications
that can encrypt the information that they store.

3.2     Protection Provided by Storage Encryption Technologies

The following explains the types of protection each storage encryption technology can and cannot
provide.

 Full Disk Encryption. For a computer that is not booted, all the information encrypted by FDE is
  protected, assuming that pre-boot authentication is required. When the device is booted, then FDE
  provides no protection; once the OS is loaded, the OS becomes fully responsible for protecting the
  unencrypted information. The exception to this is when the device is in a hibernation mode; most
  FDE products can encrypt the hibernation file.

 Virtual Disk and Volume Encryption. When virtual disk encryption is employed, the contents of
  containers are protected until the user is authenticated for the containers. If single sign-on is being
  used for authentication to the solution, this usually means that the containers are protected until the
  user logs onto the device. If single sign-on is not being used, then protection is typically provided
  until the user explicitly authenticates to a container. Virtual disk encryption does not provide any
  protection for data outside the container, including swap and hibernation files that could contain the
  contents of unencrypted files that were being held in memory. Volume encryption provides the same
  protection as virtual disk encryption, but for a volume instead of a container.

 File/Folder Encryption. File/folder encryption protects the contents of encrypted files (including
  files in encrypted folders) until the user is authenticated for the files or folders. If single sign-on is
  being used, this usually means that the files are only protected until the user logs onto the device. If
  single sign-on is not being used, then protection is typically provided until the user explicitly
  authenticates to a file or folder. File/folder encryption does not provide any protection for data
  outside the protected files or folders, including swap and hibernation files that could contain the
  contents of unencrypted files that were being held in memory. File/folder encryption software also
  cannot protect the confidentiality of filenames and other file metadata, which itself could provide
  valuable information to attackers (for examples, files that are named by Social Security number).

In many cases, especially for FDE and volume encryption, these products do not provide any protection
for files copied or moved from the encrypted storage to another location (either local or on the network),
because they automatically decrypt the files as part of the copy or move process. 25 The target location is
responsible for protecting the files, and no protection is provided in transit from the source to the target.
However, some storage encryption technologies allow protection to be retained if desired. Most virtual
disk encryption products allow an entire container to be transferred, including the container’s protection,
but individual files or folders copied or moved from a container will not be protected. Some file/folder
encryption products allow files or folders to retain their protection when they are copied or moved, in
some cases only within a single filesystem, and in other cases both within a single filesystem and to other
filesystems.

The main threat that all these types of technology mitigate is unauthorized access to information on a lost
or stolen device. Virtual disk/volume encryption and file/folder encryption technologies can also mitigate
some OS and application layer threats to protected information involving malware, remote access to the
protected information, and other methods that depend on the OS being booted, until the user successfully

      Some products display a warning message or prompt the user to confirm the action before decrypting and copying or
      moving the files.
