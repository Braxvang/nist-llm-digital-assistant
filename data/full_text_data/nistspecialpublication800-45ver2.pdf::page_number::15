                                                                       GUIDELINES ON ELECTRONIC MAIL SECURITY



1.    Introduction

1.1   Authority

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed this document in furtherance of its
statutory responsibilities under the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002,
Public Law 107-347.

NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements, for
providing adequate information security for all agency operations and assets, but such standards and
guidelines shall not apply to national security systems. This guideline is consistent with the requirements
of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Section 8b(3), “Securing Agency
Information Systems,” as analyzed in A-130, Appendix IV: Analysis of Key Sections. Supplemental
information is provided in A-130, Appendix III.

This guideline has been prepared for use by Federal agencies. It may be used by nongovernmental
organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright, though attribution is desired.

Nothing in this document should be taken to contradict standards and guidelines made mandatory and
binding on Federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory authority, nor should these
guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the Secretary of Commerce,
Director of the OMB, or any other Federal official.

1.2   Purpose and Scope

The purpose of the Guidelines on Electronic Mail Security is to recommend security practices for
designing, implementing, and operating email systems on public and private networks. While intended as
recommended guidance for Federal departments and agencies, it may be used in the private sector on a
voluntary basis.

Mail servers are frequently targeted by attackers. Various types of email content and attachments have
also proven to be effective in introducing viruses and other malware into networks through mail clients.
Email is extensively used as a vector to deliver attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in users’ workstations
or use social engineering methods to trick users. These attacks often lead to the compromise of the user
workstation or the release of sensitive information even when the email client is securely configured.
This document may be used by organizations interested in enhancing security on existing and future mail
systems to reduce the number and frequency of email-related security incidents. This document presents
generic principles that apply to all systems.

This guideline does not cover the following aspects relating to securing a mail server:

 Securing other types of network servers
 Firewalls and routers used to protect mail servers beyond a basic discussion in Section 7.2.1
 Special considerations for high traffic mail servers with multiple hosts
 Securing backend servers that may support the mail server (e.g., syslog hosts, file servers)
 Security of the X.400 standard messaging protocol.
