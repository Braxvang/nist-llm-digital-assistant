                        Reports on Computer Systems Technology

The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical
leadership for the Nation’s measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops tests, test
methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance the
development and productive use of information technology. ITL’s responsibilities include the
development of management, administrative, technical, and physical standards and guidelines for
the cost-effective security and privacy of other than national security-related information in federal
information systems. The Special Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research, guidelines, and
outreach efforts in information system security, and its collaborative activities with industry,
government, and academic organizations.

                                             Abstract

NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-157 contains technical guidelines for the implementation of
standards-based, secure, reliable, interoperable Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)-based identity
credentials that are issued for mobile devices by federal departments and agencies to individuals
who possess and prove control over a valid Personal Identity Verification (PIV) Card. This
document, SP 800-166, contains the requirements and test assertions for testing the Derived PIV
Application and associated Derived PIV data objects implemented on removable hardware tokens
and within mobile devices. The tests reflect the design goals of interoperability and interface
functions.
