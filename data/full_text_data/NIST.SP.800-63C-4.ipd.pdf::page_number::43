       December 2022                                                      Federation and Assertions


1130      1. The agency SHALL consult with their Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)
1131         to conduct an analysis determining whether the requirements of the Privacy Act are
1132         triggered by the agency that is acting as an IdP, by the agency that is acting as an
1133         RP, or both (see Sec. 9.4).
1134      2. The agency SHALL publish or identify coverage by a System of Records Notice
1135         (SORN) as applicable.
1136      3. The agency SHALL consult with their SAOP to conduct an analysis determining
1137         whether the requirements of the E-Government Act are triggered by the agency that
1138         is acting as an IdP, the agency that is acting as an RP, or both.
1139      4. The agency SHALL publish or identify coverage by a Privacy Impact Assessment
1140         (PIA) as applicable.
1141   If the RP subscriber account lifecycle process gives the RP access to attributes through
1142   a provisioning API as discussed in Sec. 5.4.3, additional privacy measures SHALL be
1143   implemented given the wide nature of information access. Specifically, it is possible
1144   for the attributes of a subscriber to be provided to an RP without the subscriber ever
1145   interacting with the RP in question. As a consequence, when a provisioning API is
1146   used, the IdP SHALL minimize the attributes made available to the RP. To prevent the
1147   transmission of attributes for users that will never use an RP, the IdP SHALL limit the
1148   population of subscriber accounts available via the provisioning API to the population of
1149   subscribers authorized to use the RP by the trust agreement.

1150   5.6. Reauthentication and Session Requirements in Federated Environments
1151   In a federated environment, the RP manages its sessions separately from any sessions
1152   at the IdP. The assertion is related to both sessions but its validity period is ultimately
1153   independent of them. In order for the IdP to create an assertion for the subscriber,
1154   the subscriber needs to establish an authenticated session with the IdP. To create an
1155   authenticated session at the RP, the RP needs to process a valid assertion from the IdP.
1156   Due to the distributed nature of a federated system, the subscriber’s sessions with the
1157   IdP and with the RP terminate independently of each other. The RP SHALL NOT assume
1158   that the subscriber has an active session at the IdP past the issuance time of the assertion.
1159   The IdP SHALL NOT assume that termination of the subscriber’s session at the IdP will
1160   propagate to any sessions that subscriber would have at downstream RPs. The RP and
1161   IdP MAY communicate session termination requests to other parties in the federation
1162   network, if supported by the federation protocol.
1163   At the time of a federated login request, the subscriber MAY have a pre-existing
1164   session at the IdP which MAY be used to generate an assertion to the RP. The IdP
1165    SHALL communicate any information it has regarding the time of the subscriber’s
1166   latest authentication event at the IdP, and the RP MAY use this information in making
1167   authorization and access decisions. Depending on the capabilities of the federation
