       NIST SP 800-63A-4 ipd                                              Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022                                                Enrollment and Identity Proofing


1739      1. Providing Trusted Referees (Sec. 5.1.9.1) who can make risk-based decisions based
1740         on the specific applicant circumstances
1741      2. Allowing for the use of Applicant References (Sec. 5.1.9.2) who can vouch for the
1742         difference in attributes

1743   10.2. Equity and Identity Validation
1744   Identity evidence and core attribute validation involves confirming the genuineness,
1745   currency, and accuracy of presented identity evidence and the accuracy of any additional
1746   attributes. These outcomes are accomplished by comparison of the evidence and attributes
1747   against data held by authoritative or credible sources. When considered together with the
1748   identity resolution phase, the result of successful validation phase is the confirmation, to
1749   some level of confidence, that the claimed identity exists in the real world.
1750   This section provides a set of possible problems and mitigations with the inequitable
1751   access, treatment, or outcomes associated with the evidence and attribute validation
1752   process:
1753   Description: Certain user groups do not possess the necessary minimum evidence to
1754   meet the requirements of a given IAL.
1755   Possible mitigations include:
1756      1. Providing Trusted Referees (Sec. 5.1.9.1) who can make risk-based decisions based
1757         on the specific applicant circumstances
1758      2. Allowing for the use of Applicant References (Sec. 5.1.9.2) who can vouch for the
1759         applicant
1760   Description: Records held by authoritative and credible sources (e.g., mobile
1761   network operators and phone number verifiers) are insufficient to support the
1762   validation of core attributes or presented evidence for applicants belonging to
1763   certain user groups.
1764   Possible mitigations include:
1765      1. Providing Trusted Referees (Sec. 5.1.9.1) who can make risk-based decisions based
1766         on the specific applicant circumstances
1767      2. Employing alternative authoritative or credible sources
1768   Description: Records held by authoritative and credible sources may include
1769   inaccurate or false information about persons who are the victims of identity fraud.
1770   Possible mitigations include:
1771      1. Providing Trusted Referees (Sec. 5.1.9.1) who can make risk-based decisions based
1772         on the specific applicant circumstances
1773      2. Allowing for the use of Applicant References (Sec. 5.1.9.2) who can vouch for the
1774         difference in attributes
