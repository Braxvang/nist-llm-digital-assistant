                                                                                              Federated architectures have many significant benefits, including, but not limited to:

                                                                                              through the subscriber, which has further implications for system design.

                                                                                              An RP trusts an assertion based on the source, the time of creation, how long the assertion is
                                                                                              valid from time of creation, and the corresponding trust framework that governs the policies and

                                                                                              The RP is responsible for authenticating the source (the verifier) and for confirming the integrity

                                                                                              integrity of the assertion. When sending assertions across an open network, the verifier is
