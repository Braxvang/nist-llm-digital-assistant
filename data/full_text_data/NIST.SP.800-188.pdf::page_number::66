realistic surrogate names is used – so that future data users have documentation that the
dataset has been de-identifed.
Carefully consider the application of pseudonyms given the source of the direct identifer.
Applying this method to certain values, like last name, can subject the de-identifed data to
frequency distribution attacks for re-identifcation.
If the agency plans to make data available for longitudinal research and contemplates mul-
tiple data releases, then the transformation process should be repeatable, and the resulting
transformed identities should be pseudonyms. The mapping between the direct identifer
and the pseudonym is performed using a lookup table or a repeatable transformation. In
either case, the release of the lookup table or the information used for the repeatable trans-
formation will result in compromised identities. Thus, the lookup table or the information
for the transformation must be highly protected. When using a lookup table, the pseudonym
must be randomly assigned.
A signifcant risk of using a repeatable transformation is that a data intruder may be able to
determine the transformation and, thus, gain the capability to re-identify all of the records
in the dataset.
When multiple organizations use the same pseudonymization scheme, they can trade data
and perform matching on the pseudonyms. This approach is sometimes called privacy-
preserving record linkage (PPRL). However, even when matching is probabilistic (as is the
case with PPRL techniques that employ Bloom flters), this practice allows the organiza-
tions to re-identify each other’s shared datasets. Some PPRL approaches perform record
linkage within a secure data enclave to minimize the risk of unauthorized re-identifcation [111].
As an alternative, organizations can participate in a private set intersection protocol, of
which there are many in the cryptographic literature [102, 45, 89].

4.3.2.   Special Security Note Regarding the Encryption or Hashing of Direct
         Identifers
The transformation of direct identifers through encryption or hashing carries special risks,
as errors in procedure or the release of the key used in the encryption or hashing operation
can compromise identities for the entire dataset. There is no way to verify that a key has
not been released.
If a hashing key is not used or is discovered by an attacker, it is possible for an attacker to
perform a brute force search and determine the original values of identifers that have been
hashed.
When information is protected with encryption, the security of the encrypted data depends
entirely on the security of the encryption key. If a key is improperly chosen, it may be
possible for a data intruder to discover the key using a brute force search. Because there
is no visual difference between data that are encrypted with a strong encryption key and
