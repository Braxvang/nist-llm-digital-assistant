2720   3.14.6. System Monitoring
2721             REQUIREMENT: 03.14.06

2722             ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE
2723             Determine if:
2724             A.03.14.06.a.01: the system is monitored to detect attacks and indicators of potential attacks.
2725             A.03.14.06.a.02: the system is monitored to detect unauthorized connections.
2726             A.03.14.06.b: unauthorized use of the system is identified.
2727             A.03.14.06.c[01]: inbound communications traffic is monitored to detect unusual or
2728             unauthorized activities or conditions.
2729             A.03.14.06.c[02]: outbound communications traffic is monitored to detect unusual or
2730             unauthorized activities or conditions.

2741             responsibilities; personnel with information security responsibilities; system administrators]
2742             Test
2743             [SELECT FROM: processes for intrusion detection and system monitoring; mechanisms
2744             supporting and/or implementing system monitoring capabilities; mechanisms for supporting
2745             and/or implementing intrusion detection and system monitoring capabilities; mechanisms
2746             supporting and/or implementing the monitoring of inbound and outbound communications traffic]
