GUIDE TO TEST, TRAINING, AND EXERCISE PROGRAMS FOR IT PLANS AND CAPABILITIES

The Master Scenario Events List (MSEL) is created by the functional exercise team during the Development Phase. The MSEL lists key scenario events,
expected Injects that will build on the key events, and the objectives of the each MSEL item. Controllers, simulators, and data collectors will refer to the
MSEL throughout the Conduct Phase of the exercise to ensure the exercise remains on track.
