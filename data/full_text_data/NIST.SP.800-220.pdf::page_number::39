In FY 2021, NIST continued to engage with government and industry organizations to demonstrate
and ensure continued alignment with voluntary international standards. NIST discussed the
Cybersecurity Framework in numerous dialogues and has continued to identify and promote
international adaptations and translations of the Framework, which is now available in 10
languages. NIST also continues to contribute to international standards development efforts
related to cybersecurity risk management and the development of cybersecurity frameworks,
including Cybersecurity framework guidelines, ISO/IEC Technical Specification 27110, which was
published in February 2021.
NIST has been instrumental in promoting and participating in the development of a family of
voluntary ISO/IEC standards that align with NIST’s cryptographic module validation standard and
related specifications. NIST served as the project editor for nine of those standards.
Other significant examples of NIST staff engagement in the standards space include the mobile
driver license project (ISO/IEC 18013-5); work on draft ISO/IEC 23894, Artificial Intelligence Risk
Management; a leadership position for the work on Trusted Execution Environments in the IETF;
and contributions to Zero Trust Protocols and Quantum Computing in the ISO committee for
Cryptography (ISO IEC JTC1/SC27/WG2).
About 100 NIST staff members work with other agencies and industry leaders to develop
cybersecurity and privacy standards through voluntary consensus. NIST’s standards strategy
is captured in Interagency Report on Strategic U.S. Government Engagement in International
Standardization to Achieve U.S. Objectives for Cybersecurity (NISTIR 8074).
In FY 2022, the NIST staff will continue to lead and participate in cybersecurity and privacy
standardization efforts with an increased focus on new and emerging areas, such as quantum
information, 5G communications, and zero trust architectures.
