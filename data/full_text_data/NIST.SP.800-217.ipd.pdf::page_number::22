      NIST SP 800-217 ipd                         Guidelines for PIV Federation (Initial Public Draft)
      January 2023


544       • Whether the IdP is the home IdP for the population PIV identity accounts (see
545         Sec. 3.5); and
546       • The sources of attributes for the PIV identity accounts.
547   For example, an RP has established a trust agreement with IdP A as the PIV IdP for
548   all subscribers from Agency X. If the RP then receives an assertion from IdP A for a
549   subscriber from Agency Y, the RP would reject the assertion because the IdP is not
550   trusted as the PIV IdP for Agency Y. Likewise, if the same RP also has an established
551   trust agreement with IdP B, and the RP receives an assertion from IdP B for a subscriber
552   from Agency X, the RP would reject that assertion because it has established IdP A as the
553   PIV IdP for this agency.
554   Trust agreements between an RP and an IdP do not preclude different agreements being
555   established with other parties. For example, an RP can have an agreement to accept IdP
556   A as the PIV IdP for Agency X but have a separate agreement to accept IdP B as the PIV
557   IdP for Agency Y. Both of these IdPs can likewise have trust agreements with many other
558   RPs with potentially different parameters.
559   Any changes to the parameters of the trust agreement SHALL be documented and
560   disclosed to affected parties. If the PIV IdP changes for one or more PIV identity
561   accounts, the RP SHALL document any mappings made between federated identifiers
562   for affected PIV identity accounts.
563   The trust agreement SHALL be established in either a bilateral fashion (See Sec. 3.1)
564   directly between the parties or a multilateral fashion (See Sec. 3.2) through a federation
565   authority, as described in the sections below.

566   3.1. Bilateral Agreements
567   An RP MAY establish the PIV IdP directly with the IdP in a bilateral fashion, as
568   discussed in [SP800-63C].
569   When the PIV IdP is the home IdP for an agency, the PIV IdP operator SHALL make
570   available its home IdP record to the connected RP, as described in Sec. 3.5. The RP
571   operator SHALL make the home IdP record available to authenticated subscribers from
572   that IdP, upon request.
573   The IdP SHOULD make its discovery and registration available in a machine-readable
574   format to facilitate configuration of the RP, as discussed in [SP800-63C].

575   3.2. Multilateral Agreements
576   An RP MAY establish the PIV IdP through the use of a trusted third party known as a
577   federation authority, as discussed in [SP800-63C]. This creates a multilateral agreement
578   between different PIV IdPs and RPs under the PIV federation authority. In such systems,
579   the federation authority decides which PIV IdPs and RPs are allowed to participate
