3.3.2     Syslog Security

Syslog was developed at a time when the security of logs was not a major consideration. Accordingly, it
did not support the use of basic security controls that would preserve the confidentiality, integrity, and
availability of logs. For example, most syslog implementations use the connectionless, unreliable User
Datagram Protocol (UDP) to transfer logs between hosts. UDP provides no assurance that log entries are
received successfully or in the correct sequence. Also, most syslog implementations do not perform any
access control, so any host can send messages to a syslog server unless other security measures have been
implemented to prevent this, such as using a physically separate logging network for communications
with the syslog server, or implementing access control lists on network devices to restrict which hosts can
send messages to the syslog server. Attackers can take advantage of this by flooding syslog servers with
bogus log data, which can cause important log entries to go unnoticed or even potentially cause a denial
of service. Another shortcoming of most syslog implementations is that they cannot use encryption to
protect the integrity or confidentiality of logs in transit. Attackers on the network might monitor syslog
messages containing sensitive information regarding system configurations and security weaknesses;
attackers might also be able to perform man-in-the-middle attacks such as modifying or destroying syslog
messages in transit.29

As the security of logs has become a greater concern, several implementations of syslog have been
created that place a greater emphasis on security.30 Most have been based on a proposed standard, RFC
3195, which was designed specifically to improve the security of syslog.31 Implementations based on
RFC 3195 can support log confidentiality, integrity, and availability through several features, including
the following:

      Reliable Log Delivery. Several syslog implementations support the use of Transmission Control
       Protocol (TCP) in addition to UDP. TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that attempts to ensure
       the reliable delivery of information across networks. Using TCP helps to ensure that log entries
       reach their destination. Having this reliability requires the use of more network bandwidth; also,
       it typically takes more time for log entries to reach their destination. Some syslog
       implementations use log caching servers, as described in Section 3.1.
      Transmission Confidentiality Protection. RFC 3195 recommends the use of the Transport
       Layer Security (TLS) protocol to protect the confidentiality of transmitted syslog messages.32
       TLS can protect the messages during their entire transit between hosts. TLS can only protect the
       payloads of packets, not their IP headers, which means that an observer on the network can
       identify the source and destination of transmitted syslog messages, possibly revealing the IP
       addresses of the syslog servers and log sources. Some syslog implementations use other means to
       encrypt network traffic, such as passing syslog messages through secure shell (SSH) tunnels.
       Protecting syslog transmissions can require additional network bandwidth and increase the time
       needed for log entries to reach their destination.
      Transmission Integrity Protection and Authentication. RFC 3195 recommends that if
       integrity protection and authentication are desired, that a message digest algorithm be used. RFC
       3195 recommends the use of MD5; proposed revisions to RFC 3195 mention the use of SHA-1.
