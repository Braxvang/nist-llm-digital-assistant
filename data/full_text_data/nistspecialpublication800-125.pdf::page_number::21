                                                       GUIDE TO SECURITY FOR FULL VIRTUALIZATION TECHNOLOGIES



In some virtualization systems, guest OSs can be moved from one host computer to another when needed,
such as when a host needs to be rebooted or shut off for maintenance work, when a partial host failure or
an attack against the hypervisor or OS is detected, when there is a strong expectation of an impending
attack. This can lower the pressure to perform upgrades and replacements quickly, thus reducing
inconvenience to system administrators and providing more time for testing the changes. For server
virtualization, the hypervisor may be able to move its guest OSs to other host computers automatically; on
some VM systems, this can happen when the virtual machines are still running, and do not require a
shutdown or suspend of the guest operating system. For desktop virtualization, manual actions are
generally needed. A storage network is dedicated to perform these migrations or the transport channel is
fully authenticated and encrypted to preserve the integrity of the VMs and prevent information leakage.

For virtualization involving multiple physical servers, guest OS migration supports load balancing by
allowing dynamic control over which host each virtualized server is running on at any given time. For
example, if a particular host is being heavy utilized, nearly to the point of resource exhaustion, one or
more of its guest OSs could be transferred to hosts with lower utilization. This prevents denial of service
conditions, but is most often used simply to improve performance of the guest OSs.

A potential drawback of using guest OS migration is that if a guest OS has been compromised or contains
malicious code, but this malicious activity has not been detected, the guest OS could be migrated to
another host and could compromise that host. The same problem occurs when converting a compromised
physical system to a virtual machine.

The use of images can improve software testing practices. An organization can test an application on
multiple OSs without needing separate hardware for each OS. Additional physical test machines may still
be necessary to test hardware compatibility. Organizations should not depend solely on the results of tests
provided in a virtual environment. The virtualization environment may provide some functionality or
protections that do not exist on the target environment, potentially resulting in inaccurate results. In
particular, due to the overhead required for virtualization, load testing in a virtual environment may not
provide the same results as load testing in a physical environment. In addition to ensuring that the test
guest OS image is configured the same as the target environment, organizations should ensure that
additional tests will be performed on physical hardware.

Organizations can maintain known-good copies of each guest OS in a single place, allowing testers to
take advantage of a “fresh” copy of the guest OS for each test that restores the system to the desired
baseline. This allows testers to ensure that the test environment’s configuration matches that of the
production environment and that the effects of performing one test do not inadvertently affect the results
of a subsequent test. Also, through virtualization, testers can have access to multiple configurations and
platforms to test applications, software updates or patches in a secure, confined environment. By properly
configuring the guest OS, any configuration available on a production system can be replicated. In some
situations, testing can be performed on an exact copy of the production guest OS. In all these cases,
images can be used to good effect. Images holding an entire guest OS can be replicated for each fresh
copy, and many organizations keep their images on shared storage so that many departments can access
them easily.
