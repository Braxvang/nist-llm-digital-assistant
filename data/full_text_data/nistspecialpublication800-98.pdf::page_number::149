These general population / uncontrolled exposure limits are applicable in two situations. The first
situation is general public exposure. The second situation is when employees are exposed and are either
not fully aware of the potential for exposure or cannot control the exposure. The FCC also has published
maximum permissible exposure limits for occupational or controlled exposure.

      The letter f represents the frequency of the electromagnetic waves in MHz. The power density for the 0.3 – 1.34 MHz range
      and the 1.34 – 30 MHz range is a plane-wave equivalent power density. For more information, see FCC OET Bulletin 56,
      “Questions and Answers about Biological Effects and Potential Hazards of Radiofrequency Electromagnetic Fields,” Table
      1, p. 15.
