                                                                                     GUIDE TO GENERAL SERVER SECURITY



Organizations should conduct vulnerability scanning to validate that OSs and server software are up-to-
date on security patches and software versions. Vulnerability scanning is a labor-intensive activity that
requires a high degree of human involvement to interpret the results. It may also be disruptive to
operations by taking up network bandwidth, slowing network response times, and potentially affecting the
availability of the scanned server or its applications. However, vulnerability scanning is extremely
important for ensuring that vulnerabilities are mitigated as soon as possible, before they are discovered
and exploited by adversaries. Vulnerability scanning should be conducted on a weekly to monthly basis.
Many organizations also run a vulnerability scan whenever a new vulnerability database is released for
the organization’s scanner application. Vulnerability scanning results should be documented and
discovered deficiencies should be corrected.

Organizations should also consider running more than one vulnerability scanner. As previously
discussed, no scanner is able to detect all known vulnerabilities; however, using two scanners generally
increases the number of vulnerabilities detected. A common practice is to use one commercial and one
freeware scanner. Network-based and host-based vulnerability scanners are available for free or for a fee.

6.4.2    Penetration Testing

Penetration testing is “security testing in which evaluators attempt to circumvent the security features of a
system based on their understanding of the system design and implementation”. 45 The purpose of
penetration testing is to exercise system protections (particularly human response to attack indications) by
using common tools and techniques developed by attackers. This testing is highly recommended for
complex or critical servers.

Penetration testing can be an invaluable technique to any organization's information security program.
However, it is a very labor-intensive activity and requires great expertise to minimize the risk to targeted
systems. At a minimum, it may slow the organization's network response time because of network
mapping and vulnerability scanning. Furthermore, the possibility exists that systems may be damaged or
rendered inoperable in the course of penetration testing. Although this risk is mitigated by the use of
experienced penetration testers, it can never be fully eliminated.

Penetration testing does offer the following benefits: 46

 Tests the network using the same methodologies and tools employed by attackers

 Verifies whether vulnerabilities exist

 Goes beyond surface vulnerabilities and demonstrates how these vulnerabilities can be exploited
  iteratively to gain greater access

 Demonstrates that vulnerabilities are not purely theoretical

 Provides the “realism” necessary to address security issues

 Allows for testing of procedures and susceptibility of the human element to social engineering.
