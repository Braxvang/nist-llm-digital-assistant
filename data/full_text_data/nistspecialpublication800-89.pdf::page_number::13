SP 800-89                                                                            November 2006



           2. Verify that p and q were generated using one of the prime generation
              algorithms specified in Appendix A.1 of FIPS 186-32, and execute the
              appropriate validation algorithm. If p and q were not generated as specified in
              FIPS 186-3, or the validation algorithm returns INVALID, then return
              INVALID. Otherwise, go to step 3.
           3. If g was generated using the unverifiable generation method specified in
              Appendix A.2.1 of FIPS 186-3, then go to step 4. Otherwise, go to step 5.
           4. Perform a partial validation of g using the process specified in Annex A.2.2 of
              FIPS 186-3. If PARTIALLY VALID is returned, then return
              g_partially_validated. Otherwise, return INVALID.
           5. If g was generated using the verifiable generation method specified in
              Appendix A.2.3 of FIPS 186-3, perform the validation process specified in
              Appendix A.2.4 of FIPS 186-3. If this process returns INVALID, then return
              INVALID. Otherwise, return g_fully_validated.

4.2        Assurances When Domain Parameters are Generated by Another
           Entity
There are two basic scenarios for DSA and ECDSA domain parameter generation:
generation by a trusted party and generation by a non-trusted party.
Domain parameter generation by a trusted party means that this party is trusted by all
users in a particular (sub) domain to correctly generate valid sets of domain parameters.
This trusted party “guarantees” the validity of all sets of domain parameters that it
generates, and generates new sets of parameters as needed. Note that users outside the
particular (sub) domain may have little or no trust in the domain parameters generated by
this party.
The generation of (candidate) domain parameters by an untrusted party means that the
untrusting users require some evidence that the domain parameters are valid. These users
may be concerned that the (candidate) domain parameters are generated incorrectly, or
that the party generating the domain parameters may be an adversary that is trying to gain
an advantage by generating the parameters in a non-standard manner. If these situations
can arise, the (candidate) domain parameters shall be generated in a manner that will
allow any concerned user to obtain assurance that the parameters are indeed valid.
There are different methods of obtaining assurance of domain parameter validity that
depend on whether or not the user seeking assurance trusts the party that generated the
parameters.

4.2.1 Assurance When Domain Parameters are Generated by a Trusted
      Party
Domain parameters may be generated by a party (i.e., a TTP) that is trusted by an entity
to generate them correctly. Assurance of domain parameter validity is provided to the
