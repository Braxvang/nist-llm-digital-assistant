PA-2   ASSESS THE PROJECT
       PA-2.1 Assess the alignment of the security aspects of project objectives and plans with the
              project context.
       PA-2.2 Assess the security aspects of the management and technical plans against objectives to
              determine adequacy and feasibility.
       PA-2.3 Assess the security aspects of the project and technical status against appropriate plans
              to determine actual and projected cost, schedule, and performance variances.
       PA-2.4 Assess the adequacy of the security-relevant roles, responsibilities, accountabilities, and
              authorities.
       Note: This includes assessment of the adequacy of personnel competencies to perform project
       roles and accomplish project tasks.
       PA-2.5 Assess the security aspects of resource adequacy and availability.
       PA-2.6 Assess progress using measured security achievement and the security aspects of
              milestone completion.
       Note: This includes collecting and evaluating security-relevant data for labor, materials, service
       costs, and technical performance, as well as other technical data about security objectives.
       These are compared against security-relevant measures of achievement, including conducting
       effectiveness assessments to determine the adequacy of the evolving system to fulfill security
       requirements.
       PA-2.7 Conduct required management and technical reviews, audits, and inspections relevant
              to the security aspects of the project.
       Note: The reviews, audits, and inspections are formal or informal and are conducted to
       determine the security-relevant readiness to proceed to the next stage or milestone, to help
       ensure that project and technical security objectives are being meet, or to solicit feedback from
       stakeholders with security concerns.
       PA-2.8 Monitor the security aspects of critical processes and new technologies.
       Note: This includes identifying and evaluating technology maturity from a security perspective,
       as well as the feasibility of technology insertion for satisfying security objectives.
       PA-2.9 Make recommendations based on security measurement results and other security-
              relevant project information.
       Note: Measurement results are analyzed to identify security-relevant deviations, variations, or
       undesirable trends from planned values and to make security-relevant recommendations for
       corrective, preventive, adaptive, additive, or perfective actions.
       PA-2.10 Record and provide security status and security findings from the assessment tasks.
       PA-2.11 Monitor the security aspects of process execution within the project.
