Security mission area. For most cases, unauthorized disclosure of ground transportation
information will have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Some regulatory and tariff
enforcement functions associated with the safe passage of passengers and goods over land
involve relatively sensitive information. These are included in Law Enforcement. Unauthorized
disclosure of accident investigation information that has not yet been adequately researched,
coordinated, or edited can result in serious economic harm to individuals and to corporations.
Loss in public confidence is a further potential consequence. Additionally, some information
associated with ground transportation functions is proprietary to corporations or subject to
privacy laws (e.g., the Privacy Act of 1974). (The Privacy Act Information provisional impact
levels are documented in the Personal Identity and Authentication information type.) In such
cases, the confidentiality impact resulting from unauthorized disclosure may be moderate.

Some military ground transportation information is national security information and is outside
the scope of this guideline.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for ground transportation information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. In most cases,
the adverse effects of unauthorized modification or destruction of ground transportation
information on agency mission functions and public confidence in the agency will be limited.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Some ground transportation functions are
time-critical (e.g., track switching functions associated with rail travel). Unauthorized
modification or destruction of time-critical information necessary to these functions can result in
large-scale property loss and in loss of human lives. Such information will have a high integrity
impact level.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
ground transportation information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to ground transportation information.
Most ground transportation processes are tolerant of reasonable delays. In most cases,
disruption of access to ground transportation information can be expected to have only a
limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Some ground transportation functions
are time-critical (e.g., track switching functions associated with rail travel). Loss of
availability of time-critical information necessary to these functions can result in large-scale
