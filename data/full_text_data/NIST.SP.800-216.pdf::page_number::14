       Usage of Document Terminology
In the context of this document, the term “vulnerability” refers to a security vulnerability in an
information system. It does not refer to other kinds of vulnerabilities that may pertain to, for
example, physical security, economic security, or foreign policy issues.
The terms “should” and “should not” indicate that – among several possibilities – one is
recommended as particularly suitable without mentioning or excluding others, that a certain
course of action is preferred but not necessarily required, or that (in the negative form) a certain
possibility or course of action is discouraged but not prohibited. The terms “may” and “need not”
indicate a course of action permissible within the limits of the publication. The terms “can” and
“cannot” indicate a possibility and capability, whether material, physical, or causal.
This document leverages the ISO/IEC standards as much as possible in forming vulnerability
disclosure guidelines for the Federal Government. Federal vulnerability disclosure programs
should follow, to the extent possible, the terminology used in this document to facilitate
interoperability in communications (e.g., using the same names for the various actors), as well as
for internal efforts of identification, assessment, and the minimization or elimination of
vulnerabilities. When a needed term is not defined in this document but does exist in the
ISO/IEC standards, the term from the standards should be used. A glossary of the major terms
used in this document is provided in Appendix B.
