                                                         TECHNICAL GUIDE TO INFORMATION SECURITY TESTING AND ASSESSMENT



           –    Each rule is still required

           –    Rules enforce least privilege access, such as specifying only required IP addresses and ports

           –    More specific rules are triggered before general rules

           –    There are no unnecessary open ports that could be closed to tighten the perimeter security

           –    The ruleset does not allow traffic to bypass other security defenses

           –    For host-based firewall rulesets, the rules do not indicate the presence of backdoors, spyware
                activity, or prohibited applications such as peer-to-peer file sharing programs
       For IDS/IPS rulesets

           –    Unnecessary signatures have been disabled or removed to eliminate false positives and
                improve performance

           –    Necessary signatures are enabled and have been fine-tuned and properly maintained.
3.4      System Configuration Review

System configuration review is the process of identifying weaknesses in security configuration controls,
such as systems not being hardened or configured according to security policies. For example, this type
of review will reveal unnecessary services and applications, improper user account and password settings,
and improper logging and backup settings. Examples of security configuration files that may be reviewed
are Windows security policy settings and Unix security configuration files such as those in /etc.

Assessors using manual review techniques rely on security configuration guides or checklists to verify
that system settings are configured to minimize security risks. 8 To perform a manual system
configuration review, assessors access various security settings on the device being evaluated and
compare them with recommended settings from the checklist. Settings that do not meet minimum
security standards are flagged and reported.

The Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) is a method for using specific standards to enable
automated vulnerability management, measurement, and policy compliance evaluation. 9 NIST SCAP
files are written for FISMA compliance and NIST SP 800-53A security control testing. Other tools can
be used to retrieve and report security settings and provide remediation guidance. Automated tools are
often executed directly on the device being assessed, but can also be executed on a system with network
access to the device being assessed. While automated system configuration reviews are faster than
manual methods, there may still be settings that must be checked manually. Both manual and automated
methods require root or administrator privileges to view selected security settings.

Generally it is preferable to use automated checks instead of manual checks whenever feasible.
Automated checks can be done very quickly and provide consistent, repeatable results. Having a person
manually checking hundreds or thousands of settings is tedious and error-prone.
