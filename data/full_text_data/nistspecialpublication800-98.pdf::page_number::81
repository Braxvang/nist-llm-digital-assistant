Applicability: Shielding is applicable for contexts in which eavesdropping or RF radiation is a concern,
and the use of temporary shielding would not stop valid transactions.

Benefits: Shielding can limit the ability of eavesdroppers or unauthorized readers to collect data from an
RFID system.

Weaknesses:

 Shielding can prevent or hinder legitimate transactions. For example, shielded containers require
  objects to be physically removed from the shielding material. This prevents an implementing
  organization from realizing one of the key benefits of RFID technology, which is to read tags
  remotely without optical line of sight and additional handling.
 It may still be possible for an adversary to place a radio inside the shielded area. The radio could be
  used for malicious purposes, such as eavesdropping on RFID transactions or causing interference.
5.3.2.4 Radio Frequency Selection

Control: RFID technology can communicate over various radio frequencies, including those in the LF,
HF, UHF, and microwave bands. Particular fixed frequencies can be assigned to an RFID application to
avoid or reduce the effects of radio interference. Some tag technologies can perform frequency hopping
within a limited frequency range, but in these cases, the technique is used primarily to avoid collisions
with other tag transactions, not radio interference with different types of radio systems. 60 In some cases,

60
     For example, EPCglobal Class-1 Generation-2 915 MHz UHF systems use frequency hopping techniques. This capability is
     built into tags complying with the standard. Therefore, organizations implementing RFID systems using EPCglobal Class-1
     Generation-2 compliant equipment do not have to configure this capability.
