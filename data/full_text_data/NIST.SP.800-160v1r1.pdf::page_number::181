Appendix J. Organizational Project-Enabling Processes
This appendix contains the Organizational Project-Enabling Processes from [4] with security-
relevant considerations and contributions for the purpose, outcomes, activities, and tasks.

J.1.     Life Cycle Model Management
The purpose of the Life Cycle Model Management process is to define, maintain, and help ensure
the availability of policies, life cycle processes, life cycle models, and procedures for use by the
organization with respect to the scope of this International Standard.

J.1.1. Security Purpose
-   Ensure that security needs and considerations are incorporated into the policies, life cycle
    processes, life cycle models, and procedures used by the organization.

J.1.2. Security Outcomes
-   Security considerations are captured in organizational policies and procedures for the
    management and deployment of life cycle models and processes.
-   Security roles, responsibilities, accountabilities, and authorities within life cycle policies,
    processes, models, and procedures are defined.
-   The selection of policies, life cycle processes, life cycle models, and procedures for use by
    the organization is informed by security needs and considerations.
-   Security needs and considerations for policies, life cycle processes, life cycle models, and
    procedures for use by the organization are assessed.
-   Prioritized security-relevant process, model, and procedure improvements are implemented.

J.1.3. Security Activities and Tasks
LM-1     ESTABLISH THE LIFE CYCLE PROCESSES
         LM-1.1 Establish policies and procedures for process management and deployment that are
                consistent with the security aspects of organizational strategies.
         Note: The policies and procedures may be security-focused, security-based, or may have
         security-informing aspects.
         LM-1.2 Establish the security aspects of the life cycle processes that implement the
                requirements of [4] and are consistent with organizational strategies.
         LM-1.3 Define the security roles, responsibilities, accountabilities, and authorities to facilitate
                implementation of the security aspects of life cycle processes and the strategic
                management of life cycles.
         LM-1.4 Define the security aspects of the criteria that control progression through the life cycle.
