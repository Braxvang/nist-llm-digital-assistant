Special Publication 800-137                      Information Security Continuous Monitoring for
                                                 Federal Information Systems and Organizations




 Patch Management             The systematic notification, identification, deployment,
 [CNSSI 4009]                 installation, and verification of operating system and application
                              software code revisions. These revisions are known as patches,
                              hot fixes, and service packs.

 Penetration Testing          A test methodology in which assessors, using all available
 [NISTIR 7298]                documentation (e.g., system design, source code, manuals) and
                              working under specific constraints, attempt to circumvent the
                              security features of an information system.

 Plan of Action &             A document that identifies tasks needing to be accomplished. It
 Milestones (POA&M)           details resources required to accomplish the elements of the plan,
 [OMB Memorandum 02-01]       any milestones in meeting the tasks, and scheduled completion
                              dates for the milestones.

 Potential Impact             The loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability could be
 [FIPS 199]                   expected to have: (i) a limited adverse effect (FIPS 199 low); (ii)
                              a serious adverse effect (FIPS 199 moderate); or (iii) a severe or
                              catastrophic adverse effect (FIPS 199 high) on organizational
                              operations, organizational assets, or individuals.

 Records                      The recordings (automated and/or manual) of evidence of
 [CNSSI 4009]                 activities performed or results achieved (e.g., forms, reports, test
                              results), which serve as a basis for verifying that the organization
                              and the information system are performing as intended. Also used
                              to refer to units of related data fields (i.e., groups of data fields
                              that can be accessed by a program and that contain the complete
                              set of information on particular items).

 Resilience                   The ability to continue to: (i) operate under adverse conditions or
 [NIST SP 800-39, Adapted]    stress, even if in a degraded or debilitated state, while maintaining
                              essential operational capabilities; and (ii) recover to an effective
                              operational posture in a time frame consistent with mission needs.

 Risk                         A measure of the extent to which an entity is threatened by a
 [FIPS 200, Adapted]          potential circumstance or event, and typically a function of: (i)
                              the adverse impacts that would arise if the circumstance or event
                              occurs; and (ii) the likelihood of occurrence.
                              [Note: Information system-related security risks are those risks
                              that arise from the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability
                              of information or information systems and reflect the potential
                              adverse impacts to organizational operations (including mission,
                              functions, image, or reputation), organizational assets,
                              individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. Adverse impacts
                              to the Nation include, for example, compromises to information
                              systems that support critical infrastructure applications or are
                              paramount to government continuity of operations as defined by
                              the Department of Homeland Security.]
