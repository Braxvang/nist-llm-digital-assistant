 Passive. A passive sensor is deployed so that it monitors a copy of the actual network traffic; no
  traffic actually passes through the sensor. Passive sensors are typically deployed so that they can
  monitor key network locations, such as the divisions between networks, and key network segments,
  such as activity on a demilitarized zone (DMZ) subnet. Passive sensors can monitor traffic through
  various methods, including the following:

   â€“   Spanning Port. Many switches have a spanning port, which is a port that can see all network
       traffic going through the switch. Connecting a sensor to a spanning port can allow it to monitor
       traffic going to and from many hosts. Although this monitoring method is relatively easy and
       inexpensive, it can also be problematic. If a switch is configured or reconfigured incorrectly, the
       spanning port might not be able to see all the traffic. Another problem with spanning ports is that
       their use can be resource-intensive; when a switch is under heavy loads, its spanning port might
