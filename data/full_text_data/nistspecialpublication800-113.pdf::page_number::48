the VPN device is placed in the DMZ. The DMZ is a network segment attached to a firewall interface.
Although it is not shown in the diagram, placement of an additional firewall between the SSL VPN
device and the internal network is highly recommended. That ensures both front-end and back-end
protection for the SSL VPN device. An alternate approach is a two-DMZ architecture, placing the SSL
VPN device, front- and back-ended by a firewall, on a separate DMZ segment.

This approach has some advantages and disadvantages when compared to the other options:

Advantages:

 Compromise of the device does not necessarily mean that the attacker has full access to the internal
  network.
 Traffic between the device and the internal network must go through the firewall, so the traffic is still
  subject to the firewall’s policies.
 An intrusion detection system (IDS) within the DMZ can analyze the traffic destined for the internal
  network for malicious activity.
Disadvantages:

 Numerous ports from the device to internal hosts must be opened in the firewall. User traffic from
  the VPN device will only reach internal hosts if these holes are opened. Despite one of the previously
  mentioned advantages of this approach, an attacker that compromises the VPN device will have
  access to the internal network through these holes. However, of the three solutions, this approach
  best minimizes the impact of a VPN breach.
