                                                            CLOUD COMPUTING SYNOPSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



 Legal. Consumers should investigate whether a provider can support ad hoc legal requests for: (1) e-
  Discovery, such as litigation freezes, and (2) preservation of data and meta-data.
 Operating Policies. Consumers should ascertain the operating policies of providers for their: (1)
  willingness to be subjected to external audits and security certifications, (2) incident response and
  recovery procedures/practices, including forensic analysis capabilities, (3) internal investigation
  processes with respect to illegal or inappropriate usage of IT resources, and (4) policies for vetting of
  privileged uses such as the provider’s system and network administrators.
 Acceptable Use Policies. Consumers should ensure that all consumer personnel read and understand
  the provider’s acceptable use policy, and negotiate an agreement for resolution of specific classes of
  policy violations in advance with the provider. Further, it is important that consumers know the
  process a priori for how disputes over possible policy violations will be resolved between themselves
  and the provider.
 Licensing. Consumers should ensure that both the provider and consumer properly license any
  proprietary software installed into a cloud.
 Patch Management. Consumers and providers should agree on a set of procedures a consumer needs
  to perform to take an application offline (whether a software patch is going to be installed by the
  provider or consumer), the testing that must be performed to ensure the application continues to
  perform as intended, and the procedures needed to bring the application back online. Plans for system
  maintenance should be expressed in the service agreement.
9.2   Data Governance

 Data Access Standards. Before a decision is made to develop new applications in a cloud,
  consumers should ensure that the application infrastructure interfaces provided in that cloud are
  generic or at least that data adaptors could be developed so that portability and interoperability of the
  application is not significantly impacted. Consumers should choose clouds that work with well-
  documented data access protocols.
 Data Separation. When data of differing levels of sensitivity are to be processed in a cloud, multiple
  distinct clouds can be used concurrently to provide different levels of protection to sensitive and
  nonsensitive data. When this approach is taken, protective mechanisms should be required by
  consumers for separating sensitive and nonsensitive data at the provider’s site.
 Data Integrity. Consumers should employ checksums and replication techniques for data integrity.
  Data can be protected from unauthorized modification in a cloud if it is check-summed and validated
  on use, and if the check-sums are stored separately.
 Data Regulations. A consumer should assess the risks of having their data processed or stored in a
  cloud since the consumer is ultimately responsible for all compliances with data-related laws and
  regulations. Consumers should require that a cloud provider meet international, Federal, or state
  statutes and directives with which they must comply, e.g., that may prohibit the storage of data
  outside certain physical boundaries or borders.
 Data Disposition. Consumers should require that a cloud provider offer a mechanism for reliably
  deleting consumer data on request as well as providing evidence that the data was deleted.
 Data Recovery. Consumers should be able to examine the capabilities of providers with respect to:
  (1) data backup, (2) archiving, and (3) recovery.
