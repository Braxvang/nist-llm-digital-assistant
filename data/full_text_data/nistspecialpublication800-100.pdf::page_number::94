CHAPTER 10                                                           Risk Management




     Risk management is an aggregation of three processes that have their roots in
several federal laws, regulations, and guidelines, including the Computer Security Act
of 1987, the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), Office of
Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, and National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-30, Risk Management Guide for
Information Technology Systems. The three processes are risk assessment, risk
mitigation, and evaluation and assessment. If applied appropriately and with due
diligence, this process meets the FISMA requirements of “providing information
security protections commensurate with the risk and magnitude of the harm
resulting from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or
destruction of…information…and…information systems” collected by and used by the
federal government, and “ensuring that information security management processes
are integrated with agency strategic and operational planning processes.”

10.1 Risk Assessment
     To understand the risk assessment process, it is essential to define the term risk.
NIST SP 800-30 defines risk as “a function of the likelihood of a given threat source’s
exercising a particular potential vulnerability, and the resulting impact of that
adverse event on the organization.” In other words, where a threat intersects with a
vulnerability, risk is present. With this definition of risk in mind, the goal of the risk
assessment process is to identify and assess the risks to a given environment. The
depth of the risk assessment performed can vary greatly and is determined by the
criticality and sensitivity of the system, as applied to confidentiality, integrity, and
availability, a process which is described in detail in Federal Information Processing
Standard (FIPS) 199. To meet the goal of the risk assessment, a nine-step process
is defined in NIST SP 800-30 and summarized here. To simplify the process
somewhat, the nine-step process described in NIST SP 800-30 is reduced to a six-
