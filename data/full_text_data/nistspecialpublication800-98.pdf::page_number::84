GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



Applicability: Primarily access control or automated payment applications in which the holder of the tag
desires or requires control over when tag transactions occur.

Benefits: A press-to-activate switch provides a user with physical control over when and where the tag
can respond to a reader. Consequently, this control mitigates privacy and business intelligence risks by
providing a countermeasure to the threat of eavesdropping and the execution of unauthorized tag
commands. Eavesdropping would be limited to the immediate vicinity of authorized readers and tracking
beyond the immediate vicinity of the authorized readers would not be possible.

This control also provides assurance that a person is knowingly in possession of the tag, and that it has
not been intentionally or inadvertently separated from that person. For example, this control could be
useful in ticketing or access control applications in which the objective is to get an accurate count of the
number of individuals present, and to prevent spare tags in pockets or bags from interfering with the
accuracy of the count.

Weaknesses:

 Requiring the user to activate the tag would require some level of instruction, however minimal,
  which might add a cost or delay in the business process. For example, the user would need to know
  when and for how long they would need to activate the tag.
 Some users may consider activating a switch to be an inconvenience, which could hinder user
  acceptance of the technology.
 A press-to-activate switch could distract the user from other functions that the user is performing.
  For example, a press-to-activate switch is not an appropriate control for an automated toll-payment
  system because the user needs to have both hands available for driving the vehicle.
5.3.2.8 Tag Polling

Control: A reader periodically queries the tag to determine its continued presence and operating status.

Applicability: Process control or asset management applications in which a design objective is periodic
or near continuous monitoring. Examples include medical facilities that require real-time inventory of
certain medical supplies or systems that collect sensor data. Tag polling also is applicable for high-value
business processes that require early indications of system failures or performance problems. This control
is most effective in applications in which those with access to the tags are trusted or when detaching the
tag is not feasible (e.g., when a tag is embedded in another item such as a poker chip).

Benefits: Operators obtain timely information about system failures, item theft, or unusual
environmental conditions that enables them to proactively address problems.

Weaknesses: Tag polling:

 Reduces the battery life of active and semi-active tags,
 May not detect critical events in a timely manner if the polling frequency is too low,
 Is a business intelligence risk if the tag polling enables an adversary to perform traffic analysis, or
  track or target tags that might have otherwise remained silent, and.
 Could be circumvented in some cases by detaching the tag, taking the item, and leaving the tag
  behind so that it continues to signal its presence to readers.
