                                                                           GUIDE TO COMPUTER SECURITY LOG MANAGEMENT



applications such as supply chain management, financial management, procurement systems, enterprise
resource planning, and customer relationship management. In addition to COTS and GOTS software,
most organizations also use custom-developed applications tailored to their specific requirements.8

Some applications generate their own log files, while others use the logging capabilities of the OS on
which they are installed. Applications vary significantly in the types of information that they log. The
following lists some of the most commonly logged types of information and the potential benefits of
each:9

     Client requests and server responses, which can be very helpful in reconstructing sequences of
      events and determining their apparent outcome. If the application logs successful user
      authentications, it is usually possible to determine which user made each request. Some
      applications can perform highly detailed logging, such as e-mail servers recording the sender,
      recipients, subject name, and attachment names for each e-mail; Web servers recording each URL
      requested and the type of response provided by the server; and business applications recording
      which financial records were accessed by each user. This information can be used to identify or
      investigate incidents and to monitor application usage for compliance and auditing purposes.
     Account information such as successful and failed authentication attempts, account changes
      (e.g., account creation and deletion, account privilege assignment), and use of privileges. In
      addition to identifying security events such as brute force password guessing and escalation of
      privileges, it can be used to identify who has used the application and when each person has used
      it.
     Usage information such as the number of transactions occurring in a certain period (e.g., minute,
      hour) and the size of transactions (e.g., e-mail message size, file transfer size). This can be useful
      for certain types of security monitoring (e.g., a ten-fold increase in e-mail activity might indicate
      a new e-mail–borne malware threat; an unusually large outbound e-mail message might indicate
      inappropriate release of information).
     Significant operational actions such as application startup and shutdown, application failures,
      and major application configuration changes. This can be used to identify security compromises
      and operational failures.
Much of this information, particularly for applications that are not used through unencrypted network
communications, can only be logged by the applications, which makes application logs particularly
valuable for application-related security incidents, auditing, and compliance efforts. However, these logs
are often in proprietary formats that make them more difficult to use, and the data they contain is often
highly context-dependent, necessitating more resources to review their contents.

Figure 2-3 contains a sample log entry from a Web server log, along with an explanation of the
information recorded in the entry.

    A single implementation of an application could also be used by multiple organizations. For example, a parent organization
    could host an application that its member agencies all use. The logs for the agencies’ use of the application would most
    likely be managed by the parent organization, but each individual agency might also have the ability to review the log
    information for its own users.

    An organization should consider having a policy that defines the logging requirements for custom applications developed for
    it. Such a policy helps to ensure that applications will log the information necessary to support the security of the
    application and the auditing of its use.
