6.4.5. Response Improvements (RS.IM)
Organizational response activities are improved by incorporating lessons learned from current
and previous detection and response activities. Organizations should designate one or more
individuals to be responsible for documenting and communicating response actions to the
incident response team, which can later be reviewed for lessons learned.

       Recover (RC)
Timely recovery to normal operations after a cybersecurity incident is critical. The Recover
Function addresses developing and implementing activities to maintain system resilience and
ensure timely restoration of capabilities and services affected by a cybersecurity incident.

6.5.1. Recovery Planning (RC.RP)
When recovering from events, organizations should attempt to capture details associated with the
execution of the documented recovery plans. Capturing execution details may help organizations
during the post-incident review process to determine whether any gaps or potential opportunities
for improvement in the recovery plan should be considered. Due to the time sensitivity of
recovery efforts, organizations may want to consider other techniques (e.g., reviewing logs,
reviewing video footage captured during the recovery activities, or interviewing recovery
personnel) if capturing execution details impacts safety or increases the time to complete the
recovery plan.
Supplemental guidance for recovery planning can be found in the following documents:
   •   NIST SP 800-184, Guide for Cybersecurity Event Recovery
   •   NIST SP 800-209, Security Guidelines for Storage Infrastructure

6.5.2. Recovery Improvements (RC.IM)
As a recovery effort is ongoing, the recovery steps taken should be documented to identify
lessons learned. These lessons can be used to improve recovery plans and processes.
Supplemental guidance for recovery improvements can be found in the following document:
