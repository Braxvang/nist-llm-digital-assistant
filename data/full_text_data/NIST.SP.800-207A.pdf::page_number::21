       Role of the Service Mesh in Policy Deployment, Enforcement, and Updates
The service mesh has a unique role within the overall policy life cycle activities of policy
definition, deployment, enforcement, and update. As already stated, the service mesh is a
dedicated infrastructure that provides all application services, including security controls like
secure communication and application-level access control. These services are only possible if
there are also policies to enforce them during application runtime.
Based on the discussion of the control plane in previous sections, it should be clear that this
component of the service mesh provides access to the interfaces of various policy definition tools
through which policies can be defined and updated. Thus, the control plane of the service mesh
acts as the policy administration point, while the underlying policy tools become the policy
decision point. In addition, the control plane also enables those policies to be distributed to the
various proxies described in the previous section. Once distributed, these proxies intercept all
traffic in and out of the applications, where it acts as a universal policy enforcement point. This
allows the service mesh — which centrally manages a fleet of the applications’ proxies — to
become the modern cloud-native security kernel [3].
The proxies — especially the sidecars — can enforce security and traffic policies and generate
telemetry data to allow operators to close the loop on policy changes by authoring a change,
observing its effect on the runtime, and making additional changes as needed in a real-time
feedback control loop. In other words, the mesh provides the needed capabilities to implement
the runtime controls and achieve a zero trust posture.
