G.3.2. Polynomial Basis to Normal Basis Conversion
Let α be an element of the field GF(2m) with bit-string representation p with respect to a given
polynomial basis and bit-string representation n with respect to a given normal basis. The bit
strings p and n are related via
                                               p Γ = n,
where Γ is an (m × m) matrix with entries in GF(2). The matrix Γ, which only depends on the
bases, can be easily computed given its second-to-last row. For each conversion, that second-to-
last row is given below.

If r is the second-to-last row of Γ and represents the element β of GF(2m) with respect to the
normal basis, then the rows of Γ from top to bottom are the bit-string representations of the
elements
                                      β m–1, β m–2, …, β 2, β, 1
with respect to this normal basis. (Note that the element 1 is represented by the all-1 bit string.)
Alternatively, the matrix is the inverse of the matrix described in Appendix G.3.3.
More details of these computations can be found in Annex A.7 of the IEEE Standard 1363-2000
standard [IEEE_1363].

G.3.3. Normal Basis to Polynomial Basis Conversion
Let α be an element of the field GF(2m) with bit-string representation n with respect to a given
normal basis and bit-string representation p with respect to a given polynomial basis. The bit
strings p and n are related via
                                               n ∆ = p,
