CHAPTER 6                                                           Interconnecting Systems


availability of the connected systems and the data they store, process, and transmit, the parties
agree to provide notice of specific events within the time frames indicated below:

   Security Incidents: Technical staff will immediately notify their designated counterparts by
telephone or e-mail when a security incident(s) is detected, so the other party may take steps to
determine whether its system has been compromised and to take appropriate security
precautions. The system owner will receive formal notification in writing within five (5) business
days after detection of the incident(s).

  Disasters and Other Contingencies: Technical staff will immediately notify their designated
counterparts by telephone or e-mail in the event of a disaster or other contingency that disrupts
the normal operation of one or both of the connected systems.

   Material Changes to System Configuration: Planned technical changes to the system
architecture will be reported to technical staff before such changes are implemented. The
initiating party agrees to conduct a risk assessment based on the new system architecture and to
modify and re-sign the ISA within one (1) month of implementation.

  New Interconnections: The initiating party will notify the other party at least one (1) month
before it connects its information system with any other information system, including systems
that are owned and operated by third parties.

  Personnel Changes: The parties agree to provide notification of the separation or long-term
absence of their respective system owner or technical lead. In addition, both parties will provide
notification of any changes in point of contact information. Both parties also will provide
notification of changes to user profiles, including users who resign or change job responsibilities.

INTERCONNECTION SECURITY AGREEMENT

The technical details of the interconnection will be documented in an Interconnection Security
Agreement (ISA). The parties agree to work together to develop the ISA, which must be signed
by both parties before the interconnection is activated. Proposed changes to either system or the
interconnecting medium will be reviewed and evaluated to determine the potential impact on the
interconnection. The ISA will be renegotiated before changes are implemented. Signatories to the
ISA shall be the AO for each system.

SECURITY

Both parties agree to work together to ensure the joint security of the connected systems and the
data they store, process, and transmit, as specified in the ISA. Based on National Institute of
Standards and Technology Special Publication 800-53, Recommended Security Controls for
Federal Information Systems, both parties should authorize all connections from the information
system to other information systems outside of that accreditation boundary and monitor and
control the system interconnections on an ongoing basis. Each party should identify security
controls that apply to the interconnection based on each systemâ€™s information security
categorization and impact level and agree on a mutual set of applicable controls. Each party
certifies that its respective system is designed, managed, and operated in compliance with all
relevant federal laws, regulations, and policies, and will ensure that appropriate security controls
are maintained throughout the life of this MOU/MOA.

PRIVACY REQUIREMENTS

Both parties agree to examine privacy issues related to data that will be exchanged or passed
over the interconnection and determine whether such use is restricted under current statutes,
regulations, or policies. Examples of data that might be restricted include personally identifiable
information such as names and social security numbers, or confidential business information
