CHAPTER 10                                                          Risk Management


10.1.3 Step 3 – Vulnerability Identification
    NIST SP 800-30 defines vulnerability as “a flaw or weakness in system security
procedures, design, implementation, or internal controls that could be exercised
(accidentally triggered or intentionally exploited) and result in a security breach or a
violation of the system’s security policy.” Vulnerabilities can be identified using a
combination of a number of techniques and sources. Reviews of such sources as
previous risk assessments, audit reports, vulnerability lists [e.g., NIST National
Vulnerability Database (NVD), formerly known as I-CAT, found at nvd.nist.gov], and
security advisories can be used to begin the process of vulnerability identification.
System security testing, using methods such as automated vulnerability scanning
tools; security, test, and evaluation (ST&E); and penetration testing can be used to
augment the vulnerability source reviews and identify vulnerabilities that may not
have been previously identified in other sources.
    In addition, developing a security requirements checklist based on the security
requirements specified for the system during the conceptual, design, and
implementation phases of the SDLC can be used to provide a 360-degree inspection
of the system. The checklist can be developed using the guidance provided in NIST
SP 800-53A, Guide for Assessing the Security Controls in Federal Information
Systems (draft), and NIST SP 800-53, Recommended Security Controls for Federal
Information Systems, to ensure the inclusion of appropriate questions in the areas of
management, operational, and technical security controls. The results of the
checklist (or questionnaire) can be used as input for evaluating compliance and
noncompliance, which in turn identifies system, process, and procedural weaknesses
that represent potential vulnerabilities.

10.1.4 Step 4 – Risk Analysis
    The risk analysis is a determination (or estimation) of risk to the system, an
analysis that requires the consideration of closely interwoven factors, such as the
security controls in place for the system under review, the likelihood that those
controls will be either insufficient or ineffective protection of the system, and the
impact of that failure. In other words, it is not possible to estimate the level of risk
posed by the successful exploitation of a given vulnerability without considering the
efficacy of the security controls that have been or are to be implemented to mitigate
or eliminate the potential for such an exploitation; nor the threat’s motivation,
opportunity, and capabilities, which contribute to the likelihood of a successful
attack; nor the impact to the system and organization should successful exploitation
of a vulnerability occur. The following four steps—control analysis, likelihood
determination, impact analysis, and risk determination—are, in a practical sense,
performed simultaneously or nearly simultaneously because they are so tightly linked
to each other.

10.1.4.1 Control Analysis
    As previously discussed, the analysis of controls in place to protect the system
can be accomplished using a checklist or questionnaire, which is based on the
security requirements for the system as specified by NIST SP 800-53. This analysis
can be refined using the NIST SP 800-53A, Guide for Assessing the Security Controls
in Federal Information Systems (draft), which provides guidance on testing security
controls extracted from NIST SP 800-53. The results are used to strengthen the
determination of the likelihood that a specific threat might successfully exploit a
particular vulnerability.
