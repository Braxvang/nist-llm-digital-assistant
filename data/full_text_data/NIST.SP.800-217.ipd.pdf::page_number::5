83    Reports on Computer Systems Technology

84    The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and
85    Technology (NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical
86    leadership for the Nation’s measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops
87    tests, test methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations, and technical
88    analyses to advance the development and productive use of information technology. ITL’s
89    responsibilities include the development of management, administrative, technical, and
90    physical standards and guidelines for the cost-effective security and privacy of other
91    than national security-related information in federal information systems. The Special
92    Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research, guidelines, and outreach efforts in
93    information system security, and its collaborative activities with industry, government,
94    and academic organizations.

95    Abstract

96    FIPS 201 defines the requirements and characteristics of government-wide interoperable
97    identity credentials used by federal employees and contractors. It also calls for the
98    federated use of those credentials. These guidelines provide technical requirements
99    for federal agencies implementing digital identity services for federal employees and
100   contractors and are not intended to constrain the development or use of standards outside
101   of this purpose. This document focuses on the use of federated PIV identity and the use
102   of assertions to implement PIV federations backed by PIV identity accounts and PIV
103   credentials. Federation allows a PIV identity account to be used by relying parties outside
104   the PIV identity account’s home agency.

109   Note to Reviewers

110   The family of PIV credentials includes a variety of form factors and authenticator
111   types – as envisioned in OMB Memoranda M-19-22 and M-22-09 and subsequently
112   outlined in FIPS 201-3. The cross-domain and interagency use of these credentials is
113   provided by federation protocols outlined in this public draft SP 800-217 Guidelines for
114   PIV Federation. The companion document, SP 800-157r1 Guidelines for Derived PIV
115   Credentials, details the authenticators themselves. Both documents are closely aligned
116   with draft release SP 800-63-4 Digital Identity Guidelines. NIST hopes that the draft
117   document enable a close alignment with new and emerging digital identity and federation
