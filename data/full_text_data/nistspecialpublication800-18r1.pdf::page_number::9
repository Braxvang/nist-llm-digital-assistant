                        Guide for Developing Security Plans for Federal Information Systems



    •    Chapter 1 includes background information relevant to the system security
         planning process, target audience, information on FIPS 199, Standards for
         Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems, a
         discussion of the various categories of information systems, identification of
         related NIST publications, and a description of the roles and responsibilities
         related to the development of system security plans.
    •    Chapter 2 discusses how agencies should analyze their information system
         inventories in the process of establishing system boundaries. It also discusses
         identification of common security controls and scoping guidance.
    •    Chapter 3 takes the reader through the steps of system security plan development.
    •    Appendix A provides a system security plan template.
    •    Appendix B provides a glossary of terms and definitions.
    •    Appendix C includes references that support this publication.


1.4 Systems Inventory and Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS 199)
FISMA requires that agencies have in place an information systems inventory. All
information systems in the inventory should be categorized using FIPS 199 as a first step
in the system security planning activity.

FIPS 199 is the mandatory standard to be used by all federal agencies to categorize all
information and information systems collected or maintained by or on behalf of each
agency based on the objectives of providing appropriate levels of information security
according to impact. Security categorization standards for information and information
systems provide a common framework and understanding for expressing security that, for
the federal government, promotes: (i) effective management and oversight of information
security programs, including the coordination of information security efforts throughout
the civilian, national security, emergency preparedness, homeland security, and law
enforcement communities; and (ii) consistent reporting to the Office of Management and
Budget (OMB) and Congress on the adequacy and effectiveness of information security
policies, procedures, and practices.


1.5 Major Applications, General Support Systems, and Minor Applications
All information systems must be covered by a system security plan and labeled as a
major application1 or general support system.2 Specific system security plans for minor




1
  OMB Circular A-130, Appendix III, defines major application as an application that requires special
attention to security due to the risk and magnitude of harm resulting from the loss, misuse, or unauthorized
access to or modification of the information in the application.
2
  OMB Circular A-130, Appendix III, defines general support system as an interconnected set of
information resources under the same direct management control that shares common functionality. It
normally includes hardware, software, information, data, applications, communications, and people.
