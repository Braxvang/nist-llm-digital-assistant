1853   Entropy
1854   A measure of the amount of uncertainty an attacker faces to determine the value of a
1855   secret. Entropy is usually stated in bits. A value having n bits of entropy has the same
1856   degree of uncertainty as a uniformly distributed n-bit random value.

1857   Equity
1858   Per EO 13985, Equity refers to the consistent and systematic fair, just, and impartial
1859   treatment of all individuals, including individuals who belong to underserved
1860   communities that have been denied such treatment, such as Black, Latino, and Indigenous
1861   and Native American persons, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, and other persons
1862   of color; members of religious minorities; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer
1863   (LGBTQ+) persons; persons with disabilities; persons who live in rural areas; and persons
1864   otherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality.

1865   Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS)
1866   Under the Information Technology Management Reform Act (Public Law 104-106),
1867   the Secretary of Commerce approves the standards and guidelines that the National
1868   Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) develops for federal computer systems.
1869   NIST issues these standards and guidelines as Federal Information Processing Standards
1870   (FIPS) for government-wide use. NIST develops FIPS when there are compelling federal
1871   government requirements, such as for security and interoperability, and there are no
1872   acceptable industry standards or solutions. See background information for more details.
1873   FIPS documents are available online on the FIPS home page: https://www.nist.gov/itl/fips.

1875   Federated Identifier
1876   The combination of a subject identifier within an assertion and an identifier for the IdP
1877   that issued that assertion. When combined, these pieces of information uniquely identify
1878   the subscriber in the context of a federation transaction.

1879   Federation
1880   A process that allows the conveyance of identity and authentication information across a
1881   set of networked systems.

1882   Federation Assurance Level (FAL)
1883   A category describing the assertion protocol used by the federation to communicate
1884   authentication and attribute information (if applicable) to an RP.

1885   Federation Proxy
1886   A component that acts as a logical RP to a set of IdPs and a logical IdP to a set of RPs,
1887   bridging the two systems with a single component. These are sometimes referred to as
1888   “brokers”.
