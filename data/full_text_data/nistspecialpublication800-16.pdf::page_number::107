     Definition    —       The system life cycle is a model for building and operating an FT system
                           from its initial inception to its termination and disposal of assets. The
                           model includes six phases: Initiation, Development, Test and Evaluation,
                           Implementation, Operations, and Termination. Life cycle security is the
                           ensemble of processes and procedures which ensures data confidentiality, as
                           needed, as well as data and system integrity, and availability.


                           The initiation phase is the series of steps followed to ensure that security
                           requirements are considered and resolved as new information systems and
                           technologies are planned.

     Behavioral Outcome          —   Individuals with management responsibilities are able to identify
                                     steps in the system development life cycle where security
                                     requirements and concerns (e.g., confidentiality, integrity, and
                                     availability) need to be considered and to define the processes to be
                                     used to resolve those concerns.

            security concerns.

     3.     Advanced    — Analyze    identified IT security strategies and select those that are the best
            approach/practice.
