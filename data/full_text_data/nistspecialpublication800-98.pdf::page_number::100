GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



use of PHI. In all but a few circumstances, disclosure of PHI is only permitted if the organization has
obtained the individual's consent in advance. The security rule addresses an organization’s infrastructure
requirements to assure secure and private communication, as well as the confidentiality of patient
information.

To comply with HIPAA, organizations must identify how RFID-enabled business processes create,
collect, store, monitor, transmit, or share PHI. In particular, organizations should explore how PHI may
be established through indirect means, including scenarios in which information obtained from RFID tags
may be combined with other data to infer someone’s identity or link it with health information. One
example mentioned previously is the possibility that, without implementation of appropriate controls,
someone may be able to identify that an individual is consuming prescription drugs or a particular type of
drug by surreptitiously reading information on a tagged label. Scenarios involving medical devices may
present similar risks. Perhaps the greatest HIPAA privacy compliance challenges occur when RFID-
tagged medical services and products are delivered or purchased outside the boundaries of hospitals or
doctor offices because it is more difficult to enforce controls in these circumstances.

6.6   Federal CIO Council Privacy Control Families

Organizations may be required to implement privacy controls to comply with the laws and regulations
discussed earlier in this section or they may do so voluntarily to protect and improve relationships with
customers, business partners, and employees. To assist agencies with their privacy programs, the Federal
Chief Information Officers (CIO) Council (“CIO Council”) developed a reference model that describes 17
privacy control families. Many of the privacy control families are closely related to the security controls
discussed in detail in Section 5. How controls within these families will be implemented for RFID
systems will vary depending on the characteristics of the business process the RFID system supports. For
RFID technology supporting transportation initiatives will likely have a different set of privacy controls
those involving delivery of healthcare. However, both would likely involve privacy controls within the
notice and consent family. The control families and related considerations for RFID systems are
presented in Table 6-2.
