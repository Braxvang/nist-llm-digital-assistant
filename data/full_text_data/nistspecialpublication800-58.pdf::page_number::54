 6.2     Megaco/H.248

 6.2.1    Overview

         The IETF started to work on MEGACO as a compromise protocol between
         MGCP and MDCP. ITU-T SG16 adopted MEGACO version 0.1 in April 1999 as
         the starting specification for H.GCP (H-series, Gateway Control Protocol), later
         H.248. In June 1999, the IETF MEGACO WG and ITU-T came out with a single
         document describing a standard protocol for interfacing between Media Gateway
         Controllers (MGCs) and Media Gateways (MGs) MEGACO/H.248.
         MEGACO/H.248. It is expected to win wide industry acceptance as the official
         standard for decomposed gateway architectures released by both the IETF and
         ITU-T.

         Since MEGACO/H.248 is derived from MGCP, many similarities can be found,
         for instance:

         –   Similarity between the semantics of the commands in the two specifications.
         –   The use of ABNF grammar for syntax specification and the Session
             Description Protocol (SDP) to specify media stream properties is the same as
             in MGCP.
         –   The processing of signals and events in media streams is the same in
             MEGACO as in MGCP.
         –   The concept of packages containing event and signal definitions that permits
             easy extension to the protocol is borrowed from MGCP.
         –   The MEGACO specification for transport of messages over UDP is the same
             as specified in MGCP. The three-way-handshake and the computation of
             retransmission timers described in MGCP are also described within the ALF
             definition specified in Annex E of MEGACO.

         MEGACO/H.248 introduces several enhancements compared with MGCP,
         including the following:

         – Support of multimedia and multipoint conferencing enhanced services
         – Improved syntax for more efficient semantic message processing
         – TCP and UDP transport options
         – Allows either text or binary encoding (to support IETF and ITU-T approach)
         – Formalized extension process for enhanced functionality
         – Expanded definition of packages

         MEGACO is described as Gateway Control Protocol Version 1 within the RFC
         3525.

 6.2.2    System Architecture

         MEGACO/H.248 (see Figure 8) has basically the same architecture as MGCP.
         MEGACO/H.248 commands are similar to MGCP commands. However, the
