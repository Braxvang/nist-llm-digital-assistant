NIST SP 800-82r3                                           Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security

6.2.3. Data Security (PR.DS)
Providing data security includes protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data
at rest and data in transit, protecting assets after removal, and preventing data leaks.
Cryptography can support data security requirements. Encryption, digital signatures, hashing,
and other cryptographic functions are available to prevent unauthorized access or the
modification of data at rest and in transit [RFC4949]. When cryptography is selected,
organizations should use a certified cryptographic system. Federal organizations are required to
comply with FIPS 140-3 [FIPS140-3] and the Cryptographic Module Validation Program
(CMVP). Additionally, cryptographic hardware should be protected from physical tampering and
uncontrolled electronic connections.
Supplemental guidance for data security can be found in the following documents:
   •   NIST SP 800-47, Rev. 1, Managing the Security of Information Exchanges
   •   NIST SP 800-111, Guide to Storage Encryption Technologies for End User Devices
   •   NIST SP 800-209, Security Guidelines for Storage Infrastructure
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Identify critical physical and electronic file types and data to protect
            while at rest. This may include personally identifiable information and
            sensitive, proprietary, or trade secret information (e.g., PLC program
            code, robot programs, computer-aided drafting [CAD] or computer-aided
            manufacturing [CAM] files, operating manuals and documentation,
            electrical diagrams, network diagrams, historical production data
            [IR8183A]). Organizations should consider centralizing critical data
            within secure storage locations.
            When OT data is stored in the cloud or on vendor servers, organizations
            should consider performing a risk analysis to determine how the data is
            protected by the service provider and whether additional
            countermeasures should be implemented to manage risk to an acceptable
            level.
            Monitor information flows from the OT security domain to other security
            domains and connections between security domains. Technologies such
            as data diodes, firewalls, and ACLs can be used to restrict the
            information flow. Examples of critical interfaces and interconnections
            may include interfaces between IT and OT, OT and external industry
            partners, or OT and third-party support vendors.
            To protect data on system components at end of life, an asset disposal
            program should be implemented, including considerations for wiping,
            sanitizing, or otherwise destroying critical data and media prior to
            disposal. The asset disposal program should include any removeable
            media, mobile devices, and traditional OT hardware.
