                                                                                                   Attackers can try to use these capabilities to access information on the device or use the device’s
                                                                                                   services. This can be prevented by disabling each networking capability that is not used, and by
                                                                                                   enabling necessary capabilities only when they are going to be used. For example, if a person only
                                                                                                   uses a Bluetooth earpiece occasionally with a smartphone, then the teleworker could enable the
                                                                                                   smartphone’s Bluetooth capability only when the teleworker wants to use the earpiece and disable it
                                                                                                   when the teleworker is done with the earpiece. Each enabled networking capability increases the risk
                                                                                                   of successful attacks, so teleworkers should consider the relative risk of each form of networking
                                                                                                   before enabling it (for example, enabling Bluetooth in a crowded public area is generally riskier than
