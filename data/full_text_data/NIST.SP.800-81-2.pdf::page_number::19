                                Figure 2-1. Partial DNS Name Space Hierarchy



There are many name servers in the DNS infrastructure. Each name server contains information about a
portion of the domain name space. Name servers are associated with levels as far as the first three levels
of domain name space are concerned. There are 13 name servers associated with the root level; they are
called root servers. Two of the root servers are currently run by the U.S private-sector corporation
VeriSign; the rest are operated by other organizations around the world as a service to the Internet
community. The organizations that run name servers associated with a TLD are called registries.
Generally, ccTLDs are run by designated registries in the respective countries, and global registries run
gTLDs. For example, VeriSign currently manages the name servers for the .com and .net TLDs, a
nonprofit entity called Public Internet Registry (PIR) manages the name servers for the .org TLD, and
another nonprofit organization called EDUCAUSE manages the name servers for the .edu TLD. All of
these registry organizations are subject to change, however. Domain registrants should be familiar with
the points of contact (called registrars) for their particular registry. The name servers associated with
enterprise-level domains and below are either run directly by the organizations that own those domains or
outsourced to Internet service providers (ISP) or other service providers.

The DNS infrastructure functions through collaboration among the various entities involved
(organizations that manage root servers, registries that run TLDs, etc.) A nonprofit, private-sector
corporation, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), acts as the technical
coordination body for aspects of DNS. For example, ICANN formulates policies for management of root
servers. ICANN also is the authority for creation of new TLDs. ICANN was established in 1998 by the
U.S. Department of Commerce.

A user (i.e., an individual or corporation) wishing to register a domain name (which can only be an
enterprise-level domain under a TLD) must contact an authorized entity called a registrar (which may
charge a fee, depending on the TLD in question). Registrars are companies that are authorized to register
domain names in a particular TLD (or even in a sub-domain of a TLD e.g. co.uk.) to end-users. There are
registrars all over the world. When the registrar receives the user’s registration request, the registrar
verifies that the name is available by checking with the registry that manages the corresponding TLD (or
sub-domain under the TLD). If the name is available, the registrar registers the name with the appropriate
registry. The registry then adds the new name to its registry database and publishes the new name in DNS.
Note that in some domains (some country codes and gTLDs for example), the same organization acts as
the registry and registrar for names in the domain. There is no middle organization that registers domain
names on behalf of the domain holder.
