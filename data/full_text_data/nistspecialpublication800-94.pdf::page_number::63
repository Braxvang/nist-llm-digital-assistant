and customization to improve their detection accuracy. The main effort is in specifying which WLANs,
APs, and STAs are authorized, and in entering the policy characteristics into the wireless IDPS software.
Besides reviewing tuning and customizations periodically to ensure that they are still accurate,
administrators should also ensure that changes to building plans are incorporated occasionally. This is
needed for accurate identification of the physical location of threats and accurate planning of sensor
deployments.

Although wireless IDPSs offer robust detection capabilities, they do have some significant limitations.
Wireless IDPSs cannot detect certain types of attacks against wireless networks, such as attacks involving
passive monitoring and offline processing of wireless traffic. Wireless IDPSs are also susceptible to
evasion techniques, especially those involving knowledge of a product’s channel scanning scheme.
Channel scanning can also impact network forensics because each sensor sees only a fraction of the
activity on each channel. Wireless IDPS sensors are also susceptible to denial of service attacks and
physical attacks.

Wireless IDPS sensors can offer intrusion prevention capabilities. Some sensors can instruct endpoints to
terminate a session and prevent a new session from being established. Some sensors can instruct a switch
on the wired network to block network activity for a particular wireless endpoint; however, this method
can only block wired network communications and will not stop an endpoint from continuing to perform
malicious actions through wireless protocols. Most IDPS sensors allow administrators to specify the
prevention capability configuration for each type of alert. Prevention actions can affect sensor
monitoring; for example, if a sensor is transmitting signals to terminate connections, it may not be able to
perform channel scanning to monitor other communications until it has completed the prevention action.
To mitigate this, some sensors have two radios—one for monitoring and detection, and another for
performing prevention actions. When selecting sensors, organizations should consider what prevention
actions may need to be performed and how the sensor’s detection capabilities could be affected by
performing prevention actions.
