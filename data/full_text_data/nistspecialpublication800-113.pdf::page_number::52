                              Figure 4-5. Routing Problem with SSL VPN Traffic

One final consideration for overall network policy is the issue of multiple sites. If the organization wants
multiple sites to support SSL VPN services, then it must decide how to configure authentication and
routing. There are several possibilities:

 Each site has an SSL VPN device, but users can only authenticate to the device at their local site. If
  there is a network between sites, then users can use the SSL VPN to access those other sites.
 Users can authenticate to a device at any of the sites but not simultaneously. So if there are two sites,
  Site A and Site B, users cannot establish VPN connections to Site A and Site B at the same time. All
  internal traffic must go to either Site A or Site B. Once users are authenticated, their traffic is sent to
  a single site and then traverses the internal network if necessary to access the other sites. This
  configuration could be used for backup purposes, so that a user who normally establishes a VPN
  connection to Site A can create a Site B VPN if the Site A VPN architecture is inaccessible.
