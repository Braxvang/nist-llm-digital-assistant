           The Technical Specification for the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.2



1. The @start-time and @end-time attributes SHALL be provided to indicate when the scan
   started and completed, respectively.
2. The @test-system attribute SHALL be provided, and it SHALL be a CPE name value
   indicating the product that was responsible for generating the results.
3. When the <xccdf:TestResult> is the root XCCDF element, then it will include an
   <xccdf:benchmark> element [XCCDF:6.6.2]. The <xccdf:benchmark> element MUST
   have an @id attribute specified.
4. Regarding the definition and use of <xccdf:Profile> elements, reported <xccdf:set-
   value> elements SHALL include all those values that are exported by the reported rules. The
   specific settings are those determined by the reported <xccdf:Profile>.
5. The <xccdf:identity> element SHALL identify the security principal used to access rule
   evaluation on the target(s). This will include the identity name or username used to perform the
   evaluation.
6. Each IP address associated with the <xccdf:target> SHALL be enumerated using the
   <xccdf:target-address> element.
7. An <xccdf:target-id-ref> SHALL be specified with a @system attribute of
   “http://scap.nist.gov/schema/asset-identification/1.1”, an @href attribute value of “”, and a
   @name attribute value of the ID of the <ai:asset> element in the ARF that this
   <xccdf:TestResult> is about.
8. The <xccdf:rule-result> elements report the result of the application of each selected
   rule [XCCDF:6.6.2]. The <xccdf:check/xccdf:check-content-ref> element
   SHALL record the reference to the check system specific result component report ID and check
   name within the result file using the @href and @name attributes, respectively. The @href
   attribute SHALL contain “#” + the @id of the <arf:report> containing the check result. This
   approach provides traceability between XCCDF and check results. Note that if @multi-check
   is not set to “true” and the <xccdf:rule-result> represents a group of checks, then the
   @name attribute SHALL be omitted. This is a stripped down example:
    <arf:asset-report-collection>
     <rc:relationships>...</rc:relationships>
     <arf:report-requests>...</arf:report-requests>
     <arf:assets>...</arf:assets>
     <arf:reports>
       <arf:report id="xccdf1">
         <arf:content>
           <xccdf:TestResult>
             <xccdf:rule-result>
               <xccdf:check>
                 <xccdf:check-content-ref href="#oval1"
                   name="oval:gov.nist:def:2"/>
               </xccdf:check>
             </xccdf:rule-result>
           </xccdf:TestResult>
         </arf:content>
       </arf:report>
       <arf:report id="oval1">
         <arf:content>
           <arf:xccdf-res:oval-results>...</xccdf-res:oval-results>
         </arf:content>
       </arf:report>
