                                GUIDE TO PROTECTING THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION (PII)



 Privacy in the system development life cycle process
 Limitation of collection, disclosure, sharing, and use of PII
 Consequences for failure to follow privacy rules of behavior.
If the organization permits access to or transfer of PII through interconnected systems external to the
organization or shares PII through other means, the organization should implement the appropriate
documented agreements for roles and responsibilities, restrictions on further sharing of the information,
requirements for notification to each party in the case of a breach, minimum security controls, and other
relevant factors. Also, Interconnection Security Agreements (ISA) should be used for technical
requirements as necessary.44 These agreements ensure that the partner organizations abide by rules for
handling, disclosing, sharing, transmitting, retaining, and using the organization‘s PII.

PII maintained by the organization should also be reflected in the organization‘s incident response
policies and procedures. A well-defined incident response capability helps the organization detect
incidents rapidly, minimize loss and destruction, identify weaknesses, and restore IT operations rapidly.
OMB M-07-16 sets out specific requirements for reporting incidents involving the loss or inappropriate
disclosure of PII. For additional information, see Section 5.

4.1.2    Awareness, Training, and Education

Awareness, training, and education are distinct activities, each critical to the success of privacy and
security programs.45 Their roles related to protecting PII are briefly described below. Additional
information on privacy education, training, and awareness is available in NIST SP 800-50, Building an
Information Technology Security Awareness and Training Program.

Awareness efforts are designed to change behavior or reinforce desired PII practices. The purpose of
awareness is to focus attention on the protection of PII. Awareness relies on using attention-grabbing
techniques to reach all different types of staff across an organization. For PII protection, awareness
methods include informing staff of new scams that are being used to steal identities, providing updates on
privacy items in the news such as government data breaches and their effect on individuals and the
organization, providing examples of how staff members have been held accountable for inappropriate
actions, and providing examples of recommended privacy practices.

The goal of training is to build knowledge and skills that will enable staff to protect PII. Laws and
regulations may specifically require training for staff, managers, and contractors. An organization should
have a training plan and implementation approach, and an organization‘s leadership should communicate
the seriousness of protecting PII to its staff. Organizational policy should define roles and responsibilities
for training; training prerequisites for receiving access to PII; and training periodicity and refresher
training requirements. To reduce the possibility that PII will be accessed, used, or disclosed
inappropriately, all individuals that have been granted access to PII should receive appropriate training
and, where applicable, specific role-based training. Depending on the roles and functions involving PII,
important topics to address may include:

 The definition of PII

     Some organizations have chosen to combine their security and privacy awareness, education, and training, whereas other
     organizations have chosen to keep them separate. Additionally, the Privacy Act and OMB guidance specifically require
     privacy training.
