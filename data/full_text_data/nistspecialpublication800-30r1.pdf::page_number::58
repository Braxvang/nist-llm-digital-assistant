 National Security System             Any information system (including any
 [44 U.S.C., Sec. 3542]               telecommunications system) used or operated by an
                                      agency or by a contractor of an agency, or other
                                      organization on behalf of an agency (i) the function,
                                      operation, or use of which involves intelligence activities;
                                      involves cryptologic activities related to national security;
                                      involves command and control of military forces;
                                      involves equipment that is an integral part of a weapon or
                                      weapons system; or is critical to the direct fulfillment of
                                      military or intelligence missions (excluding a system that
                                      is to be used for routine administrative and business
                                      applications, for example, payroll, finance, logistics, and
                                      personnel management applications); or (ii) is protected
                                      at all times by procedures established for information that
                                      have been specifically authorized under criteria
                                      established by an Executive Order or an Act of Congress
                                      to be kept classified in the interest of national defense or
                                      foreign policy.
 Operational Controls                 The security controls (i.e., safeguards or
 [FIPS 200]                           countermeasures) for an information system that are
                                      primarily implemented and executed by people (as
                                      opposed to systems).
 Organization                         An entity of any size, complexity, or positioning within
 [FIPS 200, Adapted]                  an organizational structure (e.g., a federal agency or, as
                                      appropriate, any of its operational elements). See
                                      Enterprise.
 Plan of Action and                   A document that identifies tasks needing to be
 Milestones                           accomplished. It details resources required to accomplish
 [OMB Memorandum 02-01]               the elements of the plan, any milestones in meeting the
                                      tasks, and scheduled completion dates for the milestones.
 Predisposing Condition               A condition that exists within an organization, a
                                      mission/business process, enterprise architecture, or
                                      information system including its environment of
                                      operation, which contributes to (i.e., increases or
                                      decreases) the likelihood that one or more threat events,
                                      once initiated, will result in undesirable consequences or
                                      adverse impact to organizational operations and assets,
                                      individuals, other organizations, or the Nation.
 Qualitative Assessment               Use of a set of methods, principles, or rules for assessing
 [DHS Risk Lexicon]                   risk based on nonnumerical categories or levels.
 Quantitative Assessment              Use of a set of methods, principles, or rules for assessing
 [DHS Risk Lexicon]                   risks based on the use of numbers where the meanings
                                      and proportionality of values are maintained inside and
                                      outside the context of the assessment.
 Repeatability                        The ability to repeat an assessment in the future, in a
                                      manner that is consistent with, and hence comparable to,
                                      prior assessments.
