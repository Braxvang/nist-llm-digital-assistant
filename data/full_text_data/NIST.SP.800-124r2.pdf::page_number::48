       Perform Risk Assessment
Risk assessments are a foundational component of cybersecurity. The risk-assessment process
can be used to identify, estimate, and prioritize risk to organizational operations and assets, staff,
and other organizations that result from the operation and use of information systems. Risk
assessments should be performed periodically, as the threat landscape is constantly changing and
the systems to be protected are evolving. Section 5.4 addresses the topic of periodic security
audits, which assess the effectiveness of controls for protecting the enterprise. Periodic risk
assessments should inform security audits.
Risk assessments can be conducted at the organization, mission, or information system level.
This guidance recommends that mobile devices, mobile apps, and any systems used to manage
the mobile system be included as part of the risk-assessment process. The risk assessment may
have mobile devices included under a larger risk assessment umbrella or be conducted against a
specific mobile device deployment. A variety of risk assessment methodologies exist, such as
mobile-agnostic guidance (NIST SP 800-30, Rev. 1, Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments)
[14] and mobile-specific guidance (Mobile Computer Decision Framework) [12]. Another
example of mobile-specific guidance also exists for performing risk assessments, such as draft
NISTIR 8144, Assessing Threats to Mobile Devices & Infrastructure: The Mobile Threat
Catalogue [5][6], used in conjunction with a threat modeling process, such as draft NIST SP 800-
154, Guide to Data-Centric System Threat Modeling [47], and the MITRE Mobile ATT&CK
Framework [15]. Organizations that fail to conduct risk assessments may inadvertently select and
apply incorrect security controls or spend too many resources addressing certain risks and not
enough on other risks. Enterprises are encouraged to revisit their identified requirements once a
risk assessment has been performed in order to update the list of requirements based on
information identified within the risk assessment.

       Implement Enterprise Mobility Strategy
Resource availability, mission needs, and various other organization constraints will guide
decisions on mobile deployment options, devices, and EMM systems. Some organizations must
have full control of all components in the enterprise environment, so all mobile equipment must
be purchased by the organization and managed by enterprise system administrators through an
EMM. Other organizations allow employees to bring their own devices (possibly from an
approved list) and may manage a few enterprise applications through an MAM system. By
focusing on the enterprise requirements, decision makers can narrow the range of appropriate
deployment options.

5.3.1. Select and Install Mobile Technology
The list of mobile technology requirements previously identified should be compared against
those of the EMMs under consideration. There may not be a perfect match with a complete
overlap of requirements and capabilities, especially when EMM selection must be made from a
predetermined list owned by an external organization. Once an EMM selection is made, the
EMM should be appropriately implemented inside the enterprise network boundary. This
includes proper product configuration, which is another important step in securing enterprise
mobile infrastructure. A misconfigured EMM can lead to data leaks of confidential and
