Certification      A comprehensive assessment of the management, operational, and
[NIST SP 800-      technical security controls in an information system, made in support
37]                of security accreditation, to determine the extent to which the
                   controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and
                   producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security
                   requirements for the system.
Certification      The individual, group, or organization responsible for conducting a
Agent              security certification.

                   executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, and priorities

Common             Security control that can be applied to one or more agency
Security Control   information systems and has the following properties: (i) the
[NIST SP 800-      development, implementation, and assessment of the control can be
37]                assigned to a responsible official or organizational element (other
                   than the information system owner); and (ii) the results from the
                   assessment of the control can be used to support the security
                   certification and accreditation processes of an agency information
                   system where that control has been applied.
Compensating       The management, operational, and technical controls (i.e., safeguards
Security           or countermeasures) employed by an organization in lieu of the
Controls           recommended controls in the low, moderate, or high baselines
                   described in NIST SP 800-53, that provide equivalent or comparable
                   protection for an information system.
