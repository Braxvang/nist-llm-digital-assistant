Note that since SHA-224 is based on SHA-256, there is no efficiency benefit when using SHA-
224, rather than SHA-256. Also note that since SHA-384, SHA-512/224 and SHA-512/256 are
based on SHA-512, there is no efficiency benefit for using these three SHA mechanisms, rather
than using SHA-512. However, efficiency is just one factor to consider when selecting the
appropriate hash function to use as part of a DRBG mechanism.

10.1.1     Hash_DRBG

Figure 8 presents the normal operation of the Hash_DRBG generate algorithm. The
Hash_DRBG requires the use of a hash function during the instantiate, reseed and generate
functions; the same hash function shall be used throughout a Hash_DRBG instantiation.
Hash_DRBG uses the derivation function specified in Section 10.3.1 during instantiation and
reseeding. The security strength of the hash function to be used shall meet or exceed the desired
security strength required by the consuming application for DRBG output (see [SP 800-57]).
