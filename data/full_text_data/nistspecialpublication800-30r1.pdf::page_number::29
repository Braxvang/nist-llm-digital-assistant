Special Publication 800-30                                                       Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments
________________________________________________________________________________________________


descriptions of vulnerabilities in the systems, an assessment of the risks associated with each
vulnerability (thereby updating the assessment of vulnerability severity), and corrective actions
that can be taken to mitigate the risks. The risk assessment results also include an assessment of
the overall risk to the organization and the information contained in the information systems by
operating the systems as evaluated. Risk assessment results at Tier 3 are communicated to
organizational entities at Tier 1 and Tier 2.

Risk assessment activities can be integrated with the steps in the Risk Management Framework
(RMF), as defined in NIST Special Publication 800-37. The RMF, in its system development life
cycle approach, operates primarily at Tier 3 with some application at Tiers 1 and 2, for example,
in the selection of common controls. Risk assessments can be tailored to each step in the RMF as
reflected in the purpose and scope of the assessments described in Section 3.1. Risk assessments
can also help determine the type of security assessments conducted during various phases of the
system development life cycle, the frequency of such assessments, the level of rigor applied
during the assessments, the assessment methods used, and the types/number of objects assessed.
The benefit of risk assessments conducted as part of the RMF can be realized from both initial
assessments and from updated assessments, as described below.

RMF Step 1 – Categorize
Organizations can use initial risk assessments to make security categorization decisions consistent
with the risk management strategy provided by the risk executive (function) and as a preparatory
step to security control selection. Conducting initial risk assessments brings together the available
information on threat sources, threat events, vulnerabilities, and predisposing conditions—thus
enabling organizations to use such information to categorize information and information systems
based on known and potential threats to and vulnerabilities in organizational information systems
and environments in which those systems operate. 39 Security categorization decisions inform the
selection of initial baseline security controls. Baseline security controls serve as the starting point
for organizational tailoring and supplementation activities described in the RMF Select step.

RMF Step 2 – Select
Organizations can use risk assessments to inform and guide the selection of security controls for
organizational information systems and environments of operation. After the initial security
control baseline is selected based on the security categorization process, the risk assessment
results help organizations: (i) apply appropriate tailoring guidance to adjust the controls based on
specific mission/business requirements, assumptions, constraints, priorities, trade-offs, or other
organization-defined conditions; and (ii) supplement the controls based on specific and credible
threat information. 40 Threat data from risk assessments provide critical information on adversary
capabilities, intent, and targeting that may affect the decisions by organizations regarding the
selection of additional security controls including the associated costs and benefits. Organizations
also consider risk assessment results when selecting common controls (typically a Tier 1 and Tier
2 activity). Risk is introduced if the implementation of a common control results in a single point
of failure because the control provides a security capability potentially inherited by multiple
information systems. As risk assessments are updated and refined, organizations use the results to
modify current security control selections based on the most recent threat and vulnerability
information available.

39
   Even when an initial risk assessment is performed prior to the existence of an information system, vulnerabilities
may be present in certain technologies that will be used in the system, in common controls that will be inherited by the
system, or in the environment in which the system will operate.

     Supplementation will be incorporated into the tailoring process in NIST Special Publication 800-53, Revision 4.
