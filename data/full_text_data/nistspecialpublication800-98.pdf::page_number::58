4.4      Externality Risk

RFID systems typically are not isolated from other systems and assets in the enterprise. Every connection
point between the RFID system and something outside the RFID system represents a potential
vulnerability for the entity on the other side of the connection, whether that is an application process, a
valued asset, or a person. Externality risks are present for both the RF and enterprise subsystems of an
RFID system. The main externality risk for the RF subsystem is hazards resulting from electromagnetic
radiation, which could possibly range from adverse human health effects to ignition of combustible
material, such as fuel or ordnance. The main externality risk for the enterprise subsystem is successful
computer network attacks on networked devices and applications. Computer network attacks can involve
malware (e.g., worms and viruses) or attack tools that exploit software vulnerabilities and configuration
weaknesses to gain access to systems, perform a denial of service, or cause other damage. The impact of
computer network attacks can range from performance degradation to complete compromise of a mission-
critical application.

Because the externality risk by definition involves risks outside of the RFID system, it is distinct from
both the business process and business intelligence risks; externality risks can be realized without having
any effect on RFID-supported business processes or without revealing any information to adversaries.

4.4.1      Hazards of Electromagnetic Radiation

RFID technology, like any other radio technology, relies on the use of electromagnetic radiation to
communicate information. The potential risk of electromagnetic radiation includes:

 Hazards of electromagnetic radiation to people (HERP),
 Hazards of electromagnetic radiation to ordnance (HERO),
 Hazards of electromagnetic radiation to fuel (HERF), and
 Hazards of electromagnetic radiation to other materials, including medical supplies such as blood
  products, vaccines, and pharmaceuticals.
As of the publication of this document, no documented examples have been identified that any of these
hazards have been realized with respect to RFID technology, which typically operates at power levels
below those that would cause a concern. Moreover, no research has suggested the realization of these
risks with respect to RFID technology is likely, although interaction with some medical devices has been
the subject of research studies. 34 The US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) promulgates
regulations to protect citizens against unsafe radio transmissions by requiring equipment testing and
certification. The FCC limits for general population/uncontrolled exposure are tabulated in Appendix E.
