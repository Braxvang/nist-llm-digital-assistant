       NIST SP 800-63A-4 ipd                                            Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022                                              Enrollment and Identity Proofing


1646           – If enrollment is partially complete (due to users not having the complete set
1647             of identity evidence, users choosing to stop the process, or session timeouts),
1648             communicate to users:
1649               * what information will be destroyed;
1650               * what, if any, information will be retained for future follow-up sessions;
1651               * how long the information will be retained; and
1652               * what identity evidence they will need to bring to a future session.
1653           – If enrollment is unsuccessful, provide users with clear instructions for
1654             alternative enrollment session types, for example, offering in-person proofing
1655             for users that can not complete remote proofing.
1656      • If users receive the authenticator during the enrollment session, provide users
1657        information on the use and maintenance of the authenticator. For example,
1658        information could include instructions for use (especially if there are different
1659        requirements for first-time use or initialization), information on authenticator
1660        expiration, how to protect the authenticator, and what to do if the authenticator
1661        is lost or stolen.
1662      • For both in-person and remote identity proofing, additional usability considerations
1663        apply:
1664           – At the start of the enrollment session, operators or attendants need to explain
1665             their role to users (e.g., whether operators or attendants will walk users
1666             through the enrollment session or observe silently and only interact as
1667             needed).
1668           – At the start of the enrollment session, inform users that they must not depart
1669             during the session, and that their actions must be visible throughout the
1670             session.
1671           – When biometrics are collected during the enrollment session, provide users
1672             clear instructions on how to complete the collection process. The instructions
1673             are best given just prior to the process. Verbal instructions with corrective
1674             feedback from a live operator are the most effective (e.g., instruct users where
1675             the biometric sensor is, when to start, how to interact with the sensor, and
1676             when the biometric collection is completed).
1677      • Since remote identity proofing is conducted online, follow general web usability
1678        principles. For example:
1679           – Design the user interface to walk users through the enrollment process.
1680           – Reduce users’ memory load.
1681           – Make the interface consistent.
