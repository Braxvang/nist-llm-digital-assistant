                                            '05'                  RSA 3072 bit modulus, 65537 ≤ exponent ≤ 2256 - 1
                                            '06'                  RSA 1024 bit modulus, 65537 ≤ exponent ≤ 2256 - 1
                                            '07'                  RSA 2048 bit modulus, 65537 ≤ exponent ≤ 2256 - 1
                                            '08'                  AES-128 – ECB

440   Note that 3 Key Triple DES – ECB with identifier '00' and '03' is deprecated and will be removed
441   in the next revision of this document.
442   Algorithm identifiers '27' and '2E' represent suites of algorithms and key sizes for use with secure
443   messaging and key establishment. Cipher Suite 2 (CS2) is used to establish session keys and for
444   secure messaging when the PIV Secure Messaging key is an ECDH (Curve P-256) key, and
445   Cipher Suite 7 (CS7) is used to establish session keys and for secure messaging when the PIV
446   Secure Messaging key is an ECDH (Curve P-384) key. Details of secure messaging, the key
447   establishment protocol, and the algorithms and key sizes for these two cipher suites are specified
448   in NIST SP 800-73-4, Part 2.

449                Algorithm Identifiers for PIV Key Types
450   Table 10 summarizes the set of algorithms supported for each key reference value.
451   All cryptographic algorithms employed shall provide at least 112 bits of security strength.
452   Cryptographic keys that will remain in use after 2030 should provide 128 bits of security
453   strength 7. Federal departments and agencies should consider potential cryptographic key length
454   migrations as part of their moderate-to-long term cryptographic transition and modernization
455   plans, including the need to plan and invest for a future migration to post-quantum algorithms.
456   Capital investments for PIV issuance and relying party systems should be selected with an
457   emphasis on ensuring a timely migration to post-quantum algorithms once standards,
458   technologies, and services are available. If a migration to longer cryptographic keys would
459   require significant resources or infrastructure upgrades, federal departments and agencies may
460   elect to defer these improvements until the post-quantum migration. Post-quantum algorithms
461   will be specified in a future revision of this document once foundational standards supporting
462   their use have been adopted.
