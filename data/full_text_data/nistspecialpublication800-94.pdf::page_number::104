GUIDE TO INTRUSION DETECTION AND PREVENTION SYSTEMS (IDPS)



 How the organization receives each type of update from the vendor (e.g., sensor upgrade distributed
  on CD, signature updates available for download through the console or from the vendor’s technical
  support Web site)
 How the authenticity and integrity of updates can be confirmed (e.g., through cryptographic
  checksums)
 How updates can be distributed to IDPS components such as sensors and consoles (e.g., automated
  process, manual installation)
 How the installation of updates can affect existing IDPS settings or customizations.
9.4.3    Training, Documentation, and Technical Support

Organizations should consider the resources available to the IDPS administrators and users for learning
about the IDPS’s functionality and characteristics and for receiving assistance when problems occur.
These resources—training, documentation, and technical support—should take into account both
administrator and user needs, as well as different experience levels.

 Training. Most IDPS vendors offer training classes for their products. Some offer a single class per
  product, while others offer separate classes for users and administrators. Separate classes may also be
  available for particular IDPS components, such as consoles or management servers, or for specialized
  tasks such as code customization or report creation. Some vendors also offer general IDPS classes
  that are intended to give users a better understanding of IDPS principles. Third parties also offer
  general IDPS classes and classes for some specific IDPS products. Organizations should consider
  which training classes are available that meet their needs, what format the classes are in (e.g.,
  instructor-led, online, computer-based training [CBT]), and where the classes are held (e.g., the IDPS
  vendor’s headquarters, regional locations, the customer’s site). For instructor-led classes,
  organizations should determine if they include lab work or other hands-on exercises that allow users
  to use the actual IDPS equipment.
 Documentation. IDPS products usually include documentation in paper or electronic forms.
  Examples include installation, user, administrator, and signature/policy development guides.
  Electronic guides are often fully searchable; some products also offer context-sensitive help through
  the console, allowing a user to easily access the pertinent documentation for a particular console
  feature or security event type. If guides are provided on paper only, organizations should determine if
  the guides can be duplicated, and if not, what the availability of additional copies is.
 Technical Support. Most IDPS vendors offer multiple technical support contracts. For example,
  one contract might provide basic phone, e-mail, and Web-based support during business hours with a
  one-hour response time, while another contract might provide 24-hour access to senior support staff
  with a 15-minute response time and include annual onsite visits and consulting services.
  Organizations should take care to determine what activities are and are not covered by a contract; for
  example, tuning and customization, such as writing signatures or customizing reports, might not be
  included. Vendors typically provide multiple support contract options so that each customer can
  select one that is cost-effective for them. Free technical support is also available for some products
  through user groups, mailing lists, forums, and other methods.
9.5     Life Cycle Costs

Organizations should compare the funding they have available for IDPS solutions to the estimated life
cycle costs for each of the evaluated solutions. Quantifying the life cycle costs for IDPS solutions can be
difficult because there are many environment-specific factors that impact cost, and because it is usually
