8. Reporting

     Reporting is the process of preparing a detailed summary of all the steps taken and conclusions
     reached in the investigation of a case. Reporting depends on all participants carefully
     maintaining a record of their actions and observations, reporting the results of tests, and
     explaining the inferences drawn from the evidence. The basis of a good report is solid
     documentation, notes, sketches, photographs, and tool-generated reports.

     Reporting of the results of a forensic examination tend to follow predefined templates,
     customized as required by the specific circumstances of each investigation. Reports of
     forensic examination results should include all the information necessary to identify the case
     and its source, outline the test results and findings, and bear the signature of the individual
     responsible for its contents. In general, the report may include the following information
     [DOJ04]:

             Identity of the reporting agency

             Case identifier or submission number

             Case investigator

             Identity of the submitter

             Date of receipt

             Date of report

             Descriptive list of items submitted for examination, including serial number, make,
             and model

             Identity and signature of the examiner

             The equipment and set up used in the examination

             Brief description of steps taken during examination, such as string searches, graphics
             image searches, and recovering erased files.

             Supporting materials such as printouts of particular items of evidence, digital copies of
             evidence, and chain of custody documentation

             Details of findings:

                      Specific files related to the request

                      Other files, including deleted files, that support the findings

                      String searches, keyword searches, and text string searches

                      Internet-related evidence, such as Web site traffic analysis, chat logs, cache
                      files, e-mail, and news group activity
