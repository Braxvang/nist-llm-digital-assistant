      NIST SP 800-50r1 ipd                                                     Building a Cybersecurity and
      August 2023                                                                Privacy Learning Program

728   The cybersecurity Learning Program Manager works with the cybersecurity policy owners to
729   understand and interpret the guidance. Once completed, they define a strategy with goals and
730   objectives and identify a set of program tactics that would deliver new training to all members of
731   the workforce and meet the new requirements with specific new procedures. The cybersecurity
732   Learning Program Manager decides to work with organizational training staff to create an online
733   experience, which would also enable remote workers to participate fully.
734   As the course is being completed, the cybersecurity Learning Program Manager works with
735   organizational leaders and management to identify expected measures of completion and success
736   and to ensure that all necessary members of the workforce are identified and trained. As an
737   element of continuous monitoring, the cybersecurity Learning Program Manager works with the
738   learning office and leadership to test the completion and success of the training.
739          Strategy – Meet new regulatory requirements
740          Strategic Goal – Train cybersecurity professionals
741          Strategic Goal – Build and deliver online training program
742          Objective – Launch new online training program that will enable all employees to meet
743          the new procedure training objectives, even from remote work locations
744          Tactic – Work with management to schedule the training and ensure 100 % compliance
745          in training
746          Tactic – Enable a continuous monitoring program to test completion rates and provide
747          daily tracking to managers

748          Determining CPLP Measurements and Metrics
749   Program measurements and metrics are essential to show the effectiveness and impact of the
750   program, understand where changes are required for success, and meet continued budgetary and
751   resource requirements. There may be regulations that apply.
752   Metrics should determine what should be measured and why. While laws, regulations, and
753   policies often set specific measurable requirements, CPLP metrics should go beyond simply
754   achieving compliance and serve to help measure the CPLP’s impact on workforce attitude and
755   behavioral changes. The metrics should be tied directly to the goals of the program. The
756   Learning Program Managers should identify how the metrics will be collected, how frequently,
757   who should have access to them or receive reports that include information about them, and how
758   they will be shared.
759   Policies and regulations need to be considered, since they often set specific guidelines on what
760   information to gather. CPLPs should be prepared to answer some common questions, such as:
761      •   What policies apply to our organization?
762      •   How often is reporting required?
763      •   What data is required in the report?
764      •   What data are we required to maintain for potential audits?
