NIST SP 800-166                                                             DERIVED PIV APPLICATION AND
                                                                            DATA MODEL TEST GUIDELINES

                 VERIFY

                 CHANGE REFERENCE DATA

                 RESET RETRY COUNTER

      +    Credential initialization and administration commands–

                 PUT DATA

                 GENERATE ASYMMETRIC KEY PAIR.

The token commands will be validated against the following conditions:

      +    Precondition for use (password, cryptographic authentication),

      +    Expected response status word, and

      +    Appropriate state variables set in the Derived PIV Application.

2.3       Data Model of the Derived PIV Application Tests

These tests are intended to ensure that issuers populate the containers within the Derived PIV
Application with data objects that conform to [SP800-157], [SP800-73] and [SP800-78]. In
general, these tests cover the following:

      +    Data objects are formatted correctly,

      +    Field values are in accordance with the specifications, and

      +    Data consistency and value computations such as signatures are accurate.

The tests should be performed via test scripts that communicate directly with the hardware
cryptographic token through the API of the associated reader drivers and includes the following
categories of tests.

2.3.1      BER-TLV Format Conformance

These tests validate that the tags and lengths of various data objects conform to specifications in
[SP800-157].

2.3.2 Signed Data Object Conformance

For the Security Object, the tests check to ensure that the fields in the signature block conform to
the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS).
