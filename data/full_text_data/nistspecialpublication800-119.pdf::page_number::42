                                                              GUIDELINES FOR THE SECURE DEPLOYMENT OF IPV6


        Routing Header. NH value of 43 in the immediately preceding header. The Routing Header
         is used by an IPv6 source (sending host) to list one or more intermediate nodes to be traversed
         on the way to a packet’s destination. The sending host sets the NH extension to direct a packet
         through a certain path. In IPv4, this is called the Loose Source and Record Route option. The
         Type 0 Routing Header was identified as a security risk, because it may allow attackers to
         bypass firewalls and carry out denial of service or other attacks. For these reasons the IETF
         deprecated the use of Type 0 Routing Headers (RFC 5095). The Mobile IPv6 specification
         defines a Type 2 Routing Header which allows the data exchange between the care-of address
         of a mobile node and a correspondent node without being routed through the home agent.
         Mobile IPv6 is discussed in Section 4.4.

        Fragment header. NH value of 44 in the immediately preceding header. This header is used
         by an IPv6 source to send a packet larger than the Path Maximum Transmission Unit (PMTU)
         to its destination. Each fragment of a packet must have the same identification value as well
         as identical source and destination addresses. Fragmentation in IPv6 is performed only by
         source nodes, not by routers along a packet’s delivery path as allowed in IPv4.

        Authentication header. NH value of 51 in the immediately preceding header. The
         Authentication header is used to provide connectionless integrity and data origin
         authentication for IP datagrams and to provide protection against replays. Also known as
         IPsec Authentication Header (AH), this capability is used in IPv4 as well as IPv6. IPsec is
         covered in Section 5.3.

        Encapsulating Security Payload header. NH value of 50 in the immediately preceding
         header. This header is used to provide confidentiality, data origin authentication,
         connectionless integrity, an anti-replay service (a form of partial sequence integrity), and
         limited traffic flow confidentiality. Also known as the IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload
         header (ESP), this capability is used in IPv4 as well as IPv6 to provide the same functions as
         AH and also, optionally, confidentiality. IPsec as well as AH and ESP is covered in Section
         5.3.

        Destination Options header. NH value of 60 in the immediately preceding header. This
         header is used to carry optional information that needs to be examined only by a packet’s
         destination node(s). Intermediate nodes (for which the IPv6 base header destination address is
         not the address of the current node or more Routing Header processing is required) do not
         examine the Destination Options header. The Destination Options header works similarly
         to the Hop-by-Hop Option header, as it may carry one or more options, where each option is
         encoded in type-length-value format. A node receiving a packet that matches the IPv6
         destination address examines the NH field, notes the presence of a Destination Options, and
         processes the Destination Options before forwarding the payload to the upper layer protocol.
         A Destinations Options header could appear before or after an ESP header; however, it should
         be placed after an ESP header for increased protection.

        Mobility header. NH value of 135 in the immediately preceding header. This header is used
         by a mobile node, correspondent node, and home agent to manage mobile IPv6 bindings.
         Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) provides enhanced security, streamlined administrative protocols, and
         greater efficiency compared with Mobile IPv4. MIPv6 is covered in Section 4.4.

Extension headers are established at the source before transmission of the packet. Their order and
contents are not altered by intermediary nodes.
