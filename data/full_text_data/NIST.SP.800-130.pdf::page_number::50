Policy should state the maximum allowable cryptoperiod of any key type used to protect
the data covered by the policy.

FR: 6.24 The CKMS design shall specify for each key type how deactivation of the key
is determined (e.g., by cryptoperiod, by number of uses, or by amount of data).

FR: 6.25 The CKMS design shall specify how each key type is deactivated (e.g.,
manually or automatically, based on the deactivation date-time, the number of usages, or
the amount of protected data).

FR: 6.26 The CKMS design shall specify how the deactivation date-time for each key
type can be changed 11.

FR:6.27 For each key type, the CKMS design shall specify requirements for advance
notification of the deactivation of the key type, including which CKMS supported roles
are notified, how they are notified, what security services are applied to the notification,
and the time-frames for notification(s).

6.4.5 Revoke Key
Key revocation is used in cases where the authorized use of a key needs to be terminated
prior to the established cryptoperiod of that key. A cryptographic key should be revoked
as soon as feasible after it is no longer authorized for use (e.g., the key has been
compromised). Revoking a key includes marking the key as no longer authorized for use
to apply cryptographic protection or to process already protected information. Security
entities that have been, that are, or that will be using the key (i.e., relying parties) need to
be notified that the key has been revoked. This may involve the publication of a
revocation list identifying keys that have been revoked. Other forms of revocation
notification may be supported in key-management systems.

FR:6.28 The CKMS design shall specify when, how, and under what circumstances
revocation is performed and revocation information is made available to the relying
parties.

6.4.6 Suspend and Re-Activate a Key
A key may be temporarily suspended and later re-activated 12. Examples of situations that
may warrant suspension, as opposed to irreversible revocation, include: the owner is not
available for an extended period of time, the key has been misused, a possible
compromise is under investigation, or a token containing a key has been misplaced. In

11
   For example, over time, the advancements in key exhaustion technology may improve at a
faster rate than expected, or new attacks that lower the bits of security strength provided by the
key and its algorithm may be discovered. Thus, the key-deactivation date may require
modification.
12
   Suspension is a temporary deactivation. In other words, while deactivation is generally
irreversible, suspension can be reversed in order to re-activate the key.
