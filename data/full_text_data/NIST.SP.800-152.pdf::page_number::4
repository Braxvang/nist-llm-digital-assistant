                       Reports on Computer Systems Technology

The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical
leadership for the Nation’s measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops tests, test
methods, reference data, proof-of-concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance
the development and productive use of information technology. ITL’s responsibilities include the
development of management, administrative, technical, and physical standards and guidelines for
the cost-effective security and privacy of other than national security-related information in
federal information systems. The Special Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research,
guidelines, and outreach efforts in information system security, and its collaborative activities
with industry, government, and academic organizations.


                                            Abstract

This Profile for U. S. Federal Cryptographic Key Management Systems (FCKMSs) contains
requirements for their design, implementation, procurement, installation, configuration,
management, operation, and use by U. S. Federal organizations. The Profile is based on NIST
Special Publication (SP) 800-130, A Framework for Designing Cryptographic Key Management
Systems (CKMS).
