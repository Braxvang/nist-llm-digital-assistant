6.4     Privacy Requirements for Federal Agencies

This section provides an overview of the following Federal privacy statutes and guidance that pertain to
Federal agencies and, in many cases, other organizations that handle, process, or share data with Federal
agencies:

 Privacy Act of 1974,
 Section 208 of the E-Government Act of 2002,
 Section 522 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2005, 70
 Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), 71 and
 OMB memoranda on the implementation of privacy requirements.
This section is not intended as an interpretation of law, legal advice, or a mandate for any organization.
Federal officials responsible for RFID systems should consult with the senior agency official for
privacy 72 , legal counsel, and other privacy compliance-related officials to appropriately identify and
integrate privacy controls into RFID systems. RFID privacy stakeholders also may include the Office of
the Chief Information Officer, the organizational components that the RFID system supports, and the
office implementing the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).

Collaboration among RFID project managers and privacy officials will help ensure greater understanding
of privacy initiatives currently in place, provide for greater efficiencies in the use and sharing of agency
resources, and lower the risk of RFID projects. Additionally, collaboration can better ensure privacy
controls are considered early in the system development life cycle and avoid costly retrofitting of
solutions.

While Federal agencies must meet certain privacy requirements as a matter of legal compliance,
organizations not covered by the mandates may implement privacy controls for other purposes, such as to
maintain the trust and confidence of their customers and business partners, or to protect or enhance their
reputation. These organizations may still find it useful to review requirements for Federal agencies to
determine what might be appropriate for their environment.

6.4.1     Privacy Act of 1974

For over 30 years, the cornerstone of federal information privacy law has been the Privacy Act of 1974
(“the Privacy Act”), (5 USC § 552a), which was written before the widespread adoption of IT as the
primary means of managing data. The Privacy Act regulates the collection, use, maintenance, and
70
      Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005, Pub. L. No. 108-447.
71
      Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-347, 116 Stat. 2946.
72
      The senior agency official for privacy may also be known as the Chief Privacy Officer or Privacy Advocate. In some cases,
      the role may be filled by the agency’s Chief Information Officer. The senior agency official privacy may also head an office
      responsible for Privacy Act implementation or other privacy-related law(s), but not hold one of these titles.
