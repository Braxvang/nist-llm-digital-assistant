NIST SP 800-124r2                                                   Guidelines for Managing the Security

should help the enterprise security team assess whether the benefits of mobile access outweigh
the security risks that they present to the enterprise ecosystem.

5.4.2. Device Usage
An organization should develop security and privacy policies for mobile device (and app) usage.
A key element of that policy is enterprise monitoring of device/app usage. EMM, MAM, and
many mobile network monitoring systems enable enterprise administrators to track or monitor
mobile user activities, including the following:
   •   identification of all device apps,
   •   app usage patterns (e.g., downloads, when/how often an app is launched),
   •   device features used by each app (e.g., microphone, camera),
   •   data used by an app (e.g., user location, contacts),
   •   device/user geographical location, and
   •   phone calls (e.g., phone number, name, time duration, date, location).
An appropriate monitoring policy for devices/apps should consider many factors, including the
organization’s mission (and how the mobile device/app supports that mission), security and
privacy characteristics of the enterprise data and systems accessed via the device, the user’s
relationship to the enterprise (e.g., employee, contractor, employee of a partner organization,
members of the general public), deployment model (e.g., -enterprise-owned, BYOD), and user
privacy. A monitoring policy that is appropriate for enterprise-owned devices carried by
employees in a highly sensitivity environment might include tracking the location of the
device/user and geofencing the use of certain applications. Such a policy would be unacceptable
(and likely infeasible to implement) for individually owned devices of employees of a partner
organization who are visiting the enterprise site.
User privacy is an important consideration because most devices will contain some personal user
information, and certain types of monitoring (e.g., geolocation) may bring enterprise interests
into conflict with privacy regulations. Organizations that do business within the European Union
(EU) should also consider how the EU’s privacy and data protection regulation (i.e., the General
Data Protection Regulation [30]) constrains mobile device/app usage monitoring.

       Dispose of and/or Reuse Device
Mobile devices may hold sensitive information, such as passwords, account numbers, emails,
voicemails, text message logs, or mission-specific data (e.g., sensitive law enforcement
information). When a mobile device must be disposed of, it is important to take the proper steps
to ensure that sensitive information does not fall into the wrong hands.
While techniques such as degaussing, memory overwriting, or even physical grinding can be
used to sanitize magnetic media, these techniques are not effective for sanitizing the solid-state
memory used in mobile devices. However, most mobile devices now store user data on self-
encrypting drives (SEDs), which provide “always-on” encryption. Mobile OSs leverage the
encryption inherent in the SED to provide “hard reset” or “factory reset” functionality to clear
