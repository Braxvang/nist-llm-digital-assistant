Special Publication 800-85B                              PIV Data Model Testing Specification


Test Steps              1. Set cardHandle := <<valid card handle>>
                        2. Set OID := <<Key Management Certificate
                           (2.16.840.1.101.3.7.2.1.2)>>
                        3. Call pivGetData w/
                           • (IN) cardHandle
                              • (IN) OID
                              • (OUT) data
                        4. Extract the subjectPublicKeyInfo->subjectPublicKey
                           from the certificate.
                        5. Parse the exponent from the extracted public key
Expected Result(s)      The exponent of the RSA asymmetric key for key management is
                        greater than or equal to 65,537.
