Information Technology Security Training Requirements


                                           FOREWORD
In 1997 the General Accounting Office (GAO) identified information technology (IT) security as
"a new high-risk area that touches virtually every major aspect of government operations" (report
# GAO/HR-97-30). In doing so, GAO went beyond dozens of specific reconmiendations in its
prior reports to identify underlying factors. Several are people factors, not technological factors,
e.g., "insufficient awareness and understanding of information security risks   among senior
agency officials," "poorly designed and implemented security programs," "a shortage of
personnel with the technical expertise needed to manage controls," and "limited oversight of
agency practices."

The key to addressing people factors or competencies is awareness, training, and education.
Certainly the need for government-wide attention to this area of FT security has never been
greater, so issuance of this publication. Information Technology Security Training Requirements:
A Role- and Performance-Based Model, (Training Requirements) is especially timely. This
document has been designed as a "living handbook" to have the longest useful life possible as the
foundation of and structure for "do-able" training by Federal agencies. To meet this objective,
the following elements have been included in this document's design:


   •    Dates, references, or other items that would quickly outdate the Training Requirements
        have been excluded. Excluded also are "terms du jour" and items which may be specific
        to a given agency or Department. Technical jargon changes rapidly     —
                                                                           even though the
        meanings are not significantly different. Thus, to avoid unnecessary outdating, the
        document uses terminology that is most consistent across Federal agencies and broadest
        in scope to encompass all information processing, storage, and transmission resources
        and technologies   —   for example, "Information Technology."   A glossary of key terms is
        provided in an appendix.

    •   An extensible set of knowledges, skills, and abilities (KSAs) structure the Training
        Requirements and are linked to the document through generic IT Security Body of
        Knowledge, Topics and Concepts categories as shown in Exhibit 4-4. Thus, new
        technologies and associated terminology may be added to the KSAs (which are to be
        maintained in a separate database), and will be tracked forward through the generic IT
        Security Body of Knowledge, Topics and Concepts categorization to recommended
        instructional blocks defined in Chapter 4. This linkage precludes a need to continually
        revise or supersede the key chapter that addresses training criteria with respect to security
        requirements affected by the ongoing evolution of information technology.

    •   Finally, the emphasis of the Training Requirements is on training criteria or standards,
        rather than on specific curricula or content.  The training criteria are established according
        to trainees' role(s) within their organizations, and are measured by their on-the-job
        performance. This emphasis on roles and results, rather than on fixed content, gives the
        Training Requirements flexibility, adaptability, and longevity.
