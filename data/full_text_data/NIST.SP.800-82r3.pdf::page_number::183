real time
Pertaining to the performance of a computation during the actual time that the related physical process transpires so
that the results of the computation can be used to guide the physical process.

redundant control server
A backup to the control server that maintains the current state of the control server at all times. [IR6859]

relay
An electromechanical device that completes or interrupts an electrical circuit by physically moving conductive
contacts. The resultant motion can be coupled to another mechanism such as a valve or breaker. [ISADICT]

remote access
Access to an organizational system by a user (or a process acting on behalf of a user) communicating through an
external network. [SP800-53r5]

remote diagnostics
Diagnostic activities conducted by individuals who are outside of an information system security perimeter.

remote maintenance
Maintenance activities conducted by individuals communicating through an external network. [SP800-53r5]

remote terminal unit
A computer with radio interfacing used in remote situations where communications via wire is unavailable. Usually
used to communicate with remote field equipment. PLCs with radio communication capabilities are also used in
place of RTUs. [IR6859]

risk
The level of impact on agency operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), agency assets, or
individuals resulting from the operation of an information system, given the potential impact of a threat and the
likelihood of that threat occurring. [FIPS200] (adapted)

risk assessment
The process of identifying risks to agency operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), agency
assets, or individuals by determining the probability of occurrence, the resulting impact, and additional security
controls that would mitigate this impact. Part of risk management, synonymous with risk analysis. Incorporates
threat and vulnerability analyses. [SP800-39] (adapted)

risk management
The process of managing risks to organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, reputation),
organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation, resulting from the operation of an information
system, and includes: (i) the conduct of a risk assessment; (ii) the implementation of a risk mitigation strategy; and
(iii) employment of techniques and procedures for the continuous monitoring of the security state of the information
system. [FIPS200] (adapted)

router
A computer that is a gateway between two networks at OSI layer 3 and that relays and directs data packets through
that inter-network. The most common form of router operates on IP packets. [RFC4949] (adapted)

safety instrumented system
A system that is composed of sensors, logic solvers, and final control elements whose purpose is to take the process
to a safe state when predetermined conditions are violated. Other terms commonly used include emergency
shutdown system (ESS), safety shutdown system (SSD), and safety interlock system (SIS). [ANSI-ISA-84]

SCADA server
The device that acts as the master in a SCADA system.
