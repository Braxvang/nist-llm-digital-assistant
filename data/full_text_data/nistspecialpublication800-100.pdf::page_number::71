CHAPTER 7                                                                    Performance Measures


    Phases 5, 6, and 7, depicted in Figure 7-1, involve developing metrics that
measure process implementation, effectiveness and efficiency, and mission impact.
The specific aspect of information security that metrics will focus on at any given
point will depend on information security program maturity. Implementation
evidence, required to prove higher levels of effectiveness, will change from
establishing existence of policy and procedures to quantifying implementation of
these policies and procedures, then to quantifying results of implementation of
policies and procedures, and ultimately to identifying the impact of implementation
on the organization’s mission.
    Based on existing policies and procedures, the universe of possible metrics can
be prohibitively large; therefore, agencies should prioritize metrics to ensure that the
final set selected for initial implementation has the following attributes:
       • Facilitates improvement of high-priority security control implementation. High
         priority may be defined by the latest GAO or IG reports, results of a risk
         assessment, or an internal organizational goal;
       • Uses data that can realistically be obtained from existing processes and data
         repositories; and
       • Measures processes that already exist and are relatively stable. Measuring
         nonexistent or unstable processes will not provide meaningful information
         about security performance and will therefore not be useful for targeting
         specific aspects of performance. On the other hand, attempting such
         measurement may not be entirely useless, because such a metric will certainly
         produce poor results and will therefore identify an area that needs
         improvement.
    Metrics can be derived from existing data sources, including security certification
and accreditation, security assessments, plan of action and milestones (POA&M),
incident statistics, and agency-initiated or independent reviews. 47 Agencies may
decide to use a weighting scale to differentiate the importance of selected metrics
and to ensure that the results accurately reflect existing security program priorities.
This process would involve assigning values to each metric based on the importance
of a metric in the context of the overall security program. Metrics weighting should
be based on the overall risk mitigation goals, is likely to reflect higher criticality of
department-level initiatives versus smaller-scale initiatives, and is a useful tool that
facilitates integration of information security into the departmental capital planning
process.
    A phased approach may be required to identify short-, mid-, and long-term
metrics in which the implementation time frame depends on a combination of
system-level effectiveness, metric priority, data availability, and process stability.
Once applicable metrics that contain the qualities described above are identified,
they will need to be documented with supporting detail, including frequency of data
collection, data source, formula for calculation, implementation evidence for
measured activity, and a guide for metric data interpretation. Other information
about each metric can be defined based on an organization’s processing and
business requirements.
