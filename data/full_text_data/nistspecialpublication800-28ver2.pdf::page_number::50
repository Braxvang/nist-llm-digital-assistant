                                                                GUIDELINES ON ACTIVE CONTENT AND MOBILE CODE



6.    Summary

Active content offer benefits to both consumers and producers. The associated technologies are varied,
yet sometimes similar and overlapping in function. Java applets, JavaScript, VBScript and ActiveX
provide additional functionality to Web pages, while plug-ins, helper applications, and ActiveX controls
enable browsers to support new types of content. PDF offloads the processing and interpretation of the
presentation of documents to a display interpreter, and macros automate repetitive word processing and
spreadsheet tasks. HTML, JavaScript, and Java are relatively platform independent and can run on many
browsers. VBScript and JavaScript can also be used to pass information between HTML, Java, and
ActiveX components. AJAX allows Web pages to be more responsive, akin to desktop applications.

The benefits of each of these active content technologies must be carefully weighed against the risks they
pose. Security is not black or white, but shades of gray. When employing active content technology,
security measures should be put in place to reduce risk to an acceptable level and to recover if an incident
occurs.

Informed security officers, administrators, and other IT professionals are responsible for developing
security policies based on their organization’s specific security needs and level of acceptable risk.
Unfortunately, rarely is there a “one size fits all” guideline that meets the unique needs of every
organization. Thus, each organization must decide for itself what constitutes an acceptable level of risk
and act accordingly. Establishing an organizational security policy is an important step in developing and
applying appropriate security measures. The IT and security staff have a responsibility for keeping
abreast of the risks associated with emerging technologies, by subscribing to security mailing lists and
visiting manufacturer Web sites for information and updates to products used within their organization.
As active content moves beyond desktop personal computers to mobile handheld devices, television sets,
and other consumer electronic goods, users will be faced with competing and difficult tradeoffs of
decreased privacy and security against increased functionality and ease-of-use.

Before handling active content documents, organizations should consider the following checklist, which
summarizes some recommendations from the material presented in the previous sections:

 Develop the enterprise security policy regarding active content.
 Identify and assess the risk to critical information resources from active content.
 Audit systems on a regular basis to ensure the security policy is implemented correctly and remains
  effective.
 Identify critical information resources and maintain regular backups.
 Become knowledgeable of the security settings of desktop applications and turn off unneeded
  functionality.
 Keep systems current with the latest software upgrades and patches that address security
  vulnerabilities in desktop applications, such as Web browsers, readers, and email, and other critical
  software.
 Obtain all software through approved distribution channels, particularly through internal distribution
  channels set up by the organization for this purpose.
 Evaluate and install anti-malware software, firewalls, active content filters, and dynamic behavior
  monitors according to enterprise security requirements. Keep these products upgraded to the latest
  version.
