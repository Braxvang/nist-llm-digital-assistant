6.4.1    Vulnerability Scanning

Vulnerability scanners are automated tools that are used to identify vulnerabilities and misconfigurations
of hosts. Many vulnerability scanners also provide information about mitigating discovered
vulnerabilities. Vulnerability scanners attempt to identify vulnerabilities in the hosts scanned.
Vulnerability scanners can help identify out-of-date software versions, missing patches, or system
upgrades, and they can validate compliance with or deviations from the organization’s security policy.
To accomplish this, vulnerability scanners identify OSs, server software, and other major software
applications running on hosts and match them with known vulnerabilities in their vulnerability databases.

However, vulnerability scanners have some significant weaknesses. Generally, they identify only surface
vulnerabilities and are unable to address the overall risk level of a scanned server. Although the scan
process itself is highly automated, vulnerability scanners can have a high false positive error rate
(reporting vulnerabilities when none exist). Also, vulnerability scanners may not be able to recognize that
compensating controls are in place that mitigate a detected vulnerability. This means an individual with
expertise in server security and administration must interpret the results. Furthermore, vulnerability
scanners cannot generally identify vulnerabilities in custom code or applications.

Vulnerability scanners rely on periodic updating of the vulnerability database to recognize the latest
vulnerabilities. Before running any scanner, server administrators should install the latest updates to its
vulnerability database. Some databases are updated more regularly than others (the frequency of updates
should be a major consideration when choosing a vulnerability scanner). Because of the potential
negative impact of vulnerability scanning, server administrators may wish to scan test servers first with
new vulnerability database updates to ascertain their impact on the servers before scanning production
servers.

Vulnerability scanners are often better at detecting well-known vulnerabilities than more esoteric ones
because it is impossible for any one scanning product to incorporate all known vulnerabilities in a timely
manner. In addition, manufacturers want to keep the speed of their scanners high (the more
vulnerabilities detected, the more tests required, which slows the overall scanning process). Therefore,
vulnerability scanners may be less useful to server administrators operating less popular servers, OSs, or
custom-coded applications.

Vulnerability scanners provide the following capabilities:

 Identifying active hosts on a network

 Identifying active services (ports) on hosts and which of these are vulnerable

 Identifying applications and banner grabbing

 Identifying OSs

 Identifying vulnerabilities associated with discovered OSs, server software, and other applications

 Testing compliance with host application usage/security policies.
