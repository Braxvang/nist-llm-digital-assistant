CHAPTER TWO

THE FUNDAMENTALS
BASIC CONCEPTS ASSOCIATED WITH RISK ASSESSMENTS




T      his chapter describes the fundamental concepts associated with assessing information
       security risk within an organization including: (i) a high-level overview of the risk
       management process and the role risk assessments play in that process; (ii) the basic
concepts used in conducting risk assessments; and (iii) how risk assessments can be applied
across the organization’s risk management tiers. 12

2.1 RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS
Risk assessment is a key component of a holistic, organization-wide risk management process as
defined in NIST Special Publication 800-39, Managing Information Security Risk: Organization,
Mission, and Information System View. Risk management processes include: (i) framing risk; (ii)
assessing risk; (iii) responding to risk; and (iv) monitoring risk. Figure 1 illustrates the four steps
in the risk management process—including the risk assessment step and the information and
communications flows necessary to make the process work effectively. 13

                   FIGURE 1: RISK ASSESSMENT WITHIN THE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS

The first component of risk management addresses how organizations frame risk or establish a
risk context—that is, describing the environment in which risk-based decisions are made. The
purpose of the risk framing component is to produce a risk management strategy that addresses
how organizations intend to assess risk, respond to risk, and monitor risk—making explicit and

   NIST Special Publication 800-39 provides guidance on the three tiers in the risk management hierarchy including
Tier 1 (organization), Tier 2 (mission/business process), and Tier 3 (information system).
13
   Many of the outputs from the risk framing step provide essential inputs to the risk assessment step and the associated
risk assessment process. These include, for example, the risk management strategy, organizational risk tolerance, risk
assessment methodology, assumptions, constraints, and mission/business priorities.
