CP-7      ALTERNATE PROCESSING SITE

          Control: The organization identifies an alternate processing site and initiates necessary agreements
          to permit the resumption of information system operations for critical mission/business functions
          within [Assignment: organization-defined time period] when the primary processing capabilities
          are unavailable.
          Supplemental Guidance: Equipment and supplies required to resume operations within the
          organization-defined time period are either available at the alternate site or contracts are in place
          to support delivery to the site. Timeframes to resume information system operations are consistent
          with organization-established recovery time objectives.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization identifies an alternate processing site that is geographically separated from the
                primary processing site so as not to be susceptible to the same hazards.
          (2)   The organization identifies potential accessibility problems to the alternate processing site in the
                event of an area-wide disruption or disaster and outlines explicit mitigation actions.
          (3)   The organization develops alternate processing site agreements that contain priority-of-service
                provisions in accordance with the organization’s availability requirements.
          (4)   The organization fully configures the alternate processing site so that it is ready to be used as the
                operational site supporting a minimum required operational capability.

CP-8      TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES

          Control: The organization identifies primary and alternate telecommunications services to support
          the information system and initiates necessary agreements to permit the resumption of system
          operations for critical mission/business functions within [Assignment: organization-defined time
          period] when the primary telecommunications capabilities are unavailable.
          Supplemental Guidance: In the event that the primary and/or alternate telecommunications services
          are provided by a common carrier, the organization requests Telecommunications Service Priority
          (TSP) for all telecommunications services used for national security emergency preparedness (see
          http://tsp.ncs.gov for a full explanation of the TSP program).
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization develops primary and alternate telecommunications service agreements that
                contain priority-of-service provisions in accordance with the organization’s availability
                requirements.
          (2)   The organization obtains alternate telecommunications services that do not share a single point of
                failure with primary telecommunications services.
          (3)   The organization obtains alternate telecommunications service providers that are sufficiently
                separated from primary service providers so as not to be susceptible to the same hazards.
          (4)   The organization requires primary and alternate telecommunications service providers to have
                adequate contingency plans.
