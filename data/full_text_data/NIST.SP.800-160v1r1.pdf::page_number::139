NIST SP 800-160v1r1                                                Engineering Trustworthy Secure Systems
November 2022

H.4.1. Security Purpose
-   Generate the architectural concepts and properties of system architecture alternatives for the
    system protection capability that frame stakeholder protection concerns and meet system
    requirements.
-   Express the architectural concepts and properties in a set of consistent views and models.
-   Provide the security aspects used to select one or more architecture alternatives.

H.4.2. Security Outcomes
-   The problem space is refined with respect to key stakeholder security concerns.
-   Alignment of the architecture with applicable security policies, directives, objectives, and
    constraints is achieved.
-   Concepts, properties, characteristics, behaviors, functions, and constraints that are significant
    to security-relevant architecture decisions about the system are allocated to architectural
    entities.
-   Identified stakeholder protection concerns are addressed by the system architecture.
-   Traceability of the security aspects of system architecture elements to key architecturally
    relevant stakeholder and system requirements is established.
-   Security aspects of architecture views and models of the system are developed.
-   Security aspects of system elements, their interactions, and their interfaces are defined.

H.4.3. Security Activities and Tasks
AR-1   PREPARE FOR SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE DEFINITION
       AR-1.1 Define the security aspects of the system architecture definition strategy.
       AR-1.2 Identify the set of existing security-relevant architectures or reference architectures that
              may have direct applicability and are to be used as guiding oversight.
       AR-1.3 Establish the security aspects of the architecture description framework(s), viewpoints,
              and modeling templates to be used throughout the system architecture definition
              effort.
       AR-1.4 Establish security-specific viewpoints and modeling templates to be used throughout
              the system architecture definition effort.
       AR-1.5 Determine the security evaluation objectives and criteria with respect to the concerns of
              key stakeholders.
       AR-1.6 Determine security evaluation methods, and integrate them with evaluation objectives
              and criteria.
       AR-1.7 Collect and review security evaluation-related information.
       AR-1.8 Identify the security aspects for enabling systems or services needed to support system
              architecture definition.
