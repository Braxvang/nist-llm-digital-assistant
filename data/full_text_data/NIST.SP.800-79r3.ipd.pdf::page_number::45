       NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                    Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
       December 2023                                                           and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

1364                    Guidance: If the operations plan is deemed acceptable, the DAO authorizes the
1365                    authorization processes to advance to the next phase. Acceptance of the
1366                    operations plan signifies that the resources required to initiate and complete the
1367                    authorization activities can be deployed.

1368           Assessment Phase
1369   The assessment phase consists of two tasks: (i) issuer control assessment and (ii) assessment
1370   documentation. The purpose of this phase is to determine the extent to which the requirements of
1371   [FIPS201] are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired
1372   outcomes. This phase also specifies the actions to be taken to correct all identified deficiencies.
1373   An analysis of the impacts of identified deficiencies that cannot be corrected or mitigated
1374   efficiently on the reliable operation of the issuer is conducted and documented. The successful
1375   completion of this phase provides the DAO with the information needed to make an appropriate
1376   authorization decision.
1377           Task 4: Issuer Control Assessment
1378           The objectives of this task are to (i) initiate and assess the applicable issuer controls and
1379           (ii) document the results of the assessment. The assessor first verifies the acceptability of
1380           all documentation, including the operations plan and previous assessments, along with all
1381           relevant federal laws, regulations, standards, and directives. Issuer control assessment
1382           then commences. The assessor also schedules interviews and real-time observations of
1383           issuance processes and initiates all needed testing of the PIV Card, derived PIV
1384           credential, and relevant information system components. Once the assessor has gathered
1385           the results of the assessment procedures, they prepare descriptions of all discovered
1386           deficiencies along with recommendations for addressing and remediating those
1387           deficiencies.
1388                    Subtask 4.1: Review the suggested and selected assessment methods for each
1389                    issuer control in preparation for the assessment.
1390                    Responsibility: Assessor
1391                    Guidance: The scope of the assessment is established based on the authorization
1392                    boundary. The assessor reviews the selected assessment procedures (based on the
1393                    scope of the assessment) in order to plan and coordinate activities for the
1394                    assessment. For example, if a particular issuer control requires the observation of
1395                    a particular process, the assessor needs to schedule the activity in a timely fashion
1396                    after coordinating with the issuing facility management. The assessor, as directed
1397                    by the DAO, may supplement the assessment methods and procedures
1398                    recommended in these guidelines. Assessment methods and procedures may be
1399                    created or tailored for a particular issuer.
1400                    Subtask 4.2: Assemble all documentation and the supporting materials necessary
1401                    for the assessment of the issuer. If these documents include previous assessments,
1402                    review the findings, and determine whether they are applicable to the current
1403                    assessment.
1404                    Responsibility: EIMO, Assessor
