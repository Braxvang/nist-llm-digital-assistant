Table 4-2 reviews some of the factors that determine the level of business intelligence risk.

                            Table 4-2. Factors Influencing Business Intelligence Risk

               Factor                                                     Discussion
                                        For an attack to be successful, the attacker must have the knowledge and
                                        tools necessary to perform the attack and a motive for engaging in malicious
                                        behavior. Many organizations have known adversaries and consequently

                                        because they may not be able to anticipate who may be an adversary in the
                                        future. For example, disgruntled employees always represent an insider
                                        threat even if the organization has not experienced attacks to date.
                                        The most critical item is what information is stored on tags. With the
                                        exception of some access control applications, if tags contain only
                                        identifiers, then the risk is substantially lower than it would be if tags store
                                        data about the tagged item. Information potentially stored on tags that could
                                        be of great value to an adversary includes personal records, location history,
                                        container manifests, and sensor measurements.
 The usefulness or relevance of
 information available to the           Some adversaries might obtain valuable intelligence from the mere
 adversary                              existence of a tag or knowledge of the number of tags at a particular
                                        location. For example, if the tagged item is associated with an individual,
                                        then it could reveal the presence of that person at a specific location.
                                        Similarly, the number of tags at a location provides information about
                                        inventory levels. Accordingly, organizations need to consider how an
                                        adversary might use information about the presence of a tag as well as data
                                        stored on the tag.
                                        If tagged items are located in public areas, business intelligence risk is
                                        considerably higher than it would be if tags stay within access-controlled
                                        facilities. Another consideration is the ability of radio communication to
                                        occur beyond the physical perimeter. For example, if an adversary can read
 The location of RFID components
                                        tags outside of a facilityâ€™s fence, then the business intelligence risk is higher
                                        than it would be if signals were limited to a few feet and could not easily
                                        penetrate walls. The physical location of supporting IT infrastructure can
                                        also play a role in risk determination.
                                        The use of controls such as database access controls, password-protection,
 The presence and effectiveness of
                                        and cryptography can significantly mitigate business intelligence risk if
 RFID security controls
                                        applied properly. Section 5 discusses these controls in more detail.



4.3    Privacy Risk

RFID technology raises several important privacy concerns. One concern is that organizations may
collect personal information for a particular purpose, such as to complete a financial transaction or grant
an individual access to a facility, and then later use that information for a different purpose that the
individual finds undesirable, such as to conduct a direct marketing campaign. Another concern is that
organizations that are implementing RFID systems to serve a particular business process might not be
aware of how the RFID information could be used for unintended purposes, such as the targeting or
tracking of individuals, or the potential disclosure of personal practices or preferences to unauthorized
third parties.
