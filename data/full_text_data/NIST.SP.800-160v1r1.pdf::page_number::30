As secure as reasonably practicable means that an incremental improvement in security would
require a disproportionate deterioration of meeting other system cost, schedule, or performance
objectives; would violate system constraints; or would require unacceptable concessions such as
an unacceptable change in the way operations are performed.

An adequately secure system does not necessarily preclude all of the conditions that can lead to
or result in undesirable consequences. The minimum tolerable levels of security performance and
interpretations of as secure as reasonably practicable may not be fixed for the life of a system.
The information gathered while the system is in use and the lessons learned may guide and
inform modifications that raise the bar on either or both (tolerability and practicability).

The concept of adequately secure is, therefore, inherently context-dependent, and subjective in
nature. It is based on assertions and expectations about the system security objectives and
determining how well those objectives have been achieved. Figure 4 illustrates the trade-offs
between system security and the cost, schedule, and technical performance of the system.

Judging the adequacy of system security requires an understanding of system states. All systems
operate in and transition between a set of states. These states and transitions may correspond to
or be defined by characteristics of the system, such as how the system functions (e.g., start, run,
idle, recovery), how the system is used (e.g., operational, training, maintenance, peacetime,
wartime), and by environmental conditions (e.g., under fire or not, temperature ranges). There
are security characteristics that determine whether each state or transition is secure, insecure, or
indeterminate (i.e., unknown whether secure or insecure). Adequate security depends on being
