2.7 ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE
Organizational culture refers to the values, beliefs, and norms that influence the behaviors and
actions of the senior leaders/executives and individual members of organizations. Culture
describes the way things are done in organizations and can explain why certain things occur.
There is a direct relationship between organizational culture and how organizations respond to
uncertainties and the potential for near-term benefits to be the source for longer-term losses. The
organization’s culture informs and even, to perhaps a large degree, defines that organization’s
risk management strategy. At a minimum, when an expressed risk management strategy is not
consistent with that organization’s culture, then it is likely that the strategy will be difficult if not
impossible to implement. Recognizing and addressing the significant influence culture has on
risk-related decisions of senior leaders/executives within organizations can therefore, be key to
achieving effective management of risk.

Recognizing the impact from organizational culture on the implementation of an organization-
wide risk management program is important as this can reflect a major organizational change.
This change must be effectively managed and understanding the culture of an organization plays
an important part in achieving such organization-wide change. Implementing an effective risk
management program may well represent a significant organization-wide change aligning the
people, processes, and culture within the organization with the new or revised organizational
goals and objectives, the risk management strategy, and communication mechanisms for sharing
risk-related information among entities. To effectively manage such change, organizations
include cultural considerations as a fundamental component in their strategic-level thinking and
decision-making processes (e.g., developing the risk management strategy). If the senior
leaders/executives understand the importance of culture, they have a better chance of achieving
the organization’s strategic goals and objectives by successfully managing risk.

Culture also impacts the degree of risk being incurred. Culture is reflected in an organization’s
willingness to adopt new and leading edge information technologies. For example, organizations
that are engaged in research and development activities may be more likely to push technological
boundaries. Such organizations are more prone to be early adopters of new technologies and
therefore, more likely to view the new technologies from the standpoint of the potential benefits
achieved versus potential harm from use. In contrast, organizations that are engaged in security-
related activities may be more conservative by nature and less likely to push technological
boundaries—being more suspicious of the new technologies, especially if provided by some
entity with which the organization lacks familiarity and trust. These types of organizations are
also less likely to be early adopters of new technologies and would be more inclined to look at the
potential harm caused by the adoption of the new technologies. Another example is that some
organizations have a history of developing proprietary software applications and services, or
procuring software applications and services solely for their use. These organizations may be
reluctant to use externally-provided software applications and services and this reluctance may
result in lower risk being incurred. Other organizations may, on the other hand, seek to maximize
advantages achieved by modern net-centric architectures (e.g., service-oriented architectures,
cloud computing), where hardware, software, and services are typically provided by external
organizations. Since organizations typically do not have direct control over assessment, auditing,
and oversight activities of external providers, a greater risk might be incurred.

In addition to the cultural impacts on organizational risk management perspectives, there can also
be cultural issues between organizations. Where two or more organizations are operating together
toward a common purpose, there is a possibility that cultural differences in each of the respective
organizations may result in different risk management strategies, propensity to incur risk, and
