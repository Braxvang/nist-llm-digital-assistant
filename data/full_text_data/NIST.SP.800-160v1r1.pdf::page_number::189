NIST SP 800-160v1r1                                                  Engineering Trustworthy Secure Systems
November 2022

       -   The procedures for controlling changes to the security knowledge, security skills, and
           security knowledge assets
       -   The plans, mechanisms, and procedures for protection, control, and access to classified or
           sensitive data and information
       -   The mechanisms for secure storage and secure retrieval
       KM-1.2 Identify the security knowledge, skills, and knowledge assets to be managed.
       KM-1.3 Identify projects that can benefit from the application of the security knowledge, skills,
              and knowledge assets.

KM-2   SHARE KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS THROUGHOUT THE ORGANIZATION
       KM-2.1 Establish and maintain a classification for capturing and sharing security knowledge
              and skills.
       Note: This classification includes security expert, common security, and security domains
       knowledge and skills, as well as lessons learned.
       KM-2.2 Capture or acquire security knowledge and skills.
       KM-2.3 Make security knowledge and skills accessible across the organization.

KM-3   SHARE KNOWLEDGE ASSETS THROUGHOUT THE ORGANIZATION
       KM-3.1 Establish a taxonomy to organize security knowledge assets.
       Note: The taxonomy includes the following:
       - Definition of the boundaries of security domains and their relationships to one another
       - Definition of the boundaries of security-relevant domains (e.g., safety) and their
          relationships to one another
       - Domain models that capture essential common and different security-relevant features,
          capabilities, concepts, and functions
       KM-3.2 Develop or acquire security knowledge assets.
       Note: Security knowledge assets include system elements or their representations (e.g.,
       reusable code libraries, security reference architectures), architecture or design elements (e.g.,
       security architecture or security design patterns), processes, security criteria, or other technical
       information (e.g., training materials) related to security domain knowledge and lessons learned.
       KM-3.3 Make all knowledge assets securely accessible to the organization.

KM-4   MANAGE KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS, AND KNOWLEDGE ASSETS
       KM-4.1 Maintain security knowledge, skills, and knowledge assets.
       KM-4.2 Monitor and record the use of security knowledge, skills, and knowledge assets.
