                                                                     COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE



future incidents and to provide stronger protection for systems and data. An incident response capability
also helps with dealing properly with legal issues that may arise during incidents.

Besides the business reasons to establish an incident response capability, Federal departments and
agencies must comply with law, regulations, and policy directing a coordinated, effective defense against
information security threats. Chief among these are the following:

 OMB’s Circular No. A-130, Appendix III,3 released in 2000, which directs Federal agencies to
  “ensure that there is a capability to provide help to users when a security incident occurs in the system
  and to share information concerning common vulnerabilities and threats. This capability shall share
  information with other organizations … and should assist the agency in pursuing appropriate legal
  action, consistent with Department of Justice guidance.”
 FISMA (from 2002),4 which requires agencies to have “procedures for detecting, reporting, and
  responding to security incidents” and establishes a centralized Federal information security incident
  center, in part to:

      – “Provide timely technical assistance to operators of agency information systems … including
          guidance on detecting and handling information security incidents …

      – Compile and analyze information about incidents that threaten information security …
      – Inform operators of agency information systems about current and potential information security
          threats, and vulnerabilities … .”
 Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 200, Minimum Security Requirements for Federal
  Information and Information Systems5, March 2006, which specifies minimum security requirements
  for Federal information and information systems, including incident response. The specific
  requirements are defined in NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53, Recommended Security Controls
  for Federal Information Systems and Organizations.
 OMB Memorandum M-07-16, Safeguarding Against and Responding to the Breach of Personally
  Identifiable Information6, May 2007, which provides guidance on reporting security incidents that
  involve PII.
2.3     Incident Response Policy, Plan, and Procedure Creation

This section discusses policies, plans, and procedures related to incident response, with an emphasis on
interactions with outside parties.

2.3.1     Policy Elements

Policy governing incident response is highly individualized to the organization. However, most policies
include the same key elements:

 Statement of management commitment
 Purpose and objectives of the policy
