                                                                                    Reference(s)
 Automated          CSP implements Web Application Firewall (WAF)                   5.3.1, 5.4.1,
 Enrollment         controls and bot detection technology.CSP implements            5.5.1
 Attempts           out-of-band engagement (e.g., enrollment codes). CSP
                    implements biometric verification and liveness detection
                    mechanism to determine genuine presence of an applicant.
                    CSP implements traffic and network analysis capabilities
                    to identify indications or malicious traffic
 Evidence           CSP validates core attributes with authoritative or credible 4.3, 5.3.2,
 Falsification      sources. CSP checks physical or digital security features 5.3.3, 5.4.2,
                    of the presented evidence.                                   5.4.3, 5.5.2,
                                                                                 5.5.3
 Synthetic Identity CSP collects multiple pieces of identity evidence to         4.3, 4.3,
 fraud              support the proofing process. CSP validates core attributes 5.3.2, 5.3.3,
                    with authoritative or credible sources. CSP verifies         5.3.4, 5.4.2,
                    identity through biometric comparison of the applicant       5.4.3, 5.4.4,
                    to validated identity evidence or biometric data provided 5.5.2, 5.5.3,
                    by an authoritative or credible source.                      5.5.4
 Fraudulent Use of CSP verifies identity through biometric comparison of         5.1.1, 5.3.4,
 Identity (Identity the applicant to validated identity evidence or biometric    5.4.4, 5.5.4
 Theft)             data provide by an authoritative or credible source. CSP
                    implements presentation attack detection measures to
                    confirm the genuine presence of the individual to whom
                    the identity evidence belongs. CSP implements out-of-
                    band engagement (e.g., enrollment codes) and notice
                    of proofing. CSP conducts checks of vital statistics
                    repositories (e.g., Death Master File).CSP implements
                    fraud, transaction, and behavioral analysis capabilities
                    to identify indicators of potentially malicious account
                    establishment.
 Social             CSP conducts training of Trusted Referees to identify        5.1.6, 5.1.7,
 Engineering        indications of coercion or distress. CSP provides out-       5.1.9
                    of-band engagement and notice of proofing to validated
                    address. CSP provides information and communication to
                    end users on common threats and schemes.
 False Claims       CSP implements geographic restrictions on traffic. CSP       5.1.1, 5.3.2,
                    validates core attributes and RP requested business          5.3.3, 5.4.2,
                    attributes with authoritative or credible sources.           5.4.3, 5.5.2,
                                                                                 5.5.3
