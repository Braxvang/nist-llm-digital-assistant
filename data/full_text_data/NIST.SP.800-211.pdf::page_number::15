FY 2019 was a busy and fruitful year of open collaboration with stakeholders from
across government, academia, and industry who worked together to craft and hone
tools, standards, and processes to better identify, prioritize, and manage privacy risks.
NIST also collaborated on the creation of the NIST Privacy Framework: An Enterprise
Risk Management Tool [4], which addresses the need to manage privacy issues across
the U.S. and throughout the world, improve privacy protections, and better manage
compliance with increasing global privacy requirements. The Privacy Framework—
through a risk- and outcome-based approach—is flexible enough to address diverse
privacy needs, enable more innovative and effective solutions that can lead to
better outcomes for individuals and organizations, and stay current with technology
trends such as AI and IoT. The Privacy Framework follows the structure of the NIST
Cybersecurity Framework, facilitating the use of both frameworks together. Each
framework component reinforces privacy risk management through the connection
between business and mission drivers, organizational roles and responsibilities, and
privacy protection activities. The Privacy Framework was developed from comments to
public requests for information (RFI) and discussions during three public workshops,
five webinars, and hundreds of direct interactions with stakeholders. A public draft was
released at the end of FY 2019, and the subsequent final version was released in early
FY 2020.
While the Privacy Framework represents a great leap forward in the privacy risk
management space, NIST also supported advancement in several areas of privacy
engineering in FY 2019.
  •   NIST guidance has sought to highlight the importance of security and privacy for
      all organizations and enterprises. Privacy aspects were subsequently integrated
      into many of NIST’s publications, such as SP 800-37, Revision 2, and NISTIR 8228,
      Considerations for Managing IoT Cybersecurity and Privacy Risks [6].
