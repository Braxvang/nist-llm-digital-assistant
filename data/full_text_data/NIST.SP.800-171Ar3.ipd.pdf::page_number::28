698             ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE
699             Determine if:
700             A.03.01.11.ODP[01]: conditions or trigger events that require session disconnect are
701             defined.
702             A.03.01.11: a user session is automatically terminated after <A.03.01.11.ODP[01]: conditions
