Practical Combinatorial Testing
________________________________________________________________
developed by analyzing data in a report on the use of MCDC testing in avionics software
[16], which contains 20,256 logic expressions in five different airborne systems in two
different airplane models. The table below includes all 7,685 expressions from if and while
statements; expressions from assignment (:=) statements were excluded.

           Figure 2. Cumulative percentage of branches containing n variables.

     As shown in Fig. 2, most branching statement expressions are simple, with over 70%
containing only a single variable. Superimposing the curve from Fig. 2 on Fig. 1, we see
(Fig. 3) that most failures are triggered by more complex interactions among variables. It
is interesting that the NASA distributed database failures, from development-phase
software bug reports, have a distribution similar to expressions in branching statements.
 This distribution may be because this was development-phase rather than fielded software
like all other types reported in Fig. 1. As failures are removed, the remaining failures may
be harder to find because they require the interaction of more variables. Thus testing and
use may push the curve down and to the right.
