intervals (e.g., security assessment and authorization, user awareness and training, and access
control). Similarly, organizational missions and business functions have varied requirements for
reporting and various drivers for action (e.g., changes to risk tolerance; changes in operational
environments, including evolving threat activities; security architecture adjustments, security
status reporting).

3.3    IMPLEMENT AN IS CM PROGRAM
ISCM is implemented in accordance with the strategy. Security-related information (data) is
collected as required for predefined metrics, security control assessments are conducted, and the
security-related information generated is reported in accordance with organizational policies and
procedures. All security control classes (management, operational, and technical) and types
(common, hybrid, and system-specific) are included in the organizational continuous monitoring
program. Every control is monitored for effectiveness, and every control is subject to use in
monitoring security status. Data sources include people, processes, technologies, the computing
environment, as well as any existing relevant security control assessment reports.

Collection, analysis, and reporting of data are automated where possible. Whether manual or
automated, the data collected is assembled for analysis and reported to the organizational officials
charged with correlating and analyzing it in ways that are relevant for risk management activities.
As indicated in the examples above, this may mean taking data from a variety of sources,
collected at various points in time, and combining it in ways that are meaningful for the official
receiving it at the time that it is requested. Part of the implementation stage of the continuous
monitoring process is effectively organizing and delivering ISCM data to stakeholders in
accordance with decision-making requirements. Tools and methodologies are chosen for the
organization-wide ISCM architecture, in order to help ensure that risk-based decisions are
informed by accurate, current security-related information.

Discrete security processes inform and are informed by ISCM data. Organizations also use ISCM
data to inform processes that are not primarily used to control information security risk. Similarly,
data from those processes can also be used to inform the ISCM program. Examples of processes
that inform and are informed by ISCM include, but are not limited to, patch management, asset
management, license management, configuration management, vulnerability management, and
system authorization.

As described in Chapter Two, the ISCM data output from one process may serve as input to many
others.
