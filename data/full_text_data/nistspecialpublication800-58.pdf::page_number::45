       between the endpoints using Session Description Protocol (SDP), which contains
       fields for the codec used, caller’s name, etc. If Bob wishes to place a call to Alice
       he sends an INVITE request to the proxy server containing SDP info for the
       session, which is then forwarded to Alice’s client by Bob’s proxy, possibly via
       her proxy server. Eventually, assuming Alice wants to talk to Bob, she will send
       an “OK” message back containing her call preferences in SDP format. Then Bob
       will respond with an “ACK”. SIP provides for the ACK to contain SDP instead
       of the INVITE, so that an INVITE may be seen without protocol specific
       information. After the “ACK” is received, the conversation may commence along
       the RTP / RTCP ports previously agreed upon. Notice that all the traffic was
       transported through one port in a simple (text) format, without any of the
       complicated channel / port switching associated with H.323. Still, SIP presents
       several challenges for firewalls and NAT. These difficulties are discussed in the
       next section.

 5.2   Existing Security Features within the SIP Protocol

       RFC 3261 describes several security features for SIP, which will be described in
       the next subsections. RFC 3261 deprecates several security features, which were
       advocated in the original RFC 2543, such as the usage of PGP and HTTP Basic
       Authentication.
