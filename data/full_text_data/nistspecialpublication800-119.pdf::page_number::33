together. As a result, core routers are burdened with ever increasing demands on their memory and
processing capacities. In short, IPv4 does not lend itself to a highly scalable and efficient Internet
backbone infrastructure.

Routing prefix aggregation allows contiguous groupings of CIDR addresses to be advertised to the global
Internet as a single network rather than as multiple, distinct networks. Separate routing table entries no
longer need to be made for each allocation of address space. Much like the concept of supernetting, this
means that two distinct organizations sharing only one common attribute, their Internet Service Provider
(ISP), can be attached to the Internet with unique IP addresses from an appropriately sized allocation. Yet
those two distinct entities are reachable through the global Internet using only one globally unique
network route. The two concepts discussed here, scalability of address allocations and routing efficiency
through prefix aggregation, are integral aspects of the design of IPv6.

  3.1.7   Comparing IPv6 and IPv4 Addressing

IPv6 was designed to provide sufficient numbers of globally unique IP addresses to enable true peer-to-
peer communication between nodes on interconnected networks. It was also designed to provide a
simplified hierarchical routing architecture across the Internet backbone—one that does not suffer from
inefficiencies and increasing demands for memory and processing capacities on backbone Internet
routers. Several accommodations have been made to retrofit these concepts onto IPv4, while these same
concepts are native to the IPv6 specification.

IPv6 provides an enormous number of unique addresses, about 3.4 x 1038 compared with IPv4’s roughly
4.3 x 109 addresses. The number of possible IPv6 addresses is so large that many analogies and
metaphors have been created that attempt to convey its magnitude. For example, if each IPv6 address
weighed one gram, the sum total weight of all IPv6 addresses would be greater than the weight of 56
Earths. The available address space under IPv6 is generally considered to be sufficient for the foreseeable
future, even considering the historical growth of the Internet and the devices expected to connect to it in
the future. See Figure 3-5 for a comparison of IPv4 and IPv6 addressing conventions.
