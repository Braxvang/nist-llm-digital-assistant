3.3      Symbols
K                HMAC key.
L                Length in bits of the full message digest from a hash function.
MacTag           Transmitted full or truncated HMAC output.
min(x, y)        The minimum of x and y. For example, if x < y, then min(x, y) = x.
λ                The length in bits of a MacTag, or the length in bits of a truncated
                 message digest (used, for example, by a digital signature algorithm).

4 Approved Hash Algorithms
Currently, there are seven approved hash algorithms specified in FIPS 180-4: SHA-1,
SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384 SHA-512, SHA-512/224 and SHA-512/256. These hash
algorithms produce outputs of 160, 224, 256, 384, 512, 224 and 256 bits, respectively.
The output of a hash algorithm is commonly known as a message digest, a hash value or
a hash output.

4.1      Hash Function Properties
An approved hash function 1 is expected to have the following three properties:
      1. Collision resistance: It is computationally infeasible to find two different inputs to
         the hash function that have the same hash value. That is, if hash is a hash
         function, it is computationally infeasible to find two different inputs x and x’ for
         which hash(x) = hash(x’). Collision resistance is measured by the amount of work
         that would be needed to find a collision for a hash function with high probability.
         If the amount of work is 2N, then the collision resistance is N bits. The expected
         collision-resistance strength of a hash function is half the length of the hash value
         produced by that hash function, i.e., for an L-bit hash function, the expected
         security strength for collision resistance is L/2 bits. For example, SHA-256
         produces a (full-length) hash value of 256 bits; SHA-256 provides an expected
         collision resistance of 128 bits (see Table 1 in Section 4.2).
