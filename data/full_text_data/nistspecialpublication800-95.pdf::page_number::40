Once an entity has been issued a digital identifier, that identifier can be used within that organization to
associate other information with the entity, such as role and authorization attributes. The identifier may
also become part of the digital credential that authorizes the entity to access different resources in the
SOA.

Once registered, an entity must provide a portion of its credentials sufficient to authenticate that entity’s
identity. Again, different organizations have different policies for what constitutes sufficient
authentication credentials. Many e-commerce sites require the entity to supply a username and password;
other organizations may require the entity to submit an X.509 certificate.

After the entity’s identity has been authenticated, the policy decision point (PDP) of the system or
resource to which it desires access must determine whether the now-authenticated entity is also authorized
to access the resource. To perform authorization, the PDP relies on privilege management and attribute
management. Privilege management enforces the policies that govern entity access. The policy decision
to allow or deny access may be based on a single entity attribute such as the entity’s role, or it may
require a combination of fine-grained attributes such as the physical location of the entity, its currently
active role in the system, and its clearance level. The attribute management system uses the entity’s
digital identifier (issued by the IDMS) to locate and retrieve those of the entity’s attributes that are
required by the privilege management policy.
