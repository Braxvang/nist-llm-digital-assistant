                                                                Guidelines on Mobile Device Forensics

       contents of a mobile device and personal computer tend to diverge quickly over time,
       additional information may be found in one device or the other.

       The synchronization software and the device type determine where mobile device files are
       stored on the PC. Each synchronization protocol has a default installation directory, but the
       location may be user specified.

5.4.2 Memory Cards

       Memory card storage capacity ranges from 128MB and up. As technological advances are
       made, such media becomes physically smaller and offers larger storage densities. Removable
       media extends the storage capacity of mobile devices allowing individuals to store additional
       files beyond the device’s built-in capacity and to share data between compatible devices.

       Some forensics tools are able to acquire the contents of memory cards; many are not. If the
       acquisition is logical, deleted data present on the card is not recovered. Fortunately, such media
       can be treated similarly to a removable disk drive and imaged and analyzed using conventional
       forensic tools with the use of an external media reader.

       A physical acquisition of data present on removable media provides the examiner the potential
       to search the contents of the media and potentially recover deleted files. One drawback is that
       mobile device data, such as SMS text messages may require manual decoding or a separate
       decoding tool to interpret. A more serious issue is that content protection features incorporated
       into the card may block the recovery of data. For instance, BlackBerry™ devices provide the
       user with the ability to encrypt data contained on the removable media associated with the
       mobile device. Table 4 gives a brief overview of various storage media in use today.

 5.5   Cloud Based Services for Mobile Devices

       Mobile cloud computing is the combination of mobile networks and cloud computing allowing
       user applications and data to be stored on the cloud (i.e., internet servers) rather than the
       mobile device memory. This data may be stored across geographically diverse locations.
