________________________________________________________________________________________________

PE-14     TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY CONTROLS

          Control: The organization regularly maintains, within acceptable levels, and monitors the
          temperature and humidity within the facility where the information system resides.
          Supplemental Guidance: None.

          Control Enhancements: None.


           LOW PE-14                     MOD PE-14                  HIGH PE-14



PE-15     WATER DAMAGE PROTECTION

          Control: The organization protects the information system from water damage resulting from
          broken plumbing lines or other sources of water leakage by providing master shutoff valves that
          are accessible, working properly, and known to key personnel.
          Supplemental Guidance: None.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization employs mechanisms that, without the need for manual intervention, protect the
                information system from water damage in the event of a significant water leak.


           LOW PE-15                     MOD PE-15                  HIGH PE-15 (1)



PE-16     DELIVERY AND REMOVAL

          Control: The organization authorizes and controls information system-related items entering and
          exiting the facility and maintains appropriate records of those items.
          Supplemental Guidance: The organization controls delivery areas and, if possible, isolates the areas
          from the information system and media libraries to avoid unauthorized physical access.
          Control Enhancements: None.


           LOW PE-16                     MOD PE-16                  HIGH PE-16



PE-17     ALTERNATE WORK SITE

          Control: The organization employs appropriate management, operational, and technical
          information system security controls at alternate work sites.
          Supplemental Guidance: The organization provides a means for employees to communicate with
          information system security staff in case of security problems. NIST Special Publication 800-46
          provides guidance on security in telecommuting and broadband communications.
          Control Enhancements: None.


           LOW Not Selected              MOD PE-17                  HIGH PE-17
