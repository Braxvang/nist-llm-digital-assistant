               Threat Event                                                      Description
     Loss of safety                              Adversaries may target and disable safety system functions as a
                                                 prerequisite to subsequent attack execution or to allow future unsafe
                                                 conditionals to go unchecked.
     Loss of availability                        Adversaries may leverage malware to delete or encrypt critical data on
                                                 HMIs, workstations, or databases.


Numerous OT incidents have been reported and documented. Descriptions of these events help
demonstrate the severity of the threat sources, vulnerabilities, and impacts within the OT domain.
As mentioned in Appendix C.2, the four broad categories of threat sources are adversarial,
accidental, structural, and environmental. Often, the incident can be the result of multiple threat
sources (e.g., an environmental event causes a system failure, which is responded to incorrectly
by an operator and results in an accidental event).
Below is a limited selection of reported incidents that fall into each of the four categories. The
incidents have been additionally categorized into malicious or non-malicious and direct or
indirect to further distinguish the possible causes of OT incidents.
           M = Malicious. The event was initiated by someone for a harmful purpose. The initiator
           may or may not have been targeting the OT or known the potential consequences.
           N = Non-malicious. There does not appear to be evidence that the initiating event was
           intended to cause an incident.
           D = Direct. The event was designed to discover, inhibit, impair, or otherwise impact the
           OT system.
           I = Indirect. The event was not believed to be designed to discover, inhibit, impair, or
           otherwise impact the OT system. The OT system shut down or caused disruption as a
           result of impact to the supporting infrastructure.

C.3.1. Adversarial Events
      •    [M][D] Marconi wireless hack. 9 In 1903, Italian radio pioneer Guglielmo Marconi was
           preparing for his first public demonstration of long-distance secure wireless
           communications from Cornwall to Professor Fleming at the Royal Institution of London.
           Inventor and magician Nevil Maskelyne hacked the system and sent a comical message
           in Morse code referencing “rats.” Maskelyne then published an explanation of his hack in
           the trade journal The Electrician.
      •    [M][I] Worcester air traffic communications.10 In March 1997, a teenager in
           Worcester, Massachusetts, disabled part of the public switched telephone network using a
           dial-up modem connected to the system. This disabled phone service at the control tower,
           airport security, the airport fire department, the weather service, and carriers that use the
           airport. The tower’s main radio transmitter and another transmitter that activated runway
           lights were also shut down, as well as a printer that controllers used to monitor flight
