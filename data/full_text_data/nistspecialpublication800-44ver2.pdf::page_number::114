                                                          GUIDELINES ON SECURING PUBLIC WEB SERVERS



Completed                                        Action
            Conduct remote administration and content updates
            Use a strong authentication mechanism (e.g., public/private key pair, two-factor
            authentication)
            Restrict hosts that can be used to remotely administer or update content on the
            Web server by IP address and to the internal network
            Use secure protocols (e.g., SSH, HTTPS)
            Enforce the concept of least privilege on remote administration and content
            updating (e.g., attempt to minimize the access rights for the remote
            administration/update accounts)
            Change any default accounts or passwords from the remote administration utility
            or application
            Do not allow remote administration from the Internet unless mechanisms such as
            VPNs are used
            Do not mount any file shares on the internal network from the Web server or vice
            versa
