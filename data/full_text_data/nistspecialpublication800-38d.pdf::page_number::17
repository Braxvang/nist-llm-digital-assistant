      •    A ciphertext, denoted C, whose bit length is the same as that of the plaintext.
      •    An authentication tag, or tag, for short, denoted T.

The bit length of the tag, denoted t, is a security parameter, as discussed in Appendix B. In
general, t may be any one of the following five values: 128, 120, 112, 104, or 96. For certain
applications, t may be 64 or 32; guidance for the use of these two tag lengths, including
requirements on the length of the input data and the lifetime of the key in these cases, is given in
Appendix C.

An implementation shall not support values for t that are different from the seven choices in the
preceding paragraph. An implementation may restrict its support to as few as one of these
values. A single, fixed value for t from among the supported choices shall be associated with
each key.

5.2.2      Authenticated Decryption Function

Given the selection of an approved block cipher, key, and an associated tag length, the inputs to
the authenticated decryption function are values for IV, A, C, and T, as described in Sec. 5.2.1
above. The output is one of the following:

      •    the plaintext P that corresponds to the ciphertext C, or
      •    a special error code, denoted FAIL in this document.

The output P indicates that T is the correct authentication tag for IV, A, and C; otherwise, the
output is FAIL. The authentication assurance that can be inferred in each case is discussed in
Appendix B.

The values for len(C), len (A), and len(IV) that an implementation supports for the authenticated
decryption function shall be the same as the values for len(P), len (A), and len(IV) that the
implementation supports for the authenticated encryption function.

5.3       Primitives for Confidentiality and Authentication

The mechanism for the confidentiality of the plaintext within GCM is a variation of the Counter
mode [10], with a particular incrementing function, denoted inc32, for generating the necessary
sequence of counter blocks. The first counter block for the plaintext encryption is generated by
incrementing a block that is generated from the IV.

The authentication mechanism within GCM is based on a hash function, called GHASH 1 , that
features multiplication by a fixed parameter, called the hash subkey, within a binary Galois field.

  The designers of GCM define GHASH somewhat differently, appending encodings of the lengths of its two
arguments. In this Recommendation, these encodings are incorporated instead into the definitions of the
authenticated encryption/decryption functions. The specifications of the authenticated encryption/decryption
functions are ultimately equivalent, but the simplified version of GHASH in this Recommendation does not obtain
all of the properties that are shown for the designers' definition of GHASH in Ref. [7].
