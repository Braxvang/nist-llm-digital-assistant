       NIST SP 800-171r3 fpd (Final Public Draft)                                             Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information

2883   Appendix C. Tailoring Criteria
2884   This appendix describes the security control tailoring criteria used to develop the CUI security
2885   requirements. Table 2 lists the available tailoring options and the shorthand tailoring symbols.
2886   Table 3 through Table 22 specify the tailoring actions applied to the controls in the NIST SP
2887   800-53 moderate baseline [12] to obtain the security requirements in Section 3. The controls and
2888   control enhancements are hyperlinked to the NIST Cybersecurity and Privacy Reference Tool,
2889   which provides online access to the specific control language and supplemental materials in
2890   NIST SP 800-53.

                ORC            The outcome of the control relating to the protection of confidentiality of CUI is adequately covered by
                               other related controls. 16

         The security controls in NIST SP 800-53 provide a comprehensive set of security capabilities needed to protect organizational systems that
       taken together, support the concept of defense-in-depth. As such, some of the security controls may address similar or overlapping security topics
       that are covered by other related controls. These controls have been designated as ORC in the tailoring criteria.
