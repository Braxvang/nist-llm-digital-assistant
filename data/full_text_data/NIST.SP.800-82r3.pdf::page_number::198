NIST SP 800-82r3                                                                   Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security

          progress. The attack also disabled phone service to 600 homes and businesses in the
          nearby town of Rutland.
     •    [M][D] Maroochy Shire sewage spill. 11 In the spring of 2000, a former employee of an
          Australian organization that developed manufacturing software applied for a job with the
          local government but was rejected. Over a two-month period, the disgruntled employee
          reportedly used a radio transmitter on as many as 46 occasions to remotely break into the
          controls of a sewage treatment system. He altered electronic data for particular sewerage
          pumping stations and caused malfunctions in their operations, ultimately releasing about
          264,000 gallons of raw sewage into nearby rivers and parks.
     •    [M][I] Night Dragon. 12 McAfee reported a series of attacks that were designed to steal
          sensitive data from global oil, energy, and petrochemical industries. Adversaries
          exfiltrated proprietary operations data and project financing information with regard to
          oil and gas field bids and operations.
     •    [M][D] Iranian centrifuge, Stuxnet. 13 Stuxnet was a Microsoft Windows computer
          worm discovered in July 2010 that specifically targeted industrial software and
          equipment. The worm initially spread indiscriminately but included a highly specialized
          malware payload that was designed to only target particular SCADA systems that were
          configured to control and monitor specific industrial processes.
     •    [M][D] German steel mill attack. 14 In 2014, hackers manipulated and disrupted control
          systems to such a degree that a blast furnace could not be properly shut down, resulting in
          unspecified “massive” damage.
     •    [M][I] Shamoon. 15 In 2012, Saudi Aramco experienced a malware attack that targeted
          their refineries and overwrote the attacked systems’ master boot records (MBRs),
          partition tables, and other data files. This caused the systems to become unusable.
     •    [M][D] New York dam. 16 In 2013, an Iranian computer security company obtained
          remote access to a computer that controlled the SCADA system for the Bowman Dam
          located in Rye, New York. The adversary was able to view water levels, temperature, and
          the status of the sluice gate. The sluice gate control was disconnected for maintenance at
          the time of adversarial remote access, so the dam could not be remotely controlled.
     •    [M][D] Dragonfly campaign, Havex. 17 The energy sector was targeted during a multi-
          year cyber-espionage campaign that primarily used Havex malware. Havex was a remote
          access Trojan that used the Open Platform Communications (OPC) standard to gather
          information about connected ICS devices on a network. The campaigns were exploratory.
