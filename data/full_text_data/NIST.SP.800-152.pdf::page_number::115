                            When a primary facility is damaged, and a backup facility is
PR:10.6
                            available, a Federal CKMS shall activate its backup facility
                            and place keys that have been, or could have been,
                            compromised on Compromised Key or Certificate Revocation
                            Lists and replace those keys, if required for operational
                            continuity.
                            A Federal CKMS shall be tested annually or in accordance
PR:10.7
                            with a Service Level Agreement to determine that facility-
                            damage detection and recovery mechanisms and procedures
                            work as required.
                            The procedures for maintaining and testing the

                            environmental, physical, and disaster recovery capabilities of
                            a Federal CKMS shall be evaluated every five years or in
                            accordance with a Service Level Agreement and upgraded as
                            needed.

                PE-2        For Low and Moderate impact-level systems, the devices of a
PA:10.2
                PE-3        Federal CKMS should be located in physically secure and
                PE-5        environmentally protected facilities.

                PE-19
                            A Federal CKMS component in a fixed facility should be
PA:10.3
                            tested every six months or in accordance with a Service Level
                            Agreement to verify that adequate environmental, fire, and
                            physical protection is available.
                CP-2        For Low impact-level systems, the fixed facilities of a Federal
PA:10.4
                CP-6        CKMS should have backup facilities and capabilities so that
                CP-7        the FCKMS can resume normal operations within forty-eight
             CP-9 (+3, 6)   hours of a failure of the primary facility or in accordance with
                            a Service Level Agreement.
                            A Federal CKMS mobile facility should have one or more
PA:10.5
                            backup facilities available to replace the facility in the event
                            of loss or destruction.
