12. How often should my ISCP be tested?

   Testing helps evaluate the viability of plan procedures, determine the ability of recovery staff to
   implement the plan, and identify deficiencies in the plan. Testing should occur based on organization
   requirements and when significant changes are made to the information system, supported
   mission/business process(s), or the ISCP. Each element of the ISCP should be tested first
   individually and then as a whole to confirm the accuracy of recovery procedures and the overall
   effectiveness. Test and exercise schedules should be stated in the ISCP policy statement.

13. How often should my ISCP be updated?

   An up-to-date ISCP is essential for successful ISCP operations. As a general rule, the ISCP should be
   reviewed for accuracy and completeness at least annually, as well as upon significant changes to any
   element of the ISCP, system, mission/business processes supported by the system, or resources used
   for recovery procedures. Deficiencies identified through testing (see Question 12) should be
   addressed during plan maintenance. Elements of the plan subject to frequent changes, such as contact
   lists, should be reviewed and updated more frequently. Maintenance schedules should be stated in the
   ISCP policy statement.

14. With what other activities should the ISCP and the recovery solutions be coordinated?

   In addition to integrating contingency planning into the SDLC, information system contingency
   planning should be coordinated with network security policies. System security controls can help to
   protect against malicious code or attacks that could compromise system availability and are closely
   coordinated with the incident response procedures. The ISCP should be closely coordinated with all
   other emergency preparedness plans related to the information system or interconnected systems and
   mission/business processes.
