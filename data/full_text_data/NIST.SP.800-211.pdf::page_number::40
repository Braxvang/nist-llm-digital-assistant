     FOCUS AREA 7



     the NIST Cybersecurity Practice Guide, Critical Cybersecurity Hygiene: Patching The
     Enterprise, that will be released in FY 2020. This report provides practical steps needed
     to implement a cybersecurity reference design that addresses this challenge.

     Secure Inter-Domain Routing (SIDR)
     Most of the routing infrastructure that underpins the internet currently lacks basic
     security services. In most cases, internet traffic must transit multiple networks before
     reaching its destination. Each network implicitly trusts other networks to provide, via the
     Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), the accurate information necessary to correctly route
     traffic across the internet. When that information is inaccurate, traffic will take inefficient
     paths through the internet, potentially arriving at malicious sites that masquerade as
     legitimate destinations or never arriving at its intended destination at all.
     In FY 2019, NIST researchers collaborated at the NCCoE to demonstrate the ability of a
     technique known as BGP route origin validation (ROV) to protect against route hijacking.
     This project culminated in an NCCoE practice guide, NIST SP 1800-14, Protecting the
     Integrity of Internet Routing: Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Route Origin Validation,
     which provided an example implementation that demonstrated the use of BGP ROV
     in realistic deployment scenarios; developed detailed deployment guidance; addressed
     implementation and use issues; and generated best practices and lessons learned [28].
     This resource is intended to improve the security and stability of the global internet
     by allowing networks to verify the validity of BGP routing information and strengthen
     the security and stability of traffic flowing across the global internet—benefitting all
     organizations and individuals that use and rely on it.


     Transport Layer Security (TLS)
     Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a cryptographic protocol that is designed to provide
     privacy and data integrity between two or more communicating computer applications
     over a computer network. TLS is widely used in many common applications, including
     web browsing, email, instant messaging, and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP).
     Websites often use TLS to secure communications between servers and web browsers.
     In FY 2019, the NCCoE initiated a project that uses commercially available technologies
     to demonstrate how medium and large enterprises that rely on Transport Layer Security
     (TLS) can secure both customer-facing and internal applications to manage TLS server
     certificates better by:
       •   Defining operational and security policies and identifying roles and responsibilities;
       •   Establishing comprehensive certificate inventories and ownership tracking;
       •   Conducting a continuous monitoring of certificate operational and security status;
