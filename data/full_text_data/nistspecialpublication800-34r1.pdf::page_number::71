component, such as a power supply, does not cause a system failure. UPS and power monitoring and
management systems also should be used to ensure that power fluctuation will not affect the mainframe.
Because mainframes typically process large critical applications, a long-term backup power solution may
be needed. A gas or diesel generator can ensure that mainframe processing is not interrupted by a power
outage.

Disk redundancy can be provided for the direct access storage devices (DASDs) by implementing a RAID
solution.

Because each mainframe architecture is unique and centralized, a contingency strategy is to have a
replacement system available at an alternate warm or hot site. Since backup mainframe platforms are
very costly to purchase and maintain, many agencies share commercial systems. 44 Agencies also typically
maintain vendor-support contracts to repair damaged units. However, vendor support alone may not
restore system functions within the allowable outage time. In all cases, vendor SLAs should be kept up to
date and reviewed to ensure that the vendor provides adequate support to meet system availability
requirements.

Mainframes should be backed up regularly, and backup media should be stored offsite. Backup and
retention schedules should be based on the criticality of the data being processed and the frequency that
the data is modified. (See Section 5.2.2 for backup solutions.) As with servers, remote journaling or
electronic vaulting to the alternate site could be an effective technical contingency solution. In addition,
disk replication, virtualization, or NAS or SAN technologies that replicate various platforms to one
replicating server could be used in some cases.

5.5          System Contingency Planning Considerations Summary

For information system contingency planning, the ISCP Coordinator should consider technical measures
from two perspectives when planning a system recovery strategy:

           Contingency considerations discuss technical requirements or factors to complement the
            contingency solution.

           Contingency solutions are technically based and are used to implement the contingency strategy.

Table 5-1 provides a summary of contingency considerations and solutions.

     The GSA’s Federal Technology Service Federal Computer Acquisition Center has a governmentwide acquisition contract on
     behalf of the federal government. The program has been in place since 1993 and provides disaster recovery services to more
     than forty federal organizations.
