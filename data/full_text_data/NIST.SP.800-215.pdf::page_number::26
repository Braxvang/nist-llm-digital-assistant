   Enterprise-Wide Network Security Framework – Zero Trust Network Access
   (ZTNA)
Each of the network configurations described in the previous section is for specific security
functions (e.g., user authentication, device authentication). In many enterprise environments,
these network configurations are not isolated implementations but rather an integral part of an
enterprise-wide network that is governed by a security framework or strategy. A predominant
strategy that has been endorsed by both government and industry for hybrid enterprises is zero
trust (ZT). The blueprint for achieving the goals of ZT is the zero trust architecture (ZTA), and
the consequent paradigm for network communication flows is Zero Trust Network Access
(ZTNA). Working with many stakeholders, NIST has defined zero trust and zero trust principles
as follows [33]:
   •   Zero trust (ZT) is the term for an evolving set of cybersecurity paradigms that move
       defenses from static, network-based perimeters to focus on users, assets, and resources. It
       is a set of security primitives rather than a particular set of technologies. Zero trust
       assumes that there is no implicit trust granted to assets or user accounts based solely on
       their physical or network location (i.e., local area networks versus the internet) or on
       asset ownership (e.g., enterprise or personally owned). Zero trust focuses on protecting
       resources (e.g., assets, services, workflows, network accounts) rather than network
       segments, as the network location is no longer seen as the prime component to the
       security posture of the resource.
   •   A zero trust architecture (ZTA) uses zero trust principles to plan industrial and enterprise
       infrastructure and workflows.
NIST’s guidance on zero trust also contains an abstract definition of zero trust architecture
(ZTA) and gives general deployment models and use cases where zero trust could improve an
enterprise’s overall information technology security posture. From the NIST vision of ZTA and
state of practice implementations [34], the following have emerged as the three building blocks
of ZTA:
   1. Client or Browser: The point of entry for all users to access any resources hosted in
      multi-cloud and on-premises environments.
   2. The Controller: The policy decision point (PDP), which evaluates access requests based
      on the policies, conditions, and entitlements that grant access for all users, devices, and
      workloads from a single dashboard or via API.
   3. The Gateway: The policy enforcement point (PEP), a gateway that controls the flow of
      access to protected resources and dynamically builds micro-segmentation rules based on
      granted entitlements.
As already stated, the two established network configuration techniques for enabling ZTNA are
microsegmentation and SDP, which are both discussed in the following subsections.

5.1 Microsegmentation
Microsegmentation is a security design practice where an internal network (e.g., in the data
center, cloud provider region) is divided into isolated segments so that the traffic in and out of
