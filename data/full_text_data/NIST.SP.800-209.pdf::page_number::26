                                                                                             data deduplication and compression. These two approaches can be used together.

                                                                                             Data compression (sometimes performed in hardware) seeks to reduce the amount of data by
                                                                                             encoding it with a known algorithm to produce a representation of data that uses less storage than
                                                                                             the unencoded representation [10]. Data compression can be used in many places, but is most

                                                                                             to reduce the bandwidth requirements for DR and business continuity (BC) operations.
                                                                                             Interoperability is a key requirement for data compression where the compression and

                                                                                             Data deduplication attempts to replace multiple copies of data with references to a shared copy.
                                                                                             It works by eliminating identical blocks of storage. For example, if a storage system has 500
                                                                                             identical blocks, the storage array will store just one copy, thereby eliminating the need to store
                                                                                             the other 499 copies [20]. This can take place at the storage device level, the transmission stage,
                                                                                             or the filesystem level.
