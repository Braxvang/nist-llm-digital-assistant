       NIST SP 800-90C 3pd (Third Public Draft)                          Recommendation for RBG Constructions

1718           RBG3(RS) Construction
1719   The second RBG3 construction specified in this document is the RBG3(RS) construction shown
1720   in Figure 18, and an example of this construction is provided in Appendix B.6.
1721   Note that external conditioning of the outputs from the entropy sources during instantiation and
1722   reseeding is required when the DRBG is a CTR_DRBG without a derivation function and the
1723   entropy sources do not provide a bitstring with full entropy.

1726   6.3.1. Conceptual Interfaces
1727   The RBG interfaces include function calls for instantiating the DRBG (see Section 6.3.1.1),
1728   generating random bits on request (see Section 6.3.1.2), and reseeding the DRBG instantiation (see
1729   Section 6.3.1.3).

1730   6.3.1.1.        Instantiation of the DRBG Within an RBG3(RS) Construction
1731   DRBG instantiation is performed as follows:
1732   RBG3(RS)_DRBG_Instantiate:
1733       Input: integer (prediction_resistance_flag), string personalization_string.
1734       Output: integer status, integer state_handle.
1735       Process:
1736          1. (status, RBG3(RS)_state_handle) = Instantiate_function(256,
1737             prediction_resistance_flag = TRUE, personalization_string).
