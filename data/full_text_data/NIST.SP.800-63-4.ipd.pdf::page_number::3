61   of 2014, 44 U.S.C. ยง 3551 et seq., Public Law (P.L.) 113-283. NIST is responsible
62   for developing information security standards and guidelines, including minimum
63   requirements for federal information systems, but such standards and guidelines shall
64   not apply to national security systems without the express approval of appropriate federal
65   officials exercising policy authority over such systems. This guideline is consistent with
66   the requirements of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130.
67   Nothing in this publication should be taken to contradict the standards and guidelines
68   made mandatory and binding on federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under
69   statutory authority. Nor should these guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding
70   the existing authorities of the Secretary of Commerce, Director of the OMB, or any other
71   federal official. This publication may be used by nongovernmental organizations on a
72   voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright in the United States. Attribution would,
