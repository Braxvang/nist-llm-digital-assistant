                                                                              NIST Special Publication 800-50



This centralized program management model is often deployed by agencies that:

   Are relatively small or have a high degree of structure and central management of most IT functions;
   Have, at the headquarters level, the necessary resources, expertise, and knowledge of the mission(s)
    and operations at the unit level; or
   Have a high degree of similarity in mission and operational objectives across all of its components.
Model 2: Partially Decentralized Program Management Model (Centralized Policy and Strategy;
Distributed Implementation)

In this model, security awareness and training policy and strategy are defined by a central authority, but
implementation is delegated to line management officials in the organization. Awareness and training
budget allocation, material development, and scheduling are the responsibilities of these officials.

The needs assessment is conducted by the central authority, because they still determine the strategy for
the awareness and training program. Policy, strategy, and budget are passed from the central authority to
the organizational units. Based on the strategy, the organizational units develop their own training plans.
The organizational units develop their awareness and training material, and determine the method(s) of
deploying the material within their own units.

As was the case in the centralized program management model (Model 1), communication between the
central authority and the organizational units travels in both directions in this model. The central
authority communicates the agency’s policy directives regarding IT security awareness and training, the
strategy for conducting the program, and the budget for each organizational unit. The central authority
may also advise the organizational units that they are responsible for developing training plans and for
implementing the program, and may provide guidance or training to the organizational units so that they
can carry out their responsibilities.

The central authority may require periodic input from each organizational unit, reporting the budget
expenditures made, the status of unit training plans, and progress reports on the implementation of the
awareness and training material. The central authority may also require the organizational units to report
the number of attendees at awareness sessions, the number of people trained on a particular topic, and the
number of people yet to attend awareness and training sessions. The organizational unit may be asked to
describe lessons learned, so the central authority can provide effective guidance to other units.
