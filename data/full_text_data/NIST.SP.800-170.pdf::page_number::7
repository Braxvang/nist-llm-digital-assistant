Welcome Letter
   The Computer Security Division (CSD), a component of the Information Technology Laboratory at the National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) is responsible for developing standards, guidelines, tests, and metrics for protection of non-national security federal information systems.
NIST standards and guidelines are developed in an open and transparent manner that enlists broad industry and academia expertise from around
the world. While developed for federal agency use, these resources are voluntarily adopted by other organizations because they are effective and
accepted throughout the world.
   The need for cybersecurity standards and best practices that address interoperability, usability and privacy continues to be critical for the Nation.
In Fiscal Year (FY) 2013, CSD continued to align its resources to enable greater development and application of practical, innovative security
technologies and methodologies that enhance our ability to address current and future computer and information security challenges. Our foundational
research and applied cybersecurity programs continue to advance in many areas including cryptography; identity and access management; cloud,
virtualization, and mobile technologies; and advanced security testing and measurement.
  Strong partnerships with diverse stakeholders are vital to the success of our technical programs. In February 2013, the President issued Executive
Order 13636 that directed NIST to work collaboratively with industry to develop a voluntary framework - based on existing standards, guidelines, and
practices - to improve critical infrastructure cybersecurity practices. NIST held several workshops, meetings, webinars, and informal sessions to
gather feedback with the goals of generating content for the framework and discuss several topics that help inform and guide NIST in this effort. In
August 2013, we produced a discussion draft of the preliminary framework.
  Working closely with standards developing organizations, industry and interagency partners, we are evolving and expanding security automation
capabilities to help organizations manage and measure the security of systems and technologies. Our cybersecurity awareness, training, and
education programs also exemplify the importance of these partnerships by engaging with academic institutions, federal agencies, small and medium
businesses and others to increase awareness and enhance the overall cybersecurity posture of the Nation.
   Active engagement with the diverse federal community continues to be critical to our success. This interaction is most prominent in our strengthened
collaborations with the Department of Defense, the Intelligence Community, and the Committee on National Security Systems to establish a common
foundation for information security across the federal government. Through this partnership, NIST released Special Publication (SP) 800-53 Revision
4, Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations, in April 2013. This guideline provides organizations with state-of-
the-practice security controls to fundamentally strengthen their systems and the environments in which those systems operate. SP 800-53 Revision
4 and other NIST standards and guidelines contribute to systems that are more resilient in the face of cyber attacks and other threats.
   Late in FY 2013, news reports about leaked classified documents caused concern from the cryptographic community about the security of NIST
cryptographic standards and guidelines. Recognizing community concern regarding some specific standards, we reopened the public comment period
for three Special Publications to give the public a second opportunity to view and comment on the documents. This initial step will be followed by a
                                       review of our cryptographic development process and NIST cryptographic standards and guidelines in FY 2014.
                                         For many years, CSD, in collaboration with our global partners across industry, academia, and government,
                                      has made great contributions to help secure the nation’s critical information and infrastructure. We look forward
                                      to furthering these relationships in FY 2014 as we lead the development and practical implementation of
                                      scalable and sustainable information security standards and practices in areas such as cyber-physical and
                                      industrial control systems, privacy engineering, security automation, and mobile technologies.
