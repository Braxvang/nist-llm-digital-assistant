3775, Mobility Support in IPv6,33 but many other published RFCs and work still in progress support
MIPv6.

As one might expect, MIPv6 has its own terminology, a certain amount of which is essential for
understanding how it works. The most important terms are:

    Mobile Node (MN). A node using MIPv6 to change its point of network attachment

    Home Address (HoA). The permanent, routable unicast address of the MN

    Home Link. The link on which the MN’s HoA is defined

    Foreign Link. Any link except the home link

    Care-Of Address (CoA). A routable unicast address used by the MN on a foreign link

    Correspondent Node (CN). A peer with which the MN is communicating

    Home Agent (HA). A router on the MN’s Home Link with which the MN registers its CoA and
     which forwards traffic to and from the MN at its CoA

    Binding. The association of a HoA and CoA for a given amount of time

    Binding Cache (on HA or CN). A table of other nodes’ bindings and their lifetimes

    Binding Update List (on MN). A MN’s table of HA and CN bindings

    Route optimization. Direct communications between a MN and CN without involving a HA
As with SHIM6, MIPv6 solves the problems created by using IP addresses for both identity and location.
A MN’s identity is its HoA, and its location is its CoA. The goal is to establish and use bindings between
these securely and efficiently, and the first step is for a MN to set up IPsec-secured communications with
a HA. This may be done before leaving the home link. Figure 4-2 shows the main components of
MIPv6.

     RFC 3775 is currently being revised to include items like changes to IKE and IPsec, new work on bootstrapping, and an
     update to the IPv6 addressing architecture, in the current version of the IETF Internet Draft, Mobility Support in IPv6, Work
     in Progress.
