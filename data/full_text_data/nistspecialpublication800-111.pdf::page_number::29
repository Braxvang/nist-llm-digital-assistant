the factors grants access to information secured in another factor, which is then used to gain access to the
storage encryption key. For example, a PIN or password could be used to retrieve a key from a smart
card or cryptographic token; that key could then be used to decrypt the storage encryption key. 36

Some storage encryption products allow the use of multiple user IDs on a single device. If the IDs are
tied to a single storage encryption key, then each user can access the same protected information. If each
ID is linked to a separate key, then the access is dependent on how the keys are used—for example, a
container could be encrypted using a single key so that only one user can access it, or encrypted using
several keys so that users can share the contents of the container.

For storage encryption authentication, organizations often want to leverage existing enterprise
authentication solutions (e.g., Active Directory, RADIUS, PKI, Personal Identity Verification [PIV]
cards) instead of adding another authenticator for users. Generally, using an existing authentication
solution is acceptable only if it provides multi-factor authentication. Using a single-factor authenticator
for multiple purposes significantly weakens the protection that authentication provides. 37 For example,
reusing a user’s OS password for pre-boot authentication in an FDE deployment would allow an attacker
to learn only a single password to gain full access to the device’s information. The password could
potentially be acquired through technical methods, such as infecting the device with malware, or through
physical means, such as watching a user type in a password in a public location. Another example is
having a volume, virtual disk, or file/folder encryption product use the OS’s authentication for single
sign-on (SSO). Once a user authenticates to the OS at login, the user can access the encrypted files
without further authentication, so the security of the solution is heavily dependent on the strength of the
OS authenticator. Organizations should carefully consider the security implications of using the same
single-factor authenticator for multiple purposes. In particular, organizations should not use email
passwords and other passwords sometimes transmitted in plaintext as single-factor authenticators for
storage encryption. Also, organizations concerned about targeted attacks, such as someone stealing a
particular laptop to gain access to a specific user’s data, should not use only passwords for storage
encryption authentication because of the relative ease of capturing a user’s password (e.g., watching a
password being typed).

Organizations also need to ensure that the storage encryption authenticators are protected properly. This
includes both technical mechanisms, such as encrypting passwords or storing cryptographic hashes of
passwords, and operational and management mechanisms. For example, policy should state and users
should be made aware that authenticators should not be stored in proximity of the end user device (e.g., a
password should not be on a piece of paper in a laptop case), and that for two-factor authentication,
multiple authenticators should not be stored with each other (e.g., a password or PIN should not be
written on the back of a hardware token).

Because authentication controls access to storage encryption keys, the loss of authenticators can prevent
access to the encrypted data. Organizations should determine how the loss of authenticators (both user
and administrator-level) will be handled before implementing storage encryption. Most products offer
recovery mechanisms for password-based user authentication. For example, a user that has forgotten a
password chooses a recovery option on the protected computer. The computer provides a special code to
the user, who then uses another computer to access the organization’s storage encryption recovery Web

     The following authentication methods for storage encryption are listed from weakest to strongest based on their general
     effectiveness: single sign-on, unique password or PIN, token, token with unique password or PIN. See NIST SP 800-63,
     Electronic Authentication Guideline, for additional information (http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/).

     In many cases, single-factor authentication will not be an option because the sensitivity of the data being protected will
     necessitate the use of multi-factor authentication. Using the same single-factor authenticator for storage encryption and
     other purposes may be acceptable if appropriate compensating controls are used, such as the device using storage encryption
     residing only in physically secured office space.
