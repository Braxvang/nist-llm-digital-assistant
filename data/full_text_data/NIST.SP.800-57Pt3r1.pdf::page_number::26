5. For digital signature certificates, CAs shall sign the certificate using a digital
   signature process (i.e., signature algorithm, hash function and key) whose security
   strength is equal to or greater than the security strength of the subject public key in
   the certificate. For key establishment certificates, CAs may sign the certificate using a
   digital signature process whose security strength is less than the security strength of
   the subject public key in the certificate16.
6. Generating key pairs:
     a) Users should generate their own digital signature key pairs.
     b) Key establishment key pairs may be generated by the user or by the PKI on the
        user’s behalf; where required, the PKI that generated a user’s key pair may retain
        copies of the key-establishment private key to permit key recovery.
     c) CAs should perform proof of possession for all key pairs before issuing
        certificates.
7. CAs shall obtain assurance of public-key validity before issuing certificates.
8. Key usage extension.
     a) All certificates issued shall include the key-usage extension.
     b) The key-usage extension shall restrict acceptance of the private key to a single
        cryptographic function: either user/entity authentication and verification of
        committed data, or key establishment.
9. All certificates shall include the CRL distribution-points extension to support the
   retrieval of status information.
10. If an OCSP responder is supported, a certificate shall include an appropriate URL in
    the Authority Information Access extension.

11. Certificates should be renewed before they expire and replaced if there is a change in
    the certificate’s contents, such as the domain name or the embedded e-mail address.


2.4.2 Certificate Revocation Requests
1. CAs should be configured to automate revocation processing where practical:


16
   A public key certificate used for key establishment involves two keys: the subject (key establishment)
public key, which is used to establish a symmetric key that will protect data, and the signing key of the
Certification Authority (CA), which is used to sign the certificate. The CA’s signing key needs to be
secure only until the key-establishment certificate expires, but the subject (key establishment) public key
needs to be secure as long as the data must be secure, which may be long after the key establishment
certificate expiration date. As long as the CA’s signing key is secure during the certificate’s lifetime, and
the certificate has been securely archived, any break of the CA signing key after the expiration of the
certificate does not affect the validity of the subject (key-establishment) public key or the security that it
(the subject public key) can provide. For example, if the security strength of the subject (key establishment)
public key is greater than that of the CA’s signing key, any break of the signing key after the subject public
key is signed does not affect the security of that public key. Therefore, it is acceptable for a key transport or
key agreement subject public key to be stronger than the CA key used to sign a certificate containing the
key agreement or key transport public key.
