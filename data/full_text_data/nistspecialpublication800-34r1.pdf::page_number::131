CP-1 CONTINGENCY PLANNING POLICY AND PROCEDURES

Control: The organization develops, disseminates, and reviews/updates [Assignment: organization-defined
frequency]:

       a.   A formal, documented contingency planning policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities,
            management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and
       b.   Formal, documented procedures to facilitate the implementation of the contingency planning policy and
            associated contingency planning controls.

Supplemental Guidance: This control is intended to produce the policy and procedures that are required for the
effective implementation of the security controls and control enhancements in the contingency planning family. The
policy and procedures are consistent with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations,
standards, and guidance. The contingency planning policy can be included as part of the general information
security policy for the organization. Contingency planning procedures can be developed for the security program in
general and for a particular information system, when required. The organizational risk management strategy is a
key factor in the development of the contingency planning policy.

Control Enhancements: None.

     LOW CP-1                                                      MOD CP-1                      HIGH CP-1

     Numbers in parentheses in this table refer to Control Enhancements defined for that control in NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 3. A
     control enhancement either adds related functionality or strengthens a basic control. Starting with NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 3,
     CP-5 has been incorporated into CP-2, and has been removed as a control.
