GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



               permanently write protect a block of memory. Mode 2 also has a 16-bit lock pointer which is
               located in unaddressable memory. The lock pointer points to a word in memory. All
               complete blocks of memory at addresses less than the number stored in the lock pointer
               cannot be overwritten.
 ISO/IEC 18000-4 covers systems operating at 2.45 GHz. This standard has two modes: a passive tag
  reader-talks-first mode and a battery assisted tag-talks-first mode.
 ISO/IEC 18000-5 was developed for 5.8 GHz operation but this standard was withdrawn.
 ISO/IEC 18000-6 defines three types of tags. Types A and B operate at 860 to 930 MHz, but they use
  different encoding and anti-collision methods on the forward channel. Type C is equivalent to the
  EPCglobal Class-1 Generation-2 standard.
 ISO/IEC 18000-7 is an RTF protocol for an RFID system that operates at 433 MHz. Tags have a 32-
  bit tag ID and a 16-bit manufacturer ID. Readers are given a 16-bit identifier as well. A 32-bit
  password can be set on the tags. A bit, referred to as the “secure bit” in the standard, is set to
  determine if the tag is password protected or not. If protected, read/write of the User ID, User ID
  Length, Routing Code, and memory are password protected. ISO/IEC 18000-7 supports optional
  command database query commands that are transmitted to all tags. The queries are sent in multiple
  steps and can use logical operators such as clear, and, and-or, and relational operators such as equal,
  less than, greater than, and not. Tags that receive all steps of the query will do an internal database
  search and readers can retrieve the results of these queries.
There are also a number of item management-related standards for the application of livestock tracking. 91

A.2       Industry Standards

The most prominent industry standards for RFID are the EPCglobal specifications and standards for
supply chain and patient safety applications. All EPCglobal specifications developed to date are for
passive, RTF RFID systems. Four specifications have been developed by EPCglobal: Class-0 UHF, the
Class-1 Generation-1 HF, the Class-1 Generation-1 UHF, and the Class-1 Generation-2 UHF
specifications. Of these specifications, the Class-1 Generation-2 specification has been approved by
EPCglobal as a standard.

The first specification developed by EPCglobal was the EPCglobal Class-0 specification for 900 MHz
UHF operation. The intent of this specification was to establish a low cost identification tag. The Class-0
specification provides three main features: an EPC, a 16-bit cyclic redundancy check (CRC), 92 and a self-
destruct feature. The self-destruct feature is also known as the kill feature. When a reader issues the kill
command and the appropriate 24-bit password, the tag no longer responds to any commands. 93 The Four
EPC identifiers described in the standard are shown in Table A-1.

      Livestock tracking standards include ISO 11784, ISO 11785, and ISO 14223. ISO 11784 covers the data format for such
      tags. ISO 11785 defines the technical details of such a tag, and ISO 14223 is an updated standard for livestock tracking
      tags.
92
      A cyclic redundancy check is used to detect errors such as those introduced by noise in a communication channel.
