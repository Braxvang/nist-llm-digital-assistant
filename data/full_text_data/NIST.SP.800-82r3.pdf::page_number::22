NIST SP 800-82r3                                        Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

In cooperation with the public and private sector OT community, NIST has developed specific
guidance on the application of the security controls in NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53,
Rev. 5, Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations [SP800-53r5],
to OT. This guidance is included in Appendix F of this document.
While many of the controls in NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5 are applicable to OT as written, some
controls require OT-specific interpretation and/or augmentation by adding one or more of the
following:
   •   OT Discussion provides organizations with additional information on the application of
       the security controls and control enhancements to OT and the environments in which
       these specialized systems operate. The guidance also provides information as to why a
       particular security control or control enhancement may not be applicable in some OT
       environments or may be a candidate for tailoring (i.e., the application of scoping
       guidance and/or compensating controls). OT Discussion does not replace the original
       Supplemental Guidance in NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5.
   •   Control Enhancements (one or more) provide augmentations to the original control that
       may be required for some OT systems.
 The most successful method for securing OT systems is to gather industry-recommended
 practices and engage in a proactive, collaborative effort between management, the OT
 engineers and operators, the IT organization, and a trusted OT advisor. This team should draw
 upon the wealth of information available from the ongoing Federal Government, industry
 group, vendor, and standards activities listed in Appendix D.
