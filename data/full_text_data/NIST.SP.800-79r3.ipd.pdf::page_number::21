      NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                                Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
      December 2023                                                                                       and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

587   [HSPD-12] and aware of the potential risks to the organization’s operations, assets, and
588   personnel (e.g., applicants, operation staff).
589   The assessment (Sec. 5.2) and the authorization (Sec. 5.3) are both carried out by the
590   organization that “owns” (i.e., manages, controls, or contracts) the issuance of PIV Cards and/or
591   derived PIV credentials. 4 In order to make an informed, risk-based authorization decision, the
592   assessment process SHOULD seek to answer the following questions:
593           •    Has the issuer implemented the requirements of [FIPS201] and, optionally, [SP800-157]
594                (in the case of derived PIV credential issuance) in a manner consistent with the standard?
595           •    Do personnel understand the responsibilities of their roles and/or positions and reliably
596                perform all required activities as described in the issuer’s documentation?
597           •    Are the services and functions at the issuer, its facilities, and/or SRIP stations (e.g.,
598                identity proofing/registration, card/token production, activation/issuance) carried out in a
599                consistent, reliable, and repeatable manner?
600           •    Have deficiencies identified during the assessment been documented? Have current and
601                potential impacts on security and privacy been highlighted? Have the recommendations
602                and timelines for correction or mediation been included in the assessment report?

603                Authorization Boundary of the Issuer
604   The organization’s first step is to identify the appropriate authorization boundary of the issuer.
605   The authorization boundary defines the specific operations that are to be the target of the
606   assessment and authorization. A PIV Card issuer (PCI) comprises the complete set of functions
607   required for the issuance and maintenance of PIV Cards, while a derived PIV credential issuer
608   (DPCI) comprises the complete set of functions required for the issuance and maintenance of
609   derived PIV credentials. In determining the authorization boundary, the organization SHALL
610   consider whether all of the necessary functions required for the issuance and maintenance of PIV
611   Card or derived PIV credentials are included within the scope. The organization SHALL also
612   consider whether these functions are being performed identically in all issuing facilities, are
613   using identical information technology components, and are under the same direct management
614   control. For example, an organization may have two sub-organizations, each of which has
615   distinct processes and management structures. The organization MAY decide to establish two
616   separate issuers, each with its own authorization boundary. In this example, two separate
617   assessments would be undertaken, and each assessment would result in an independent
618   authorization decision.
619   In drawing an authorization boundary, an organization MAY only want to include a subset of its
620   issuing facilities. For example, if an issuer has several facilities, some of which are ready for
621   operation and some that are still in the development stage, the organization MAY choose to
622   define the authorization boundary to include only those issuing facilities that are ready to be
623   assessed. If the authorization is successful, the organization would authorize the issuer along
624   with its subset of issuing facilities to operate and begin issuing PIV Cards. The remaining issuing

          The trust in PIV Cards and derived PIV credentials stems from the guidelines in Task 6 of Sec. 5.3.
