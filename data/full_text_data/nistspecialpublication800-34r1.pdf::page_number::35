3.4.2        Backup Methods and Offsite Storage

System data should be backed up regularly. Policies should specify the minimum frequency and scope of
backups (e.g., daily or weekly, incremental or full) based on data criticality and the frequency that new
information is introduced. Data backup policies should designate the location of stored data, file-naming
conventions, media rotation frequency, and method for transporting data offsite. Data may be backed up
on magnetic disk, tape, or optical disks, such as compact disks (CDs). The specific method chosen for
conducting backups should be based on system and data availability and integrity requirements. These
methods may include electronic vaulting, network storage, and tape library systems. 24

It is good business practice to store backed-up data offsite. Commercial data storage facilities are
specially designed to archive media and protect data from threatening elements. If using offsite storage,
data is backed up at the organization’s facility and then labeled, packed, and transported to the storage
facility. If the data is required for recovery or testing purposes, the organization contacts the storage
                                                                                                     25
facility requesting specific data to be transported to the organization or to an alternate facility.
Commercial storage facilities often offer media transportation and response and recovery services. When
selecting an offsite storage facility and vendor, the following criteria should be considered:

            Geographic area: distance from the organization and the probability of the storage site being
             affected by the same disaster as the organization’s primary site;
            Accessibility: length of time necessary to retrieve the data from storage and the storage facility’s
             operating hours;
            Security: security capabilities of the shipping method, storage facility, and personnel; all must
             meet the data’s security requirements;
            Environment: structural and environmental conditions of the storage facility (i.e., temperature,
             humidity, fire prevention, and power management controls); and
            Cost: cost of shipping, operational fees, and disaster response/recovery services.

3.4.3        Alternate Sites

As stated in Section 2.1, NIST SP 800-53 identifies the CP controls for information systems. The FIPS
199 security categorization for the availability security objective determines which controls apply to a
particular system. For example, an information system categorized with a low-availability security
objective does not require alternate storage or a processing site (CP-6 and CP-7, respectively), and an
information system with a moderate-availability security objective requires the system backup and testing

     Additional technical considerations are discussed in Chapter 5.
25
     Backup tapes should be tested regularly to ensure that data are being stored correctly and that the files may be retrieved without
     errors or lost data. Also, the ISCP Coordinator should test the backup tapes at the alternate site, if applicable, to ensure that the
     site supports the same backup configuration that the organization has implemented.
