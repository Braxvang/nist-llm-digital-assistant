      NIST SP 800-73pt2-5 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                    Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification: Part 2
      September 2023                                                       PIV Card Application Card Command Interface

382   The bytes that comprise the PIV Card Application PIN and pairing code SHALL be limited to
383   values 0x30 – 0x39, the ASCII values for the decimal digits '0' – '9'. For example:
384       •   Actual PIV Card Application PIN: “123456” or '31 32 33 34 35 36'
385       •   Padded PIV Card Application PIN presented to the card command interface: '31 32 33 34
386           35 36 FF FF'
387   The PIV Card Application SHALL enforce the minimum length requirement of 6 bytes for the
388   PIV Card Application PIN (i.e., SHALL verify that at least the first 6 bytes of the value
389   presented to the card command interface are in the range 0x30 – 0x39) and the other formatting
390   requirements specified in this section.
391   If the Global PIN is used by the PIV Card Application, then the above encoding, length, padding,
392   and enforcement of minimum PIN length requirements for the PIV Card Application PIN
393   SHALL apply to the Global PIN.
394   The PUK SHALL be 8 bytes in length and MAY be any 8-byte binary value. That is, the bytes
395   that comprise the PUK MAY have any value in the range 0x00 – 0xFF.

396           Current State of the PIV Card Application
397   The elements of the current state of the PIV Card Application when the PIV Card Application is
398   the currently selected application are described in Table 1.
