NIST SP 800-85A-4                                               PIV CARD APPLICATION & MIDDLEWARE
                                                                         INTERFACE TEST GUIDELINES

exercised through contactless interface. The tester shall verify an appropriate response code is
returned.

TE01.21.02: The tester shall validate that the PIV Card Application checks that a contact interface is
being used for contact-only APDUs.

Note: This assertion is not separately tested. This assertion is indirectly tested by verifying whether
the card application returns an appropriate error response code for those commands that cannot be
exercised through contactless interface when VCI is not in use and the commands are not contact
only commands.

AS01.22: In the dual-chip configuration, a separate PIV Card Application shall be loaded on
each chip.

Note: This assertion is not separately tested.

A.2     PIV Data Model

A.2.1      PIV Card Data Objects

AS02.01: A PIV Card Application shall contain seven mandatory interoperable data objects,
two conditionally mandatory data objects (if the cardholder has a government-issued email
account at time of credential issuance) and twenty-seven optional data objects for
interoperable use.

           •   The seven mandatory data objects are the following: 1. Card Capability
               Container; 2. Card Holder Unique Identifier; 3. X.509 Certificate for PIV
               Authentication; 4. X.509 Certificate for Card Authentication; 5. Cardholder
               Fingerprints; 6. Cardholder Facial Image; and 7. Security Object

           •   The two conditionally mandatory data objects are the following: 1. X.509
               Certificate for Digital Signature; and 2. X.509 Certificate for Key Management.

           •   The twenty-seven optional data objects for interoperable use are the following: 1.
               Printed Information; 2. Discovery Object; 3. Key History Object; 4. 20 retired
               X.509 Certificates for Key Management; 5. Cardholder Iris Images; 6. Biometric
               Information Templates Group Template; 7. Secure Messaging Certificate Signer;
               and 8. Pairing Code Reference Data Container.

Note: This assertion is not separately tested.

A.2.2      OIDs and Tags of PIV Card Application Data Objects

AS02.02: For the purpose of constructing PIV Card Application data object names in the
CardApplicationURL in the Card Capability Container of the PIV Card Application, the
NIST RID ('A0 00 00 03 08') shall be used and the card application type shall be set to '00'.
