features being correlated, the more sensitive the algorithm is. Clearly, there is a
threshold below which the sensitivity will be too high and all objects will appear
similar; it is up to the algorithm designer to identify that threshold and incorporate it
into the implementation.
Two examples of tests for measuring an algorithm’s sensitivity are fragment detection
and single-common-block correlation.
   Fragment detection. Fragment detection quantifies the length of the shortest
    sample from a data object, for which the similarity tool reliably correlates the
    sample and the whole object. Common uses include correlating a disk block, or
    network packet to file.
   Single-common-block correlation. The single-common-block correlation test is
    designed to characterize the behavior of an algorithm in the case where two files
    share a single common object. That is, given two files f1 and f2 that share a common
    object O (but are otherwise dissimilar), what is the smallest O for which the
    similarity tool reliably correlates the two targets?

3.3.3 Robustness

Robustness is a measure of the ability of an approximate matching algorithm to find correlation
among related objects in the presence of noise and routine transformations. Common
transformations include internal fragmentation (e.g., during network transmission) and
misalignment (adding content during artifact editing).

Alignment robustness and white noise resistance are examples of tests that measure an
algorithm’s robustness.

   Alignment robustness. Alignment robustness is an attempt to quantify the
    sensitivity of an algorithm to alignment shifts. Specifically, the test analyzes the
    impact of inserting sequences of bytes at the beginning of one of the compared
    artifacts.
   White noise resistance. This test measures the amount of (uniformly) random noise
    that can be added to an object before the approximate matching algorithm becomes
    unable to correlate the original and the modified version. For example, for ssdeep
    [5] it was shown that a few changes distributed over the input are sufficient to
    prevent a match [6].
