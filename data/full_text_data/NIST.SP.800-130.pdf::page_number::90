Revocation Lists and replaced, if appropriate. Wind and water damage are the common
environmental risks; fire is both an environmental risk and a facility design-dependent
risk.

FR:10.1 The CKMS design shall specify the required environmental, fire, and physical
access control protection mechanisms and procedures for recovery from damage to the
primary and all backup facilities.

10.2 Utility Service Outage
A CKMS requires reliable utility services, including electricity, water, sewer, air
conditioning, heat, and clean air in order to assure the continued availability of the
CKMS. Electrical power sufficient to satisfy the requirements of all electronic devices, as
well as human safety and comfort provisions in normal operations and during
emergencies, should be available in the primary and all backup CKMS facilities.

FR: 10.2 The CKMS design shall specify the minimum as well as recommended
electrical, water, sanitary, heating, cooling, and air filtering requirements for the primary
and all backup facilities.

10.3 Communication and Computation Outage
A CKMS needs sufficient communication and computation capability to perform its
required functions and to provide the services required by its users. Long-distance
communication capabilities are typically offered by commercial vendors, and many
computer vendors can provide computers sufficient for large key-management
applications. Redundant communications equipment is often installed in a CKMS to
assure high availability. Remote on-line backup facilities can be used to provide even
higher service availability, especially against potential environmental (e.g., weather)
risks. The ability to quickly access alternative communications services is highly
desirable in the event of a communications service failure.

FR:10.3 The CKMS design shall specify the communications and computation
redundancy present in the design and required to be available during operation in order to
assure continued operation of services commensurate with the anticipated needs of users,
enterprises, and CKMS applications.

10.4 System Hardware Failure
Since the CKMS is critical for the secure operation of the information management
system that it supports, it is desirable to minimize the impact of hardware failures of
CKMS components and devices. Several approaches to recover from hardware failure
exist. These approaches tend to trade-off the ease and speed of recovery with cost. The
redundancy of backup systems can provide assurance that the operational impact of a
single hardware failure is quickly detected and that a fully operational secure state is
quickly attained. In order for backup systems to be most effective, they should maintain
synchronization with the primary system. Backup systems that continuously maintain
synchronization with the primary system are called “hot” backups. These systems are
