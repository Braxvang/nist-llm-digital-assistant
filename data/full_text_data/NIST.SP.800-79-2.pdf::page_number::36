Special Publication 800-79-2                                     Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card Issuers
                                                                                  and Derived PIV Credential Issuers



       Review – An evaluation of documentation that describes plans, policies, and procedures
        in order to verify that they are adequate, understood by management and operations
        personnel, and that they are in accordance with applicable policies, regulations,
        standards, technical guidelines, and organizational guidance.
       Interview – a directed conversation with one or more issuer personnel in which both pre-
        established and follow-on questions are asked, responses documented, discussion
        encouraged, and conclusions reached.
       Observe – a real-time viewing of PIV processes in operation, including all information
        system components of the issuer involved in creation, issuance, maintenance, and
        termination of PIV Cards or Derived PIV Credentials.
       Test – an evaluation of a component against a set of relevant PIV specifications using
        applicable test methods and metrics (as given in the associated assessment procedure in
        Table G.1 and Table G.2).

These methods are intended to provide the Assessor with sufficient, precise, accurate, and
relevant evidence regarding an IAT topic and its focus areas. One or more assessment methods
may be required to determine if the issuer has satisfactorily met the objective outlined for that
assessment procedure. Assessment results are used by the Assessor to determine the overall
effectiveness of the issuer control.

Table 4 shows an example of the relationships among an IAT, an Authorization Focus Area,
several issuer controls, and their assessment procedures. Controls with an applicability column
marked with DPCI (e.g., without LOA-4 or 3 postfix) applies to both LOA-3 and LOA-4
Derived PIV Credentials.
