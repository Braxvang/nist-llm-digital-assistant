GUIDE TO INTRUSION DETECTION AND PREVENTION SYSTEMS (IDPS)



 Technical specifications of the existing security protections. Examples of relevant protections are
  as follows:

     –    Existing IDPS implementations

     –    Centralized logging servers and SIEM software

     –    Antimalware software, such as antivirus and antispyware software

     –    Content filtering software, including antispam software

     –    Network firewalls, routers, proxies, and other packet filtering devices and software

     –    Communication encryption services, including link encryptors, virtual private networks (VPN),
          and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS).
9.1.2     Goals and Objectives

After gaining an understanding of the existing system and network environments, evaluators should
articulate the technical, operational, and business goals and objectives they wish to attain by using an
IDPS. The following questions should be considered in this area:

 The types of threats for which the IDPS should provide protection. Evaluators should state, as
  specifically as possible, the concerns that the organization has regarding the types of threats that
  originate both outside the organization and inside the organization (insider threats). Insider threats
  should encompass not only users who attack the system from within, but also authorized users who
  overstep their privileges, thereby violating organizational security policy or laws.
 Any needs to monitor system and network usage for acceptable use violations or non-security
  reasons. In some organizations, there are system use policies that target user behaviors that may be
  considered personnel management rather than system security issues. These might include accessing
  Web sites that provide content of questionable taste or value (such as pornography) or using the
  organization’s systems to send email or other messages to harass individuals. Some IDPSs provide
  features that accommodate detecting such events. Monitoring usage can also assist organizations in
  determining when systems and networks are reaching capacity and might need to be upgraded or
  replaced.
9.1.3     Security and Other IT Policies

Evaluators should review their existing security policies and other IT policies before selecting products.
The policies serve as a specification for many of the features that the IDPS products need to provide. 52
Examples of policy elements that can contain helpful information for IDPS product selection are as
follows:

 The goals of the policies. It is helpful to articulate the goals outlined in the policies in terms of the
  standard security goals (integrity, confidentiality, and availability) as well as more generic
  management goals (privacy, protection from liability, manageability).
 Reasonable use policies or other management provisions. As mentioned above, many
  organizations have system use policies included as part of security policies and other IT policies.


52
     If the existing policies do not provide enough information on what types of activity should be permitted or denied, it may be
     necessary to revise the policies first before selecting an IDPS product to enforce the policies.
