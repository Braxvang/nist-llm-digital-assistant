                                              GUIDE TO INTEGRATING FORENSIC TECHNIQUES INTO INCIDENT RESPONSE



Appendix A—Recommendations

Appendix A restates the major recommendations presented in Sections 2 through 8 of this publication.
The first group of recommendations applies to organizing a forensics capability. The remaining
recommendations have been grouped by the phases of the forensics process: collection, examination,
analysis, and reporting.

A.1       Organizing a Forensics Capability

      ! Organizations should have a capability to perform computer and network forensics.
        Forensics is needed for various tasks within an organization, including investigating crimes and
        inappropriate behavior, reconstructing computer security incidents, troubleshooting operational
        problems, supporting due diligence for audit record maintenance, and recovering from accidental
        system damage. Without such a capability, an organization will have difficulty determining what
        events have occurred within its systems and networks, such as exposures of protected, sensitive
        data. Also, handling evidence in a forensically sound manner puts decision makers in a position
        where they can confidently take the necessary actions.
A.1.1       Forensic Participants

      ! Organizations should determine which parties should handle each aspect of forensics. Most
        organizations rely on a combination of their own staff and external parties to perform forensic
        tasks. Organizations should decide which parties should take care of which tasks based on skills
        and abilities, cost, response time, and data sensitivity.
      ! Analysts should have reasonably comprehensive technical knowledge. Because current tools
        have rather limited analysis abilities, analysts should be well-trained, experienced, and
        knowledgeable in networking principles, common network and application protocols, network
        and application security products, and network-based threats and attack methods.
      ! Incident handling teams should have robust forensic capabilities. More than one team
        member should be able to perform each typical forensic activity. Hands-on exercises and IT and
        forensic training courses can be helpful in building and maintaining skills, as can demonstrations
        of new tools and technologies.
      ! Many teams within an organization should participate in forensics. Individuals performing
        forensic actions should be able to reach out to other teams and individuals within an organization,
        as needed, for additional assistance. Examples of teams that may provide assistance in these
        efforts include IT professionals, management, legal advisors, human resources personnel,
        auditors, and physical security staff. Members of these teams should understand their roles and
        responsibilities in forensics, receive training and education on forensic–related policies,
        guidelines, and procedures, and be prepared to cooperate with and assist others on forensic
        actions.
A.1.2       Forensic Policies, Guidelines, and Procedures

      ! Forensic considerations should be clearly addressed in policies. At a high level, policies
        should allow authorized personnel to monitor systems and networks and perform investigations
        for legitimate reasons under appropriate circumstances. Organizations may also have a separate
        forensic policy for incident handlers and others with forensic roles that provides more detailed
        rules for appropriate behavior. Everyone who may be called upon to assist with any forensic
