This series of nine documents is intended to provide a structured, yet flexible framework for
selecting, specifying, employing, evaluating, and monitoring the security controls in Federal
information systems—and thus, makes a significant contribution toward satisfying the
requirements of the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002. While the
publications are mutually reinforcing and have some dependencies, in most cases, they can be
effectively used independently of one another.
The SP 800-60 information types and associated security impact levels are based on the Office of
Management and Budget (OMB) Federal Enterprise Architecture Program Management Office’s
October 2007 FEA Consolidated Reference Model Document, Version 2.3, inputs from
participants in previous NIST SP 800-60 workshops, and FIPS 199. Rationale for the example
impact-level recommendations provided in the appendices has been derived from multiple
sources and, as such, will require several iterations of review, comment, and subsequent
modification to achieve consistency in terminology, structure, and content.

1.4 Organization of this Special Publication
This is Volume I of two volumes. It contains the basic guidelines for mapping types of
information and information systems to security categories. The appendices, including security
categorization recommendations for mission-based information types and rationale for security
categorization recommendations, are published as a separate Volume II.
Volume I provides the following background information and mapping guidelines:
    •   Section 2: Provides an overview of the value of the categorization process to agency
        missions, security programs and overall information technology (IT) management and the
        publication’s role in the system development lifecycle, the certification and accreditation
        process, and the NIST Risk Management Framework.
    •   Section 3: Provides the security objectives and corresponding security impact levels
        identified in the Federal Information Processing Standard 199, Standards for Security
        Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems [FIPS 199];
