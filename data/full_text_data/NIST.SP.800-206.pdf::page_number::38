IMPERATIVE 9
Advancing Security Test and Measurement Tools

Widespread adoption and continuing support for cybersecurity requires:
       •   Testing and documentation of the effectiveness of recommended technologies
           and practices,
       •   Means for measuring the effectiveness of recommended technologies
           and practices,
       •   Monitoring and collection of information regarding asset inventories and security
           status, and
       •   Effective presentation of the results to those who have responsibility for allocating
           resources within organizations.
NIST is approaching the challenge of security status determination, monitoring, and
measurement along several avenues.
       •   Anomaly Detection. NIST is working with industry to identify and demonstrate
           automated tools for detecting security-relevant fault conditions. In FY18, a project
           was initiated to show ways to improve detection of cybersecurity attacks in
           manufacturing infrastructure environments. Preliminary project findings were
           published for public comment as NISTIR 8219.84 The anomaly detection activity will
           be expanded in FY19 to include additional detection tools.
       •   Cyber Risk Analysis (CRA) Project. This project promotes technical solutions that
           enable organizations to bridge diverse, new, and existing data sets to advance
           analysis of cyber risks. The goal is to enable information sharing among risk
           owners about historical, current, and future cyber risk conditions. NIST is
           leveraging past and present efforts such as a data repository for cyber incident
           analysis, predictive analytics and strategic analysis on threat coverage, and
           prioritization and gap identification. The near-term focus is on reconstructing the
           University of Maryland (UMD) CyberChain Portal, which is the foundational
           platform for a Cyber Incident Data and Analysis Repository (CIDAR)85 prototype.
           NIST is exploring the frameworks, formats, and standards that could help to
           automate data collection. In FY18, nearly 60 open and private cyber incident
           databases were reviewed. In FY19, data elements associated with the CIDAR
           categories will be examined for linkages that support data enrichment and bind
