Special Publication 800-53, Revision 1                Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________


To uniquely identify each control, a numeric identifier is appended to the family identifier to
indicate the number of the control within the control family. For example, CP-9 is the ninth
control in the Contingency Planning family.

The security control structure consists of three key components: (i) a control section; (ii) a
supplemental guidance section; and (iii) a control enhancements section. 18 The following
example from the Auditing and Accountability family illustrates the structure of a typical security
control.
AU-2      AUDITABLE EVENTS

          Control: The information system generates audit records for the following events: [Assignment:
          organization-defined auditable events].
          Supplemental Guidance: The purpose of this control is to identify important events which need to be
          audited as significant and relevant to the security of the information system. The organization
          specifies which information system components carry out auditing activities. Auditing activity
          can affect information system performance. Therefore, the organization decides, based upon a risk
          assessment, which events require auditing on a continuous basis and which events require auditing
          in response to specific situations. Audit records can be generated at various levels of abstraction,
          including at the packet level as information traverses the network. Selecting the right level of
          abstraction for audit record generation is a critical aspect of an audit capability and can facilitate
          the identification of root causes to problems. Additionally, the security audit function is
          coordinated with the network health and status monitoring function to enhance the mutual support
          between the two functions by the selection of information to be recorded by each function. The
          checklists and configuration guides at http://csrc.nist.gov/pcig/cig.html provide recommended lists
          of auditable events. The organization defines auditable events that are adequate to support after-
          the-fact investigations of security incidents. NIST Special Publication 800-92 provides guidance
          on computer security log management.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The information system provides the capability to compile audit records from multiple components
                throughout the system into a systemwide (logical or physical), time-correlated audit trail.
          (2)   The information system provides the capability to manage the selection of events to be audited by
                individual components of the system.
          (3)   The organization periodically reviews and updates the list of organization-defined auditable events.


           LOW AU-2                      MOD AU-2 (3)                  HIGH AU-2 (1) (2) (3)


The control section provides a concise statement of the specific security capability needed to
protect a particular aspect of an information system. The control statement describes specific
security-related activities or actions to be carried out by the organization or by the information
system. For some controls in the control catalog, a degree of flexibility is provided by allowing
organizations to selectively define input values for certain parameters associated with the
controls. This flexibility is achieved through the use of assignment and selection operations
within the main body of the control. Assignment and selection operations provide an opportunity
for an organization to tailor the security controls to support specific mission, business, or
operational needs. For example, an organization can specify the specific events to be audited.
Once specified, the organization-defined value becomes part of the control, and the organization
is assessed against the completed control statement. Some assignment operations may specify
minimum or maximum values that constrain the values that may be input by the organization.

18
   A supplemental guidance section is also used for security control enhancements in situations where the guidance is
not generally applicable to the entire control but instead focused on the particular control enhancement.
