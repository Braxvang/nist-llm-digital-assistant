     NIST SP 800-78-5 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                               Cryptographic Algorithms
     September 2023                                                                               and Key Sizes for PIV

33   Certain commercial equipment, instruments, software, or materials, commercial or non-commercial, are identified in
34   this paper in order to specify the experimental procedure adequately. Such identification does not imply
35   recommendation or endorsement of any product or service by NIST, nor does it imply that the materials or
36   equipment identified are necessarily the best available for the purpose.

37   There may be references in this publication to other publications currently under development by NIST in
38   accordance with its assigned statutory responsibilities. The information in this publication, including concepts and
39   methodologies, may be used by federal agencies even before the completion of such companion publications. Thus,
40   until each publication is completed, current requirements, guidelines, and procedures, where they exist, remain
41   operative. For planning and transition purposes, federal agencies may wish to closely follow the development of
42   these new publications by NIST.

43   Organizations are encouraged to review all draft publications during public comment periods and provide feedback
44   to NIST. Many NIST cybersecurity publications, other than the ones noted above, are available at
