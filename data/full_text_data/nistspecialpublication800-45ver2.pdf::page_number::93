 The parties affected by the mail server backup policy
 The mail servers covered by the backup policy
 The definitions of key terms, especially legal and technical
 The detailed requirements from the legal, business, and organizationâ€™s perspective
 The required frequency of backups
 The procedures for ensuring that data is properly retained and protected
 The procedures for ensuring that data is properly destroyed or archived when no longer required
 The procedures for preserving information for Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, legal
  investigations, and other such requests
 The responsibilities of those involved in data retention, protection, and destruction activities
 The retention period for each type of information logged 59
 The specific duties of the central/organizational data backup team, if one exists.
Three primary types of backups exist: full, incremental, and differential. Full backups include the
operating system, applications, and data stored on the mail server (i.e., an image of every piece of data
stored on the mail server hard drives). The advantage of a full backup is that it is easy to restore the entire
mail server back to the state (e.g., configuration, patch level, data) it was in when the backup was
performed. The disadvantage of full backups is that they take considerable time and resources to perform.
Incremental backups reduce the impact by backing up only data that has changed since the previous
backup (either full or incremental).

Differential backups reduce the number of backup sets that must be accessed to restore a configuration by
backing up all changed data since the last full backup. However, as time lapses from the last full backup,
each differential backup becomes increasingly larger, taking more processing time and storage than an
incremental backup would. Generally, full backups are performed less frequently (weekly to monthly or
when a significant change occurs), and incremental or differential backups are performed more frequently
(daily to weekly). Several factors determine the frequency of backups:

 Volatility of information on and configuring of the mail server
 Amount of data to be backed up
 Backup device and media available
 Time available for dumping backup data
 Criticality of data

     Organizations should carefully consider the retention period for email messages, transaction logs, and other mail server-
     related records. Many organizations are subject to multiple sets of legal and regulatory requirements that can affect their
     retention of email records. The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) has a Web site for Federal records
     management, which is located at http://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/. Additional information on NARA regulations
     related to mail retention is available at http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2006/pdf/06-1545.pdf. Federal agencies often retain
     email messages for an extended period of time, such as a year or more, whereas other organizations more commonly retain
     messages for only 30 to 90 days.
