Therefore, the generic TSP produced by a TTA has the form:
      TSP = user_supplied_info, TTA_supplied_info, timestamp,
           SIGTTA(user_supplied_info, TTA_supplied_info, timestamp)
where user_supplied_info and/or TTA_supplied_info may be Null.

4.2      Timestamp Provision by a TTA
A TTA may either broadcast a timestamp packet (TSP) or provide a TSP in response to a
request from a requesting entity. The requesting entity and any other party that needs to
verify the TTA’s digital signature (i.e., a relying party) must be aware of the security
strength provided by the TTA’s digital signature. If an X-bit security strength is required
by the requesting entity’s or relying party’s application, then the TTA’s digital signature
shall provide at least X bits of security strength in order to fulfill that requirement (see SP
800-57).
When a TTA broadcasts a TSP, the user_supplied_info in the TSP is Null. The
timestamp_signature is generated on the TTA-supplied_info (which may be Null) and the
timestamp. The TSP is then assembled and broadcast. Portions of the TTA_supplied_info
that are known by all intended recipients of the TSP may be omitted from the data
transmitted in the timestamped_data field of the TSP, even though the entire
TTA_supplied_info is included in the data used during the generation and verification of
timestamp_signatureTTA.
When an entity requests a timestamp, the requesting entity provides the
user_supplied_info (which may be Null) to the TTA in the request. A
timestamp_signatureTTA is generated on the user_supplied_info, the TTA-supplied_info
(which may be Null), and a timestamp. A TSP is assembled from timestamp_signatureTTA
and timestamped_data, and then sent to the requesting entity. Portions of the TTA-
supplied_info that are known by all intended recipients of the TSP, and the
user_supplied_info that is otherwise made known to the verifying entity may be omitted
from the data transmitted in the timestamped_data field of the returned TSP, even though
they must be included in the (complete) version of the timestamped_data that is used
during the generation and verification of the timestamp_signatureTTA.
For each scheme in Section 4, a text description is provided, along with a figure to
illustrate the message flow for the scheme. The number in the figure for each message
indicates the step in the text description that describes that message. Note that the step
numbers for internal operations are not indicated in the figure.

4.3      Signatory Provision of a Timestamp with a Signed Message
There are several useful schemes in which an entity A obtains a timestamp packet (TSP)
from a trusted timestamp authority (TTA) and then combines the TSP with a message
(M) and a signature into a payload of data (D) that is sent to recipient entity B.
In the following schemes, signatures are generated by entity A or a TTA using an
approved digital signature algorithm. Let SIGA( ) be a signature generated by entity A
using its private signature key, and let SIGTTA( ) be a signature generated by a TTA using
