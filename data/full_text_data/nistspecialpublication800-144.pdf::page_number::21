          backplane comprises, such as those for self-service, resource metering, quota
          management, data replication and recovery, service level monitoring, workload
          management, and cloud bursting.5 Cloud services themselves may also be realized
          through nesting and layering with services from other cloud providers. Components
          change over time as upgrades and feature improvements occur, confounding matters
          further.

          Security depends not only on the correctness and effectiveness of many components, but
          also on the interactions among them. Challenges exist in understanding and securing
          application programming interfaces that are often proprietary to a cloud provider. The
          number of possible interactions between components increases as the square of the
          number of components, which pushes the level of complexity upward. Complexity
          typically relates inversely to security, with greater complexity giving rise to increased
          vulnerability [Avo00, Gee08, Sch00]. Decreases in security also heighten privacy risks
          related to the loss or unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification or disclosure of
          personal data.

         Shared Multi-tenant Environment. Public cloud services offered by providers have a
          serious underlying complication—client organizations typically share components and
          resources with other consumers that are unknown to them. Rather than using physical
          separation of resources as a control, cloud computing places greater dependence on
          logical separation at multiple layers of the application stack [Owa10]. While not unique
          to cloud computing, logical separation is a non-trivial problem that is exacerbated by the
          scale of cloud computing (e.g., [Bos11]). An attacker could pose as a consumer to
          exploit vulnerabilities from within the cloud environment, overcome the separation
          mechanisms, and gain unauthorized access. Access to organizational data and resources
          could also inadvertently be exposed to other consumers or be blocked from legitimate
          consumers through a configuration or software error [Opp03].

          Threats to network and computing infrastructures continue to increase each year and
          become more sophisticated. Having to share an infrastructure with unknown outside
          parties can be a major drawback for some applications and require a high level of
          assurance pertaining to the strength of the security mechanisms used for logical
          separation.

         Internet-facing Services. Public cloud services are delivered over the Internet, exposing
          the administrative interfaces used to self-service and manage an account, as well as non-
          administrative interfaces used to access deployed services.6 Applications and data that

  Cloud bursting involves the deployment and launching of an application at a cloud and the redirection of requests to it, in the event
that computing resources at organization’s data center become saturated.

  Recommended solutions for mitigating Internet borne threats exist, including NIST Special publications SP 800-119, Guidelines for
the Secure Deployment of IPv6--http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-119/sp800-119.pdf; SP 500-267, A Profile for IPv6 in
the U.S. Government--Version 1.0--http://www.antd.nist.gov/usgv6/usgv6-v1.pdf; and SP-800-77, Guide to IPsec VPNs--
http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-77/sp800-77.pdf. Support from the cloud provider is a prerequisite to implementing
them, and as these publications correctly point out, exploits may still occur due to faulty implementation and configuration issues.
