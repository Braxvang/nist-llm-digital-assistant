                        cryptographic software authenticator as specified in
                        [SP800-63B], Sec. 5.1.8.1, or a single-factor
                        cryptographic software authenticator as specified in
                        [SP800-63B], Sec. 5.1.6.1 is used for derived PIV
                        authentication at AAL2 (review, interview).
                  (iii) For specific devices or authenticators issued to a
                        cardholder, the organization has a documented policy
                        and procedure for approval and issuance (review,
                        interview).
  DP(DC)-6      PKI-based derived PIV credentials issued at AAL3 meet the              PKI-AAL3      [SP800-157], Sec. 2.2 – Initial

                Determine that:
                    (i) The organization establishes blanket approvals for
                        particular device types that meet AAL3 requirements
                        (interview).
                   (ii) A multi-factor cryptographic device authenticator as
                        specified in [SP800-63B], Sec. 5.1.9.1 is used for
                        derived PIV authentication at AAL3 (review, interview).
                  (iii) For specific devices or authenticators issued to a
                        cardholder, the organization has a documented policy
                        and procedure for approval and issuance (review,
                        interview).
  DP (DC)-7     Non-PKI-based derived PIV credentials issued at AAL3 meet            Non-PKI-AAL3    [SP800-157], Sec. 2.2 – Initial
   (NEW)        the requirements for phishing resistance defined in [SP800-                          Issuance

                Determine that:
                    (i) The organization establishes blanket approvals for
                        particular device types that meet AAL3 requirements
                        (interview).
                   (ii) Either a multi-factor cryptographic device authenticator
                        as specified in [SP800-63B], Sec. 5.1.9.1 or a single-
                        factor cryptographic device authenticator as specified
                        in [SP800-63B], Sec. 5.1.7.1 is used for derived PIV
                        authentication at AAL3 (review, interview).
                  (iii) For specific devices or authenticators issued to a
                        cardholder, the organization has a documented policy
                        and procedure for approval and issuance (review,
                        interview).
  DP (DC)-8     The applicant is provided with or needs to supply an approved       Non-PKI-AAL2, [SP800-157], Sec. 2.2.2 – Non-
   (NEW)        physical authenticator for the highest AAL that the derived PIV     Non-PKI-AAL3 PKI-based Derived PIV
                credential will be used to authenticate. If the authenticator is                  Credential Issuance
                not directly provided by the issuer, the issuer verifies that the
                authenticator’s characteristics (e.g., single-factor or multi-
                factor) meet the requirements of [SP800-63B] for the highest
                authentication assurance level at which it will be used (AAL2
                or AAL3), including [FIPS140] requirements.

                Assessment
                Determine that:
                  (i) The organization establishes approved authenticator
                      characteristics (review, interview).
