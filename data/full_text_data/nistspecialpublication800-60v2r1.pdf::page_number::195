and plants, as well as tracking the spread of diseases and pests may also be life threatening or
significantly degrade public safety. This can result in assignment of a high impact level to such
information.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
population health management and consumer safety information is low.

D.14.3 Health Care Administration Information Type

Health Care Administration assures that federal health care resources are expended effectively to
ensure quality, safety, and efficiency. This includes managing health care quality, cost,
workload, utilization, and fraud/abuse efforts.
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Moderate), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of Health Care
Administration on the ability of responsible agencies to assure that federal health care resources
are expended effectively to ensure quality, safety, and efficiency will have only a limited adverse
effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Much information associated with
public health monitoring involves confidential patient information subject to the Privacy Act and
to HIPAA. The Privacy Act Information provisional impact levels are documented in the
Personal Identity and Authentication information type. In some cases, unauthorized disclosure
of this information such as privacy-protected medical records can have serious consequences for
agency operations. In such cases, the confidentiality impact level may be moderate.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for disclosure of Health Care Administration information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Unauthorized
modification or destruction of information affecting external communications that contain Health
Care Administration information (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect
operations and public confidence in the agency and also the agency mission.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Unauthorized modification or destruction
of Health Care Administration information can result in inappropriate allocation or deployment
of health care services and possible loss of human life. This can result in assignment of a high
impact level to such information.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
Health Care Administration information is Moderate.
