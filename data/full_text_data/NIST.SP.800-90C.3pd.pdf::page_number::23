      NIST SP 800-90C 3pd (Third Public Draft)                                                        Recommendation for RBG Constructions
      September 2022

607                Assumptions and Assertions
608   The RBG constructions in SP 800-90C are based on the use of validated entropy sources and the
609   following assumptions and assertions for properly functioning entropy sources:
610           1. An entropy source is independent of another entropy source if a) their security boundaries
611              do not overlap (e.g., they reside in separate cryptographic modules, or one is a physical
612              entropy source and the other is a non-physical entropy source), b) there are no common
613              noise sources, 4 and c) statistical tests provide evidence of the independence of the entropy
614              sources.
615           2. The use of both validated and non-validated entropy sources is permitted in an
616              implementation, but only entropy sources that have been validated for compliance with
617              [SP800-90B] are used to provide the randomness input for seeding and reseeding a DRBG
618              or providing entropy for an RBG3 construction.
619   The following assumptions and assertions pertain to the use of validated entropy sources for
620   providing entropy bits:
621           3. For the purpose of analysis, it is assumed that a) the number of bits that are output by an
622              entropy source is never more than 264, and b) the number of output bits from the RBG is
623              never more than 264 bits for a DRBG instantiation. In the case of an RBG1 construction
624              with one or more subordinate DRBGs, the output limit applies to the total output provided
625              by the RBG1 construction and all of its subordinate DRBGs.
626           4. Each entropy-source output has a fixed length, ES_len (in bits).
627           5. Each entropy-source output is assumed to contain a fixed amount of entropy, denoted as
628              ES_entropy, that was assessed during entropy-source implementation validation. (See
629              [SP800-90B] for entropy estimation.) ES-entropy is assumed to be at least 0.1 bits per bit
630              of output.
631           6. Each entropy source has been characterized as either a physical entropy source or a non-
632              physical entropy source upon successful validation.
633           7. The outputs from a single entropy source can be concatenated. The entropy of the resultant
634              bitstring is the sum of the entropy from each entropy-source output. For example, if m
635              outputs are concatenated, then the length of the bitstring is m × ES_len bits, and the entropy
636              for that bitstring is assumed to be m × ES_entropy bits. (This is a consequence of the model
637              of entropy used in [SP800-90B].)
638           8. The output of multiple independent entropy sources can be concatenated in an RBG. The
639              entropy in the resultant bitstring is the sum of the entropy in the output of each independent
640              entropy-source output that is considered to be contributing to the entropy in the bitstring
641              (see Methods 1 and 2 in Section 2.3). For example, suppose that the output from
642              independent physical entropy sources A and B and non-physical entropy source C are
643              concatenated. The length of the concatenated bitstring is the sum of the lengths of the
644              component bitstrings (i.e., ES_lenA + ES_lenB + ES_lenC).

          They may, however, use the same type of noise source (e.g., both entropy sources could use ring oscillators but not the same ones).
