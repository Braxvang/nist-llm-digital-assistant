8.2.2    Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems

An IDS is an application that monitors the events occurring in a system or network and analyzes them for
signs of potential incidents, which are violations or imminent threats of violation of computer security
policies, acceptable use policies, or standard security practices. 68 An IPS has all the capabilities of an
IDS and can also attempt to stop potential incidents. Because IDS and IPS systems offer many of the
same capabilities, they are often collectively called intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS).
When an IDPS detects a potential incident, it notifies administrators through IDPS console messages,
emails, pages, or other mechanisms.

The two types of IDPSs most relevant for Web security are host-based and network-based. 69 A host-
based IDPS monitors the characteristics of a single host and the events occurring within that host to
identify and stop suspicious activity. Host-based IDPS software must be installed on each individual
computer that is to be monitored or protected. Host-based IDPSs are very closely integrated with the OSs
of the host computers they protect. Thus, a host-based IDPS must be designed specifically for each OS
(and often each version of that OS). Host-based IDPSs monitor various aspects of hosts, such as network
traffic, system logs, running processes, file access and modification, and system and application
configuration changes.

Host-based IDPSs are especially useful when most of the network traffic to and from a Web server is
encrypted (e.g., SSL/TLS is in use) because the functionality and capability of network-based IDPSs (see
below) is severely limited when network traffic is encrypted. Also, because they are located on the
server, host-based IDPSs can detect some attacks and penetration attempts not recognized by network-
based IDPSs. Unfortunately, host-based IDPSs can have a negative effect on host performance. In
general, enabling more extensive detection capabilities and having more events to monitor both have a
negative impact on the performance of the host. Host-based IDPSs may not detect some network-based
attacks, such as certain DoS attacks. If a host-based IDPS is on a Web server that is compromised, it is
very likely that the attacker will also compromise the IDPS itself.

A network-based IDPS monitors network traffic for particular network segments or network devices and
analyzes the network and application protocol activity to identify and stop suspicious activity. Most
network-based IDPSs use predefined “attack signatures” to detect and identify attacks. Attack signatures
are patterns that correspond to known types of intrusions. Network-based IDPSs also use other detection
methods to identify anomalous activity, protocol violations, and other unusual activity.

Unlike a host-based IDPS, a network-based IDPS can monitor network activity for many hosts
simultaneously. Network-based IDPSs can usually detect more network-based attacks and can more
easily provide a comprehensive picture of the current attacks against a network. Because network-based
IDPSs are installed on dedicated hosts, they do not have a negative effect on the performance of the Web
server host and are not immediately compromised by a successful attack on the Web server.

Network-based IDPSs do have some limitations. The timing of an attack can have a significant impact on
the ability of a network-based IDPS to detect an attack. For example, if an attacker spreads out the timing
of an attack over a period of hours or days, the attack may not be detected by the IDPS. Network
configuration, such as the use of asymmetric routing, can have a negative impact on the ability of a

     Other major IDPS categories include wireless IDPS, which examines wireless networking protocols only, and network
     behavior anomaly detection software, which monitors network traffic flows for flow anomalies. Neither of these types of
     IDPS technologies analyzes Web activity.
