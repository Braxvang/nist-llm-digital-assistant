Q. What is the principal goal of a risk management process?
A. The principal goal of an organization’s risk management process should be to
   protect the organization and its ability to perform its mission, not just its
   information assets.

Q. How many processes does risk management encompass?
A. There are three processes of risk management: risk assessment, risk mitigation,
   and evaluation and assessment. When applied appropriately and with due
   diligence, the processes should meet the Federal Information Security
   Management Act (FISMA) requirements of “providing information security
   protections commensurate with the risk and magnitude of the harm resulting
   from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction
   of…information…and…information systems” collected by and used by the federal
   government and “ensuring that information security management processes are
   integrated with agency strategic and operational planning processes.”

Q. What options do system and organizational managers have to reduce the
   risk present on the system?
A. System and organizational managers may use several options to reduce the risk
   present on a system. These options are risk assumption, risk avoidance, risk
   limitation, risk planning, research and acknowledgement, and risk transference.

Q. Define risk mitigation and explain what steps are involved to control
   implementation.
A. The second process in the overall risk management process is that of risk
   mitigation. Because it is impractical, if not impossible, to eliminate all risks from
   a system, risk mitigation strives to prioritize, evaluate, and implement the
   appropriate risk-reducing controls recommended from the risk assessment
   process based on NIST SP 800-53 guidance. Once the decision has been made
   on which risks are to be addressed in the risk mitigation process, a seven-step
   approach is used to guide control implementation:


                                                                                    B-18
