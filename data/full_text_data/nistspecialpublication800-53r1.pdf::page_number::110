PE-3      PHYSICAL ACCESS CONTROL

          Control: The organization controls all physical access points (including designated entry/exit
          points) to the facility where the information system resides (except for those areas within the
          facility officially designated as publicly accessible) and verifies individual access authorizations
          before granting access to the facility. The organization controls access to areas officially
          designated as publicly accessible, as appropriate, in accordance with the organizationâ€™s assessment
          of risk.
          Supplemental Guidance: The organization uses physical access devices (e.g., keys, locks,
          combinations, card readers) and/or guards to control entry to facilities containing information
          systems. The organization secures keys, combinations, and other access devices and inventories
          those devices regularly. The organization changes combinations and keys: (i) periodically; and (ii)
          when keys are lost, combinations are compromised, or individuals are transferred or terminated.
          Workstations and associated peripherals connected to (and part of) an organizational information
          system may be located in areas designated as publicly accessible with access to such devices being
          appropriately controlled. Where federal Personal Identity Verification (PIV) credential is used as
          an identification token and token-based access control is employed, the access control system
          conforms to the requirements of FIPS 201 and NIST Special Publication 800-73. If the token-
          based access control function employs cryptographic verification, the access control system
          conforms to the requirements of NIST Special Publication 800-78. If the token-based access
          control function employs biometric verification, the access control system conforms to the
          requirements of NIST Special Publication 800-76.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization controls physical access to the information system independent of the physical
                access controls for the facility.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement, in general, applies to server
                rooms, communications centers, or any other areas within a facility containing large
                concentrations of information system components or components with a higher impact level
                than that of the majority of the facility. The intent is to provide an additional layer of physical
                security for those areas where the organization may be more vulnerable due to the
                concentration of information system components or the impact level of the components. The
                control enhancement is not intended to apply to workstations or peripheral devices that are
                typically dispersed throughout the facility and used routinely by organizational personnel.

           LOW PE-3                      MOD PE-3                    HIGH PE-3 (1)



PE-4      ACCESS CONTROL FOR TRANSMISSION MEDIUM

          Control: The organization controls physical access to information system distribution and
          transmission lines within organizational facilities.
          Supplemental Guidance: Physical protections applied to information system distribution and
          transmission lines help prevent accidental damage, disruption, and physical tampering.
          Additionally, physical protections are necessary to help prevent eavesdropping or in transit
          modification of unencrypted transmissions. Protective measures to control physical access to
          information system distribution and transmission lines include: (i) locked wiring closets; (ii)
          disconnected or locked spare jacks; and/or (iii) protection of cabling by conduit or cable trays.
          Control Enhancements: None.
