attacker’s activity other than sandboxing should not be used; if an organization knows that a system has
been compromised and allows the compromise to continue, it may be liable if the attacker uses the
compromised system to attack other systems. The delayed containment strategy is dangerous because an
attacker could escalate unauthorized access or compromise other systems.

Another potential issue regarding containment is that some attacks may cause additional damage when
they are contained. For example, a compromised host may run a malicious process that pings another host
periodically. When the incident handler attempts to contain the incident by disconnecting the
compromised host from the network, the subsequent pings will fail. As a result of the failure, the
malicious process may overwrite or encrypt all the data on the host’s hard drive. Handlers should not
assume that just because a host has been disconnected from the network, further damage to the host has
been prevented.

3.3.2     Evidence Gathering and Handling

Although the primary reason for gathering evidence during an incident is to resolve the incident, it may
also be needed for legal proceedings.42 In such cases, it is important to clearly document how all
evidence, including compromised systems, has been preserved.43 Evidence should be collected according
to procedures that meet all applicable laws and regulations that have been developed from previous
discussions with legal staff and appropriate law enforcement agencies so that any evidence can be
admissible in court.44 In addition, evidence should be accounted for at all times; whenever evidence is
transferred from person to person, chain of custody forms should detail the transfer and include each
party’s signature. A detailed log should be kept for all evidence, including the following:

 Identifying information (e.g., the location, serial number, model number, hostname, media access
  control (MAC) addresses, and IP addresses of a computer)
 Name, title, and phone number of each individual who collected or handled the evidence during the
  investigation
 Time and date (including time zone) of each occurrence of evidence handling
 Locations where the evidence was stored.
Collecting evidence from computing resources presents some challenges. It is generally desirable to
acquire evidence from a system of interest as soon as one suspects that an incident may have occurred.
Many incidents cause a dynamic chain of events to occur; an initial system snapshot may do more good in
identifying the problem and its source than most other actions that can be taken at this stage. From an
evidentiary standpoint, it is much better to get a snapshot of the system as-is rather than doing so after
incident handlers, system administrators, and others have inadvertently altered the state of the machine
during the investigation. Users and system administrators should be made aware of the steps that they
should take to preserve evidence. See NIST SP 800-86, Guide to Integrating Forensic Techniques into
Incident Response, for additional information on preserving evidence.

     NIST SP 800-86, Guide to Integrating Forensic Techniques into Incident Response, provides detailed information on
     establishing a forensic capability. It focuses on forensic techniques for PCs, but much of the material is applicable to other
     systems. The document can be found at http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html#800-86.

     Evidence gathering and handling is not typically performed for every incident that occurs—for example, most malware
     incidents do not merit evidence acquisition. In many organizations, digital forensics is not needed for most incidents.

     Searching and Seizing Computers and Obtaining Electronic Evidence in Criminal Investigations, from the Computer Crime
     and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS) of the Department of Justice, provides legal guidance on evidence gathering. The
