        a program by allowing pages (or segments) of data to be swapped in and out of RAM. Swap files
        may contain a broad range of OS and application information, such as usernames, password
        hashes, and contact information. Section 5.1.2 discusses the contents of memory in more detail.
    ! Dump Files. Some OSs have the ability to store the contents of memory automatically during an
      error condition to assist in subsequent troubleshooting. The file that holds the stored memory
      contents is known as a dump file.
    ! Hibernation Files. A hibernation file is created to preserve the current state of a system
      (typically a laptop) by recording memory and open files before shutting off the system. When the
      system is next turned on, the state of the system is restored.
    ! Temporary Files. During the installation of an OS, application, or OS or application updates and
      upgrades, temporary files are often created. Although such files are typically deleted at the end of
      the installation process, this does not always occur. In addition, temporary files are created when
      many applications are run; again, such files are usually deleted when the application is
      terminated, but this does not always happen. Temporary files could contain copies of other files
      on the system, application data, or other information.
Although filesystems are the primary source of non-volatile data, another source of interest is the BIOS.
The BIOS contains many types of hardware-related information, such as the attached devices (e.g., CD-
ROM drives, hard drives), the types of connections and interrupt request line (IRQ) assignments (e.g.,
serial, USB, network card), motherboard components (e.g., processor type and speed, cache size, memory
information), system security settings, and hot keys. The BIOS also communicates with RAID drivers
and displays the information provided by the drivers. For example, the BIOS views a hardware RAID as
a single drive and a software RAID as multiple drives. The BIOS typically permits the user to set
passwords, which restrict access to the BIOS settings and may prevent the system from booting if the
password is not supplied. The BIOS also holds the system date and time.

5.1.2   Volatile Data

OSs execute within the RAM of a system. While the OS is functioning, the contents of RAM are
constantly changing. At any given time, RAM might contain many types of data and information that
could be of interest. For example, RAM often contains frequently and recently accessed data, such as
data files, password hashes, and recent commands. In addition, like filesystems, RAM can contain
residual data in slack and free space, as follows:

    ! Slack Space. Memory slack space is much less deterministic than file slack space. For example,
      an OS generally manages memory in units known as pages or blocks, and allocates them to
      requesting applications. Sometimes, although an application might not request an entire unit, it is
      given one anyway. Residual data could therefore reside in the unit of memory allocated to an
      application, although it might not be addressable by the application. For performance and
      efficiency, some OSs vary the size of the units they allocate, which tends to result in smaller
      memory slack spaces.
    ! Free Space. Memory pages are allocated and deallocated much like file clusters. When they are
      not allocated, memory pages are often collected into a common pool of available pagesâ€”a
      process often referred to as garbage collection. It is not uncommon for residual data to reside in
      these reusable memory pages, which are analogous to unallocated file clusters.
Some other significant types of volatile data that might exist within an OS are as follows:
