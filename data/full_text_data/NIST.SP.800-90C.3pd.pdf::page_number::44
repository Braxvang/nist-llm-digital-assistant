       NIST SP 800-90C 3pd (Third Public Draft)                      Recommendation for RBG Constructions
       September 2022

1190               If the randomness source is an RBG3(XOR) construction (see Figure 14), the
1191               Get_randomness-source_input call is replaced by:
1192               (status, randomness-source_input) = RBG3(XOR)_Generate(RBG3_state_handle, s
1193                             + 128, prediction_resistance_request, additional_input).
1194               A request for prediction resistance from the DRBG used by the RBG3(XOR)
1195               construction is optional.
1196           c) If the randomness source is an RBG3(RS) construction (see Figure 14), the
1197              Get_randomness-source_input call is replaced by:
1198                 (status, randomness-source_input) = RBG3(RS)_Generate(RBG3_state_handle,
1199                                            3s/2, additional_input).
1200       2. When an RBG1 construction is instantiating any other DRBG (including a CTR_DRBG
1201          with a derivation function), 3s/2 bits shall be obtained from a randomness source that
1202          provides a security strength of at least s bits.
1203           a) If the randomness source is an RBG2(P) construction (see Figure 13), the
1204              Get_randomness-source_input call is replaced by:
1205                (status, randomness-source_input) = Generate_function(RGB2_state_handle, 3s/2,
1206                            s, prediction_resistance_request = TRUE, additional_input).
1207               Note that the DRBG within the RBG2(P) construction must be reseeded before
1208               generating output. This is accomplished by requesting prediction resistance (i.e., by
1209               setting prediction_resistance_request = TRUE). See Requirement 17 in Section 4.4.
1210           b) If the randomness source is an RBG3(XOR) construction (see Figure 14), the
1211              Get_randomness-source_input call is replaced by:
1212                (status, randomness-source_input) = RBG3(XOR)_Generate(RBG3_state_handle,
1213                              3s/2, prediction_resistance_request, additional_input).
1214               A request for prediction resistance from the DRBG used by the RBG3(XOR)
1215               construction is optional.
1216           c) If the randomness source is an RBG3(RS) construction (see Figure 14), the
1217              Get_randomness_-sourceinput call is replaced by:
1218                 (status, randomness-source_input) = RBG3(RS)_Generate(RBG3_state_handle,
1219                                            3s/2, additional_input).

1220   4.2.2. Requesting Pseudorandom Bits
1221   Pseudorandom bits from the RBG1 construction shall be requested using the following call:
1222                    (status, returned_bits) = Generate_function(RBG1_state_handle,
1223         requested_number_of_bits, s, prediction_resistance_request = FALSE, additional_input).
1224   The prediction_resistance_request is set to FALSE or the parameter may be omitted since a
1225   reseeding capability is not included in an RBG1 construction.
