GUIDE TO INTEGRATING FORENSIC TECHNIQUES INTO INCIDENT RESPONSE



such data will be lost once the computer is powered down. Later, a determination can be made as to
which collected volatile data should be examined. An automated script on a toolkit CD can be used for
consistency in collecting volatile data. The script can include ways to transfer the collected information
to local storage media, such as a thumb drive, and to networked drive locations.

Because volatile data has a propensity to change over time, the order and timeliness with which volatile
data is collected is important. In most cases, analysts should first collect information on network
connections and login sessions, because network connections may time out or be disconnected and the list
of users connected to a system at any single time may vary. Volatile data that is less likely to change,
such as network configuration information, should be collected later. The recommended order in which
volatile data generally should be collected, from first to last, is as follows:

     1. Network connections

     2. Login sessions

     3. Contents of memory

     4. Running processes

     5. Open files

     6. Network configuration

     7. Operating system time.

5.2.2    Collecting Non-Volatile OS Data

After obtaining volatile OS data, analysts often should collect non-volatile OS data. To do so, the analyst
first should decide whether the system should be shut down. Shutting down the system not only affects
the ability to perform bit stream imaging and many logical backups, but can also change which OS data is
preserved. Most systems can be shut down through two methods:

     ! Perform a Graceful OS Shutdown. Nearly every OS offers a shutdown option.72 This causes
       the OS to perform cleanup activities, such as closing open files, deleting temporary files, and
       possibly clearing the swap file, before shutting down the system. A graceful shutdown can also
       trigger removal of malicious material; for example, memory-resident rootkits may disappear, and
       Trojan horses may remove evidence of their malicious activity. The OS is typically shut down
       from the account of the administrator or the current user of the system (if the current user has
       sufficient privileges).
     ! Remove Power from the System. Disconnecting the power cord from the back of the computer
       (and removing the batteries on a laptop or other portable device) can preserve swap files,
       temporary data files, and other information that might be altered or deleted during a graceful
       shutdown. 73 Unfortunately, a sudden loss of power can cause some OSs to corrupt data, such as

     For example, on Windows systems, analysts could use the Shut Down feature on the Start menu.

     Disconnecting a power cord from the electrical wall outlet is not recommended because the computerâ€™s power cord may be
     plugged into an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) unit.
