environmental conditions. Those bounds can be treated as the “norm” for anomaly detection, whereby
environmental conditions that are trending beyond the norm or that reflect conditions outside of the norm
may result in an adverse effect on the system, thus requiring a planned response to prepare for an
impending difficulty or crisis.
Anomaly detection requires capturing data to support all intended response actions for a detected
anomaly, including attribution-related data. Consequently, the fidelity in data describing the anomaly
must be commensurate with the consequences of the loss scenarios associated with the anomaly and of
wrong responses in addressing the detected anomaly. The responses taken will often rely on attribution to
uniquely identifiable entities that may be responsible for undesired actions, behaviors, or outcomes. For
non-human entities, corrective actions may include component replacements, repairs, or other corrections.
For human entities, these may include training, remediation, or disciplinary actions. Wrongful attribution
may have undesired consequences, such as the cost of unnecessarily repairing the wrong system element
while an undesired condition persists or the wrongful termination of an individual. Attribution rigor is
driven by the needed proof that an entity is responsible for an anomaly.
Three aspects of anomaly detection are necessary to provide criteria for an appropriate response action or
set of actions:
-   Basis for Correctness: A system model provides a basis against which actual behavior and outcomes
    can be compared to confidently enable conclusions that an anomaly exists or to determine or forecast
    that an anomaly is about to occur. System models include normal, contingency, degraded, and other
    system states/modes of operation and account for the adversity to which the system is subjected.
-   Data Collection: Systems capture self-awareness data in the form of health, status, test, and other data
    indicative of actual behavior and outcomes, including traceability to support attribution. Terms for
    data collection include instrumentation, monitoring, logging, auditing, self-tests, and built-in tests.
-   Data Interpretation: The interpretation of data allows for conclusions of unacceptable or suspicious
    events that have happened (e.g., halt or failure condition), that are progressing (e.g., approaching a
    threshold of failure condition), or that can be expected to happen (i.e., in the absence of change, the
    failure condition will occur), including tracing to responsible entities to inform appropriate responses
    to events.
Caution must be taken with the use of design features that may hinder anomaly detection. Poorly designed
lines of defense for defense in depth have been found to conceal emerging dangerous system states and
conditions, especially from human observers [40]. The system design must minimize the difference
between estimated system states and conditions and actual system states and conditions.
Two approaches to anomaly detection are:
-   Self-Anomaly Detection: An entity has no dependency on another entity to detect an anomaly within
    the scope of its intended design. Self-anomaly detection usually involves an axiomatic or
    environmentally enforced assumption about its integrity. Typically, trusted elements have the
    capability for self-anomaly detection. This means that at the highest level of trustworthiness, an entity
    must be able to assess its internal state and functionality to a meaningful extent at various stages of
    execution. The detected anomalies must correlate to the trustworthiness assumptions placed on the
    entity.
-   Dependent Anomaly Detection: An entity-of-interest is dependent on another entity for some or all
    anomalies that are detected. When an entity-of-interest relies on another entity for any portion of the
    assessment, that entity must be at least as trustworthy as the entity-of-interest.
