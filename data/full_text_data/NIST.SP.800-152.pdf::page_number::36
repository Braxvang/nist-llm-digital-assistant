SP 800-152                                                   A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


disclosure may result in an Information Security Policy for encrypting data before being
transmitted or stored. This Policy may dictate an FCKMS Security Policy specifying the use
of symmetric-key encryption/decryption using a specific algorithm and key length. The
FCKMS Module Security Policy may specify the necessary key and metadata management
functions, and the Cryptographic Module Security Policy would describe how the keys
would be protected while in a Cryptographic Module.

FR:4.5 The CKMS design shall specify the policies that are supported by the CKMS design
and a summary of how they are supported by the design.

             PL-1           A Federal CKMS shall document the relationships among its
PR:4.9
                            policies.
                            The security policies of a Federal CKMS shall be compatible
PR:4.10
                            with each other.

4.8   Personal Accountability

A Personal Accountability Policy requires that every person who accesses sensitive
information be held accountable for his or her actions. Personal accountability may be a
requirement in an Information Management Policy that needs to be supported by specific
features in the FCKMS for the management of keys and metadata, such as an access control
system that requires users to authenticate their identity before access is granted to an FCKMS
capability.

An FCKMS that supports a Personal Accountability Policy needs to be able to correctly
identify each person accessing and using the FCKMS, determine who is authorized to access
controlled items, grant access only upon verification of the authorization, and detect and
report any attempts for unauthorized access.

FR:4.6 The CKMS design shall specify if and how personal accountability is supported by
the CKMS.

                            A Federal CKMS operating at the Moderate or High impact-
PR:4.11
                            level shall provide personal accountability for all entities
                            acting in all roles provided by the Federal CKMS.
