 Definition   —       The system life cycle is a model for building and operating an IT system
                      from its initial inception to its termination and disposal of assets. The
                      model includes six phases: Initiation, Development, Test and Evaluation,
                      Implementation, Operations, and Termination. Life cycle security is the
                      ensemble of processes and procedures which ensures data confidentiality, as
                      needed, as well as data and system integrity, and availability.


                      The operations phase includes the ongoing day-to-day use (production) and
                      maintenance or enhancement of the system without compromising the
                      integrity and effectiveness of the installed safeguards.


 Behavioral Outcome       — Users   are able to understand the objectives of and comply with the
                              "rules of behavior" for the system.
