         Will the media be processed in a controlled area?

         Should the sanitization process be conducted within the organization or outsourced?

         What is the anticipated volume of media to be sanitized by type of media? 13

         What is the availability of sanitization equipment and tools?

         What is the level of training of personnel with sanitization equipment/tools?

         How long will sanitization take?

         What is the cost of sanitization when considering tools, training, verification, and re-
          entering media into the supply stream?

 2.8 Sanitization Scope

For most sanitization operations, the target of the operation is all data stored on the media by the
user. However, in some cases, there may be a desire or need to sanitize a subset of the media.
Partial sanitization comes with some risk, as it may be difficult to verify that sensitive data stored
on a portion of the media did not spill over into other areas of the media (e.g., remapped bad
blocks). In addition, the dedicated interfaces provided by storage device vendors for sanitization
typically operate at the device level, and are not able to be applied to a subset of the media. As a
result, partial sanitization usually depends on the typical read and write commands available to
the user, which may not be able to bypass any interface abstraction that may be present in order
to directly address the media area of concern.

On some storage devices featuring integrated encryption capabilities, CE provides a unique
mechanism for supporting some forms of partial sanitization. Some of these devices support the
ability to encrypt portions of the data with different encryption keys (e.g., encrypting different
partitions with different encryption keys). When the interface supports sanitizing only a subset of
the encryption keys, partial sanitization via CE is possible. As with any other sanitization
technique applied to media, the level of assurance depends both upon vendor implementation and
on the level of assurance that data was stored only in the areas that are able to be reliably
sanitized. Data may be stored outside these regions either because the user or software on the
system moved data outside of the designated area on the media, or because the storage device
stored data to the media in a manner not fully understood by the user.

Due to the difficulty in reliably ensuring that partial sanitization effectively addresses all
sensitive data, sanitization of the whole device is preferred to partial sanitization whenever
possible. Organizations should understand the potential risks to this approach and make
appropriate decisions on this technique balancing the factors described earlier in this sectionas
