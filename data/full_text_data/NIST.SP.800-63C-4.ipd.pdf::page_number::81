       December 2022                                                      Federation and Assertions


2127   12.     Examples
2128   This section is informative.
2129   Three types of assertion technologies are discussed below: SAML assertions, Kerberos
2130   tickets, and OpenID Connect tokens. This list is not inclusive of all possible assertion
2131   technologies, but does represent those commonly used in federated identity systems.

2132   12.1. Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)
2133   SAML is an XML-based framework for creating and exchanging authentication and
2134   attribute information between trusted entities over the internet. As of this writing, the
2135   latest specification for SAML is SAML v2.0, issued 15 March 2005.
2136   The building blocks of SAML include:
2137         • The Assertions XML schema, which defines the structure of the assertion.
2138         • The SAML Protocols, which are used to request assertions and artifacts (the
2139           assertion references used in the indirect model described in Sec. 7.1).
2140         • The Bindings, which define the underlying communication protocols (such as
2141           HTTP or SOAP), and can be used to transport the SAML assertions.
2142   The three components above define a SAML profile that corresponds to a particular use
2143   case such as “Web Browser SSO”.
2144   SAML Assertions are encoded in an XML schema and can carry up to three types of
2145   statements:
2146         • Authentication statements include information about the assertion issuer, the
2147           authenticated subscriber, validity period, and other authentication information.
2148           For example, an Authentication Assertion would state the subscriber “John” was
2149           authenticated using a password at 10:32pm on 06-06-2004.
2150         • Attribute statements contain specific additional characteristics related to the
2151           subscriber. For example, subject “John” is associated with attribute “Role” with
2152           value “Manager”.
2153         • Authorization statements identify the resources the subscriber has permission
2154           to access. These resources may include specific devices, files, and information
2155           on specific web servers. For example, subject “John” for action “Read” on
2156           “Webserver1002” given evidence “Role”.
2157   Authorization statements are beyond the scope of this document and will not be
2158   discussed.
