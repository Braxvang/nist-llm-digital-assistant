Section 6 Cryptographic Keys and Metadata covers the most critical elements of a
CKMS: keys and metadata, by enumerating and defining possible key types; key
metadata; and key and metadata management functions, along with access control
considerations, security issues and recovery mechanisms.

Section 7 Interoperability and Transitioning considers the need for interoperability
and the ability to easily make transitions in CKMS capabilities in order to accommodate
future needs.

Section 8 Security Controls describes security controls applicable to a typical CKMS.

Section 9 Testing and System Assurances describes security testing and assurances.

Section 10 Disaster Recovery deals with disaster recovery in general and of a CKMS
specifically.

Section 11 Security Assessment discusses the security assessment of a CKMS.

Section 12 Technology Challenges briefly discusses the technical challenges provided
by new attacks on cryptographic algorithms, key establishment protocols, CKMS
devices, and quantum computing.

Appendix A enumerates and describes useful references.

Appendix B consists of a glossary of terms used in this Framework.

Appendix C provides a list of acronyms used in this Framework.

2. Framework Basics
This section discusses the motivation, intent, properties, and limitations of a
Cryptographic Key Management Framework.

2.1 Rationale for Cryptographic Key Management
Todayâ€™s information systems and the information that they contain are considered to be
critical assets that require protection. The information used by government and business
is often contained in computer systems consisting of groups of interconnected computers
that make use of shared networks, e.g., the Internet. Since the Internet is shared by
diverse and often competing organizations and individuals, information systems should
protect themselves and the information that they contain from unauthorized disclosure,
modification, and use. In addition, denial of service to legitimate users could be
considered a significant threat in many service and time-critical application systems and
the CKMS used to protect them. Additional security requirements can be derived from
the organizational goals for protecting personal privacy, including anonymity,
unlinkability, and unobservability of CKMS-supported communications. The information
