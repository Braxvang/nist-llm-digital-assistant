hardship for citizens. It can also be expected to result in very serious disruption of the agency
operations due to large time and resource requirements for taking corrective actions.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: In the case of smaller organizations, and
where the information affected is limited to employees, there will still be an impact, but the
consequences may justify only a low provisional impact rating. Where a data modification
permits access to facilities (or ingress into the United States) by individuals to whom access
should be prohibited, the integrity impact could be high.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
personal identity and authentication information is moderate.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific purpose to which personal identity and
authentication information is put; and not on the time required to re-establish access to the
personal identity and authentication information. Benefits determination processes are generally
tolerant of reasonable delays. In many cases, disruption of access to personal identity and
authentication information can be expected to have only a limited adverse effect on agency
operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: In the case of very large data bases
containing personal identity and authentication information relating to the general public, there is
a significant probability that processing delays will affect the benefits entitlements of or access to
facilities by large numbers of individuals. The larger the number of records affected, the longer
the delays that can be expected to result. This can result in financial hardship for citizens and in
serious disruption of the agency operations due to large time and resource requirements for
backlog processing. In such cases, the availability impact level would be at least moderate. In
the case of permanent loss of records or access to facilities by emergency personnel, the impact
might even be high.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
personal identity and authentication information is moderate.
C.2.8.10 Entitlement Event Information Information Type

Entitlement event information includes information about events such as death and date of
occurrence, date of a disabling event and the relating data that can reasonably prove the severity
of such disability, proof of age for retirement benefits, birth and relationship of spouse and/or
children who may be entitled to benefits only as auxiliaries of the primary beneficiary, and other
related information needed to process a claim for benefits. This also includes means-related
information required to administer all the means related benefits associated with the Title XVI
(Supplementary Security Income Program) and the new drug provisions of the recently revised
Medicare Program. The recommended security categorization for the entitlement event
information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Moderate), (integrity, Moderate), (availability, Moderate)}
