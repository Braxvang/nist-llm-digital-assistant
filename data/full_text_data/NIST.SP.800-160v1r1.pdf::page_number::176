I.6.1. Security Purpose
-      Address the security aspects of information management.

I.6.2. Security Outcomes
-      Security-relevant information to be managed is identified.
-      Security protections for information are identified.
-      Security aspects of information representations are defined.
-      Information is securely managed.
-      Security aspects of information status are identified.
-      Information is available to designated stakeholders in a secure manner.

I.6.3. Security Activities and Tasks
IM-1      PREPARE FOR INFORMATION MANAGEMENT
          IM-1.1 Define the security aspects of the strategy for information management.
          Note: The security aspects include stakeholder, technical, and other information. These aspects
          address security, privacy, and intellectual property concerns.
          IM-1.2 Define the security aspects of the information items that will be managed.
          IM-1.3 Designate authorities and responsibilities for the security aspects of information
                 management.
          Note: Due regard is paid to legislation, security, and privacy (e.g., ownership, agreement
          restrictions, rights of access, data rights, and intellectual property). Where restrictions or
          constraints apply, information is identified accordingly. Staff with knowledge of such items of
          information are informed of their security-relevant obligations and responsibilities.
          IM-1.4 Define the security aspects of the content, formats, structure, and strengths of
                 protection for information items.
          Note 1: The security aspects apply to information while at rest (i.e., persistent or non-persistent
          storage), while in transit between a source/point of origin and destination, and while in
          transformation.
          Note 2: The security aspects are informed by the criteria in applicable laws, policies, directives,
          regulations, and patents.
