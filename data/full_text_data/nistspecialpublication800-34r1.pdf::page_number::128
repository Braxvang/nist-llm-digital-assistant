                                                CONTINGENCY PLANNING GUIDE FOR FEDERAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS



While the OEP provides guidance on facility evacuation, it may be safer to remain within the facility in
response to certain emergency situations. Shelter-in-place plans provide instruction to personnel on how
to take refuge indoors in response to unsafe environment outside of the facility or contaminations inside
the facility which could be carried outside and spread. Shelter-in-place planning identifies “safe rooms”
on each floor of the facility. Safe rooms are equipped with emergency resources such as flashlights,
radios for communication, and water. Safe rooms are also identifiable from the window so that first
responders can locate offices where personnel may have taken shelter.

Personnel Health
Pandemic Influenza (PI) is a global outbreak of disease that occurs when a new influenza virus emerges
in human populations and causes serious illness. Because there is little natural immunity, the disease can
spread easily from person to person, rapidly moving across the country and around the world. The
Homeland Security Council, The National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza Implementation Plan, May
2006, requires federal organizations to develop plans to address how the organization will:
       Protect employees during a pandemic;
       Sustain essential functions during significant times of absenteeism;
       Support the overall federal response during a pandemic; and
       Communicate guidance to stakeholders during a pandemic.

Common strategies to protect personnel health during a pandemic outbreak include stricter hygiene
precautions and reducing the number of personnel working in close contact with one another through
implementation of “social distancing.” Approved telework arrangements facilitate social distancing
through working at home while sustaining productivity. Government-run telework sites are also available
to federal employees who cannot work from home or the office. The Office of Personnel Management
provides guidance and resources for developing Pandemic Influenza plans in coordination with the
organization’s Continuity of Operations Plan, human capital policy and strategies during a pandemic, and
telework arrangements.

The World Health Organization provides fact sheets on Avian Influenza at

OPM provides information and guidance on Pandemic Influenza planning at

including pay, leave, hiring, and alternate work arrangements.

OPM and GSA provide information and guidance on federal telework programs from the manager,
employee, and Telework coordinator perspectives at www.telework.gov. Telework centers are also listed
on this site.

Personnel Welfare
During a serious situation, addressing personnel and family matters often takes priority over resuming
business. Planning for such matters may involve pre-identification of temporary housing, work space,
and staffing. In some situations, the organization may need to use personnel from associated
organizations or contract with vendors or consultants if both primary and alternate team members are
unavailable or unable to fulfill responsibilities. Preparations should be made during contingency planning
development for this possibility to ensure that the vendors or consultants can achieve the same access as
the team members could in the event of a disaster. Once personnel are ready to return to work,
