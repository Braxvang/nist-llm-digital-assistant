combination of components that serve a specific purpose. A CKMS can be as simple as a
software program running on a single-user computer and supporting user applications. It
can also be as complex as a variety of sub-systems, each containing many devices that
provide key management services to numerous networked users and applications. A
CKMS can be implemented in a single computer, or it may be widely distributed
geographically and connected with a myriad of communications networks. Processors,
communications media, storage units, etc. are all considered devices in this Framework.

A CKMS can be described as a set of policies, procedures, devices, and components that
are designed to protect, manage, and establish cryptographic keys and metadata. The
CKMS provides a set of functions that perform cryptographic key-management services
on behalf of one or more organizations and their users. Collectively, these functions are
presented as items for specification in a CKMS design (see Section 6.4).

FR:2.5 The CKMS design shall specify all major devices of the CKMS (e.g., the make,
model, and version).

3. Goals
A CKMS should be designed to achieve specific goals. Some possible goals are discussed
in this section.

3.1 Providing Key Management to Networks, Applications, and Users
There is an extensive use of cryptography in several security protocol standards (e.g.,
TLS, IKE, SSH, CMS), where both static keys (i.e., long-term keys) and ephemeral keys
(i.e., keys used only for a single session or key management transaction) are used by the
protocols themselves. While the focus of a CKMS is on the generation, distribution and
storage of the static keys, a CKMS design must also include the generation, storage, and
protection of the employed ephemeral keys as well.

The network over which the CKMS operates forms the communications backbone of the
CKMS. The CKMS designer needs to understand the efficiency and reliability of the
network so that the CKMS can be designed to have minimal negative impact on the
network. The network size and scalability will provide some indication as to the number
of users that the CKMS will need to handle both initially and in the future. Network
characteristics, such as error properties, may also influence the selection of the
cryptographic algorithms and cryptographic modes of operation that may extend (or
worsen) the effects of communication errors after decryption is performed.

A CKMS can be built to serve a particular application (e.g., E-Mail, data storage,
healthcare systems, and payment systems), or it can be designed to serve an entire
enterprise, which encompasses many applications. A CKMS designed for a single
application tends to be specifically designed for and closely integrated into the
application, while an enterprise CKMS should be more generic so that common key-
management functions may be shared as much as possible. A CKMS designer needs to
