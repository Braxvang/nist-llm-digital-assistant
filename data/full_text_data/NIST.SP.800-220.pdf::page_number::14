Small Business Cybersecurity Corner
In FY 2021, the Small Business Cybersecurity Corner website, which provides cybersecurity
basics, guidance, solutions, and training for keeping a small business secure, was updated to
include the latest materials from NIST and other federal partners that are appropriate for small and
medium-sized business (SMB) owners. Some examples include the addition of new “quick start”
guides for both the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and NIST Privacy Framework. For example,
the Guidance by Topic section of this website includes topic-specific guidance on actions to take
to address cybersecurity risks and secure a business. This section was updated during FY 2021 to
include the latest cybersecurity topics, such as detailed instructions on protecting a small business
from ransomware and phishing attacks.
A series of “case studies” was created to enable a small business to educate its employees about
common cybersecurity risks. Each case study is limited to a single printable page and is designed
to provide sufficient information to allow a discussion of the topic’s relevance to the organization.
The topics include phishing, social engineering, keystroke logging, encryption, and data breaches.
In late FY 2021, planning began for a series of SMB-focused videos to explain the most common
cybersecurity risks to small businesses and ways to stay protected. Each video will be hosted on
a dedicated topic page on the Small Business Cybersecurity Corner website.
