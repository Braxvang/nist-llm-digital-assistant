1200          Analysis and Design of the CPLP
1201   To create a highly effective CPLP, the Learning Program Manager will dedicate time and
1202   resources to analyzing and designing the program. During the analysis phase, they identify their
1203   organizational and learning needs or gaps. The gaps are reviewed to determine which audiences
1204   will need training and and their existing levels of knowledge and skill(s). It may be necessary to
1205   evaluate various workroles for learning gaps so that relevant learning programs can be
1206   customized and created based on the specific learning needs for the workrole. During the design
1207   phase, the gaps are translated into learning objectives, which are the focus of the learning
1208   material. Tying the learning objectives to identified knowledge and skill gaps ensures that the
1209   end result is relevant and will succeed in closing the identified learning needs.

1210          Analysis Phase
1211   The analysis phase is the process during which the Learning Program Manager determines the
1212   organization’s learning and performance needs. In this context, the needs, which are also called
1213   gaps, are the difference between the current learning goals (or activities) and the desired state. To
1214   determine their learning needs, organizations may conduct a formal or informal needs
1215   assessment (also referred to as a needs analysis). The primary benefit of the analysis phase is to
1216   identify both learning needs for the organization and the learning audience. Additional benefits
1217   include having information that clearly defines the learning needs, support for resources and the
1218   prioritization of resources, and the alignment of learning goals to organizational mission goals.
1219   In the beginning of the analysis phase, it may be helpful to identify the primary members of the
1220   analysis team, including several additional constituent groups. This may include the following:
1221      •   Executive management – These organizational leaders understand the relevant
1222          regulations, directives, laws, operational changes, or other requirements that form the
1223          basis for the CPLP. It is important for the leadership to provide input to the
1224          organizational learning needs since they set the expectations for the program and the
1225          personnel. A key role for the Learning Manager in driving learning programs is to
1226          continually advocate for the program. The Learning Manager will make the case for why
1227          analysis is important and how an effective CPLP is part of effective risk management.
1228          Additionally, an effective and well-designed CPLP supports the development of an
1229          organizational culture focused on cybersecurity and privacy protections.
1230      •   Cybersecurity and privacy personnel– These individuals act as subject-matter experts
1231          and consultants for the organization. They identify and help document the knowledge and
1232          skills needed to perform work roles.
1233      •   System owners and Program Managers – These individuals will have information and
1234          responsibilities for the particular system in use by the organization. For example, the
1235          owner of the financial system will recognize the impact of a goal on the personnel tasked
1236          with operating that system.
1237      •   Learning Program participants - Representatives from the employee base and from
1238          different cybersecurity and privacy work roles can lend their voice and input into the
1239          requirements gathering and analysis process.
