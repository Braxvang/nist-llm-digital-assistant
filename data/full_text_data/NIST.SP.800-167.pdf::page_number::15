additional cost in managing these solutions. If built-in application whitelisting capabilities are not
available or are determined to be unsuitable, then the alternative is to examine third-party solutions with
robust centralized management capabilities. An organization that can dedicate the necessary trained staff
to solution maintenance and has built-in application whitelisting technology should generally implement
application whitelisting at least in a monitoring mode.

It is highly recommended to test any prospective application whitelisting technology in a monitoring
mode to see how it behaves before solution deployment. This testing should include a thorough
evaluation of how the solution reacts to changes in software, such as installing an update. An application
whitelisting technology might be considered unsuitable if, for instance, it had to be disabled in order to
install security updates for the operating system or particular applications.

2.7    Additional Considerations

This section describes additional considerations that organizations should examine when evaluating the
likely effectiveness of potential application whitelisting technology solutions.

      Effectiveness Consideration                                      Further Explanation

How easily can a solution be bypassed?       If a solution can be bypassed easily, some users will choose to do so
                                             in order to run unauthorized software, and malware may take
                                             advantage of the configuration weakness to execute on the host.

How complex is a solution (hash-based        Generally, more complex solutions will be harder for an attacker to
versus signature-based, etc.)?               circumvent. A relatively simple solution lacks the features necessary
                                             to minimize false positives and false negatives. However, more
                                             complex solutions may have higher administrative and maintenance
                                             overhead.

What are the relative costs of a solution?   It is important to consider not only the implementation costs of a
                                             solution, but also the ongoing operational costs. The implementation
                                             and operational costs of solutions may vary widely.

What impact does the solution have on        Using application whitelisting technologies generally should not be
standard performance?                        noticeable to users in terms of significantly slowing host performance.

What impact does the solution have on        If the solution does not minimize false positives, users may frequently
business/mission?                            be prevented from running authorized software. If the solution does
                                             not minimize false negatives, malware infections are more likely to
                                             occur. Both of these circumstances could seriously impact the
                                             organizationâ€™s mission, depending on the value of the relevant hosts.

How usable is the solution for both users    A more usable solution will not only minimize false positives, to
and administrators?                          minimize user disruption, but it will also provide pertinent information
                                             to users and administrators when software is blocked from installation
                                             or execution.

What are the long-term maintenance           As new applications are added to the environment and existing
demands for running the solution?            applications are updated, there may be technical difficulties in keeping
                                             whitelists updated in a timely manner, and significant costs associated
                                             with maintenance. Certain types of whitelisting require more frequent
                                             whitelist changes than others. However, the amount of maintenance
                                             needed must be balanced with the effectiveness of the solution; a
                                             higher-maintenance solution that prevents more incidents may
                                             actually be less expensive in the long term since it includes the cost to
                                             remediate incidents, versus a lower-maintenance solution that has
                                             limited effectiveness in stopping threats.
