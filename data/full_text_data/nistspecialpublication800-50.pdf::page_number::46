6.    Post-Implementation

An organization’s IT security awareness and training program can quickly become obsolete if sufficient
attention is not paid to technology advancements, IT infrastructure and organizational changes, and shifts
in organizational mission and priorities. CIOs and IT security program managers need to be cognizant of
this potential problem and incorporate mechanisms into their strategy to ensure the program continues to
be relevant and compliant with overall objectives.

Continuous improvement should always be the theme for security awareness and training initiatives, as
this is one area where “you can never do enough.”
