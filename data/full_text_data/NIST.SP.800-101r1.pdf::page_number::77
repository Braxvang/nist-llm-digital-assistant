                                                             Guidelines on Mobile Device Forensics

Appendix B. Glossary

     Acquisition – A process by which digital evidence is duplicated, copied, or imaged.

     Analysis – The examination of acquired data for its significance and probative value to the
     case.

     Authentication Mechanism – Hardware or software-based mechanisms that force users to
     prove their identity before accessing data on a device.

     Bluetooth – A wireless protocol that allows two similarly equipped devices to communicate
     with each other within a short distance (e.g., 30 ft.).

     Brute Force Password Attack – A method of accessing an obstructed device by attempting
     multiple combinations of numeric/alphanumeric passwords.

     Buffer Overflow Attack – A method of overloading a predefined amount of memory storage
     in a buffer, which can potentially overwrite and corrupt memory beyond the buffer’s
     boundaries.

     Cellular Network Isolation Card (CNIC) – A SIM card that isolates the device from cell
     tower connectivity.

     Chain of Custody – A process that tracks the movement of evidence through its collection,
     safeguarding, and analysis lifecycle by documenting each person who handled the evidence,
     the date/time it was collected or transferred, and the purpose for any transfers.

     Closed Source Operating System – Source code for an operating system is not publically
     available.

     Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) – A spread spectrum technology for cellular
     networks based on the Interim Standard-95 (IS-95) from the Telecommunications Industry
     Association (TIA).

     Compressed File – A file reduced in size through the application of a compression algorithm,
     commonly performed to save disk space. The act of compressing a file makes it unreadable to
     most programs until the file is uncompressed.

     Cradle – A docking station, which creates an interface between a user’s PC and PDA and
     enables communication and battery recharging.

     CDMA Subscriber Identity Module (CSIM) – CSIM is an application to support
     CDMA2000 phones that runs on a UICC, with a file structure derived from the R-UIM card.

     Deleted File – A file that has been logically, but not necessarily physically, erased from the
     operating system, perhaps to eliminate potentially incriminating evidence. Deleting files does
     not always necessarily eliminate the possibility of recovering all or part of the original data.

     Digital Evidence – Electronic information stored or transmitted in binary form.
