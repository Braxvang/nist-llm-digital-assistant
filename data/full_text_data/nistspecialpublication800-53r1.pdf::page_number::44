 Label                               See Security Label.
 Line of Business                    The following OMB-defined process areas common to virtually
                                     all federal agencies: Case Management, Financial Management,
                                     Grants Management, Human Resources Management, Federal
                                     Health Architecture, Information Systems Security, Budget
                                     Formulation and Execution, Geospatial, and IT Infrastructure.
 Local Access                        Access to an organizational information system by a user (or an
                                     information system) communicating through an internal
                                     organization-controlled network (e.g., local area network) or
                                     directly to a device without the use of a network.
 Low-Impact System                   An information system in which all three security objectives (i.e.,
 [FIPS 200]                          confidentiality, integrity, and availability) are assigned a FIPS
                                     199 potential impact value of low.
 Major Application                   An application that requires special attention to security due to
 [OMB Circular A-130,                the risk and magnitude of harm resulting from the loss, misuse, or
 Appendix III]                       unauthorized access to or modification of the information in the
                                     application. Note: All federal applications require some level of
                                     protection. Certain applications, because of the information in
                                     them, however, require special management oversight and should
                                     be treated as major. Adequate security for other applications
                                     should be provided by security of the systems in which they
                                     operate.
 Major Information System            An information system that requires special management
 [OMB Circular A-130]                attention because of its importance to an agency mission; its high
                                     development, operating, or maintenance costs; or its significant
                                     role in the administration of agency programs, finances, property,
                                     or other resources.
 Malicious Code                      Software or firmware intended to perform an unauthorized
 [CNSS Inst. 4009]                   process that will have adverse impact on the confidentiality,
 [NIST SP 800-61]                    integrity, or availability of an information system. A virus,
                                     worm, Trojan horse, or other code-based entity that infects a host.
                                     Spyware and some forms of adware are also examples of
                                     malicious code.
 Malware                             See Malicious Code.
 Management Controls                 The security controls (i.e., safeguards or countermeasures) for an
 [FIPS 200]                          information system that focus on the management of risk and the
                                     management of information system security.
 Media                               Physical devices or writing surfaces including, but not limited to,
 [FIPS 200]                          magnetic tapes, optical disks, magnetic disks, Large-Scale
                                     Integration (LSI) memory chips, and printouts (but not including
                                     display media) onto which information is recorded, stored, or
                                     printed within an information system.
