                           Gold Medal Award
       Tom Karygiannis, Stephen Quirolgico, and Jeffrey Voas (CSD)
                                      Additional recipients of this award were:
               Brian Antonishek, Anthony Downs, Lisa Fronczek, Craig Schlenoff, and Brian Weiss
                    (all from the NIST Engineering Laboratory, Intelligent Systems Division)




            From Left to Right: Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker, Brian Weiss, Craig Schlenoff,
               Brian Antonishek, Anthony Downs, Lisa Fronczek, Stephen Quirolgico, Jeff Voas,
                             Tom Karygiannis, and Patrick Gallagher, NIST Director


      The NIST team led a multi-organizational effort (NIST/George Mason University/DARPA) that developed
      innovative methods for security, testing, and evaluation of hardware and software to securely deploy off-
      the-shelf smartphones and applications in military field operations. NIST introduced software assurance
      methods, power and reliability analysis techniques, and standards-based cryptographic solutions that
      empowered the USG to securely deploy modified commercial solutions, reduce development costs,
      enhance the combat capability of U.S. troops, and save U.S. soldiersâ€™ lives.
