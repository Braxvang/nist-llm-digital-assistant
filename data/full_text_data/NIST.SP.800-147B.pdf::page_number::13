Section 3 specifies requirements on the RTU for performing secure BIOS updates and maintaining BIOS
integrity. The inherent trust of the RTU is derived from an isolated execution environment—minimizing
the risk to subvert the functionality of the RTU and hence maintaining the inherent trust of the RTU.

Each functional component of the RTU may be considered a Root of Trust for the specific function:

      The Verification Component is responsible for verifying a digitally signed BIOS image to
       determine if control should be passed to the image. This component has a trusted execution path
       since it is entered from a known good state of the machine. The verification component can be
       used to extend trusted execution to code in unprotected memory locations. The verification
       component verifies the BIOS image and if the verification is successful then it passes control to
       the image. If the verification fails then the verification component returns to the trusted execution
       path and does not pass control to the image.
      The Recovery Component is responsible for initiating a return of the system to a known good
       state.
      The Integrity Component is responsible for maintaining the integrity of a BIOS image. This
       may include engaging hardware and firmware based locking mechanisms to prevent unauthorized
       modification of the image. It also prevents race/logic conditions from unauthorized modification
       of a BIOS image.
      The Update Component is responsible for performing a secure update of the RTU and
       maintaining the integrity of the RTU.
