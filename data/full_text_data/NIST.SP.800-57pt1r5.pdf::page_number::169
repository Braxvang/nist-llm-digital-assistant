                                                                                                    33. In Section 5.6.1.2, text was inserted about the security properties of hash functions.
                                                                                                        KMAC128 and KMAC256 were added to Table 3. Additional text was added to facilitate

                                                                                                    36. In Section 5.6.4, a paragraph has been inserted at the beginning about the strategy for

                                                                                                    37. In Section 6, the title has been changed to accommodate discussions on key information
