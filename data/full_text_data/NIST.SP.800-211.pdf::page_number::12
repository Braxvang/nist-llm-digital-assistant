    FOCUS AREA 1



    participated in the ISO Project Committee (PC) 317, which focuses on developing ISO
    31700, Consumer protection: privacy by design for consumer goods and services. The
    NIST staff worked to promote the development and international use of the NIST Privacy
    Framework and its principles through engagement with several privacy standards
    activities from the Institute for Testing and Certification (ITC).
    NIST participation has also grown considerably in IoT standardization activities,
    including:
      •   ISO JTC 1/SC 41, IoT architecture and vocabulary, IoT Interoperability, and IoT
          Applications;
      •   ISO JTC 1/SC 27, IoT aspects of Security and Privacy; and
      •   IETF, Software Updates for Internet of Things Security Area.
    NIST has been instrumental in promoting and participating in the development of a
    family of voluntary ISO/IEC standards that align with NIST’s cryptographic module
    validation standard and related specifications. NIST serves as the project editor for nine
    of those standards. Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) Publication 140-3,
    Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules, points to ISO/IEC 19790, Security
    Requirements for Cryptographic Modules. [1] Testing for these requirements will be
    performed in accordance with ISO/IEC 24759, Test Requirements for Cryptographic
    Modules. This is an ongoing effort and will continue over the next several years to
    support a smooth transition path to those using FIPS 140-3 specifications.
    In FY 2020, the NIST staff will continue to lead and participate in cybersecurity and
    privacy standardization efforts with an increased focus on new and emerging areas, such
    as artificial intelligence (AI), quantum information, and IoT. NIST will continue to provide
    thoughtful leadership in many SDOs by actively participating in those organizations and
    contributing publications and papers.
