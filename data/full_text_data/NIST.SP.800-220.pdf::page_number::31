Security of Domain-Specific Networks
This section describes research and projects that focus on the unique requirements and risks
found in specific use cases and unique application domains.
IoT Network Security
NIST’s efforts to advance the design, standardization, commercialization, and adoption of
new technologies to improve the security and resilience of the emerging Internet of Things
has focused its recent efforts on consumer and enterprise network environments. In FY 2021,
NIST completed several projects focused on emerging Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD)
technologies, including the development of an open-source, pure software-defined network (SDN)
implementation of a MUD manager and policy enforcement points, methodologies, and tools to
automate the generation of MUD profiles for IoT devices, as well as NCCoE practice guides for
Securing Home IoT Devices Using MUD.
NIST’s ongoing work in emerging IoT security technology is focused on advancing the development
of trusted IoT device on-boarding and life cycle management. NIST developed a white paper and
conducted a workshop to help focus attention on this problem space and emerging solutions.
NIST initiated a new NCCoE demonstration project to develop practice guides for secure IoT
device on-boarding and life cycle management.
Industrial and Operational Technology Networks
In FY 2021, the NCCoE collaborated with engineers from NIST’s Engineering Lab to improve
the security and resilience of industrial and operational technology networks that span multiple
application domains, including general industrial control systems and manufacturing environments.
Members of the Protecting Information and System Integrity in Industrial Control System
Environments project published a draft practice guide, Cybersecurity for the Manufacturing Sector
(draft SP 1800-10). Manufacturers, and their increasingly interconnected operational technology
(OT) and information technology (IT) systems, have become major targets of cybersecurity
attacks. The goal of the project was to demonstrate example solutions that manufacturers can
use to protect their systems from destructive malware, insider threats, advanced persistent
threats, and unlicensed software. Technology providers and industry experts, including several
National Cybersecurity Excellence Partnership (NCEP) collaborators, contributed to example
solutions that were implemented in two distinct but related labs, each with two settings: robotics-
based manufacturing and process control systems that resemble what is being used by chemical
manufacturing industries.
NIST initiated an update of the Guide to Industrial Control Systems (ICS) Security (SP 800-82)
to incorporate lessons learned over the past several years, to provide alignment to relevant NIST
guidance and other control system cybersecurity standards and recommended practices, and to
address changes in the threat landscape. A pre-draft call for comments was initiated in April 2021,
and the initial public draft of SP 800-82, Rev. 3 is currently scheduled for FY 2022. Updates include
expanding the scope from ICS to control systems/OT, applying new cybersecurity capabilities,
adding guidance specific to small- and medium-sized control system/OT owners and operators,
and revising information about relevant threats, vulnerabilities, standards, and recommended
practices.
