Chapter 10
10. Risk Management
    An effective risk management process is an important component of a successful
information security program. The principal goal of an organizationâ€™s risk
management process is to protect the organization and its ability to perform its
mission, not just its information assets. Therefore, the risk management process
should not be treated primarily as a technical function carried out by the information
security experts who operate and manage the information security system, but as an
essential management function of the organization that is tightly woven into the
system development life cycle (SDLC), 67 as depicted in Figure 10-1. Because risk
cannot be eliminated entirely, the risk management process allows information
security program managers to balance the operational and economic costs of
protective measures and achieve gains in mission capability. By employing practices
and procedures designed to foster informed decision making, agencies help protect
their information systems and the data that support their own mission.
