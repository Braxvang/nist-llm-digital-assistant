       Tools not designed specifically for forensic purposes are questionable and should be
       thoroughly evaluated before use. In some situations, they might be the only means to retrieve
       information that could be relevant as evidence.

3.1   Palm dd (pdd)

       Palm dd (pdd)17 is a Windows-based command line tool that performs a physical acquisition of
       information from Palm OS devices [Gra02]. pdd is designed to work with most PDAs running
       the Palm OS in console mode. During the acquisition stage, a bit-for-bit image of the deviceâ€™s
       memory can be obtained. The data retrieved by pdd includes all user applications and
       databases. pdd is strictly a command line driven application without features such as graphics
       libraries, report generation, search facilities, and bookmarking capabilities. Once the
       information has been acquired, two files are generated: one that contains device-specific
       information (e.g., OS version, processor type, sizes of RAM and ROM), and another that
       contains a bit-by-bit image of the device. Examiners face the challenge of carefully examining
       the output, which is in binary form, some of which happens to be ASCII characters. Files
       created from pdd can be imported into a forensic tool, such as EnCase, to aid analysis;
       otherwise, the default tool is a hex editor. pdd does not provide hash values for the
       information acquired. However, a separate procedure can be used to obtain needed hash
       values. As of January 2003, pdd is no longer supported, however, version 1.11 source code is
       available and should remain available for use, as defined in the included license. Paraben has
       integrated elements of the pdd engine into PDA Seizure [Cas04].

3.2   Pilot-Link

       Pilot-link is an open source software suite originally developed for the Linux community to
       allow information to be transferred between Linux hosts and Palm OS devices.18 It runs on
       other desktop operating systems besides Linux, including Windows and Mac OS. About thirty
       command line programs comprise the software suite. Unlike pdd, which uses the Palm
       debugger protocol for acquisition, pilot-link uses the Hotsync protocol. The two programs of
       interest to forensic specialists are pi-getram and pi-getrom, which respectively retrieve the
       contents of RAM and ROM from a device, similar to the physical acquisition done by pdd.
       Another useful program is pilot-xfer, which allows the installation of programs and the backup
       and restoration of databases. pilot-xfer provides a means to acquire the contents of a device
       logically. The contents retrieved with these utilities can be manually examined with either
       POSE, a compatible forensic tool such as EnCase, or a hex editor. Pilot-link does not provide
       hash values of the information acquired. A separate step must be carried out to obtain needed
       hash values.

3.3   POSE

       POSE (Palm OS Emulator)19 is a software program that runs on a desktop computer under a
       variety of operating systems, and behaves exactly as a Palm OS hardware device, once an
       appropriate ROM is loaded into it. The free emulator program imitates the hardware of a
