     NIST SP 800-73pt3-5 ipd (Initial Public Draft)         Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification: Part 3
     September 2023                                                                             PIV Client API



53   Abstract
54   FIPS 201 defines the requirements and characteristics of government-wide interoperable identity
55   credentials. It specifies that these identity credentials must be stored on a smart card and that
56   additional common identity credentials, known as derived PIV credentials, may be issued by a
57   federal department or agency and used when a PIV Card is not practical. This document contains
58   the technical specifications to interface with the smart card to retrieve and use the PIV identity
59   credentials. The specifications reflect the design goals of interoperability and PIV Card
60   functions. The goals are addressed by specifying a PIV data model, card edge interface, and
61   application programming interface. Moreover, this document enumerates requirements for the
62   options and branches in international integrated circuit card standards. The specifications go
63   further by constraining interpretations of the normative standards to ease implementation,
64   facilitate interoperability, and ensure performance in a manner tailored for PIV applications.

69   Reports on Computer Systems Technology
70   The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and
71   Technology (NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical
72   leadership for the Nation’s measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops tests, test
73   methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance
74   the development and productive use of information technology. ITL’s responsibilities include the
75   development of management, administrative, technical, and physical standards and guidelines for
76   the cost-effective security and privacy of other than national security-related information in
77   Federal information systems. The Special Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research,
78   guidelines, and outreach efforts in information system security, and its collaborative activities
79   with industry, government, and academic organizations.
