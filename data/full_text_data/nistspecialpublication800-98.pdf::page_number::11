Executive Summary

Like any information technology (IT), radio frequency identification (RFID) presents security and privacy
risks that must be carefully mitigated through management, operational, and technical controls in order to
realize the numerous benefits the technology has to offer. When practitioners adhere to sound security
engineering principles, RFID technology can help a wide range of organizations and individuals realize
substantial productivity gains and efficiencies. These organizations and individuals include hospitals and
patients, retailers and customers, and manufacturers and distributors throughout the supply chain. This
document provides an overview of RFID technology, the associated security and privacy risks, and
recommended practices that will enable organizations to realize productivity improvements while
safeguarding sensitive information and protecting the privacy of individuals. While RFID security is a
rapidly evolving field with a number of promising innovations expected in the coming years, these
guidelines focus on controls that are commercially available today.

RFID is a form of automatic identification and data capture (AIDC) technology that uses electric or
magnetic fields at radio frequencies to transmit information. An RFID system can be used to identify
many types of objects, such as manufactured goods, animals, and people. Each object that needs to be
identified has a small object known as an RFID tag affixed to it or embedded within it. The tag has a
unique identifier and may optionally hold additional information about the object. Devices known as
RFID readers wirelessly communicate with the tags to identify the item connected to each tag and
possibly read or update additional information stored on the tag. This communication can occur without
optical line of sight and over greater distances than other AIDC technologies. RFID technologies support
a wide range of applicationsâ€”everything from asset management and tracking to access control and
automated payment.

Every RFID system includes a radio frequency (RF) subsystem, which is composed of tags and readers.
In many RFID systems, the RF subsystem is supported by an enterprise subsystem that is composed of
middleware, analytic systems, and networking services. RFID systems that share information across
organizational boundaries, such as supply chain applications, also have an inter-enterprise subsystem.
Each RFID system has different components and customizations so that it can support a particular
business process for an organization; as a result, the security risks for RFID systems and the controls
available to address them are highly varied. The enterprise and inter-enterprise subsystems involve
common IT components such as servers, databases, and networks and therefore can benefit from typical
IT security controls for those components.

Implementing the recommendations presented in this publication should help organizations improve the
security of their RFID systems.

Personnel responsible for designing RFID systems should understand what type of application an
RFID system will support so that they can select the appropriate security controls.

Each type of application uses a different combination of components and has a different set of risks. For
example, protecting the information used to conduct financial transactions in an automated payment
system requires different security controls than those used for protecting the information needed to track
livestock. Factors to consider include:

 The general functional objective of the RFID technology. For example, does the system need to
  determine the location of an object or the presence of an object, authenticate a person, perform a
  financial transaction, or ensure that certain items are not separated?
