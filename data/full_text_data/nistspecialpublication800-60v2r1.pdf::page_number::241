management of large amounts of information (e.g., environmental and weather data, criminal
records, etc.), the creation of information and data standards relating to a specific type of
information (patient records), and the creation and management of physical communication
infrastructures (networks) on behalf of the public.

Note: Information infrastructures for government use are not included in this information type
because the impact levels associated with information infrastructure maintenance information are
primarily a function of the information processed in that infrastructure. The recommended
provisional security categorization for the information infrastructure maintenance information
type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of information
infrastructure maintenance information on the ability of responsible agencies to manage a type of
information and/or to create physical communication infrastructures on behalf of the public in
order to facilitate communication. The disclosure of most information infrastructure maintenance
information can be expected to result in a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or
individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: In some cases, information
infrastructure maintenance details can be of use to terrorists or other criminals who seek to
destroy government data bases or communications infrastructures, or deny access to information
needed by the public. Unauthorized disclosure of some information infrastructure maintenance
details to criminals can result in danger to critical infrastructures, key national assets, or human
life. In such cases, the confidentiality impact can be high. In other cases, premature
unauthorized disclosure of management information can give an unfair competitive advantage to
a commercial interest (e.g., proposed outsourcing of system administration or details of a
proposed communications system acquisition). This can result in assignment of a moderate
impact level to such information.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for information infrastructure maintenance information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. That is, the
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of information infrastructure
maintenance information typically depend on the criticality of the data processed by the
infrastructure and whether this data is time-critical. In most cases, the data will not be urgently
needed or acted upon immediately.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: In a relatively few cases, the consequences
of unauthorized modification or destruction of information infrastructure maintenance
information might result in serious damage to agency operations, assets, or human safety. This
