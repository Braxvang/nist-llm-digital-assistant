involvement during operations, resulting in a more transparent system, is usually more
desirable and may be more secure.

FR:6.97 For each key and metadata management function, the CKMS design shall specify
all human input parameters, their formats, and the actions to be taken by the CKMS if they
are not provided.

                             A Federal CKMS should minimize human involvement in

                             entering and outputting keys and sensitive metadata to/from
                             the FCKMS.

6.7.4 Multiparty Control
Certain FCKMS key-management functions could require multiparty control. Requiring k of
n entities to be authorized by the FCKMS access-control system before the function is
performed could provide multiparty control. Multiparty controls should be used when
performing key-management functions for highly sensitive applications.

Of particular concern are the keys used by a Certificate Authority to sign certificates and any
keys used by the FCKMS for self-protection (e.g., the keys used to access other keys within
the FCKMS, such as the keys used to protect a database of keys).

FR:6.98 The CKMS design shall specify all functions that require multiparty control,
specifying k and n for each function.

FR: 6.99 For each multiparty function, the CKMS design shall cite or specify any known
rationale (logic, mathematics) as to why any k of the n entities can enable the desired
function, but k-1 of the entities cannot.

                            impact-level systems.

              AC-3 (2)      A Federal CKMS should use multiparty control for managing

                            and using Certificate Authority keys in Low and Moderate
                            impact-level systems.

6.7.5 Key Splitting
Key splitting is a technique for establishing multiparty control of keys. When a highly
sensitive key is required, the key is split into n key splits so that for some k (k < n), any k key
splits of the key can be used to form the key, but having any kï€­1 key splits provides no
knowledge of the key value. Each of the n key splits is then provided to one of n trusted
entities so that the key cannot be formed unless k of the entities agree to take part. But if any
