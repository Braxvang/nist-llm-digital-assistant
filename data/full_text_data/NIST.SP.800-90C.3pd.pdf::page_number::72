2012   Appendix A. Entropy vs. Security Strength (Informative)
2013   This section of the appendix compares and contrasts entropy and security strength.

2014   A.1.    Entropy
2015   Suppose that an entropy source produces n-bit strings with m bits of entropy in each bitstring. This
2016   means that when an n-bit string is obtained from that entropy source, the best possible guess of the
2017   value of the string has a probability of no more than 2−m of being correct.
2018   Entropy can be thought of as a property of a probability distribution, like the mean or variance.
2019   Entropy measures the unpredictability or randomness of the probability distribution on bitstrings
2020   produced by the entropy source, not a property of any particular bitstring. However, the
2021   terminology is sometimes slightly abused by referring to a bitstring as having m bits of entropy.
2022   This simply means that the bitstring came from a source that ensures m bits of entropy in its output
2023   bitstrings.
2024   Because of the inherent variability in the process, predicting future entropy-source outputs does
2025   not depend on an adversary’s amount of computing power.

2026   A.2.    Security Strength
2027   A deterministic cryptographic mechanism (such as one of the DRBGs defined in [SP800-90A])
2028   has a security strength − a measure of how much computing power an adversary expects to need
2029   to defeat the security of the mechanism. If a DRBG has an s-bit security strength, an adversary
2030   who can make 2w computations of the underlying block cipher or hash function, where w < s,
2031   expects to have about a 2w−s probability of defeating the DRBG’s security. For example, an
2032   adversary who can perform 296 AES encryptions can expect to defeat the security of the CTR-
2033   DRBG that uses AES-128 with a probability of about 2−32 (i.e., 296−128).

2034   A.3.    A Side-by-Side Comparison
2035   Informally, one way of thinking of the difference between security strength and entropy is the
2036   following: suppose that an adversary somehow obtains the internal state of an entropy source (e.g.,
2037   the state of all of the ring oscillators and any internal buffer). This might allow the adversary to
2038   predict the next few bits from the entropy source (assuming that there is some buffering of bits
2039   within the entropy source), but the entropy source outputs will once more become unpredictable
2040   to the adversary very quickly. For example, knowing what faces of the dice are showing on the
2041   craps table does not allow a player to successfully predict the next roll of the dice.
2042   In contrast, suppose that an adversary somehow obtains the internal state of a DRBG. Because the
2043   DRBG is deterministic, the adversary can then predict all future outputs from the DRBG until the
2044   next reseeding of the DRBG with a sufficient amount of entropy.
2045   An entropy source provides bitstrings that are hard for an adversary to guess correctly but usually
2046   have some detectable statistical flaws (e.g., they may have slightly biased bits, or successive bits
2047   may be correlated). However, a well-designed DRBG provides bitstrings that exhibit none of these
