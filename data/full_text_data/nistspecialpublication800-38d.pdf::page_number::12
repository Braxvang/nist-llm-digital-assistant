Direct Random String       In the RBG-based construction of IVs, an output string of an RBG
                           that is used as the random field for an IV.

FIPS                       Federal Information Processing Standard.

Fixed Field                In the deterministic construction of IVs, the field that identifies the
                           device or context for the instance of the authenticated encryption
                           function.

Forward Cipher             A permutation on blocks that is determined by the choice of a key for
Function                   a given block cipher.

Free Field                 In the RBG-based construction of IVs, the field whose contents are
                           not restricted.

Fresh                      For a newly generated key, the property of being unequal to any
                           previously used key.

GCM                        Galois/Counter Mode

ICB                        Initial Counter Block

Initialization Vector      A nonce that is associated with an invocation of authenticated
                           encryption on a particular plaintext and AAD.

Inverse Cipher Function    The function that is the inverse of the forward cipher function for a
                           given key.

Invocation Field           In the deterministic construction of IVs, the field that identifies the
                           sets of inputs to the authenticated encryption function in a particular
                           device or context.

Key                        The parameter of the block cipher that determines the selection of the
                           forward cipher function from the family of permutations.

Least Significant Bit(s)   The right-most bit(s) of a bit string.

Mode of Operation          An algorithm for the cryptographic transformation of data that is
