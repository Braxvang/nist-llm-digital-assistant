objectives and security impact levels for administrative and management information and
information systems are determined by the natures of the supported direct services and
constituencies being supported.

Much of the discussion of factors affecting assignment of impact level is common to many
information types. Because this guideline is intended as a reference document, and it is
anticipated that most users will refer only to one or a few information types of interest, several
common or similar observations appear with each information type to which they are
appropriate. Some impact factors common to all information types are discussed in Volume I,
Section 4.2.3 and 4.4.2.

C.1 Recommended Provisional Impact Levels for Management and Support
   Information Types
The eight information types associated with support delivery of services as well as the five
government resources management information FEA lines of business are provided in Table
C-1. Each of the information types associated sub-functions are detailed in Appendix C.2 and
C.3. These management and support functions are the day-to-day activities necessary to provide
the critical policy, programmatic, and managerial foundation that support Federal government
operations.
