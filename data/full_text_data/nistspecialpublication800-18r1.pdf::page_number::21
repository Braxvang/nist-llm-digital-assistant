                        Guide for Developing Security Plans for Federal Information Systems



-        Security controls that can be either explicitly or implicitly supported by
         automated mechanisms will not require the development of such mechanisms if
         the mechanisms do not already exist or are not readily available in commercial or
         government off-the-shelf products. In situations where automated mechanisms
         are not readily available or technically feasible, compensating security controls,
         implemented through non-automated mechanisms or procedures, will be used to
         satisfy minimum security requirements.

Common security control-related considerations—

-        Security controls designated by the agency as common controls will, in most
         cases, be managed by an organizational entity other than the information system
         owner. Every control in a security control baseline must be addressed either by
         the agency through common security controls or by the information system
         owner. Decisions on common control designations must not, however, affect the
         agency's responsibility in providing the necessary security controls required to
         meet the minimum security requirements for the information system. (Additional
         information on common controls is provided in Section 2.5.3.)

Public access information systems-related considerations—

-        Security controls associated with public access information systems must be
         carefully considered and applied with discretion since some of the security
         controls from the specified security control baselines (e.g., personnel security
         controls, identification and authentication controls) may not be applicable to users
         accessing information systems through public interfaces.12

Infrastructure-related considerations—

-        Security controls that refer to agency facilities (e.g., physical access controls such
         as locks and guards, environmental controls for temperature, humidity, lighting,
         fire, and power) will be applicable only to those sections of the facilities that
         directly provide protection to, support for, or are related to the information system
         (including its information technology assets such as electronic mail or web
         servers, server farms, data centers, networking nodes, controlled interface
         equipment, and communications equipment).



12
  For example, while the baseline security controls require identification and authentication of
organizational personnel who maintain and support information systems that provide public access
services, the same controls might not be required for users accessing those systems through public
interfaces to obtain publicly available information. On the other hand, identification and authentication
must be required for users accessing information systems through public interfaces to access their
private/personal information.
