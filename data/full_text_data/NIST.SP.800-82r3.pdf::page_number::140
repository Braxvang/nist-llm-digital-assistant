NIST SP 800-82r3                                            Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

            should be developed and communicated to the organization for
            requesting and enabling remote access. Remote access should be
            provided only if justified and limited to what is required for the business
            need. Remote access should not circumvent or negate safety or security
            controls. Multi-factor authentication should be considered for remote
            access to the OT system.
            In critical situations or when vendor support is needed, temporary remote
            access may be requested to perform maintenance. In such cases,
            procedures should still be followed to ensure that secure connections are
            being utilized.
            There are several different techniques for implementing temporary
            remote access, including:
                   •   Users or protocols (e.g., RDP, SSH) that are temporarily
                       permitted through the OT or enterprise firewall
                   •   Screen-sharing technologies
                   •   Modems
                   •   VPNs
            Regardless of the technology, organizations should consider the
            following:
                   •   Implementing unique usernames and complex passwords
                   •   Removing, disabling, or modifying any default credentials
                   •   Updating any software and firmware to the latest versions
                   •   Removing access when no longer required. Consider
                       implementing automatic timers for removing access or managing
                       change processes to manually confirm the removal of access.
                   •   Monitoring remote activities
                   •   Ensuring that operations personnel are aware of planned remote
                       activity in the OT environment
                   •   Initiating the connection from the OT environment
                   •   Labeling remote connection devices so that operations may
                       disconnect quickly in the case of unauthorized use
            Dial-Up Modems
            If dial-up modems are used in OT environments, consider using callback
            systems. This ensures that a dialer is an authorized user by having the
            modem establish the working connection based on the dialer’s
            information and a callback number stored in the OT-approved authorized
            user list.
