    During Phase 2, Acquisition/Development, the risk management process begins
with the initial risk assessment. NIST SP 800-30, Risk Management Guide for
Information Technology Systems, defines risk management as “the process that
allows information technology (IT) managers to balance the operational and
economic costs of protective measures and achieve gains in mission capability by
protecting the information systems and data that support their organizations’
missions.” 86 Risk management encompasses the process of identifying, analyzing,
and responding to risk. This process includes identifying existing vulnerabilities in a
system or in its respective components. Since risk is oftentimes an uncertainty on
whether or not a given event will occur, an executable plan must be in place if a
potential risk is exploited. Risk identification involves determining the possible effect
on an information system due to a risk. During this phase, initial baselines of security
controls are being selected based on assessing the risk level of a network. After the
security controls are established, the CM process can begin. The documented CM
