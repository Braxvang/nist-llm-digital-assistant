3 CONFIGURATION TESTING

This chapter presents worked examples illustrating development of test configurations. As
will be seen, the advantages of combinatorial testing increase with the size of the problem.

3.1   Simple Application Platform Example

         Returning to the simple example introduced in Chapter 2, we illustrate development
of test configurations, and compare the size of test suites for various interaction strengths
versus testing all possible configurations. For the five configuration parameters, we have
3 ⋅ 2 ⋅ 2 ⋅ 2 ⋅ 3 = 72 configurations. The convention for describing the variables and values in
combinatorial testing is v1n1v2n2 ... where the vi are number of variable values and ni are
number of occurrences. Thus this configuration is designated 2332. Note that at t = 5, the
number of tests is the same as exhaustive testing for this example, because there are only
five parameters. The savings as a percentage of exhaustive testing are good, but not that
impressive for this small example. With larger systems the savings can be enormous, as
will be seen in the next section.

                          Parameter           Values
                          Operating system    XP, OS X, RHL
                          Browser             IE, Firefox
                          Protocol            IPv4, IPv6
                          CPU                 Intel, AMD
                          DBMS                MySQL, Sybase, Oracle
                  Table 2. Simple example configuration options.
We can now generate test configurations using the ACTS tool. For simplicity of
presentation we illustrate usage of the command line version of ACTS, but an intuitive GUI
version is available that may be more convenient. This tool is summarized in Appendix C
and a comprehensive user manual is included with the ACTS download.

       The first step in creating test configurations is to specify the parameters and
possible values in a file for input to ACTS, as shown in Figure 5:
