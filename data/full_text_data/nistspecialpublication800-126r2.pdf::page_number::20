                 The Technical Specification for the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.2



        The “Element Definition” field indicates the prose description of the element. The definition field
         MAY contain key words as indicated in [RFC2119].
        The “Properties” field is broken into four subfields:
         o    The “Name” column indicates the name of a property that MAY, SHOULD, or MUST be
              included in the described element, in accordance with the cardinality indicated in the “Count”
              column and any [RFC2119] requirement words in the “Property Definition” column.
         o    The “Type” column indicates the REQUIRED data type for the value of the property. There
              are two categories of types: literal and element. A literal type indicates the type of literal as
              defined in [XMLS]. An element type references the name of another element that ultimately
              defines that property.
         o    The “Count” column indicates the cardinality of the property within the element. The
              property MUST be included in the element in accordance with the cardinality. If a range is
              given, and “n” is the upper bound of the range, then the upper limit SHALL be unbounded.
         o    The “Property Definition” column defines the property in the context of the element. The
              definition MAY contain key words as indicated in [RFC2119].


                                        Table 2 - ds:data-stream-collection

Element Name: ds:data-stream-collection
Element         The top-level element for a SCAP data stream collection. It contains the data streams and
Definition      components that comprise this data stream collection, along with any data stream signatures.
Properties:
Name            Type              Count     Property Definition
id              literal – ID      1         The identifier for the data stream collection. This identifier MUST be
                                            globally unique (see Section 3.1.3).
schematron-     literal – token   1         The version of the SCAP Requirements Schematron rule set to which
version                                     the data stream collection conforms.
data-stream     element –         1-n       An element that represents a single data stream (see Table 3).
                ds:data-stream
component       element –         1-n       An element that represents content expressed using an SCAP
                ds:component                component specification (see Table 10).
extended-       element –         0-n       An element that holds non-SCAP components to enable extension (see
component       ds:extended-                Table 11).
                component
Signature       element –         0-n       An XML digital signature element. Sections 3.10 and 4.8 define the
                dsig:Signature              requirements for this element.

                                             Table 3 - ds:data-stream

Element Name: ds:data-stream
Element         A data stream. This element contains the links to all of the components that comprise this data
Definition      stream.
Properties
Name            Type              Count     Property Definition
id              literal – ID      1         The identifier for the data stream. This identifier MUST be globally
                                            unique (see Section 3.1.3).
