OT Discussion: Hardware components are marked or labeled to indicate information that is
processed, stored, or transmitted. Component markings can be useful for differentiating between
safety and control systems, OT and IT equipment, and internally and externally connected
systems. Marking components reduces the probability of mismanaging the system or performing
maintenance on an incorrect device.
