Appendix B—Glossary

Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)—A protocol used to obtain a node’s physical address. A client
station broadcasts an ARP request onto the network with the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the target
node with which it wishes to communicate, and with that address the node responds by sending back its
physical address so that packets can be transmitted to it.

Content Generator—A program on a Web server that will dynamically generate HyperText Markup
Language (HTML) pages for users. Content generators can range from simple Common Gateway
Interface (CGI) scripts executed by the Web server to Java EE or .NET application servers in which
most—if not all—HTML pages served are dynamically generated.

Demilitarized Zone (DMZ)—A host or network segment inserted as a “neutral zone” between an
organization’s private network and the Internet.

Host—Almost any kind of computer, including a centralized mainframe that is a host to its terminals, a
server that is host to its clients, or a desktop personal computer (PC) that is host to its peripherals. In
network architectures, a client station (user’s machine) is also considered a host because it is a source of
information to the network, in contrast to a device, such as a router or switch, that directs traffic.

Hotfix—Microsoft’s term for “patch.”

Mandatory Access Control—A means of restricting access to system resources based on the sensitivity
(as represented by a label) of the information contained in the system resource and the formal
authorization (i.e., clearance) of users to access information of such sensitivity.

Network Administrator—A person who manages a local area network (LAN) within an organization.
Responsibilities include ensuring network security, installing new applications, distributing software
upgrades, monitoring daily activity, enforcing licensing agreements, developing a storage management
program, and providing for routine backups.

Nonce—A randomly generated value used to defeat “playback” attacks in communication protocols. One
party randomly generates a nonce and sends it to the other party. The receiver encrypts it using the
agreed upon secret key and returns it to the sender. Because the sender randomly generated the nonce,
this defeats playback attacks because the replayer cannot know in advance the nonce the sender will
generate. The receiver denies connections that do not have the correctly encrypted nonce.

Operating System—The software “master control application” that runs the computer. It is the first
program loaded when the computer is turned on, and its main component, the kernel, resides in memory
at all times. The operating system sets the standards for all application programs (such as the Web server)
that run in the computer. The applications communicate with the operating system for most user interface
and file management operations.

Patch—A “repair job” for a piece of programming; also known as a “fix.” A patch is the immediate
solution that is provided to users; it can sometimes be downloaded from the software maker’s Web site.
The patch is not necessarily the best solution for the problem, and product developers often find a better
solution to provide when they package the product for its next release. A patch is usually developed and
distributed as a replacement for or an insertion in compiled code (that is, in a binary file or object
module). In many operating systems, a special program is provided to manage and track the installation
of patches.
