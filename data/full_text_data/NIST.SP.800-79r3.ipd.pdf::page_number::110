                       Determine that:
                          (i) The PKI is listed on the Federal PKI Policy Authority’s
                              website as being a provider of derived PIV Credential
                              certificates at AAL3 (review).
                         (ii) Derived PIV authentication certificates comply with the
                              derived PIV authentication certificate profile (review).
                        (iii) Cryptographic algorithms and key sizes are based on
                              [SP800-78] (review).

                       authentication key pair is generated within a hardware                                 Issuance
                       cryptographic module that meets the requirements of [SP800-
                       63B], Sec. 4.2.2, including being validated to [FIPS140] Level 2                       [SP800-157], Sec. 3.1.2 –
                       or higher, providing Level 3 physical security to protect the                          Cryptographic Specifications
                       derived PIV authentication private key while in storage, and not
                       permitting the private key to be exported.

                       Assessment
                       Determine that:
                          (i) The organization ensures that derived PIV authentication
                              certificates issued under id-fpki-common-derived-
                              pivAuth-hardware certificate policy are generated on
                              cryptographic modules the meet the requirements of
                              [SP800-63B], Sec. 4.2.2 and validated against
                              [FIPS140] at Level 2 or higher with Level 3 physical
                              security (review).
                         (ii) The keypair is generated in the device (authenticator or
                              endpoint) that will house the derived PIV credential
                              (interview, test).

                       common-derived-pivAuth, the derived PIV authentication key                             Cryptographic Specifications
                       pair is generated within a cryptographic module that has been
                       validated to [FIPS140] Level 1 or higher.

                       Assessment
                       Determine that:
                          (i) The organization ensures that derived PIV authentication

                         (ii) If the key pair is generated outside of the authenticator
                              itself, the private key is transferred via an authenticated
