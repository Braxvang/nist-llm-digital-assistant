Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Unauthorized modification or destruction
of public relations information may result in distribution of false and misleading information.
Such events can be expected to adversely affect operations and/or public confidence in the
agency. This can significantly degrade the public relations mission capability. In such cases, a
moderate integrity impact may exist.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
public relations information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the public relations information.
Public relations processes are generally tolerant of limited delays. In most cases, disruption of
access to public relations information can be expected to have only a limited adverse effect on
agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
public relations information is low.

C.2.7 Legislative Relations

Legislative Relations involves activities aimed at the development, tracking, and amendment
of public laws through the legislative branch of the Federal Government.
C.2.7.1 Legislation Tracking Information Type

Legislation Tracking involves following legislation from conception to adoption. The
recommended security categorization for the legislation tracking information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of legislation tracking
information on the ability of responsible agencies to follow legislation from conception to
adoption. Legislation tracking information itself is usually in the public domain and poses no
confidentiality impact.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: In some cases, internal
correspondence associated with legislation tracking information can contain information, that if
improperly disclosed, will have a serious adverse effect on agency relationships with other
agencies and with the legislative branch. This can result in assignment of a moderate impact
level to such information.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for legislation tracking information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. In most cases,
