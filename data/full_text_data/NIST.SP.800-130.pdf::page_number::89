9.8.4 Flaw Remediation Capabilities
A CKMS should have the capability to detect, report, and fix flaws in an expeditious and
secure manner. A CKMS that employs automated techniques is highly desirable because
it can continuously monitor its own security status, report potential problems to an
authorized person fulfilling an appropriate CKMS role, and minimize reliance on human
monitoring of events that occur infrequently.

FR:9.13 The CKMS design shall specify the CKMS capabilities for detecting system
flaws, including:
    a) Known-answer tests,
    b) Error detection codes,
    c) Anomaly diagnostics, and
    d) Functional Testing.

FR:9.14 The CKMS design shall specify the CKMS capability for reporting flaws,
including: the capability to produce status report messages with confidentiality, integrity
and source authentication protections, and to detect unauthorized delays.

FR:9.15 The CKMS design shall specify the CKMS capability for analyzing flaws and
creating/obtaining fixes for likely or commonly known flaws.

FR:9.16 The CKMS design shall specify its capability to transmit fixes with
confidentiality, integrity and source authentication protections and to detect unauthorized
delays.

FR:9.17 The CKMS design shall specify its capability for implementing fixes in a timely
manner.

10. Disaster Recovery
The use of a CKMS to manage cryptographic keys and metadata that are used to protect
information has the additional risk that a failure of the CKMS may hamper or prevent
access to the information. For example, the failure of the decrypting capability may delay
or prevent the use of enciphered data. This section describes how operational continuity
can be achieved in the event of component failures or the corruption of keys and
metadata

10.1 Facility Damage
A CKMS should be located in physically secure and environmentally protected facilities.
In addition, the CKMS management should provide for backup and recovery in the event
that damage to the CKMS occurs. The backup and recovery facilities should be designed,
implemented, and operated at a level that is commensurate with the value and sensitivity
of the data and the operations being protected. When a CKMS facility is damaged,
operations should be transferred to a backup facility, and keys that could have been
disclosed accidentally should be immediately placed on Compromised Key or Certificate
