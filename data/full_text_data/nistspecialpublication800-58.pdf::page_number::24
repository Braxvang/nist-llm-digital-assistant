 3     Quality of Service Issues

        Quality of Service (QoS) [3,4] is fundamental to the operation of a VOIP
        network. Despite all the money VOIP can save users and the network elegance it
        provides, if it cannot deliver at least the same quality of call setup and voice relay
        functionality and voice quality as a traditional telephone network, then it will
        provide little added value. The implementation of various security measures can
        degrade QoS. These complications range from delaying or blocking of call setups
        by firewalls to encryption-produced latency and delay variation (jitter). QoS
        issues are central to VOIP security. If QoS was assured, then most of the same
        security measures currently implemented in today’s data networks could be used
        in VOIP networks. But because of the time-critical nature of VOIP, and its low
        tolerance for disruption and packet loss, many security measures implemented in
        traditional data networks just aren’t applicable to VOIP in their current form. The
        main QoS issues associated with VOIP that security affects are presented here:


 3.1    Latency

        Latency in VOIP refers to the time it takes for a voice transmission to go from its
        source to its destination. Ideally, we would like to keep latency as low as possible
        but there are practical lower bounds on the delay of VOIP. The ITU-T
        Recommendation G.114 [5] establishes a number of time constraints on one-way
        latency. The upper bound is150 ms for one-way traffic. This corresponds to the
        current latency bound experienced in domestic calls across PSTN lines in the
        continental United States [6]. For international calls, a delay of up to 400 ms was
        deemed tolerable [7], but since most of the added time is spent routing and
        moving the data over long distances, we consider here only the domestic case and
        assume our solutions are upwards compatible in the international realm.

        VOIP calls must achieve the 150 ms bound to successfully emulate the QoS that
        today’s phones provide. This time constraint leaves very little margin for error in
        packet delivery. Furthermore, it places a genuine constraint on the amount of
        security that can be added to a VOIP network. The encoding of voice data can
        take between 1 and 30 ms [8] and voice data traveling across the North American
        continent can take upwards of 100 ms [9] although actual travel time is often
        much faster [10]. Assuming the worst case (100 ms transfer time), 20 –50 ms
        remain for queuing and security implementations. A less pessimistic delay budget
        is provided by Goode [10] and reproduced in Figure 2. (Dnw = backbone
        network delay, bounded to 29 ms with a total of 121 ms from other sources.)
