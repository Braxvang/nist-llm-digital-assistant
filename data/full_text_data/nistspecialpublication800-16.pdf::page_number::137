 Training Area: System Life Cycle Security          — implementation
 Functional Specialty: Manage

 Definition   —      The system life cycle is a model for building and operating an IT system
                     from its initial inception to its termination and disposal of assets. The
                     model includes six phases: Initiation, Development, Test and Evaluation,
                     Implementation, Operations, and Termination. Life cycle security is the
                     ensemble of processes and procedures which ensures data confidentiality, as
                     needed, as well as data and system integrity, and availability.


                     The implementation phase is the installation of the system into the
                     operational environment in a manner that does not compromise the integrity
                     and effectiveness of the successfully tested security safeguards.

 Behavioral Outcome      —   Individuals with management responsibilities are able to oversee the
                             implementation and deployment of an IT system in a manner that
                             does not compromise in-place and tested security safeguards.
