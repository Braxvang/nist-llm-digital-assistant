                            NIST SP 800-135, Revision 1



HASH             A cryptographic hash function, such as SHA-1.
HMAC-HASH The HMAC algorithm using the hash function, HASH (e.g., HASH
          could be SHA-1). See FIPS 198-1 for the specification of the
          HMAC algorithm using one of the approved hash functions.
HMAC-PRF         The HMAC function being used as a PRF.
P_HASH          A function that uses the HMAC-HASH as the core function in its
                construction. The specification of this function is in RFCs 2246 and
                5246.
a|x              a divides x.


x             The ceiling of x; the smallest integer ≥ x. For example, 5 = 5 and
                5.2 = 6.

x              The floor of x; the largest integer ≤ x. For example, 5 = 5 and
                 6.9 = 6.

len(x)           The length of the string x in bits.

               A bitwise logical operation such that 1  1 = 0, 1  0 = 1, 0  0 =
                0, and 0  1 = 1. For example, given a string A = 10 and a string B
                = 11, then A  B = (1  1) || (0  1) = 01.

XOR             A XOR B is equivalent to A  B. See the definition of the bitwise
                logical operation  above.

Pre-shared-key A secret key that has previously been established. See “pre-shared
               key” in Section 3.1 above.

SKEY            A session key in TPM.



4         Extraction-then-Expansion (E-E) Key Derivation
          Procedure
NIST has specified several key derivation functions (KDFs) in SP 800-56A, SP 800-
56B and SP 800-108 [SP 800-108]. SP 800-56C [SP 800-56C] specifies an additional
KDF that is an extraction-then-expansion (E-E) procedure, which has a different
structure from the KDFs in SP 800-56A, SP 800-56B and SP 800-108. The procedure
consists of two separate steps: a randomness extraction step and a key expansion step.
The general specification of the E-E procedure is in SP 800-56C, which provides an
additional method for deriving keys when performing a key establishment scheme as
