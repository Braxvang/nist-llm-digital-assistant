      •   Audience for the plan;

      •   Measurement roles and responsibilities, including responsibilities for data collection
          (both soliciting and submitting), analysis, and reporting;

      •   Process of measures collection, analysis, and reporting, as tailored to the specific
          organizational structure, processes, policies, and procedures;

      •   Details of coordination within the Office of the CIO, relating to areas such as risk
          assessment, C&A, and FISMA reporting activities;

      •   Details of coordination between the SAISO and other functions within the agency (e.g.,
          physical security, personnel security, and privacy) to ensure that measures data collection
          is streamlined and non-intrusive;

      •   Creation or selection of data collection and tracking tools;

      •   Modifications of data collection and tracking tools; and

      •   Measures summary reporting formats.

Additionally, the information security measurement implementation plan should contain
provisions for continuous monitoring of the information security program. Continuous
monitoring activities include configuration management, information security impact analyses of
changes to the information system, assessment of a subset of security controls, and status
reporting. Sound continuous monitoring practices dictate that the organization establishes
selection criteria for a subset of the security controls employed within the information system for
purposes of continuous monitoring. NIST SP 800-37 provides guidelines on the continuous
monitoring process. NIST SP 800-53A provides guidelines on the assessment of security
controls. Results generated from continuous monitoring provide data necessary to support and
supplement the data collected in Phase 2, and help facilitate corrective action prioritization in
Phase 3.

6.2       Collect Data and Analyze Results

Phase 2 of the information security measurement program implementation process, Collect Data
and Analyze Results, involves activities essential for ensuring that the collected measures are
used to gain an understanding of information system security and identify appropriate
improvement actions. This phase includes the following activities:

          •   Collect measures data according to the processes defined in the Measurement
              Program Implementation Plan;

          •   Aggregate measures as appropriate to derive higher-level measures (e.g., “rolling up”
              information system-level measures to derive program-level measures);
