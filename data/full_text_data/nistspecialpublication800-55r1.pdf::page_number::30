       •    Improve congressional decision making by providing more objective information on
            achieving statutory objectives and by reporting on the relative effectiveness and
            efficiency of federal programs and spending; and
       •    Improve internal management of the federal government. 4

GPRA mandates agencies to conduct strategic and performance planning that culminates in
annual submissions of strategic plans and performance measures reports. GPRA puts this
planning in the context of the overall agency Capital Planning and Investment Control (CPIC)
process by emphasizing “managing for results—what the program accomplishes and how well
the accomplishments match with the program’s purpose and objectives.” 5

As a part of their annual strategic and performance planning processes, agencies should:

       •    Define their long-term and annual goals and objectives;
       •    Set measurable targets of performance; and
       •    Report their performance against goals and objectives to the Office of Management and
            Budget (OMB) on a quarterly basis.

This performance measures reporting directly supports GPRA by providing a means to track
performance against agency goals and objectives and measurable performance targets. Agencies
can demonstrate the impact of information security on their missions by aligning information
security performance measures with their information security goals and objectives.

GPRA is implemented by OMB Circular A-11, Preparation, Submission, and Execution of the
Budget, Part 6.

4.1.2       Federal Information Security Management Act

FISMA requires federal agencies to provide appropriate protection of their resources through
implementing a comprehensive information security program that is commensurate with the
sensitivity of the information being processed, transmitted, and stored by agency information
systems. It also requires agencies to assess and report their performance in implementing and
managing their information security programs.
The purpose of FISMA is to:

       •    Provide a comprehensive framework for ensuring the effectiveness of security controls
            over information resources that support federal operations and assets;
       •    Recognize the highly networked nature of the current federal computing environment and
            provide effective government wide management and oversight of related information
