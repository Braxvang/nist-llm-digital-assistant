                                            ESTABLISHING WIRELESS ROBUST SECURITY NETWORKS: A GUIDE TO IEEE 802.11I



This section also explains the basic IEEE 802.11 network components and architectural models, as a
foundation for understanding other sections of this guide. The major concepts introduced in this section
are as follows:

      Station (STA). A STA is a wireless endpoint device, 13 such as a laptop, PDA, or mobile phone.
      Access Point (AP). An AP logically connects STAs with a distribution system, which is
       typically an organizationâ€™s wired network infrastructure. APs can also logically connect wireless
       STAs with each other without accessing a distribution system.
      Ad Hoc Mode. This is a wireless network configuration that does not use APs; STAs
       communicate directly with each other.
      Infrastructure Mode. This wireless network configuration requires APs and is the most
       commonly used mode for WLANs. All STAs connect with an AP, and the AP transfers frames
       among the STAs and the distribution system.
      Independent Basic Service Set (IBSS). An IBSS is a set of STAs configured in ad hoc mode.
      Basic Service Set (BSS). A BSS is composed of an AP and one or more STAs configured in
       infrastructure mode. Each of the STAs associate directly with the AP. A BSS is the basic
       building block of a WLAN.
      Distribution System (DS). A DS is an infrastructure, typically a wired LAN, that connects
       individual BSSs to each other.
      Extended Service Set (ESS). An ESS is a WLAN comprising more than one BSS connected by
       a DS.

     Technically, a STA is a wireless network interface implementation. It is distinct from the device that will provide an
     application using the network interface (such as a laptop or PDA).
