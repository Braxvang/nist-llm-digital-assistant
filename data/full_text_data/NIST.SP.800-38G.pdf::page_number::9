inverse            For a given block cipher, the inverse of the permutation of blocks that is
transformation     determined by the choice of a key.

                   For a given block cipher, the secret bit string that parameterizes the
key
                   permutation.

mode               See block cipher mode of operation.

numeral            For a given base, a nonnegative integer less than the base.

numeral string     For a given base, a finite, ordered sequence of numerals for the base.
