                   If sufficient entropy is available or can be obtained when reseeding the RBG’s DRBG.
421       1. An RBG1 construction (see Section 4) does not have access to a randomness source after
422          instantiation. It is instantiated once in its lifetime over a secure channel from an external
423          RBG with appropriate security properties. An RBG1 construction does not support
424          reseeding and cannot provide prediction resistance as described in Section 2.4.2 and
425          [SP800-90A]. The construction can be used to initialize subordinate DRBGs.
426       2. An RBG2 construction (see Section 5) includes one or more entropy sources that are used
427          to instantiate and reseed the DRBG within the construction. This construction can provide
428          prediction resistance (see Section 2.4.2 and [SP800-90A]) when sufficient entropy is
429          available or can be obtained from the RBG’s entropy source(s) at the time that prediction
430          resistance is requested. The construction has two variants that depend on the type of
431          entropy source(s) employed (i.e., physical and non-physical).
432       3. An RBG3 construction is designed to provide output with a security strength equal to the
433          requested length of its output by producing outputs that have full entropy (i.e., an RBG
434          designed as an RBG3 construction can, in effect, support all security strengths) (see Section
435          2.1). This construction provides prediction resistance and has two types, namely
436          RBG3(XOR) and RBG3(RS).
437           a. An RBG3(XOR) construction (see Section 6.2) combines the output of one or more
438              validated entropy sources with the output of an instantiated, approved DRBG using an
439              exclusive-or (XOR) operation.
440           b. An RBG3(RS) construction (see Section 6.3) uses one or more validated entropy
441              sources to provide randomness input for the DRBG by continuously reseeding.
442   This document also provides constructions for 1) subordinate DRBGs (sub-DRBGs) that are
443   instantiated and possibly reseeded by an RBG1 construction (see Section 4.3) and 2) acquiring
444   entropy from an entropy source and conditioning the output to provide a bitstring with full entropy
445   (see Section 3.3). SP 800 90A provides constructions for instantiating and reseeding DRBGs and
446   requesting the generation of pseudorandom bitstrings.
447   All constructions in SP 800-90C are described in pseudocode. These pseudocode conventions are
448   not intended to constrain real-world implementations but to provide a consistent notation to
449   describe the constructions. By convention, unless otherwise specified, integers are unsigned 32-
450   bit values, and when used as bitstrings, they are represented in the big-endian format.

451           Sources of Randomness for an RBG
452   The RBG constructions specified in this document are based on the use of validated entropy
453   sources. Some RBG constructions (e.g., the RBG3 construction) access these entropy sources
