not SSL 3.0. Because each version of SSL or TLS is incompatible with other versions, both the browser
and the SSL VPN have to have at least one version of SSL in common. Further, they both have to have a
version in common that meets the security policy of the organization running the SSL VPN; otherwise,
the browser and the SSL VPN gateway will not be able to communicate.

3.4.2   Cryptography Used in SSL Sessions

There are many types of cryptographic functions that are used in security protocols. The most widely
known cryptographic features are confidentiality (secrecy of data), integrity (the ability to detect even
minute changes in the data), and signature (the ability to trace the origin of the data). The combination of
these features is an important aspect of the overall security of a communications stream. SSL uses four
significant types of features: confidentiality, integrity, signature, and key establishment (the way that a
key is agreed to by the two parties).

SSL uses cipher suites to define the set of cryptographic functions that a client and server use when
communicating. This is unlike protocols such as IPsec and S/MIME where the two parties agree to
individual cryptographic functions. That is, SSL exchanges say in effect, “Here is a set of functions to be
used together, and here is another set I am willing to use.” IPsec and S/MIME (and many other protocols)
instead say, “Here are the confidentiality functions I am willing to use, here are the integrity functions I
am willing to use, and here are the signature algorithms I am willing to use”, and the other side creates a
set from those choices.

Just as the SSL client and server need to be able to use the same version of SSL, they also need to be able
to use the same cipher suite; otherwise, the two sides cannot communicate. The organization running the
SSL VPN chooses which cipher suites meet its security goals and configures the SSL VPN gateway to
use only those cipher suites.

3.4.3   Authentication Used for Identifying SSL Servers

When a Web browser connects to an SSL server such as an SSL VPN gateway, the browser user needs
some way to know that the browser is talking to a server the user trusts. SSL uses certificates that are
signed by trusted entities to authenticate the server to the Web user. (SSL can also use certificates to
authenticate users to servers, but this is rarely done.)

The server authentication occurs very early in the SSL process, immediately after the user sends its first
message to the SSL server. In that first message, the Web browser specifies which type of certificate
algorithms it can handle; the two common choices are RSA and DSS. In the second message, the SSL
server responds with a certificate of one of the types that the browser said it understands. After receiving
the certificate, the Web browser verifies that the identity in the certificate (that is, the domain name listed
in the certificate) matches the domain name to which the Web browser attempted to connect.

Some SSL VPNs use certificates issued by the vendor of the SSL VPN, and those certificates do not link
through a chain of trust to a root certificate that is normally trusted by most users. If that is the case, the
user should add the SSL VPN's own certificate to the user's list of directly-trusted certificates. It is
important to note that users should not add the root certificate of the SSL VPN's manufacturer to the list
of certification authorities that the user trusts, since the manufacturer’s security policies and controls may
differ from those of the organization. Other SSL VPNs produce self-signed certificates that do not chain
to any trusted root certificate; as before, the user should add the SSL VPN's own certificate to the user's
list of directly-trusted certificates.
