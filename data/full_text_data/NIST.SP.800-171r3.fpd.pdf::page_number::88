       November 2023

2703   information
2704   Any communication or representation of knowledge such as facts, data, or opinions in any medium or form,
2705   including textual, numerical, graphic, cartographic, narrative, electronic, or audiovisual forms. [13]

2706   information flow control
2707   Procedure to ensure that information transfers within a system do not violate the security policy.

2708   information resources
2709   Information and related resources, such as personnel, equipment, funds, and information technology. [81]

2710   information security
2711   The protection of information and systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or
2712   destruction in order to provide confidentiality, integrity, and availability. [79]

2713   information system
2714   A discrete set of information resources organized for the collection, processing, maintenance, use, sharing,
2715   dissemination, or disposition of information. [81]

2716   information technology
2717   Any services, equipment, or interconnected system(s) or subsystem(s) of equipment, that are used in the automatic
2718   acquisition, storage, analysis, evaluation, manipulation, management, movement, control, display, switching,
2719   interchange, transmission, or reception of data or information by the agency. For purposes of this definition, such
2720   services or equipment if used by the agency directly or is used by a contractor under a contract with the agency that
2721   requires its use; or to a significant extent, its use in the performance of a service or the furnishing of a product.
2722   Information technology includes computers, ancillary equipment (including imaging peripherals, input, output, and
2723   storage devices necessary for security and surveillance), peripheral equipment designed to be controlled by the
2724   central processing unit of a computer, software, firmware and similar procedures, services (including cloud
2725   computing and help-desk services or other professional services which support any point of the life cycle of the
2726   equipment or service), and related resources. Information technology does not include any equipment that is
2727   acquired by a contractor incidental to a contract which does not require its use. [13]

2728   insider threat
2729   The threat that an insider will use her/his authorized access, wittingly or unwittingly, to do harm to the security of
2730   the United States. This threat can include damage to the United States through espionage, terrorism, unauthorized
2731   disclosure, or through the loss or degradation of departmental resources or capabilities.

2732   integrity
2733   Guarding against improper information modification or destruction and includes ensuring information non-
2734   repudiation and authenticity. [79]

2735   internal network
2736   A network in which the establishment, maintenance, and provisioning of security controls are under the direct
2737   control of organizational employees or contractors or in which the cryptographic encapsulation or similar security
2738   technology implemented between organization-controlled endpoints provides the same effect (with regard to
2739   confidentiality and integrity). An internal network is typically organization-owned yet may be organization-
2740   controlled while not being organization-owned.

2741   least privilege
2742   The principle that a security architecture is designed so that each entity is granted the minimum system
2743   authorizations and resources needed to perform its function.

2744   malicious code
2745   Software or firmware intended to perform an unauthorized process that will have an adverse impact on the
2746   confidentiality, integrity, or availability of a system. Examples of malicious code include viruses, worms, Trojan
2747   horses, spyware, some forms of adware, or other code-based entities that infect a host.
