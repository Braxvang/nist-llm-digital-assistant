Special Publication 800-79-2                             Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card Issuers
                                                                          and Derived PIV Credential Issuers



                 Subtask 7.2: Update the operations plan.
                 Responsibility: OIMO
                 Guidance: The operations plan must be updated to reflect all changes made as the
                 result of assessment and authorization. All conditions of issuer’s operations that
                 are set forth in the authorization decision must also be noted in the plan.

5.4 Monitoring Phase

The Monitoring Phase consists of two tasks— (i) operations plan maintenance; and (ii) annual
lifecycle walkthrough. Based on the importance of reliably creating and issuing PIV Cards and
Derived PIV Credentials, it is imperative that once the authorization is completed, the issuer is
monitored to ensure that policies, procedures, and processes remain in effect as originally
intended. There can be significant changes in an issuer’s policies, management, operations
personnel, and available technology during a three-year ATO. These changes must be monitored
so that the organization minimizes exposing itself to security and privacy threats existing or
arising after the authorization. For example, if there is a significant staff turnover, the
organization must be sure that the new staff is performing the PIV functions using the same
reliable processes that were previously approved. The overall responsibility for monitoring lies
with the OIMO and the DAO.

In order to facilitate the monitoring of an issuer without undue burden in activities and
paperwork, only two activities are required during this phase: maintenance of the operations plan
and an annual lifecycle walkthrough of issuer operations. The latter entails reviewing all the
services and functions of an issuer and its facilities for continued reliability. The annual
walkthrough must cover a PIV Card’s and/or Derived PIV Credential’s lifecycle from
sponsorship to maintenance. Observation of the full lifecycle ensures that all processes are still
reliably operating as assessed during the authorization.

        Task 8: Operations Plan Update
An operations plan is the primary description of what and how PIV Card and/or Derived PIV
Credential issuing services are provided by the issuer. It is essential that this document be
updated as changes occur in the issuer’s operations. Management will be able to analyze the
impact of changes as they occur and will be significantly better prepared when re-authorization is
required.

                 Subtask 8.1: Document all relevant changes in the issuance processes within the
                 operations plan.
                 Responsibility: OIMO
                 Guidance: In addition to the policies, procedures, and processes that must be
                 documented if changes are made, the organization shall update the operations plan
                 if changes to the information system, the PIV Card, Derived PIV Credential,
                 privacy policies, roles and responsibilities, or issuer controls are made.
                 Subtask 8.2: Analyze the proposed or actual changes to the issuer and determine
                 the impact of such changes.
                 Responsibility: OIMO
