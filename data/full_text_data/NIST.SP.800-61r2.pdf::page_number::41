3.2.6   Incident Prioritization

Prioritizing the handling of the incident is perhaps the most critical decision point in the incident handling
process. Incidents should not be handled on a first-come, first-served basis as a result of resource
limitations. Instead, handling should be prioritized based on the relevant factors, such as the following:

 Functional Impact of the Incident. Incidents targeting IT systems typically impact the business
  functionality that those systems provide, resulting in some type of negative impact to the users of
  those systems. Incident handlers should consider how the incident will impact the existing
  functionality of the affected systems. Incident handlers should consider not only the current
  functional impact of the incident, but also the likely future functional impact of the incident if it is not
  immediately contained.
 Information Impact of the Incident. Incidents may affect the confidentiality, integrity, and
  availability of the organization’s information. For example, a malicious agent may exfiltrate sensitive
  information. Incident handlers should consider how this information exfiltration will impact the
  organization’s overall mission. An incident that results in the exfiltration of sensitive information may
  also affect other organizations if any of the data pertained to a partner organization.
 Recoverability from the Incident. The size of the incident and the type of resources it affects will
  determine the amount of time and resources that must be spent on recovering from that incident. In
  some instances it is not possible to recover from an incident (e.g., if the confidentiality of sensitive
  information has been compromised) and it would not make sense to spend limited resources on an
  elongated incident handling cycle, unless that effort was directed at ensuring that a similar incident
  did not occur in the future. In other cases, an incident may require far more resources to handle than
  what an organization has available. Incident handlers should consider the effort necessary to actually
  recover from an incident and carefully weigh that against the value the recovery effort will create and
  any requirements related to incident handling.
Combining the functional impact to the organization’s systems and the impact to the organization’s
information determines the business impact of the incident—for example, a distributed denial of service
attack against a public web server may temporarily reduce the functionality for users attempting to access
the server, whereas unauthorized root-level access to a public web server may result in the exfiltration of
personally identifiable information (PII), which could have a long-lasting impact on the organization’s
reputation.
The recoverability from the incident determines the possible responses that the team may take when
handling the incident. An incident with a high functional impact and low effort to recover from is an ideal
candidate for immediate action from the team. However, some incidents may not have smooth recovery
paths and may need to be queued for a more strategic-level response—for example, an incident that
results in an attacker exfiltrating and publicly posting gigabytes of sensitive data has no easy recovery
path since the data is already exposed; in this case the team may transfer part of the responsibility for
handling the data exfiltration incident to a more strategic-level team that develops strategy for preventing
future breaches and creates an outreach plan for alerting those individuals or organizations whose data
was exfiltrated. The team should prioritize the response to each incident based on its estimate of the
business impact caused by the incident and the estimated efforts required to recover from the incident.
An organization can best quantify the effect of its own incidents because of its situational awareness.
Table 3-2 provides examples of functional impact categories that an organization might use for rating its
own incidents. Rating incidents can be helpful in prioritizing limited resources.
