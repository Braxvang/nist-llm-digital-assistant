2747   len(x)
2748   The length of x in bits

2749   min(a, b)
2750   The minimum of a and b

2751   output_len
2752   The bit length of the output block of a cryptographic primitive

2753   s
2754   The security strength

2755   X⊕Y
2756   Boolean bitwise exclusive-or (also bitwise addition modulo 2) of two bitstrings X and Y of the same length
