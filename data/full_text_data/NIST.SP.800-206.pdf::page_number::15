    IMPERATIVE 2 – Enhancing Risk Management



            •    Update of the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF). For years, the RMF
                 has been a mainstay for federal agencies and others to use in assessing and
                 managing cybersecurity needs and challenges. Two drafts of the new version
                 were produced in FY18—NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-37, Revision 25—
                 before becoming final in early FY19. Updates included significant new guidance
                 in addressing privacy risks and integrating security and privacy into the
                 design of systems. The RMF also references NIST systems security engineering
                 guidance at appropriate points, including NIST SP 800-160,6 which addresses the
                 engineering of trustworthy secure systems.
                 The revised RMF also offers additional guidance on:
                 •   Better preparing an organization’s senior leaders to execute the RMF, as well
                     as how to communicate their protection plans and risk management strategies
                     to system implementers and operators.
                 •   Incorporating supply chain risk management considerations. The RMF now
                     addresses growing supply chain concerns, such as counterfeit components,
                     tampering, theft, insertion of malicious software and hardware, poor
                     manufacturing and development practices, and other potentially harmful
                     activities that can impact an organization’s systems and systems components.
                 •   Supporting security and privacy safeguards. The RMF update provides
                     organizations with a disciplined and structured process to select controls
                     from the newly developed consolidated security and privacy control catalog
                     in NIST’s SP 800-53 Revision 5.7 This should be valuable to companies and
                     organizations beyond the federal government, considering how high profile the
                     subject of privacy has become as of late.
    Importantly, the revised RMF clarifies its relationship to the Cybersecurity Framework.
    Aligning the RMF with other NIST guidance and publications will help federal agencies
    which are required to implement multiple frameworks. While adhering to the CSF is
    voluntary for private companies, its use for the federal government is not optional
    under Executive Order 13800.8 Use of the RMF is mandatory for federal agencies in
    accordance with the Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA9). The RMF
    is also required and in widespread use in the Department of Defense and the intelligence
