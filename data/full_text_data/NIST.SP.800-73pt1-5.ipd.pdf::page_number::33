800   Secure messaging (SM) is defined in Section 5.4, and VCI is defined in Section 5.5. Table 2 of
801   SP 800-73-5 Part 2 specifies the security conditions for each command.
802   When represented as a byte, the key reference occupies bits b8 and b5-b1, while b7 and b6
803   SHALL be set to 0. If b8 is 0, then the key reference names global reference data. If b8 is 1, then
804   the key reference names application-specific reference data.
805   The access control rules for PIV data object access SHALL reference the PIV Card Application
806   PIN and MAY optionally reference the cardholder Global PIN or OCC data. If the Global PIN is
807   used by the PIV Card Application, then the Global PIN format SHALL follow the PIV Card
808   Application PIN format defined in Section 2.4.3 of SP 800-73-5 Part 2.
809   PIV Card Applications with the Discovery Object and Bit 6 of the first byte of the PIN Usage
810   Policy value set to one, as per Section 3.3.2, SHALL reference the PIV Card Application PIN
811   and the cardholder Global PIN in the access control rules for PIV data object access.
812   Additionally, the PIV Card Application card commands CAN change the status of the Global
813   PIN and MAY change its reference data while the PIV Card Application is the currently selected
814   application.


      12
         A card may optionally have a symmetric CAK in addition to the mandatory asymmetric CAK, in which case both keys would share the same
      key reference and access control rules. However, the use of the symmetric card authentication key has been deprecated in FIPS 201-3 and may be
      removed in a future version of the standard.
