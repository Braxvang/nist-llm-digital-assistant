       â€¢   Draft SP 800-171B, Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information in Nonfederal
           Systems and Organizations: Enhanced Security Requirements for Critical Programs
           and High Value Assets, which provides enhanced security requirements that
           apply only to components of nonfederal systems that process, store, or transmit
           CUI or that provide protection for such components when the designated CUI is
           contained in a critical program or high-value asset [12]. The enhanced security
           requirements are only applicable to a nonfederal system or organization when
           mandated by a federal agency in a contract, grant, or other agreement.
     In October 2018, NIST coordinated with the Department of Defense (DoD) and NARA to
     host an informational workshop that provided an overview of CUI, updates about recent
     changes to CUI provisions in the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations Supplement
     (DFARS), and NIST Special Publications 800-171 and 800-171A. This workshop featured
     panels of Federal Government representatives (who discussed expectations for
     evaluating evidence and implementing the CUI security requirements) and industry
     representatives (who shared best practices and lessons learned).


     Systems Security Engineering (SP 800-160, Volumes 1 & 2)
     In FY 2019, NIST continued to foster the engineering-driven perspective and actions
     necessary to develop more defensible and survivable systems, including the machine,
     physical, and human components that compose the systems and the capabilities and
     services delivered by those systems. The Systems Security Engineering (SSE) approach
     builds upon well-established international standards for systems and software and fuses
     systems security engineering methods, practices, and techniques. The objective is to
     address security issues from the perspective of stakeholder protection needs, concerns,
     and requirements using established engineering processes so that appropriate fidelity
     and rigor are addressed early on and in a sustainable manner throughout the life cycle
     of the system. NIST also published the first draft in a series of specialty publications
     that were developed to support the NIST SSE guideline. Volume 2 addresses cyber
     resiliency considerations for two important, yet distinct, communities of interest: 1) those
     conducting the new development of IT component products, systems, and services and
     2) those with legacy systems (having an installed base) currently carrying out day-to-
     day mission and business functions.
     An element of this focus on risk-based SSE included the publication of a new NIST
     Cybersecurity White Paper entitled, Mitigating the Risk of Software Vulnerabilities by
     Adopting a Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF) [13]. This white paper
     builds on a proven software development life cycle (SDLC) methodology for designing,
     creating, and maintaining software and encouraging the integration of specific secure
     software development practices. Benefits of SSDF include reducing the number of
     vulnerabilities in released software, mitigating the potential exploitation of undetected or
     unaddressed vulnerabilities, and addressing the root causes of vulnerabilities to prevent
     future recurrences.
