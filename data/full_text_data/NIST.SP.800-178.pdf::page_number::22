                                                                                                     •    Deny-overrides: if any decision evaluates to Deny, or no decision evaluates to Permit,

                                                                                                     •    Permit-overrides: if any decision evaluates to Permit, then the result is Permit, otherwise

                                                                                                     •    First-applicable: the result is the result of the first decision (either Permit, Deny, or

                                                                                                     •    Only-one-applicable: if only one decision applies, then the result is the result of the

                                                                                               Combining algorithms are applied to Rules in a Policy and Policies within a PolicySet in arriving

                                                                                               In addition to the standard set of combining algorithms, XACML includes a standard extension
