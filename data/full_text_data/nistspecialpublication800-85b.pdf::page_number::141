Special Publication 800-85B                                   PIV Data Model Testing Specification


Test Steps              1.    Take an arbitrary stream of data
                        2.    Hash the data using a hash algorithm
                        3.    Set cardHandle := <<valid card handle>>
                        4.    Set authenticators := <<valid authenticator>>
                        5.    Call pivLogIntoCardApplication
                              • (IN) cardHandle
                              • (IN) authenticators
                        6. Set keyReference := <<key reference for Key Management
                           Key i.e. 9D>>
                        7. Set algorithmIdentifier := <<identifier of the
                           algorithm to be used for the cryptographic operation>>
                        8. Set algorithmInput := <<hashed data from Step 2>>
                        9. Call pivCrypt with the following parameters
                           • (IN) keyReference
                              • (IN) algorithmIdentifier
                              • (IN) algorithmInput
                              • (OUT) algorithmOutput
                        10. Set OID := <<Key Management Certificate
                            (2.16.840.1.101.3.7.2.1.2)>>
                        11. Call pivGetData with the following parameters
                            • (IN) cardHandle
                              • (IN) OID
                              • (OUT) data
                        12.     Verify the signature with subjectPublicKeyInfo-
                              >subjectPublicKey from the certificate
Expected Result(s)      The private key corresponds to the public key contained in the
                        certificate as the signature verification succeeds.


11.3.2.3 Verify RSA exponent

Purpose                 For RSA keys, confirms that the exponent of the RSA asymmetric key
                        for digital signature is greater than or equal to 65,537.

                        2.    AS07.03.09
Precondition            1.    A valid PIV card is inserted into the contact reader.
                        2.    A valid PC/SC connection exists between the test application and
                              the contact reader.
                        3.    The test application is currently connected to the card application
                              which is accessible through card handle.
                        4.    A digital signature key and corresponding certificate are present on
                              the PIV card.
