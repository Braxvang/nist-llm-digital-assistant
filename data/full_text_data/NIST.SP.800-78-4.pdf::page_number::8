2       Application of Cryptography in FIPS 201-2

FIPS 201-2 employs cryptographic mechanisms to authenticate cardholders, secure information
stored on the PIV Card, and secure the supporting infrastructure.

FIPS 201-2 and its supporting documents specify a suite of keys to be stored on the PIV Card for
personal identity verification, digital signature generation, and key management. The PIV
cryptographic keys specified in FIPS 201-2 and SP 800-73-4 are:

    +    the asymmetric PIV Authentication key;
    +    an asymmetric Card Authentication key;
    +    a symmetric Card Authentication key;
    +    an asymmetric digital signature key for signing documents and messages;
    +    an asymmetric key management key, supporting key establishment or key transport, and
         up to twenty retired key management keys;
    +    a symmetric PIV Card Application Administration Key; and
    +    an asymmetric PIV Secure Messaging key, supporting the establishment of session keys
         for use with secure messaging.
The cryptographic algorithms, key sizes, and parameters that may be used for these keys are
specified in Section 3.1. PIV Cards must implement private key computations for one or more of
the algorithms identified in this section.

Cryptographically protected objects specified in FIPS 201-2, SP 800-73-4, and SP 800-76-2
include:

    +    the X.509 certificates for each asymmetric key on the PIV Card, except the PIV Secure
         Messaging key;
    +    a secure messaging card verifiable certificate (CVC) for the PIV Secure Messaging key;
    +    an Intermediate CVC for the public key needed to verify the signature on the secure
         messaging CVC;
    +    a digitally signed Card Holder Unique Identifier (CHUID);
    +    digitally signed biometrics using the Common Biometric Exchange Formats Framework
         (CBEFF) signature block; and
    +    the SP 800-73-4 Security Object, which is a digitally signed hash table.
The cryptographic algorithms, key sizes, and parameters that may be used to protect these
objects are specified in Section 3.2. Certification authorities (CA) and card management systems
that protect these objects must support one or more of the cryptographic algorithms, key sizes,
and parameters specified in Section 3.2.
