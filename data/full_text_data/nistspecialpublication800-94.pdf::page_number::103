                                                 GUIDE TO INTRUSION DETECTION AND PREVENTION SYSTEMS (IDPS)



 What default report formats are offered (e.g., text, comma-separated values [CSV], HTML,
  Extensible Markup Language [XML], PDF, Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel) and what data storage
  formats are supported for IDPS data, log, and report retention
 How reports can be customized (both altering existing reports and creating new reports)
 Whether or not reports can be generated automatically (e.g., on a schedule, when certain events
  occur), how the reports can be distributed (e.g., e-mailed to administrators), and how the distributed
  reports are protected (e.g., file encryption)
 Whether or not it offers any workflow tracking capabilities, such as incident tracking.
9.4.2.2 Maintenance

Organizations should consider how the IDPS solution and its components should be maintained, and then
evaluate products based on those maintenance requirements. Maintenance considerations should include
the following:

 Whether or not sensors or agents can be managed both independently and through a management
  server, and whether such accesses are logged
 What local and remote maintenance mechanisms are available (e.g., locally installed GUI, Web-based
  console, command-line interface [CLI], third-party tools), and what differences there are (if any) in
  their functionality
 Which components can be maintained locally and remotely with each maintenance mechanism
 What security protections are provided for each maintenance mechanism (e.g., strong encryption for
  network traffic)
 How component configuration settings can be backed up and restored, and how they can be
  transferred from a component to a replacement component (e.g., swapping sensor appliances because
  of hardware failure)
 How robust the product is at logging component status information (e.g., low disk space, high CPU
  utilization), operational failures, and other events that may necessitate maintenance actions
 Whether or not the IDPS provides sufficiently robust log management tools, and if not, how
  administrators could compensate (e.g., write scripts, acquire third-party tools).
9.4.2.3 Updates

Organizations should carefully consider how the vendor of each evaluated IDPS product releases updates
for it. Aspects of this to consider include the following:

 How often regular major and minor updates to each component are released (e.g., sensors,
  management servers, consoles)
 How often updates to detection capabilities are released in response to major new threats, and how
  soon after the identification of a new threat the corresponding update is typically available
 Which types of updates usually or sometimes require that IDPS components be rebooted or restarted
