Special Publication 800-96                                 PIV Card to Reader Interoperability Guidelines




1.    Introduction


1.1   Authority
This document has been developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in furtherance
of its statutory responsibilities under the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002,
Public Law 107-347.
NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements, for providing
adequate information security for all agency operations and assets, but such standards and guidelines shall not
apply to national security systems. This recommendation is consistent with the requirements of the Office of
Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Section 8b(3), Securing Agency Information Systems, as
analyzed in A-130, Appendix IV: Analysis of Key Sections. Supplemental information is provided in A-130,
Appendix III.
This recommendation has been prepared for use by Federal agencies. It may be used by non-governmental
organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright. Nothing in this document should be taken to
contradict standards and guidelines made mandatory and binding on Federal agencies by the Secretary of
Commerce under statutory authority. Nor should this recommendation be interpreted as altering or superseding
the existing authorities of the Secretary of Commerce, Director of the Office of Management and Budget, or any
other Federal official.

1.2   Purpose and Scope
The purpose of this document is to present recommendations for Personal Identity Verification (PIV) card
readers in the area of performance and communications characteristics to foster interoperability. This document
is not intended to re-state or contradict requirements specifically identified in Federal Information Processing
Standard 201 (FIPS 201) or its associated documents. It is intended to augment existing standards to enable
agencies to achieve the interoperability goal of Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12).
The document provides requirements that facilitate interoperability between any card and any reader.
Specifically, the recommendations are for end-point cards and readers designed to read end-point cards.
