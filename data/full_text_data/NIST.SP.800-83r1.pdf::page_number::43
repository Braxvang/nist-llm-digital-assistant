                                GUIDE TO MALWARE INCIDENT PREVENTION AND HANDLING FOR DESKTOPS AND LAPTOPS


malware incidents is no different than for any other type of incident. Examples of possible outcomes of
lessons learned activities for malware incidents are as follows:

     Security Policy Changes. Security policies might be modified to prevent similar incidents. For
      example, if connecting personally owned mobile devices to organization laptops caused a serious
      infection, modifying the organization’s policies to secure, restrict, or prohibit such device
      connections might be advisable.
     Awareness Program Changes. Security awareness training for users might be changed to reduce
      the number of infections or to improve users’ actions in reporting incidents and assisting with
      handling incidents on their own hosts.
     Software Reconfiguration. OS or application settings might need to be changed to support
      security policy changes or to achieve compliance with existing policy.
     Malware Detection Software Deployment. If hosts were infected through a transmission
      mechanism that was unprotected by antivirus software or other malware detection tools, an
      incident might provide sufficient justification to purchase and deploy additional software.
     Malware Detection Software Reconfiguration. Detection software might need to be
      reconfigured in various ways, such as the following:

        –   Increasing the frequency of software and signature updates

        –   Improving the accuracy of detection (e.g., fewer false positives, fewer false negatives)

        –   Increasing the scope of monitoring (e.g., monitoring additional transmission mechanisms,
            monitoring additional files or file systems)

        –   Changing the action automatically performed in response to detected malware

        –   Improving the efficiency of update distribution.
