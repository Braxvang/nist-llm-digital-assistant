Sections 2.3.1 and 2.3.2 discuss tag and reader characteristics in more detail. Section 2.3.3 explains the
fundamentals of tag-reader communication.

2.3.1   Tag Characteristics

The market for RFID tags includes numerous different types of tags, which differ greatly in their cost,
size, performance, and security mechanisms. Even when tags are designed to comply with a particular
standard, they are often further customized to meet the requirements of specific applications.
Understanding the major tag characteristics can help those responsible for RFID systems identify the tag
characteristics required in their environments and applications. Major characteristics of tags include:

 Identifier format,
 Power source,
 Operating frequencies,
 Functionality, and
 Form factor.
Sections 2.3.1.1 through 2.3.1.5 examine these characteristics in detail.

2.3.1.1 Identifier Format

Every tag has an identifier that is used to uniquely identify it. There are a number of data formats
available for encoding identifiers on tags. System designers often want to use identifiers that have a
standard structure, with certain groups of bits representing particular fields. A tag identifier format that is
used across many industry sectors is the Electronic Product Code (EPC). This format was developed by
the industry group EPCglobal. EPCglobal is a joint venture between Global Standards One (GS1), which
was formerly known as European Article Numbering (EAN) International, and GS1 US, which was
formerly known as the Uniform Code Council (UCC). The tag identifier format consists of four data
fields:

 The Header, which specifies the EPC type,
