       NIST SP 800-63-4 ipd                                               Digital Identity Guidelines

1288   to excessive harm, organizations should assess whether lower-assurance identity proofing
1289   processes would be appropriate.
1290   The result of this process, including any additional tailoring, is the initial assessment
1291   of the IAL, which will be assessed against additional potential impacts as described in
1292   Sec. 5.3.

1293   5.2.3.2. Selecting Initial AAL
1294   The AAL reflects the level of assurance from the authentication process that the claimant
1295   is who they claim to be. Organizations SHALL use a risk-based approach to select
1296   the most appropriate authentication requirements for their RP application. The impact
1297   analysis described in Sec. 5.1.3 informs the selection of the initial AAL selection. This
1298   initial selection SHALL be tailored, as described in Sec. 5.3, based on mission needs, risk
1299   tolerance, and potential impacts to privacy, equity, and usability, before making a final
1300   AAL determination.
1301   The AAL selection does not mean the RP application owner will need to issue
1302   authenticators themselves.
1303   The initial AAL SHALL be assessed based on the potential impacts of authentication
1304   failures. As described in Sec. 5.1, potential impacts SHALL be considered from the
1305   perspective of the organization, individuals, other organizations, and the nation, for harms
1306   incurred through the use or operation of the RP application, as the level of harm from a
1307   failure could vary significantly across these entities. Organizations SHOULD consider
1308   the worst-case when identifying the overall impact level of the RP application, but may
1309   use risk management processes to tailor their initial selection when there are differing
1310   impacts.
1311   When assessing the overall impact level of the RP application, the organization SHOULD
1312   consider impacts to mission delivery separately from other impact categories. Potential
1313   failures in the authentication process that could lead to harms in mission delivery should
1314   be assessed by the organization to determine if the associated impacts would be mitigated
1315   or exacerbated by the implementation of more rigorous authentication controls. As such,
1316   the organization MAY exclude the mission delivery category when initially identifying
1317   the overall impact level of the RP application, as these impacts will need to be considered
1318   in the tailoring process.
1319   The overall impact level assessed by the organization leads to a preliminary selection of
1320   the AAL from which further tailoring may be done:
1321       • Low impact: AAL1
1322       • Moderate impact: AAL2
1323       • High impact: AAL3
