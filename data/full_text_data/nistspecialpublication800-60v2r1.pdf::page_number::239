infrastructures, key national assets, or human life. In such cases, the confidentiality impact may
be high.

There are some cases for which construction information includes classified or other national
security information. Such cases are outside the scope of this guideline.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for construction information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of construction information depends
primarily on the criticality of the information. Typically, the effects of modification or deletion
of construction information are limited with respect to agency missions or assets.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
construction information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to construction information. The nature of
most government construction processes is tolerant of reasonable delays.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
construction information is low.

D.22.3 Public Resources, Facility and Infrastructure Management Information Type

Public Resources, Facility and Infrastructure Management involves the management and
maintenance of government-owned capital goods and resources (natural or otherwise) on behalf
of the public, usually with benefits to the community at large as well as to the direct user.
Examples of facilities and infrastructure include schools, roads, bridges, dams, harbors, and
public buildings. Examples of resources include parks, cultural artifacts and art, endangered
species, oil reserves, etc. The following security categorization is recommended for the public
resources, facilities, and infrastructure management information type:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of public resources,
facilities, and infrastructure management information on the abilities of responsible agencies to
manage and maintain government-owned capital goods and resources (natural or otherwise) on
behalf of the public, usually with benefits to the community at large as well as to the direct user.
In most cases, the consequences of unauthorized disclosure of public resources, facilities, and
