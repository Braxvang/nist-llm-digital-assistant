                                         Abstract

This Recommendation specifies the Galois/Counter Mode (GCM), an algorithm for
authenticated encryption with associated data, and its specialization, GMAC, for generating a
message authentication code (MAC) on data that is not encrypted. GCM and GMAC are modes
of operation for an underlying approved symmetric key block cipher.

KEY WORDS: authenticated encryption; authentication; block cipher; confidentiality,
cryptography; encryption; information security; mode of operation.
