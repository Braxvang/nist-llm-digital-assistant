                                              Information Security Program Questions

    Each question should be answered for each level of IT Security maturity. Each column represents an IT Security Maturity
Level. For the “Policy” maturity level, to answer “Yes,” the topic should be documented in agency policy. For the “Procedures”
maturity level, to answer “Yes,” the topic should be documented in detailed procedures. For the “Implemented” maturity level,
to answer “Yes,” the implementation is verified by examining the procedures and program area documentation, and
interviewing key personnel to determine that the procedures are implemented. For the “Tested” maturity level, to answer
“Yes,” documents should be examined and interviews should be conducted to verify that the policies and procedures for the
question are implemented and operating as intended and provide the desired level of security. For the “Integrated” maturity
level, to answer “Yes,” the policies, procedures, implementation, and testing are continually monitored and improvements are
made as a normal business process of the agency.
