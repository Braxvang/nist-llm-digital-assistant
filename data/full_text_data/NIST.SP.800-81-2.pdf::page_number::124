extension and the DO bit [RFC4035], and supports the RR types and message header bits defined in this
document set.

DNSSEC-Aware Recursive Name Server: An entity that acts in both the DNSSEC-aware name server
and DNSSEC-aware resolver roles. A more cumbersome equivalent phrase would be “a DNSSEC-aware
name server that offers recursive service.” Also sometimes referred to as a “security-aware caching name
server.”

DNSSEC-Aware Resolver: An entity acting in the role of a resolver (defined in section 2.4 of
[RFC4033]) that understands the DNS security extensions. In particular, a DNSSEC-aware resolver is an
entity that sends DNS queries, receives DNS responses, and understands the DNSSEC specification, even
if it is incapable of performing validation.

DNSSEC-Aware Stub Resolver: An entity acting in the role of a stub resolver that has an understanding
of the DNS security extensions. DNSSEC-aware stub resolvers may be either “validating” or
“nonvalidating,” depending on whether the stub resolver attempts to verify DNSSEC signatures on its
own or trusts a friendly DNSSEC-aware name server to do so. See also “validating stub resolver” and
“nonvalidating stub resolver.”

Island of Security: A signed, delegated zone that does not have an authentication chain from its
delegating parent. That is, there is no DS RR containing a hash of a DNSKEY RR for the island in its
delegating parent zone. An island of security is served by DNSSEC-aware name servers and may provide
authentication chains to any delegated child zones. Responses from an island of security or its
descendents can be authenticated only if its authentication keys can be authenticated by some trusted
means out of band from the DNS protocol.

Key Rollover: The process of generating and using a new key (symmetric or asymmetric key pair) to
replace one already in use. Rollover is done because a key has been compromised or is vulnerable to
compromise as a result of use and age.

Key Signing Key (KSK): An authentication key that corresponds to a private key used to sign one or
more other authentication keys for a given zone. Typically, the private key corresponding to a key signing
key will sign a zone signing key, which in turn has a corresponding private key that will sign other zone
data. See also “zone signing key.”

Nonvalidating DNSSEC-Aware Stub Resolver: A DNSSEC-aware stub resolver that trusts one or more
DNSSEC-aware recursive name servers to perform most of the tasks discussed in this document set on its
behalf. In particular, a nonvalidating DNSSEC-aware stub resolver is an entity that sends DNS queries,
receives DNS responses, and is capable of establishing an appropriately secured channel to a DNSSEC-
aware recursive name server that will provide these services on behalf of the DNSSEC-aware stub
resolver. See also “DNSSEC-aware stub resolver” and “validating DNSSEC-aware stub resolver.”

Nonvalidating Stub Resolver: A less tedious term for a nonvalidating DNSSEC-aware stub resolver.

Signed Zone: A zone whose RRsets are signed and which contains properly constructed DNSKEY,
Resource Record Signature (RRSIG), Next Secure (NSEC), and (optionally) DS records.

Trust Anchor: A configured DNSKEY RR or DS RR hash of a DNSKEY RR. A validating DNSSEC-
aware resolver uses this public key or hash as a starting point for building the authentication chain to a
signed DNS response. In general, a validating resolver will need to obtain the initial values of its trust
anchors via some secure or trusted means outside the DNS protocol. The presence of a trust anchor also
