                                                                                               A communication channel is a medium by which data is transmitted (e.g., physical via Universal

                                                                                                     2. Since data is the ‚Äúblood‚Äù of a NoT, communication channels are the ‚Äúveins‚Äù and

                                                                                                        We talk more about the role of snapshots in time in Section 3.

                                                                                                     3. Communication channels will have a physical or virtual aspect to them, or both.
                                                                                                        Protocols and associated implementations provide a virtual dimension. Wires provide a
