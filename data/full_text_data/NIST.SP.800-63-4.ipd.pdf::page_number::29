730   4.3.1. Authenticators
731   The classic paradigm for authentication systems identifies three factors as the
732   cornerstones of authentication:
733       • Something you know (e.g., a password)
734       • Something you have (e.g., an ID badge or a cryptographic key)
735       • Something you are (e.g., a fingerprint or other biometric characteristic data)
736   Single-factor authentication requires only one of the above factors, most often
737   “something you know”. Multiple instances of the same factor still constitute single-factor
738   authentication. For example, a user generated PIN and a password do not constitute two
739   factors as they are both “something you know.” Multi-factor authentication (MFA) refers
740   to the use of more than one distinct factor. For the purposes of these guidelines, using two
741   factors is adequate to meet the highest security requirements. Other types of information,
742   such as location data or device identity, may also be used by a verifier to evaluate the risk
743   in a claimed identity but they are not considered authentication factors.
744   In digital authentication, the claimant possesses and controls one or more authenticators.
745   The authenticators will have been bound with the subscriber account. The authenticators
746   contain secrets the claimant can use to prove they are a legitimate subscriber. The
747   claimant authenticates to a system or application over a network by demonstrating they
748   have possession and control of the authenticator. Once authenticated, the claimant is
749   referred to as a subscriber.
750   The secrets contained in an authenticator are based on either key pairs (asymmetric
751   cryptographic keys) or shared secrets (including symmetric cryptographic keys and
752   memorized secrets). Asymmetric key pairs are comprised of a public key and a related
753   private key. The private key is stored on the authenticator and is only available for
754   use by the claimant who possesses and controls the authenticators. A verifier that has
755   the subscriber’s public key, for example through a public key certificate, can use an
756   authentication protocol to verify the claimant has possession and control of the associated
757   private key contained in the authenticators and, therefore, is a subscriber.
758   As mentioned above, shared secrets stored on an authenticator may be either symmetric
759   keys or memorized secrets (e.g., passwords and PINs). While both keys and memorized
760   secrets can be used in similar protocols, one important difference between the two is
761   how they relate to the claimant. Symmetric keys are generally chosen at random and
762   are complex and long enough to thwart network-based guessing attacks, and stored in
763   hardware or software that the subscriber controls. Memorized secrets typically have fewer
