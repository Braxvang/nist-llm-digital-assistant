NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1                                                Guidelines for Media Sanitization


included in Appendix E. These characteristics can be used to drive the types of questions that
media users should ask vendors, but ideally this information would be made readily available by
vendors so that it can be easily retrieved by users to facilitate informed risk based sanitization
decisions. For example, knowing the coercivity of the media can help a user decide whether or
not the available degausser(s) can effectively degauss the media.

 2.5 Types of Sanitization

Regarding sanitization, the principal concern is ensuring that data is not unintentionally released.
Data is stored on media, which is connected to a system. This guidance focuses on the media
sanitization component, which is simply data sanitization applied to a representation of the data
as stored on a specific media type. Other potential concern areas exist as part of the system, such
as for monitors, which may have sensitive data burned into the screen. Sensitive data stored in
areas of the system other than storage media (such as on monitor screens) are not addressed by
this document.

When media is repurposed or reaches end of life, the organization executes the system life cycle
sanitization decision for the information on the media. For example, a mass-produced
commercial software program contained on a DVD in an unopened package is unlikely to
contain confidential data. Therefore, the decision may be made to simply dispose of the media
without applying any sanitization technique. Alternatively, an organization is substantially more
likely to decide that a hard drive from a system that processed PII needs sanitization prior to
Disposal.

Disposal without sanitization should be considered only if information disclosure would have no
impact on organizational mission, would not result in damage to organizational assets, and would
not result in financial loss or harm to any individuals.

The security categorization of the information, along with internal environmental factors, should
drive the decisions on how to deal with the media. The key is to first think in terms of
information confidentiality, then apply considerations based on media type.

In organizations, information exists that is not associated with any categorized system. This
information is often hard copy internal communications such as memoranda, white papers, and
presentations. Sometimes this information may be considered sensitive. Examples may include
internal disciplinary letters, financial or salary negotiations, or strategy meeting minutes.
Organizations should label these media with their internal operating confidentiality levels and
associate a type of sanitization described in this publication.

Sanitization is a process to render access to target data (the data subject to the sanitization
technique) on the media infeasible for a given level of recovery effort. The level of effort applied
when attempting to retrieve data may range widely. For example, a party may attempt simple
keyboard attacks without the use of specialized tools, skills, or knowledge of the media
characteristics. On the other end of the spectrum, a party may have extensive capabilities and be
able to apply state of the art laboratory techniques.
