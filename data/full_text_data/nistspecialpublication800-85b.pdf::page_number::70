9.2.2.8   Biometric Data Type
Purpose                 Validates that the CBEFF biometric data type encoding value shall be
                        b001xxxxx, which corresponds to the raw biometric data.

Precondition(s)         1. All required sample finger images have been recorded.
                        2. All templates have been generated and stored on the PIV card.
                        3. A valid PIV card is inserted into the contact reader.
                        4. A valid PC/SC connection exists between the test application and the
                           contact reader.
                        5. The test application is currently connected to the card application which
                           is accessible through card handle.
                        6. A valid Card Holder Facial Image object is present on the PIV card.
                        7. Security conditions to read the object are met.
Test Scenario           1. Set cardHandle := <<valid card handle>>
                        2. Set OID := <<Card Holder Facial Image
                           (2.16.840.1.101.3.7.2.96.48)>>
                        3. Call pivGetData w/
                            • (IN) cardHandle
                              • (IN) OID
                              • (OUT) data
                        4. Extract the Biometric Data Type field of CBEFF Header.
                        5. Extract the value field for tag 0xBC, extract the first
                           88 bytes (CBEFF Header) and read the Biometric Data Type
                           field (based on its position) in CBEFF Header.
Expected Result(s) The Biometric Data Type field has a value of b001xxxxx.

9.2.2.9   Biometric Data Quality
Purpose                 Validates that the biometric data quality field carries valid values

Precondition(s)         1. A valid PIV card is inserted into the contact reader.
                        2. A valid PC/SC connection exists between the test application and
                            the contact reader.
                        3. The test application is currently connected to the card application
                             which is accessible through card handle.
                        4. A valid Card Holder Facial Image object is present on the PIV card.
                        5. Security conditions to read the object are met.
