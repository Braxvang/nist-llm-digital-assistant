GUIDELINES ON ELECTRONIC MAIL SECURITY



Once the mail server is processing the message, several events occur: recipient server identification,
connection establishment, and message transmission. Using Domain Name System (DNS) services, the
sender’s mail server determines the mail server(s) for the recipient(s). Then, the server opens up a
connection(s) to the recipient mail server(s) and sends the message employing a process similar to that
used by the originating client. At this point, one of two events could occur. If the sender’s and
recipient’s mailboxes are located on the same mail server, the message is delivered using a local delivery
agent (LDA). If the sender’s and recipient’s mailboxes are located on different mail servers, the send
process is repeated from one MTA to another until the message reaches the recipient’s mailbox.

When the LDA has control of the message, a number of possible events may occur. Depending on the
configuration, the LDA could deliver the message or process the message based on a predefined message
filter before delivery (filtering can be based on a number of message properties and is discussed in detail
in Section 6.2.2). Once the message is delivered, it is placed in the recipient’s mailbox where it is stored
until the recipient performs some action on it (e.g., read, delete) using the MUA. Figure 2.1 illustrates the
flow of the message through the various mail components discussed previously. This is the general
process of sending an email.

2.2   Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions

RFC 2822 provides a standard for transmitting messages containing textual content; however, it does not
address messages that contain attachments, such as a mail message with a word processing document or
photo included. Making use of the headers in an RFC 2822 message, the Multipurpose Internet Mail
Extensions (MIME) provide almost endless possibilities to describe the structure of rich message content.
MIME uses the convention of content-type/subtype pairs to specify the native representation or encoding
of associated data. Examples of content types include the following:

 Audio – for transmitting audio or voice data.
 Application – used to transmit application data or binary data.
 Image – for transmitting still image (picture) data.
 Message – for encapsulating another mail message.
 Multipart – used to combine several message body parts, possibly of differing types of data, into a
  single message.
