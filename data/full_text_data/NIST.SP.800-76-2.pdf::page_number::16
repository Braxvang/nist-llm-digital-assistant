3.2.2       Training of PIV fingerprint collection staff
Quality of the biometric data is critical to the success of a biometric application. This is particularly true for enrollment
data that typically persists for years. As enrollment is an attended operation, the operator is important to the
collection of high quality data. Attending staff should be trained to maintain and clean the sensor, and to collect in
accordance with manufacturer's guidance and this document. Specifically Agencies shall apprise staff that:
―     Low humidity - typical in winter – causes dry fingers from which good images are more difficult to collect. This risk
      can be mitigated by measurement and appropriate use of supplemental humidification. Fingers may be lightly
      moisturized.
―     Exposure of biometric equipment to bright light sources, such as direct sunlight, is generally adverse for
      collection of fingerprints.
―     The background check can be defeated by mutilation of the fingerprints e.g.,either temporarily (e.g.,by burns or
      abrasives) or permanently (e.g.,by surgical means). In addition certain medications can cause loss of fingerprint
      ridge structure. It is recommended that collection of fingerprints from applicants with finger injuries be delayed
      until the fingers heal.

3.2.3       Monitoring overall enrollment quality
In order to track enrollment quality over time, a numerical summary of operational quality may be computed as a
management indicator. If computed, this summary shall be computed from the NFIQ values of primary fingers of all
PIV Card applicants processed in each calendar month. If computed, the summary shall be computed using the
method of NIST Interagency Report 7422 [NFIQ SUMMARY] which uses a simple formula to aggregate NFIQ values.
This calculation is readily automated.
Managers can track this over time, across collection sites or stations, over different populations (e.g., contractors vs.
employees), across functions (PIV issuance vs. re-issuance), or even across fingers. Managers can use aggregated
quality indicators as a tool to identify fingerprint collection problems. These may be due to changes in the physical
environment or unintended changes in operating procedures.

3.3     Fingerprint image format for images retained by agencies
This Section specifies a common data format record for the retention of the fingerprint images collected in Sub-
section 3.2. Specifically any fingerprint images enrolled or otherwise retained by agencies shall be formatted
according to the INCITS 381-2004 finger image based interchange format standard [FINGSTD]. This set should include
single-finger images. These shall be obtained by segmentation of the plain multi-finger images gathered in
accordance with Options 1, 2 or 3 of Table 2, and the single plain thumb impressions from presentations 4 & 5 of
Options 2 and 3. These images shall be placed into a single [FINGSTD] record. The record may also include the
associated multi-finger plain impressions and the rolled images. This document ([800-76]) does not specify uses for
any single-finger rolled images gathered according to Options 2 or 3 of Table 2. The record shall be wrapped in the
CBEFF structure described in Section 9. Agencies may encrypt this data per the provisions of Section 9, Table 14, Note
2.
Table 4 is a clause-by-clause profile of [FINGSTD] for PIV. Its structure is as follows.
―     Rows 1-10 give normative content in INCITS 381 on the kind of images to be acquired.
―     Row 11 requires the CBEFF structure of Section 9 (i.e., header of Table 14, digital signature of Section 9.3).
―     Rows 12-27 give PIV specifications for the fields of the General Record Header of [FINGSTD, Table 2]. These are
      common to all images in the record.
―     Similarly, rows 28-36 provide specifications for the Finger Image Header Record in Table 4 of [FINGSTD]. The "PIV
      Conformance" column provides PIV specific practice and parameter defaults of the standard.
While INCITS 381 has been revised by the INCITS M1 committee, the 2004 edition is sufficient for PIV so the 2009
revision is irrelevant to PIV; however implementations should respect the version number on Line 14 of Table 4.
