507   At FAL3, the RP is responsible for verifying the presentation of the bound authenticator,
508   as discussed in [SP800-63C]. Note that the bound authenticator could also be a PIV
509   credential, but it is not necessary for it to be one (see Sec. 4.1.3 for more information
510   about bound authenticators).
