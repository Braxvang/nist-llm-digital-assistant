                                                                                        GUIDE TO GENERAL SERVER SECURITY



deploying servers in higher-security environments are likely to need to employ more restrictive security
controls than the recommendations in this publication. For servers in legacy environments, organizations
should secure them as if they were in a typical enterprise environment or a higher-security environment,
as appropriate, and make the minimum possible security control alterations to facilitate legacy access.

2.2     Security Categorization of Information and Information Systems

The classic model for information security defines three objectives of security: maintaining
confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Confidentiality refers to protecting information from being
accessed by unauthorized parties. Integrity refers to ensuring the authenticity of information—that
information is not altered, and that the source of the information is genuine. Availability means that
information is accessible by authorized users. Each objective addresses a different aspect of providing
protection for information.

Determining how strongly a system needs to be protected is based largely on the type of information that
the system processes and stores. For example, a system containing medical records probably needs much
stronger protection than a computer only used for viewing publicly released documents. This is not to
imply that the second system does not need protection; every system needs to be protected, but the level
of protection may vary based on the value of the system and its data. Federal Information Processing
Standards (FIPS) Publication (PUB) 199, Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information
and Information System establishes criteria for determining the security category of a system. 3 FIPS PUB
199 defines three security categories—low, moderate, and high—based on the potential impact of a
security breach involving a particular system:

 “The potential impact is LOW if the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability could be expected
  to have a limited adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals. A
  limited adverse effect means that, for example, the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability
  might (i) cause a degradation in mission capability to an extent and duration that the organization is
  able to perform its primary functions, but the effectiveness of the functions is noticeably reduced; (ii)
  result in minor damage to organizational assets; (iii) result in minor financial loss; or (iv) result in
  minor harm to individuals.
 The potential impact is MODERATE if the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability could be
  expected to have a serious adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, or
  individuals. A serious adverse effect means that, for example, the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or
  availability might (i) cause a significant degradation in mission capability to an extent and duration
  that the organization is able to perform its primary functions, but the effectiveness of the functions is
  significantly reduced; (ii) result in significant damage to organizational assets; (iii) result in
  significant financial loss; or (iv) result in significant harm to individuals that does not involve loss of
  life or serious life threatening injuries.
 The potential impact is HIGH if the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability could be expected
  to have a severe or catastrophic adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, or
  individuals. A severe or catastrophic adverse effect means that, for example, the loss of
  confidentiality, integrity, or availability might (i) cause a severe degradation in or loss of mission
  capability to an extent and duration that the organization is not able to perform one or more of its
  primary functions; (ii) result in major damage to organizational assets; (iii) result in major financial
  loss; or (iv) result in severe or catastrophic harm to individuals involving loss of life or serious life
  threatening injuries.”
