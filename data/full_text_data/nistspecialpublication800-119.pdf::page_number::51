        Valid Address. A preferred or deprecated address. A valid address may appear as the source
         or destination address of a packet, and the internet routing system is expected to deliver
         packets sent to a valid address to their intended recipients.

        Invalid Address. An address that is not assigned to any interface. A valid address becomes
         invalid when its valid lifetime expires. Invalid addresses should not appear as the destination
         or source address of a packet. In the former case, the Internet routing system will be unable to
         deliver the packet; in the latter case the recipient of the packet will be unable to respond to it.

  3.5.5   Path Maximum Transmission Unit (PMTU) Discovery

With IPv4, a router can fragment a packet when the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) of the next link
is smaller than the packet it has to send. The router does this by slicing the packet to fit into the smaller
MTU and sending it out as a series of fragments. The packet is then reassembled at the final destination,
which can be very inefficient. It can also introduce additional traffic into the network, in the form of an
increased number of smaller-than-necessary packets, as well as necessitating re-transmission of packets if
all of the fragments do not arrive within a specific time interval. With IPv6, routers do not fragment
packets; instead, the sender discovers the maximum packet size by using Path Maximum Transmission
Unit (or PMTU) for the entire path. PMTU discovery is the process by which each node on the network
establishes an important IPv6 parameter for a given communication session. The PMTU establishes the
maximum packet size, measured in bytes, which may be carried across a sequence of network nodes.
PMTU for a local network segment can be determined directly from the MTU in RA messages.

The IPv6 specification calls for a MTU of at least 1280 bytes. In other words, all links must accept
packets of any size up through 1280 bytes. The minimum recommended MTU for IPv6 is 1500 bytes.
The IPv6 specification does not allow intermediate nodes (such as routers) to fragment packets in transit.
Instead, PMTU is determined dynamically and maintained throughout each communication session. By
disallowing fragmentation by intermediary devices, IPv6 achieves a level of efficiency that is generally
not available under IPv4. Intermediate nodes operate faster and with less processing overhead by not
