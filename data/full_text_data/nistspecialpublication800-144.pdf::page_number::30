    relied on another cloud provider to host historical data, and on yet another cloud provider
    to host its newly launched application and database, direct responsibility for the cause of
    the failure was unclear and never resolved [Bro08].

   Visibility. Continuous monitoring of information security requires maintaining ongoing
    awareness of security controls, vulnerabilities, and threats to support risk management
    decisions [Dem10]. Collecting and analyzing available data about the state of the system
    should be done regularly and as often as needed by the organization to manage security
    and privacy risks, as appropriate for each level of the organization involved in decision
    making. Transition to public cloud services entails a transfer of responsibility to the
    cloud provider for securing portions of the system on which the organization’s data and
    applications operate. To fulfill the obligations of continuous monitoring, the organization
    is dependent on the cloud provider, whose cooperation is essential, since aspects of the
    computing environment are under the cloud provider’s complete control.

    Knowledge of a cloud provider’s security measures is also needed for the organization to
    conduct risk management. For example, the process of identifying vulnerabilities should
    include an analysis of the system security features and the security controls used to
    protect the cloud environment [Sto02]. Cloud providers can be reluctant to provide
    details of their security and privacy measures and status, however, since such information
    is often considered proprietary and might otherwise be used to devise an avenue of
    attack. Moreover, detailed network and system level monitoring by a cloud consumer is
    generally not part of most service arrangements, limiting visibility and the means to audit
    operations directly (e.g., [Bro09, Dig08, Met09]). While notification tools and Web-
    based dashboards are typically made available to consumers to monitor status, they can
    lack sufficient detail and may themselves suffer disruption during a system outage
    [Goo09a, Ker11, Per11].

    Transparency in the way the cloud provider operates, including the provisioning of
    composite services, is a vital ingredient for effective oversight over system security and
    privacy by an organization. To ensure that policy and procedures are being enforced
    throughout the system lifecycle, service arrangements should include some means for the
    organization to gain visibility into the security controls and processes employed by the
    cloud provider and their performance over time. For example, the service agreement
    could include the right to audit controls via a third party, as a way to validate control
    aspects that are not otherwise accessible or assessable by the consumer. Ideally, the
    consumer would have control over aspects of the means of visibility to accommodate its
    needs, such as the threshold for alerts and notifications, and the level of detail and
    schedule of reports.

   Ancillary Data. While the focus of attention in cloud computing is mainly on protecting
    application data, cloud providers also hold significant details about the accounts of cloud
    consumers that could be compromised and used in subsequent attacks. Payment
    information is one example; other, more subtle types of information, can also be
    involved. For example, a database of contact information stolen from a SaaS cloud
    provider, via a targeted phishing attack against one of its employees, was used in turn to
