      NIST SP 800-157r1 ipd                            Derived PIV Credentials (Initial Public Draft)
      January 2023


629   3.2. Non-PKI-based Derived PIV Credentials
630   When used, non-PKI-based credentials SHALL be used to authenticate only to the home
631   agency of the associated PIV Card.

632   3.2.1. Allowable Authenticator Types
633   Phishing-resistant multi-factor or single-factor cryptographic authenticators SHALL be
634   used for non-PKI-based derived PIV authentication. A multi-factor cryptographic device
635   authenticator as specified in [SP800-63B] Sec. 5.1.9.1 or a single-factor cryptographic
636   device authenticator as specified in [SP800-63B] Sec. 5.1.7.1 SHALL be used for derived
637   PIV authentication at AAL3. Either a cryptographic device authenticator or a multi-factor
638   cryptographic software authenticator as specified in [SP800-63B] Sec. 5.1.8.1 or a single-
639   factor cryptographic software authenticator as specified in [SP800-63B] Sec. 5.1.6.1
640    SHALL be used for derived PIV authentication at AAL2. All single-factor authenticators
641    SHALL be used in conjunction with a memorized secret that meets the requirements of
642   [SP800-63B] Sec. 5.1.1.1.

643   3.2.2. Cryptographic SpeciÔ¨Åcations
644   Authenticators used as non-PKI-based derived PIV credentials SHALL meet the
645   cryptographic requirements specified in [SP800-63B] Sec. 5.1 for the corresponding
646   authenticator type.

647   3.2.3. Activation Data
648   Activation of a multi-factor authenticator being used as a derived PIV credential using a
649   memorized secret SHALL meet the requirements of [SP800-63B] Sec. 5.2.11. Activation
650   using a biometric characteristic SHALL meet the requirements of [SP800-63B]
651   Sec. 5.2.3. Unlocking the device that houses the authenticator (e.g., mobile phone)
652    SHALL NOT be considered activation of the authenticator. Separate entry of the
653   activation secret or presentation of a biometric factor SHALL be performed to use the
654   authenticator. The same activation secret or biometric factor used to unlock the device
655    MAY be used to activate the authenticator.

656   If the memorized secret used for activation or the biometric activation factor needs to be
657   changed, entry of the current activation secret SHALL be required to change the value.
658   If the activation secret has been forgotten or the permitted number of consecutive wrong
659   attempts has been reached, the activation secret and attempt counter MAY be reset by
660   centralized management by the home agency. If centralized reset is not available, the
661   authenticator SHALL be reset and require re-binding to the PIV identity account, as
662   described in Sec. 3.3.
