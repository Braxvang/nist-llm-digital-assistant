2265   Sample Authorization Decision Letter (Denial of Authorization to Operate)
2266   From: Designated Authorizing Official                        Date:
2267   To: Enterprise Identity Management Official
2268   Subject: Authorization Decision for [PCI/DPCI]
2269   After reviewing the results of the assessment of [ISSUER NAME] and the supporting evidence
2270   provided in the associated authorization package, I have determined that the requirements
2271   identified in [FIPS201] and the organization’s policies, regulations, and standards are not being
2272   met by the [ISSUER]. Accordingly, I am issuing a denial of authorization to operate (DATO) to
2273   the [ISSUER] and its issuing facilities. The [ISSUER] is not authorized and [MAY NOT BE
2274   PLACED INTO OPERATION OR ALL CURRENT OPERATIONS MUST BE HALTED].
2275   The corrective actions plan (CAP) is to be pursued immediately to ensure that proactive
2276   measures are taken to correct the deficiencies found during the assessment. Reauthorization is to
2277   be initiated at the earliest opportunity to determine the effectiveness of correcting the
2278   deficiencies.
2279   A copy of this letter and all supporting authorization documentation shall be retained in
2280   accordance with the organization’s record retention schedule.
