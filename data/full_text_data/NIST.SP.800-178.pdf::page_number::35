                                                                                               NGAC’s access control data is comprised of basic elements, containers, and configurable
                                                                                               relations. While XACML uses the terms subject, action, and resource, NGAC uses the terms
                                                                                               user, operation, and object with similar meanings. In addition to these, NGAC includes
                                                                                               processes, administrative operations, and policy classes. Like XACML, NGAC recognizes user
                                                                                               and object attributes; however, it treats attributes along with policy class entities as containers.
                                                                                               These containers are instrumental in both formulating and administering policies and attributes.

                                                                                               NGAC treats users and processes as independent but related entities. NGAC processes can be
                                                                                               thought of as simple representations of operating system processes. They have an id, memory,
                                                                                               and descriptors for resource allocations (e.g., “handles”). Like an operating system, an NGAC
                                                                                               process can utilize system resources (e.g., clipboard) for inter-process communication. Processes
                                                                                               through which a user attempts access take on the same attributes as the invoking user.

                                                                                               Although an XACML resource is similar to an NGAC object, NGAC uses the term object as an
                                                                                               indirect reference to its data content. Given this one-to-one correspondence, the object can also
                                                                                               be identified as an object attribute with the same name. The set of objects reflects entities
                                                                                               needing protection, such as files, clipboards, email messages, and record fields.

                                                                                               Similar to an XACML subject attribute value, NGAC user containers can represent roles,
                                                                                               affiliations, or other common characteristics pertinent to policy, such as security clearances.

                                                                                               Object containers (attributes) characterize data and other resources by identifying collections of
                                                                                               objects, such as those associated with certain projects, applications, or security classifications.
                                                                                               Object containers can also represent compound objects, such as folders, inboxes, table columns,
                                                                                               or rows, to satisfy the requirements of different data services. Policy class containers are used to
                                                                                               group and characterize collections of policy or data services at a broad level, with each container
                                                                                               representing a distinct set of related policy elements. Every user, user attribute, and object
                                                                                               attribute must be contained in at least one policy class. Policy classes can be mutually exclusive
                                                                                               or overlap to various degrees to meet a wide range of policy requirements.

                                                                                               NGAC recognizes a generic set of operations that include basic input and output operations (i.e.,
