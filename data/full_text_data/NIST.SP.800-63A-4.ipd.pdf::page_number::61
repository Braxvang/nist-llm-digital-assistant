       NIST SP 800-63A-4 ipd                                             Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022                                               Enrollment and Identity Proofing


1608      • Set user expectations regarding the outcome of the enrollment session as prior
1609        identity verification experiences may drive their expectations (e.g., receiving a
1610        driver’s license in person, receiving a passport in the mail).
1611      • Clearly indicate whether users will receive an authenticator immediately at the end
1612        of a successful enrollment session, if users have to schedule an appointment to pick
1613        it up in person, or if users will receive it in the mail and when they can expect to
1614        receive it.
1615      • During the enrollment session, there are several requirements to provide users with
1616        explicit notice at the time of identity proofing, such as what data will be retained on
1617        record by the CSP (see Sec. 5.1 and Sec. 8 for detailed requirements on notices). If
1618        CSPs seek consent from a user for additional attributes or uses of their attributes for
1619        any purpose other than identity proofing, authentication, authorization or attribute
1620        assertions, per 4.2 requirement (5), make CSPs aware that requesting additional
1621        attributes or uses may be unexpected or may make users uncomfortable. If users
1622        do not perceive benefit(s) to the additional collection or uses, but perceive extra
1623        risk, they may be unwilling or hesitant to provide consent or continue the process.
1624        Provide users with explicit notice of the additional requirements.
1625      • If an enrollment code is issued:
1626           – Notify users in advance that they will receive an enrollment code, when to
1627             expect it, the length of time for which the code is valid, and how it will arrive
1628             (e.g., physical mail, SMS, landline telephone, email, or physical mailing
1629             address).
1630           – When an enrollment code is delivered to a user, include instructions on how
1631             to use the code, and the length of time for which the code is valid. This
1632             is especially important given the short validity timeframes specified in
1633             Sec. 5.1.6.
1634           – If issuing a machine-readable optical label, such as a QR Code (see
1635             Sec. 5.1.6), provide users with information on how to obtain QR code
1636             scanning capabilities (e.g., acceptable QR code applications).
1637           – Inform users that they will be required to repeat the enrollment process if
1638             enrollment codes expire or are lost before use.
1639           – Provide users with alternative options as not all users are able to access and
1640             use technology equitably. For example, users may not have the technology
1641             needed for this approach to be feasible.
1642      • At the end of the enrollment session,
1643           – If enrollment is successful, send users confirmation regarding the successful
1644             enrollment and information on next steps (e.g., when and where to pick up
1645             their authenticator, when it will arrive in the mail).
