2.9   Summary

This section introduced the underlying concepts of Web services and the security challenges they face.
The challenges have five dimensions:

 Secure messaging. Ensure that SOAP messages traversing networks are not viewed or modified by
  attackers. WS-Security and WS-SecureConversation provide the confidentiality and integrity
  services necessary.
 Protection of resources. Ensure that individual Web services are adequately protected through
  appropriate identification, authentication, and access control mechanisms. There is a plethora of
  standards available for controlling access to Web services.
 Negotiation of contracts. To truly meet the goals of SOA and automate business processes, Web
  services should be capable of negotiating business contracts as well as the QoP and QoS of the
  associated transactions. While this remains a hard problem, standards are emerging to address
  portions of contract negotiation—particularly in the QoP and QoS field.
 Trust management. One of the underlying principles of security is ensuring that all entities involved
  in a transaction trust one another. To this end, Web services support a variety of trust models that can
  be used to enable Web services to trust the identities of entities within the SOA.
 Security properties. All Web service security processes, tools, and techniques rely on secure
  implementation. A vulnerable Web service may allow attackers to bypass many—if not all—of the
  security mechanisms discussed in Section 3.
To adequately meet the challenges posed by each security dimension, the Web services community has
developed a large number of standards. Each standard meets a different security challenge faced by Web
services. WS-Security and SSL/TLS, for example, address the secure messaging domain, while WS-
Federation and Liberty Identity Federation Framework (IDFF) address the trust management domain.
Some security domains, such as messaging and trust management, are addressed by competing or
overlapping standards, while others, such as the security properties domain, require further research
within the community to fully address the challenges faced. Some standards address relevant security
properties. For example, WS-Reliability and WS-ReliableMessaging provide some QoS functionality,
allowing guaranteed message passing even if the network is under attack. More standards and technology
are necessary to provide full support for all of the necessary security properties. When determining which
Web services standards and technologies to adopt, it is important to be aware of the threats facing an
organization’s Web services and prioritize them to ensure that resources are distributed appropriately for
the Web services being secured.
