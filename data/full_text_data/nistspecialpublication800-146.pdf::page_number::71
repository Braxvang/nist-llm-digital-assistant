The current NIST baselines in SP800-53 are a starting point for cloud applications and services as well as
for the information systems that are providing those applications and services. SP800-53 offers tailoring
guidance that allows adjustments for cloud computing environments. Additional guidance will be
required at lower levels of abstraction as the current security controls in SP800-53 are written to be
technology and policy neutral.

Currently work is being undertaken to develop additional guidance. The following three key observations
are included in those findings:

 Policy and procedure related technical security controls are typically a consumer’s responsibility.
  Providers will likely offer input as to the feasibility and cost of enforcing these policies and
  procedures, especially if the provider has the responsibilities to implement them. System capability-
  related controls are the responsibility of the capability developer at build time or the administrator
  during operation. For example, account management controls for privileged users in an IaaS cloud are
  typically performed by the IaaS provider, whereas account management for user and application
  consumers of an application deployed in an IaaS environment is typically not the provider’s
  responsibility. The consumer’s organization is often fully responsible for managing the accounts,
  unless the consumer outsources the responsibility to a third-party ID management broker.
 Operational families of security controls are about policies, procedures, and processes. A consumer is
  typically responsible for the definitions and the provider shares responsibilities during execution
  (since the provider is an operational partner). However, the nature of the cooperation will affect the
  extent of the applicability of these controls; for example, a provider would need to be definitive as to
  whether regularly held security training is required or is feasible for their staff. These operational
  security controls form a checklist when a consumer is comparison-shopping for a provider as well as
  during service agreement negotiations.
 The four management class security control families mentioned in Table 6 are similar to operational
  class security controls and are the responsibility of a consumer. The provider plays a supporting role
