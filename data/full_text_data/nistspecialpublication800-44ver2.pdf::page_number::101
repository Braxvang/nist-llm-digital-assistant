                                                                    GUIDELINES ON SECURING PUBLIC WEB SERVERS



 Error Log—Each error is represented as one entry, including an explanation of the reason for this
  error report.

 Agent Log—This log contains information about the user client software used to access Web content.

 Referrer Log—This log collects information relevant to HTTP access. This includes the URL of the
  page that contained the link that the user client software followed to initiate access to the Web page.

Most Web servers support the Transfer Log, and it is usually considered the most important. Several log
formats are available for Transfer Log entries. Typically, the information is presented in plain American
Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) without special delimiters to separate the different
fields [Alle00]:

 Common Log Format (CLF)—This format stores information related to one transfer (Transfer Log)
  in the following order:

      Remote host

      Remote user identity in accordance with RFC 1413 73

      Authenticated user in accordance with the basic authentication scheme (see
         Section 7.3)

      Date

      URL requested

      Status of the request

      Number of bytes actually transferred.

 Combined Log Format—This format contains the same seven fields above. It also provides
  information normally stored in the Agent Log and the Referrer Log, along with the actual transfer.
  Keeping this information in a consolidated log format may support more effective administration.

 Extended Log Format—This format provides a way to describe all items that should be collected
  within the log file. The first two lines of the log file contain the version and the fields to be collected,
  and they appear in the log file as follows:

         #Version: 1.0
         #Fields: date time c-ip sc-bytes time-taken cs-version
         1999-08-01 02:10:57 192.0.0.2 6340 3 HTTP/1.0

         This example contains the date, time, originating address, number of bytes transmitted, time taken
         for transmission, and HTTP version.

 Other Log File Formats—Some server software provides log information in different file formats,
  such as database formats or delimiter-separated formats. Other server software provides the
