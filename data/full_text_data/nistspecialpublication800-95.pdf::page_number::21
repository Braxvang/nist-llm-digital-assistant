When invoking a Web service orchestration, the encapsulating Web service uses an orchestration engine
to define which Web services will be invoked. In contrast, when invoking a Web service choreography,
the sequence of Web services is more dynamic, and the decisions are made by the relationships defined
between individual Web services rather than by a unifying orchestration engine. Figure 2-7 illustrates
how the Web service orchestration is controlled by a single Web service.

Using the loan service example, the credit service could be implemented as a choreography. Each Web
service in the transaction is not necessarily operated by the same organization as the credit service. Each
Web service, the credit service and the individual credit bureau service, would enumerate the rules and
expectations for interacting with one another. The credit service would dynamically look up the credit
bureau service, process the information that is needed to interact with it, and then initiate a choreography
among the services.
