3.      Handling an Incident

The incident response process has several phases. The initial phase involves establishing and training an
incident response team, and acquiring the necessary tools and resources. During preparation, the
organization also attempts to limit the number of incidents that will occur by selecting and implementing
a set of controls based on the results of risk assessments. However, residual risk will inevitably persist
after controls are implemented. Detection of security breaches is thus necessary to alert the organization
whenever incidents occur. In keeping with the severity of the incident, the organization can mitigate the
impact of the incident by containing it and ultimately recovering from it. During this phase, activity often
cycles back to detection and analysis—for example, to see if additional hosts are infected by malware
while eradicating a malware incident. After the incident is adequately handled, the organization issues a
report that details the cause and cost of the incident and the steps the organization should take to prevent
future incidents. This section describes the major phases of the incident response process—preparation,
detection and analysis, containment, eradication and recovery, and post-incident activity—in detail.
Figure 3-1 illustrates the incident response life cycle.

3.1     Preparation

Incident response methodologies typically emphasize preparation—not only establishing an incident
response capability so that the organization is ready to respond to incidents, but also preventing incidents
by ensuring that systems, networks, and applications are sufficiently secure. Although the incident
response team is not typically responsible for incident prevention, it is fundamental to the success of
incident response programs. This section provides basic advice on preparing to handle incidents and on
preventing incidents.

3.1.1    Preparing to Handle Incidents

The lists below provide examples of tools and resources available that may be of value during incident
handling. These lists are intended to be a starting point for discussions about which tools and resources an
organization’s incident handlers need. For example, smartphones are one way to have resilient emergency
