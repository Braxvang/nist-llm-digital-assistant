        server. If it is necessary to use a web server for remote administration, use the
        more secure HTTPS (HTTP over SSL or TLS) protocol.

IP Phone Netmask Vulnerability

        A similar effect of the ARP Cache Vulnerability can be achieved by assigning a
        subnet mask and router address to the phone crafted to cause most or all of the
        packets it transmits to be sent to an attacker’s MAC address. Again, standard (1q
        aware) IP forwarding makes the intrusion all but undetectable.

        A firewall filtering mechanism can reduce the probability of this attack.
        Remote access to IP phones is a severe risk.

Extension to IP Address Mapping Vulnerability

        Discovering the IP address corresponding to any extension requires only calling
        that extension and getting an answer. A protocol analyzer or packet capture tool
        attached to the hub on the dialing instrument will see packets directly from the
        target instrument once the call is answered. Knowing the IP address of a
        particular extension is not a compromise in itself, but makes it easier to
        accomplish other attacks. For example, if the attacker is able to sniff packets on
        the local network used by the switch, it will be easy to pick out packets sent and
        received by a target phone. Without knowledge of the IP address of the target
        phone, the attacker’s job may be much more difficult to accomplish and require
        much longer, possibly resulting in the attack being discovered. Disabling the
        hub on the IP Phone will prevent this kind of attack. However, it is a rather
        simple task to turn the hub back on.

  A.2 Integrity Issues

       Integrity of information means that information remains unaltered by
       unauthorized users. For example, most users want to ensure that bank account
       numbers cannot be changed by anyone else, or that passwords are changed only
       by the user or an authorized security administrator. Telecommunication switches
       must protect the integrity of their system data and configuration. Because of the
       richness of feature sets available on switches, an attacker who can compromise
       the system configuration can accomplish nearly any other goal. For example, an
       ordinary extension could be re-assigned into a pool of phones that supervisors can
       listen in on or record conversations for quality control purposes. Damaging or
       deleting information about the IP network used by a VOIP switch results in an
       immediate denial of service.

       The security system itself provides the capabilities for system abuse and misuse.
       That is, compromise of the security system not only allows system abuse but also
       allows the elimination of all traceability and the insertion of trapdoors for
       intruders to use on their next visit. For this reason, the security system must be
       carefully protected.
