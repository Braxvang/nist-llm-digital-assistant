NIST SP 800-85A-4                                        PIV CARD APPLICATION & MIDDLEWARE
                                                                  INTERFACE TEST GUIDELINES

                      4. The value of the counter reference data (PUK) is recorded.
 Test Scenario        Repeat steps 1, 2, and 5 of test C.2.3.1
 Expected Result(s)   1. Step 1 referenced above returns the application property template
                         with the status word '90 00' at the end.
                      2. Steps 2 and 5 referenced above return an error status word.
 Postcondition(s)     Reference data associated with key reference is not changed. Retry
                      counter value associated with the key reference is not reset. The reset
                      counter value is unchanged.

C.2.3.3        Secure Messaging Interface
 Purpose              Validates that the RESET RETRY COUNTER command cannot be
                      issued through the secure messaging interface.
 Reference(s)         1. SP 800-73-4 Part 2, Section 3.2.3
                      2. AS05.01, AS03.07, AS05.30 through AS05.33
 Precondition(s)      1. The IUT is placed within the reading range of the contactless
                          reader.
                      2. There exists a valid PC/SC connection between the test system
                          and the contactless reader.
                      3. No other contactless card is within the proximity of the reader.
                      4. Secure messaging session keys have been established and secure
                          messaging is used in the test scenario.
                      5. The value of the counter reference data (PUK) is recorded.
 Test Scenario        1. Repeat step 1 of test C.2.3.1 without secure messaging.
                      2. Repeat steps 2 and 5 of test C.2.3.1 using the '0C' CLA
                         byte
 Expected Result(s)   1. Step 1 referenced above returns the application property template
                         with the status word '90 00' at the end.
                      2. Steps 2 and 5 referenced above return an error status word.
 Postcondition(s)     Reference data associated with key reference is not changed. Retry
                      counter value associated with the key reference is not reset. The reset
                      counter value is unchanged.


C.2.3.4       Virtual Contact Interface
 Purpose              Validates that the RESET RETRY COUNTER command cannot be
                      issued through the VCI.
 Reference(s)         1. SP 800-73-4 Part 2, Section 3.2.3
                      2. AS05.01, AS03.07, AS05.30 through AS05.33
 Precondition(s)      1. The IUT is placed within the reading range of the contactless
                          reader.
                      2. There exists a valid PC/SC connection between the test system
                          and the contactless reader.
                      3. No other contactless card is within the proximity of the reader.
