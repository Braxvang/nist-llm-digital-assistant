1.   Introduction

The U.S. Government collects, maintains, and uses many kinds of datasets. Every federal
agency creates and maintains internal datasets that are vital for fulflling its mission, such as
delivering services to citizens or ensuring regulatory compliance. There are also 13 princi-
pal federal statistical agencies, three recognized statistical units, and over 100 other federal
statistical programs that collect, compile, process, analyze, and distribute information for
statistical purposes [156, 121].
Government programs collect information from individuals and organizations for taxation,
public benefts, public health, licensing, employment, censuses, and the production of of-
fcial statistics. While privacy is integral, many individuals and organizations that provide
information to the Government do not typically have the right to opt out of such requests.
For example, people and establishments in the United States must respond to mandatory
U.S. Census Bureau surveys.
Agencies make many of their datasets available to the public. The U.S. Government
publishes data to promote commerce, scientifc research, and public transparency. Many
datasets contain some data elements that should not be made public, and it is necessary to
remove such information before making the rest of the dataset available. Some datasets
are so sensitive that they cannot be made publicly available at all but can be available on a
limited basis to qualifed, vetted researchers in protected enclaves. In some cases, agencies
may also elect to release summary statistics of sensitive data or create synthetic datasets
that resemble the original data but that have a lower disclosure risk [9, 99].
There is frequent tension between the goals of privacy protection and the release of use-
ful data to the public. One way that the Government attempts to resolve this tension is
with an offcial promise of confdentiality to individuals and organizations regarding the
information that they provide [132]. Other information is created by the Government as
a consequence of providing government services. This information – sometimes called
administrative data – is also increasingly being used and made available for statistical pur-
poses and must be protected.
A bedrock principle of offcial statistical programs is that data provided to the Government
should generally remain confdential and not be used in a way that would pose a privacy or
confdentiality risk to the individual or the organization providing the data. One justifcation
for this principle is that it helps to ensure high data accuracy. If data providers believe
that the information they provide will remain confdential, they may be willing to provide
accurate information.
