      security, and individual privacy. This introductory report provides the foundation
      for a planned series of publications on more specific aspects of this topic.
  •   Publication of Draft NISTIR 8259, Core Cybersecurity Feature Baseline for
      Securable IoT Devices: A Starting Point for IoT Device Manufacturers [29].
      This NISTIR defines a baseline of cybersecurity features that manufacturers
      may voluntarily adopt for the IoT devices that they produce. It also provides
      information on how manufacturers can identify and implement features beyond
      the baseline that are most appropriate for their customers.
  •   Publication of Draft NISTIR 8267, Security Review of Consumer Home Internet
      of Things (IoT) Products, which presents the results of technical assessments on
      the security features of various “smart” products (e.g., smart light bulbs, security
      cameras, and doorbells) [30]. The report provides recommendations, information
      on the observations of the devices’ security features, current practices, and the
      means by which these current practices could be improved. These technical
      assessments will help the NCCoE better address consumer home IoT security in a
      holistic manner in future projects.


Federal Engagement for Artificial Intelligence
As artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming our world, remarkable surges
in AI capabilities have led to a number of innovations. New AI-enabled systems are
revolutionizing everything from commerce and healthcare to transportation and
cybersecurity. Because AI has the potential to impact nearly all aspects of our society
including our economy, AI must be developed in a trustworthy manner to ensure
reliability, safety, and accuracy.
Drawing upon NIST’s long-standing reputation for cultivating trust in technology, the
NIST staff is helping to ensure the public trust of rapidly evolving technologies, including
the development of rigorous and scientific testing that ensures safe and trustworthy AI.
Our progress includes:
  •   Participation in interagency efforts to further innovate AI. NIST Director and
      Undersecretary of Commerce for Standards and Technology Walter Copan serves
      on the White House Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence. Charles Romine,
      the Director of NIST’s ITL, serves on the Machine Learning and AI Subcommittee.
  •   Creation of a plan in response to Executive Order 13859, Maintaining American
      Leadership in Artificial Intelligence, for prioritizing federal agency engagement in
      the development of standards for AI [31]. The plan recommends that the Federal
      Government “commit to deeper, consistent, long-term engagement” in activities
      to help the United States speed the pace of reliable, robust, and trustworthy AI
      technology development; bolster AI standards-related knowledge, leadership, and
      coordination among agencies that develop or use AI; promote focused research on
                                                                                               35
