    IMPERATIVE 1 — Advancing Cybersecurity and Privacy Standards



    During FY18, NIST staff actively contributed to and held leadership positions in various
    SDOs, including the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), the International
    Organization for Standardization (ISO), the International Electrotechnical Commission
    (IEC), the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), the Internet
    Engineering Task Force (IETF), the T Trusted Computing Group (TCG), the World Wide
    Web Consortium (W3C), and the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). Many of the
    international SDOs have domestic counterparts. Figure 1, on the previous page; indicates
    the SDOs in which NIST is actively engaged.
    NIST staff have been actively participating in ISO standards bodies to raise awareness
    and influence the development of privacy standards, including a new family of
    ISO standards (developed primarily in ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee (JTC 1)/
    Subcommittee (SC) 27) that is aligned with the principles of the NIST Cybersecurity
    Framework. Notably, NIST staff participates in the Technical Committee ISO/Program
    Committee (PC) 317 – Consumer Protection: Privacy by Design for Consumer Goods
    and Services, which focuses on developing ISO 31700 Consumer protection: Privacy by
    Design for Consumer Goods and Services. NIST staff has also been engaged with several
    privacy standards activities of the ITC 1/SC 27/Working Group (WG) 5. By participating,
    NIST aims to sustain and promote the development and use of the NIST Privacy
    Framework and its principles in the international arena.
    NIST participation has also grown considerably in Internet of Things (IoT)
    standardization activities, including JTC 1/SC 41 (IoT architecture and vocabulary,
    IoT Interoperability, and IoT Applications), JTC 1/SC 27 (IoT aspects of Security and
    Privacy), IETF – SW Updates for IoT, and the International Telecommunications
    Union–Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T): Sector Joint Coordination
    Activity on IoT and “IoT and Smart Cities.” NIST has been instrumental in promoting
    and participating in the development of a family of voluntary ISO standards that align
    with NIST’s cryptographic module validation standard and related specifications.
    NIST serves as the project editor for nine of those standards. FIPS 140-3, Security
    Requirements for Cryptographic Modules, points to ISO/IEC 19790, Security
    Requirements for Cryptographic Modules. Testing for these requirements will be
    performed in accordance with ISO/IEC 24759, Test Requirements for Cryptographic
    Modules. This is an ongoing effort and will continue over the next several years to
    support a smooth transition path to those using FIPS 140-3 specifications.
    In FY19, NIST staff will continue to lead and participate in cybersecurity and privacy
    standardization efforts with an increased focus on cybersecurity, privacy, and
    cryptography, as well as on new and emerging areas such as Artificial Intelligence and
    the Internet of Things. NIST will continue to provide thoughtful leadership in many SDOs
    by actively participating in those organizations and contributing publications and papers.
