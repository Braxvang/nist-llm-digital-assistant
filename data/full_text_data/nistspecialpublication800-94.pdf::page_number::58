GUIDE TO INTRUSION DETECTION AND PREVENTION SYSTEMS (IDPS)



5.3.2    Logging Capabilities

Wireless IDPSs typically perform extensive logging of data related to detected events. This data can be
used to confirm the validity of alerts, to investigate incidents, and to correlate events between the IDPS
and other logging sources. Data fields commonly logged by wireless IDPSs include the following:

 Timestamp (usually date and time)
 Event or alert type 37
 Priority or severity rating
 Source MAC address (the vendor is often identified from the address)
 Channel number
 ID of the sensor that observed the event
 Prevention action performed (if any).
5.3.3    Detection Capabilities

Wireless IDPSs can detect attacks, misconfigurations, and policy violations at the WLAN protocol level,
primarily examining IEEE 802.11a, b, g, and i protocol communication. Wireless IDPSs do not examine
communications at higher levels (e.g., IP addresses, application payloads). Some products perform only
simple signature-based detection, while others use a combination of signature-based detection, anomaly-
based detection, and stateful protocol analysis techniques; organizations should use wireless IDPS
products that use such a combination of techniques, to achieve broader and more accurate detection. This
section discusses the following aspects of detection capabilities:

 Types of events detected
 Detection accuracy
 Tuning and customization
 Technology limitations.
5.3.3.1 Types of Events Detected

The types of events most commonly detected by wireless IDPS sensors include the following:

 Unauthorized WLANs and WLAN devices. Through their information gathering capabilities, most
  wireless IDPS sensors can detect rogue APs, unauthorized STAs, and unauthorized WLANs (both
  infrastructure mode and ad hoc mode).
 Poorly secured WLAN devices. Most wireless IDPS sensors can identify APs and STAs that are not
  using the proper security controls. This includes detecting misconfigurations and the use of weak
  WLAN protocols and protocol implementations. This is accomplished by identifying deviations from
  organization-specific policies for settings such as encryption, authentication, data rates, SSID names,
  and channels. For example, a sensor could detect that a STA is using WEP instead of WPA2 or IEEE

37
     Some products may use identifiers from the Wireless Vulnerabilities & Exploits (WVE) database, which contains
     information on wireless protocol and product vulnerabilities and known exploits for these vulnerabilities. The WVE
     database is located at http://www.wve.org/.
