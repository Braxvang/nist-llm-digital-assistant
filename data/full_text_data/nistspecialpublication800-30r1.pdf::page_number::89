 Column               Heading                                                                      Content

     1        Threat Event                        Identify threat event. (Task 2-2; Table E-1; Table E-3; Table E-5; Table I-7.)
     2        Threat Sources                      Identify threat sources that could initiate the threat event. (Task 2-1; Table D-1; Table D-2;
                                                  Table D-8; Table I-7.)
     3        Range of Effects                    Identify the range of effects from the threat source. (Task 2-1; Table D-1; Table D-6; Table I-7.)
     4        Relevance                           Determine relevance of threat event. (Task 2-2; Table E-1; Table E-4; Table E-5; Table I-7.)
                                                  If the relevance of the threat event does not meet the organization’s criteria for further
                                                  consideration, do not complete the remaining columns.
     5        Likelihood of Threat Event          Determine the likelihood that the threat event will occur. (Task 2-4; Table G-1; Table G-3; Table
              Occurring                           I-7.)
     6        Vulnerabilities and                 Identify vulnerabilities which could be exploited by threat sources initiating the threat event and
              Predisposing Conditions             the predisposing conditions which could increase the likelihood of adverse impacts. (Task 2-5;
                                                  Table F-1; Table F-3; Table F-4; Table F-6; Table I-7.)
     7        Severity                            Assess severity of vulnerabilities and pervasiveness of predisposing conditions. (Task 2-5; Table
              Pervasiveness                       F-1; Table F-2; Table F-5; Table F-6; Table I-5.)
     8        Likelihood Threat Event             Determine the likelihood that the threat event, once initiated, will result in adverse impact, taking
              Results in Adverse Impact           into consideration vulnerabilities and predisposing conditions. (Task 2-4; Table G-1; Table G-4;
                                                  Table I-7.)
     9        Overall Likelihood                  Determine the likelihood that the threat event will occur and result in adverse impacts (i.e.,
                                                  combination of likelihood of threat occurring and likelihood that the threat event results in
                                                  adverse impact). (Task 2-4; Table G-1; Table G-5; Table I-7.)
     10       Level of Impact                     Determine the adverse impact (i.e., potential harm to organizational operations, organizational
                                                  assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation) from the threat event. (Task 2-5; Table H-
                                                  1, Table H-2; Table H-3; Table H-4; Table I-7.)
     11       Risk                                Determine the level of risk as a combination of likelihood and impact. (Task 2-6; Table I-1; Table
                                                  I-2; Table I-3; Table I-7.)
