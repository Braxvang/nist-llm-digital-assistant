                                                                          Guidelines on PDA Forensics


        USB drives, sometimes referred to as thumb drives, are chewing-gum-pack size hardware
        components with a USB connector at one end, and built as a printed circuit board within a
        plastic housing that encases a processor and memory. USB memory drives can be treated
        similarly to a removable disk drive, and imaged and analyzed using conventional forensic
        tools.

6.3.1   Synched Devices

        Synchronization refers to the process of resolving differences in certain classes of information,
        such as e-mail, residing on two devices (i.e., a PDA and PC), such that both retain most current
        versions, which reflect any actions taken by the user (e.g., deletions) on one device or the
        other. Depending on how the suspect’s device is configured, a significant amount of
        informative data may reside locally on the personal computer. When a connection is
        established between the device and the PC, the user may communicate through the following
        types of account:

                Guest Account – No data is automatically synchronized between the device and the
                PC, unless explicitly initiated by the user.

                User Account – Upon connection, data is synchronized automatically between the
                device and PC. The user predefines what data is synched and which device takes
                precedence. Most handheld devices are configured to synchronize new data, such as
                messages, address book entries, and agenda information.

        Synchronization of information may occur at either the record level or the file level. When
        done at the file level, any discrepancies from the last synchronization date and time result in
        the latest version automatically replacing the older version. Occasionally manual intervention
        may be needed if both versions were modified independently since the last synchronization
        occurred. Record level synchronization is done similarly, but with more granularity whereby
        only out-of-date parts of a file are resolved and replaced.

        With Palm OS devices, record level synchronization is the norm. The core PIM databases that
        can be synchronized include the following: Address Book, Date Book, Memo Pad, Note Pad,
        and To Do List. With Pocket PC devices, file level synchronization is the norm. The core
        PIM application files that can be synchronized include the following: Calendar, Contacts,
        Inbox, Pocket Access, Tasks, and Favorites. Synchronization software other than that built
        into the operating system also exists and may provide a more extensive or different set of
        capabilities. Because the synchronized contents of a PDA and personal computer tend to
        diverge quickly over time, additional information may be found in one device or the other.

        Digital devices are typically populated with data from the PC during the synchronization
        process. Data from the PDA can also be synchronized to the PC, through user-defined
        preferences in the synchronization software. The synchronization software and the device type
        determine where PDA files may be stored on the PC. Each synchronization protocol has a
        default installation directory, but the locale can be user specified. Palm’s HotSync manager
        keeps a log of data transfers containing: dates, location of the data, and what information was
        synched.
