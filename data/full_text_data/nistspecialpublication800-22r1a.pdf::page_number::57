A STATISTICAL TEST SUITE FOR RANDOM AND PSEUDORANDOM NUMBER GENERATORS FOR CRYPTOGRAPHIC APPLICATIONS



            For the example in this section, S' = 0, -1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 0. The resulting random walk is
            shown below.




                                                        Example Random Walk (S')



(4)         Let J = the total number of zero crossings in S', where a zero crossing is a value of zero in S ' that
            occurs after the starting zero. J is also the number of cycles in S′, where a cycle of S′ is a
            subsequence of S′consisting of an occurrence of zero, followed by no-zero values, and ending
            with another zero. The ending zero in one cycle may be the beginning zero in another cycle. The
            number of cycles in S ' is the number of zero crossings. If J < 500, discontinue the test6.

            For the example in this section, if S' = {0, –1, 0 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 0}, then J = 3 (there are zeros
            in positions 3, 5 and 12 of S'). The zero crossings are easily observed in the above plot. Since J =
            3, there are 3 cycles, consisting of {0, -1, 0}, {0, 1, 0} and {0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 0}.

(5)         For each cycle and for each non-zero state value x having values –4 ≤ x ≤ -1 and 1 ≤ x ≤ 4,
            compute the frequency of each x within each cycle.

            For the example in this section, in step 3, the first cycle has one occurrence of –1, the second
            cycle has one occurrence of 1, and the third cycle has three occurrences each of 1 and 2. This can
            be visualized using the following table.

                                                                      Cycles

    J times the minimum of the probabilities found in the table in Section 3.14 must be ≥ 5 in order to satisfy the empirical rule for
        Chi-square computations.
