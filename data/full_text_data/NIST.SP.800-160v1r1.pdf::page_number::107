administrative domain is accessible only by system administrators with proper privileges, and distinctly
administrative functions may only be executed by administrators from the administrative domain.
Similarly, data intended to be accessed only by administrators and administrative functions (e.g., system
configurations) is stored and accessed only within that domain, ensuring needed protection of the data.
Domain separation requires a domain to be contained within its own protected subsystem so that elements
of the domain are only directly accessible by procedures or functions of the protected subsystem. The
concept of isolation enables the implementation of domain separation. Isolation limits the extent to which
one domain can influence or can be influenced by other entities. The challenge is that the system elements
within domains must at times interact with other elements and the environment to deliver a capability.
Every interface that results from design decisions can diminish domain separation while achieving
requirements for a system capability. External requests for resources or functions within protected
subsystems are arbitrated at these interfaces. Firewall, data diodes, and cross-domain solutions (CDS) are
examples of mechanisms that enable varying degrees of control over the interactions between separated
domains.
Encryption is another mechanism often used to provide domain separation. For example, communication
between distinct subsystems within a domain may be encrypted with a key that is known only to the
subsystems within the domain. Where a common storage module or subsystem is used for multiple
domains, encryption may be used to limit information access to the domain that owns the key to decrypt.

E.13. Hierarchical Protection
Principle: A system element need not be protected from more trustworthy elements.
Note: Hierarchical protection is a simplifying assumption for trade decisions to help determine where
emphasis is placed in providing protection and the extent of the protection effectiveness. The simplifying
assumption introduces susceptibilities to system elements that are dependent on more trustworthy
elements. The assumption relies on validated trust assertions about the more trustworthy element and
acceptable uncertainty associated with behavior outside of the scope of the validated trust assertions. For
example, systems may include a human element, which is often the more trustworthy element. The
assertions of the trusted human are violated for the malicious insider threat. The extent to which any
element is considered trustworthy has limits, and beyond those limits, the element should not be assumed
to remain trustworthy. In the degenerate case of the most trustworthy system element, it must protect
itself from all other elements. For example, if an operating system kernel is deemed the most trustworthy
component in a system, then it must protect itself from the less trustworthy applications it supports.
However, the applications do not need to protect themselves from the operating system kernel.

E.14. Least Functionality
Principle: Each system element has the capability to accomplish its required functions but no
more.
Note: Susceptibility and vulnerability increase unnecessarily when a system element provides more
functionality than is needed to achieve its intended purpose. Least functionality reduces the potential for
susceptibility and vulnerability and reduces the scope of analysis of the system element’s trustworthiness
and loss potential. The strictest interpretation of least functionality is to prohibit any system element
functions that are not required. Where that is not possible or practical, the unnecessary functions of the
system element should be disabled, disarmed, or put into a “safe” mode that prevents the functions from
