 Risk Assessment              The process of identifying risks to organizational operations
 [CNSSI 4009]                 (including mission, functions, image, reputation), organizational
                              assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation, resulting
                              from the operation of an information system. Part of risk
                              management, incorporates threat and vulnerability analyses, and
                              considers mitigations provided by security controls planned or in
                              place. Synonymous with risk analysis.

 Risk Executive (Function)    An individual or group within an organization that helps to ensure
 [CNSSI 4009]                 that: (i) security risk-related considerations for individual
                              information systems, to include the authorization decisions, are
                              viewed from an organization-wide perspective with regard to the
                              overall strategic goals and objectives of the organization in
                              carrying out its missions and business functions; and (ii)
                              managing information system-related security risks is consistent
                              across the organization, reflects organizational risk tolerance, and
                              is considered along with organizational risks affecting
                              mission/business success.

 Risk Management              The program and supporting processes to manage information
 [FIPS 200, Adapted]          security risk to organizational operations (including mission,
                              functions, image, reputation), organizational assets, individuals,
                              other organizations, and the Nation, and includes: (i) establishing
                              the context for risk-related activities; (ii) assessing risk; (iii)
                              responding to risk once determined; and (iv) monitoring risk over
                              time.

 Risk Monitoring              Maintaining ongoing awareness of an organizationâ€™s risk
                              environment, risk management program, and associated activities
                              to support risk decisions.

 Risk Response                Accepting, avoiding, mitigating, sharing, or transferring risk to
 [NIST SP 800-39]             organizational operations (mission, functions, image, or
                              reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other
                              organizations, and the Nation.

 Risk Tolerance               The level of risk an entity is willing to assume in order to achieve
 [NISTIR 7298]                a potential desired result.

 Safeguards                   Protective measures prescribed to meet the security requirements
 [CNSSI 4009]                 (i.e., confidentiality, integrity, and availability) specified for an
                              information system. Safeguards may include security features,
                              management constraints, personnel security, and security of
                              physical structures, areas, and devices. Synonymous with security
                              controls and countermeasures.

 Security Authorization       See Authorization.
