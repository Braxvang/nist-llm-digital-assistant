          Further discussion of these techniques is presented in Section 4.
       Target Vulnerability Validation Techniques. These testing techniques corroborate the
        existence of vulnerabilities, and may be performed manually or by using automatic tools,
        depending on the specific technique used and the skill of the test team. Target vulnerability
        validation techniques include password cracking, penetration testing, social engineering, and
        application security testing. More information on these techniques is found in Section 5.
Since no one technique can provide a complete picture of the security of a system or network,
organizations should combine appropriate techniques to ensure robust security assessments. For example,
penetration testing usually relies on performing both network port/service identification and vulnerability
scanning to identify hosts and services that may be targets for future penetration. Also, multiple technical
ways exist to meet an assessment requirement, such as determining whether patches have been applied
properly. This publication focuses on explaining how these different technical techniques can be
performed, and does not specify which techniques should be used for which circumstances—thus
providing organizations with the flexibility to choose the techniques that best meet their requirements.

In addition to the technical techniques described in this publication, there are many non-technical
techniques that may be used in addition to or instead of the technical techniques. One example is physical
security testing, which confirms the existence of physical security vulnerabilities by attempting to
circumvent locks, badge readers, and other physical security controls, typically to gain unauthorized
access to specific hosts. Another example of a non-technical technique is manual asset identification. An
organization may choose to identify assets to be assessed through asset inventories, physical
walkthroughs of facilities, and other non-technical means, instead of relying on technical techniques for
asset identification. Details on non-technical techniques are outside the scope of this publication, but it is
important to recognize the value of non-technical techniques and to consider when they may be more
appropriate to use than their technical counterparts.

2.3     Comparing Tests and Examinations

Examinations primarily involve the review of documents such as policies, procedures, security plans,
security requirements, standard operating procedures, architecture diagrams, engineering documentation,
asset inventories, system configurations, rulesets, and system logs. They are conducted to determine
whether a system is properly documented, and to gain insight on aspects of security that are only available
through documentation. This documentation identifies the intended design, installation, configuration,
operation, and maintenance of the systems and network, and its review and cross-referencing ensures
conformance and consistency. For example, an environment’s security requirements should drive
documentation such as system security plans and standard operating procedures—so assessors should
ensure that all plans, procedures, architectures, and configurations are compliant with stated security
requirements and applicable policies. Another example is reviewing a firewall’s ruleset to ensure its
compliance with the organization’s security policies regarding Internet usage, such as the use of instant
messaging, peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing, and other prohibited activities.

Examinations typically have no impact on the actual systems or networks in the target environment aside
from accessing necessary documentation, logs, or rulesets. 5 However, if system configuration files or
logs are to be retrieved from a given system such as a router or firewall, only system administrators and

      One passive testing technique that can potentially impact networks is network sniffing, which involves connecting a sniffer
      to a hub, tap, or span port on the network. In some cases, the connection process requires reconfiguring a network device,
      which could disrupt operations.
