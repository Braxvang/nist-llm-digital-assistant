                                                                    COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE



Appendix B—Incident-Related Data Elements

Organizations should identify a standard set of incident-related data elements to be collected for each
incident. This effort will not only facilitate more effective and consistent incident handling, but also assist
the organization in meeting applicable incident reporting requirements. The organization should designate
a set of basic elements (e.g., incident reporter’s name, phone number, and location) to be collected when
the incident is reported and an additional set of elements to be collected by the incident handlers during
their response. The two sets of elements would be the basis for the incident reporting database, previously
discussed in Section 3.2.5. The lists below provide suggestions of what information to collect for
incidents and are not intended to be comprehensive. Each organization should create its own list of
elements based on several factors, including its incident response team model and structure and its
definition of the term “incident.”
B.1       Basic Data Elements
 Contact Information for the Incident Reporter and Handler
      – Name
      – Role
      – Organizational unit (e.g., agency, department, division, team) and affiliation
      – Email address
      – Phone number
      – Location (e.g., mailing address, office room number)
 Incident Details
      – Status change date/timestamps (including time zone): when the incident started, when the
          incident was discovered/detected, when the incident was reported, when the incident was
          resolved/ended, etc.
      – Physical location of the incident (e.g., city, state)
      – Current status of the incident (e.g., ongoing attack)
      – Source/cause of the incident (if known), including hostnames and IP addresses
      – Description of the incident (e.g., how it was detected, what occurred)
      – Description of affected resources (e.g., networks, hosts, applications, data), including systems’
          hostnames, IP addresses, and function
      – If known, incident category, vectors of attack associated with the incident, and indicators related
          to the incident (traffic patterns, registry keys, etc.)
      – Prioritization factors (functional impact, information impact, recoverability, etc.)
      – Mitigating factors (e.g., stolen laptop containing sensitive data was using full disk encryption)
      – Response actions performed (e.g., shut off host, disconnected host from network)
      – Other organizations contacted (e.g., software vendor)
 General Comments
