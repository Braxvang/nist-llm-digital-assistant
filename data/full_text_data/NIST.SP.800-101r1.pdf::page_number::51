always necessary to recover all available data, a complete acquisition avoids having to redo the
process later if additional data is requested. For examinations involving a limited scope search
warrant (e.g., only text messages), a full memory data extraction may be completed but care
should be taken to only report items covered by the warrant.

To acquire data from a mobile device, a connection must be established to the device from the
forensic workstation. Before performing an acquisition, the version of the tool or device being
used should be documented, along with any applicable patches or errata from the manufacturer
applied to the tool. As mentioned earlier, caution should be taken to avoid altering the state of a
mobile device when handling it, for example, by pressing keys that may corrupt or erase data.
Once the connection has been established, the forensic software suite or device may proceed to
acquire data from the mobile device.

The date and time maintained on the mobile device is an important piece of information. The
date and time may have been obtained from the network or manually set by the user. Owners
may manually set the day or time to different values from the actual ones yielding misleading
values in the call and message records found on the mobile device. If the device was on when
seized, the date and time maintained and differences from a reference clock should have
already been recorded. Nevertheless, confirmation at the time acquisition may prove useful. If
the mobile device was off when seized, the date and time maintained and differences from a
reference clock should be recorded immediately when first powered on. Actions taken during
acquisition, such as removal of the battery to view the device label, may affect the time and
date values.

Mobile devices may provide the user with an interface for a memory card. Mobile device
forensic tools that acquire the contents of a resident memory card normally perform a logical
acquisition. If the device is found in an active state, the mobile device internal memory should
be acquired before removing and performing a physical acquisition of the associated media
(e.g., microSD Card). Otherwise, if the device is found in a power off state, a physical
acquisition of the removable media should be performed before the internal handset memory
of the mobile device is acquired. With either type of acquisition, the forensic tool may or may
not have the capability to decode recovered data stored on the card (e.g., SMS text messages),
requiring additional manual steps to be taken.

After an acquisition is finished, the forensic specialist should confirm that the contents of a
device were captured correctly. On occasion, a tool may fail without any error notification and
require the specialist to reattempt acquisition. It is advisable to have multiple tools available
and be prepared to switch to another if difficulties occur with the initial tool.

Invariably, not all relevant data viewable on a mobile device using the available menus may be
acquired and decoded through a logical acquisition. Manually scrutinizing the contents via the
device interface menus while video recording the process not only allows such items to be
captured and reported, but also confirms that the contents reported by the tool are consistent
with observable data. Manual extraction must always be done with care, preserving the
integrity of the device in case further, more elaborate acquisitions are necessary.

The contents of a mobile deviceâ€™s memory often contain information, such as deleted data, that
is not recoverable through either a logical or manual extractions. Lacking a software tool able
to perform a physical acquisition, it may be necessary to turn to hardware-based techniques.
Two techniques commonly used are acquisition through a standardized JTAG test interface, if
