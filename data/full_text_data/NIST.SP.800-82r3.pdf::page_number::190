            Vulnerability                                             Description
  Inadequate incident detection and   Incident detection and response plans, procedures, and methods are
  response plan and procedures        necessary for rapidly detecting incidents, minimizing loss and destruction,
                                      preserving evidence for later forensic examination, mitigating the
                                      weaknesses that were exploited, and restoring services. Establishing a
                                      successful incident response capability includes continually monitoring for
                                      anomalies, prioritizing the handling of incidents, and implementing
                                      effective methods for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data.

C.2.2. System Vulnerabilities and Predisposing Conditions
Security controls must clearly identify the systems to which they apply. Systems range widely in
size, scope, and capability. At the small end of the spectrum, a system may be an individual
hardware or software product or service. At the other end of the spectrum are large and complex
systems, systems-of-systems, and networks, all of which incorporate hardware architectures and
software frameworks (including application frameworks) to support operations. An organization
may choose to identify security zones such that security controls may be applied to all systems
within the security zone.
System vulnerabilities can occur in the hardware, firmware, and software used to build the OT.
Sources of vulnerabilities include design flaws, development flaws, misconfigurations, poor
maintenance, poor administration, and connections with other systems and networks. Many of
the controls in the NIST SP 800-53 and the OT overlay in Appendix F specify what the system
must do to mitigate these vulnerabilities.
Vulnerabilities can also exist in the auxiliary components that support the OT systems. A subset
of those vulnerabilities with the potential to impact the physical process are described in this
section.
The potential vulnerabilities and predisposing conditions commonly found within OT systems
are categorized into the following tables:
   •    Table 15. Architecture and design vulnerabilities and predisposing conditions
   •    Table 16. Configuration and maintenance vulnerabilities and predisposing conditions
   •    Table 17. Physical vulnerabilities and predisposing conditions
   •    Table 18. Software development vulnerabilities and predisposing conditions
   •    Table 19. Communication and network configuration vulnerabilities and predisposing
        conditions
   •    Table 20. Sensor, final element, and asset management vulnerabilities and predisposing
        conditions
