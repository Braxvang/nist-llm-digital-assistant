4.0 ASSIGNMENT OF IMPACT LEVELS AND SECURITY
    CATEGORIZATION
This section provides a methodology for assigning security impact levels and security
categorizations for information types and information systems consistent with the organizationâ€™s
assigned mission and business functions based on FIPS 199, Standards for Security
Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems. This document assumes that
the user has read and is familiar with FIPS 199. Figure 2 illustrates the four-step security
categorization process and how it drives the selection of baseline security controls.

Table 3 provides a step-by-step roadmap for identifying information types, establishing security
impact levels for loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information types, and
assigning security categorization for the information types and for the information systems.
Security categorization is the basis for identifying an initial baseline set of security controls for
the information system. 10 Each functional step in the process is explained in detail in Sections
4.1 through 4.4.

  An information system is a discrete set of information resources organized for the collection, processing,
maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of information [Source: SP 800-53; FIPS 200; FIPS
