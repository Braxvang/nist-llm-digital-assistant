ESTABLISHING WIRELESS ROBUST SECURITY NETWORKS: A GUIDE TO IEEE 802.11I



with WPA, so any WPA2 product should be able to interoperate with a WPA product. 95 Some products
may require a hardware upgrade to achieve WPA2 compliance; older products, in general, cannot be
upgraded to WPA2.

WPA2 testing validates interoperability with selected EAP methods only, so WPA2 certification does not
imply interoperability with all possible EAP methods. Currently, certification involves interoperability
testing with the following EAP methods:

       EAP-TLS
       EAP-TTLS/MSCHAPv2
       PEAPv0/EAP-MSCHAPv2
       PEAPv1/EAP-GTC
       EAP Subscriber Identity Module (EAP-SIM).
When a method is listed with a “/”, the first term is the actual EAP method, and the second term is the
inner method tunneled within it. The Alliance may add to this list over time. Organizations procuring
WPA2 products should either select EAP methods from the tested list or conduct their own
interoperability testing on the equipment with their own authentication infrastructures.

WPA2 certification does not currently exist for products providing AS functionality. When the Alliance
conducts its interoperability testing, it uses AAA servers running leading implementations of RADIUS
and the tested EAP methods, but does not publicize which these are. If an organization selects a AAA
server running a different implementation of RADIUS or the chosen EAP method, then there is no
guarantee of interoperability. Conducting independent testing in enterprise environments is advised.

Because Federal agencies are required to use encryption algorithms that are FIPS-approved, such as AES,
they should procure WPA2 components with FIPS-validated cryptographic modules. WPA equipment is
not FIPS-compliant because it utilizes the RC4 algorithm instead of AES. Products can obtain WPA2
certification without being FIPS-validated, so Federal agencies should check for both WPA2 certification
and FIPS validation.

7.3.3     Modes of Operation

Both WPA and WPA2 have two modes of operation: Personal and Enterprise. The Personal mode
involves the use of a pre-shared key for authentication, while the Enterprise mode uses IEEE 802.1X and
EAP for this purpose. Products can be certified for both modes or for Personal mode only. Therefore,
organizations that plan to use an authentication server rather than pre-shared keys should look specifically
for the Enterprise certification. The use of an authentication server rather than pre-shared keys is
recommended for most situations because of the impracticality of generating, deploying, and periodically
replacing pre-shared keys. The lack of individual user/client authentication in most PSK APs is another
reason to avoid the use of pre-shared keys.

7.4     Summary

Federal agencies are required to use FIPS-approved cryptographic algorithms that are contained in FIPS-
validated cryptographic modules. In addition, the Wi-Fi Alliance has established several certification

95
      WPA2 products implement both WPA and WPA2 (IEEE 802.11i) TKIP and 4-Way Handshakes.
