1501   3.10.2. Monitoring Physical Access
1502             REQUIREMENT: 03.10.02
1503             a. Monitor physical access to the location where the system resides to detect and respond to
1504                physical security incidents.
1505             b. Review physical access logs periodically.

1506             DISCUSSION
1507             A facility can include one or more physical locations containing systems or system components
1508             that process, store, or transmit CUI. Physical access monitoring includes publicly accessible
1509             areas within organizational facilities. Examples of physical access monitoring include the
1510             employment of guards, video surveillance equipment (i.e., cameras), and sensor devices.
1511             Reviewing physical access logs can help identify suspicious activity, anomalous events, or
1512             potential threats. The reviews can be supported by audit logging controls if the access logs are
1513             part of an automated system. Incident response capabilities include investigations of physical
1514             security incidents and responses to those incidents. Incidents include security violations or
1515             suspicious physical access activities, such as access outside of normal work hours, repeated
1516             access to areas not normally accessed, access for unusual lengths of time, and out-of-sequence
1517             access.

1528             REQUIREMENT: 03.10.06
1529             a. Determine alternate work sites allowed for use by employees.
1530             b. Employ the following security requirements at alternate work sites: [Assignment:
