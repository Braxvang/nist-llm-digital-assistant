C.2.8.9 Personal Identity and Authentication Information Information Type

Personal identity and authentication information includes that information necessary to ensure
that all persons who are potentially entitled to receive any federal benefit are enumerated and
identified so that Federal agencies can have reasonable assurance that they are paying or
communicating with the right individuals. This information include individual citizen’s Social
Security Numbers, names, dates of birth, places of birth, parents’ names, etc. 18 The
recommended security categorization for the personal identity and authentication information
type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Moderate), (integrity, Moderate), (availability, Moderate)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is based on the effects of unauthorized disclosure of personal
identity and authentication information on the ability of Federal agencies to determine that
communications with and payments to individuals are being made with or to the correct
individuals - and to protect individuals against identity theft and the Federal government against
fraud. Unauthorized disclosure of raw data and other source information for identity
authentication operations is likely to violate the Privacy Act of 1974 and other regulations
applicable to the dissemination of personal and government information. There are many cases
in which unauthorized disclosure of personal identity and authentication information will have
only a limited adverse effect on government operations, assets, or individuals. However, the
potential for use of such information by criminals to perpetrate identity theft and related fraud
can do serious harm to individuals. Unauthorized disclosure of centrally managed personal
identity and authentication information, such as passport and visa control databases can have a
serious adverse effect on agency missions.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: For agencies that manage large
income information involving records of the general public, the provisional confidentiality
impact level can be expected to be at least moderate. Where personal identity and authentication
information is used in controlling access to facilities (e.g., Federal facilities, critical
infrastructure facilities, key national assets) or for border control purposes, the consequences of
unauthorized disclosure that permits credentials forgery can justify a high impact assignment.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for personal identity and authentication information is moderate.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific purpose to which personal identity and
authentication information is put; and not on the time required to detect the modification or
destruction of information. In the case of very large databases containing personal identity and
authentication information relating to the general public, there is a significant probability that
erroneous actions will be taken affecting benefits entitlements of or access to facilities by large
numbers of individuals. In the case of benefits, this can result in at least short-term financial

  Persons conducting sensitive or payment related business with the government must identify themselves to the
level prescribed by appropriate governing directives using such data.
