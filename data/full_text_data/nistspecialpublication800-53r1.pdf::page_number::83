FAMILY: CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT                                                         CLASS: OPERATIONAL


CM-1      CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT POLICY AND PROCEDURES

          Control: The organization develops, disseminates, and periodically reviews/updates: (i) a formal,
          documented, configuration management policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles,
          responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and
          compliance; and (ii) formal, documented procedures to facilitate the implementation of the
          configuration management policy and associated configuration management controls.
          Supplemental Guidance: The configuration management policy and procedures are consistent with
          applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. The
          configuration management policy can be included as part of the general information security
          policy for the organization. Configuration management procedures can be developed for the
          security program in general, and for a particular information system, when required. NIST Special
          Publication 800-12 provides guidance on security policies and procedures.
          Control Enhancements: None.

CM-2      BASELINE CONFIGURATION

          Control: The organization develops, documents, and maintains a current baseline configuration of
          the information system.
          Supplemental Guidance: This control establishes a baseline configuration for the information
          system. The baseline configuration provides information about a particular component’s makeup
          (e.g., the standard software load for a workstation or notebook computer including updated patch
          information) and the component’s logical placement within the information system architecture.
          The baseline configuration also provides the organization with a well-defined and documented
          specification to which the information system is built and deviations, if required, are documented
          in support of mission needs/objectives. The baseline configuration of the information system is
          consistent with the Federal Enterprise Architecture. Related security controls: CM-6, CM-8.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization updates the baseline configuration of the information system as an integral part
                of information system component installations.
          (2)   The organization employs automated mechanisms to maintain an up-to-date, complete, accurate,
                and readily available baseline configuration of the information system.
