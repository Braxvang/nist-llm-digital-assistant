1160           administrator reports, and reported supply chain events. An effective incident handling capability
1161           involves coordination among many organizational entities, including mission and business
1162           owners, system owners, human resources offices, physical and personnel security offices, legal
1163           departments, operations personnel, and procurement offices.

1167   3.6.2. Incident Monitoring, Reporting, and Response Assistance
1168           REQUIREMENT: 03.06.02
1169           a. Track and document system security incidents.
1170           b. Report suspected incidents to the organizational incident response capability within
1171              [Assignment: organization-defined time period].
1172           c.   Report incident information to [Assignment: organization-defined authorities].
1173           d. Provide an incident response support resource that offers advice and assistance to users of
1174              the system for the handling and reporting of incidents.

1175           DISCUSSION
1176           Documenting incidents includes maintaining records about each incident, the status of the
1177           incident, and other pertinent information necessary for forensics as well as evaluating incident
1178           details, trends, and handling. Incident information can be obtained from many sources, including
1179           network monitoring, incident reports, incident response teams, user complaints, supply chain
1180           partners, audit monitoring, physical access monitoring, and user and administrator reports. 3.6.1
1181           provides information on the types of incidents that are appropriate for monitoring. The types of
1182           incidents reported, the content and timeliness of the reports, and the reporting authorities reflect
1183           applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines.
1184           Incident information informs risk assessments, the effectiveness of security assessments, the
1185           security requirements for acquisitions, and the selection criteria for technology products. Incident
1186           response support resources provided by organizations include help desks, assistance groups,
1187           automated ticketing systems to open and track incident response tickets, and access to forensic
1188           services or consumer redress services, when required.

1192   3.6.3. Incident Response Testing
1193           REQUIREMENT: 03.06.03
1194           Test the effectiveness of the incident response capability periodically.

1195           DISCUSSION
1196           Organizations test incident response capabilities to determine their effectiveness and identify
1197           potential weaknesses or deficiencies. Incident response testing includes the use of checklists,
1198           walk-through or tabletop exercises, and simulations. Incident response testing can include a
