       NIST SP 800-63B-4 ipd                                             Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022                                      Authentication and Lifecycle Management


2475   This guideline recommends the binding of additional authenticators to minimize the
2476   need for account recovery (see Sec. 6.1.2.3). However, a subscriber might find it difficult
2477   to purchase a second hardware-based authenticator as a backup. This inequity can be
2478   addressed by making inexpensive authenticators such as look-up secrets (see Sec. 5.1.2)
2479   available for use in the event of a primary authenticator failure or loss.
2480   CSPs need to be responsive to subscribers that experience authentication challenges
2481   that cannot be solved using authenticators they currently support. This might involve
2482   supporting a new authenticator type or allowing federated authentication through a trusted
2483   service that meets the needs of the subscriber.
