7.3   Checklist for Implementing a Secure Network Infrastructure

        Completed                                                  Action
                      Network location
                      Mail server is located on the internal network and protected by a mail gateway and/or
                      firewall, or
                      Mail server is located in a DMZ
                      Firewall configuration
                      Mail server is protected by a firewall
                      Mail server, if it faces a higher threat or if it is more vulnerable, is protected by an
                      application layer firewall
                      Firewall controls all traffic between the Internet and the mail server
                      Firewall blocks all inbound traffic to the mail server except the necessary ports, such as
                      TCP ports 25 (SMTP), 110 (POP3), 143 (IMAP), 398 (LDAP), 636 (secure LDAP), 993
                      (secure IMAP), and 995 (secure POP)
                      Firewall blocks (in conjunction with the intrusion detection or prevention system) IP
                      addresses or subnets that the IDS or IPS reports are attacking the organizational network
                      Firewall blocks known “blacklisted” networks or subnets, as identified by a trusted external
                      security response center
                      Firewall notifies the network administrator or mail server administrator of suspicious
                      activity through an appropriate means
                      Firewall provides content filtering and malware scanning
                      Firewall is configured to protect against DoS attacks
                      Firewall logs critical events
                      Firewall and firewall operating system patched to latest or most secure level
                      Intrusion detection and prevention systems
                      IDPS configured to monitor traffic network traffic to and from the mail server
                      IDPS configured to monitor changes to critical files on mail server (host-based IDPS or file
                      integrity checker)
                      IDPS configured to monitor the system resources available on the mail server host (host-
                      based IDPS)
                      IDPS blocks (in conjunction with the firewall) IP addresses or subnets that are attacking
                      the organizational network
                      IDPS notifies the necessary parties of suspected attacks through appropriate means
                      according to the organization’s incident response policy and procedures
                      IDPS configured to maximize detection with an acceptable level of false positives
                      IDPS configured to log events and to capture packet header information for network
                      events
                      IDPS updated with new attack signatures frequently (e.g., on a daily to weekly basis,
                      typically after testing the updates)
                      Network switches
                      Network switches are used to protect against network eavesdropping
                      Network switches are configured in high-security mode to defeat ARP spoofing and ARP
                      poisoning attacks
                      Network switches are configured to send all traffic on network segment to network-based
                      IDPS
