                                                                   GUIDE TO USING VULNERABILITY NAMING SCHEMES



3.      Recommendations for End-User Organizations

This section provides recommendations for end-user organizations on how they should take advantage of
the CVE and CCE specifications to improve their system security management. For all recommendations
in this section involving an organization using CVE and CCE names, the organization should use the
authoritative names; locations for downloading these are listed in Section 2.

Some of the recommendations in this section involve the Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) version
2.2 specification. CPE provides standardized, consistent names for referring to operating systems,
hardware, and applications. CPE names are often used in conjunction with CVE and CCE names. Each
CVE name and CCE name is related to one or more IT components, which can be expressed using CPE
names. For example, a particular software flaw (identified by a CVE name) may affect seven products
(identified by their CPE names). Using CPE names with CVE and CCE names further supports
interoperability and standardization across products and services. The official CPE dictionary is available
at http://nvd.nist.gov/cpe.cfm.

3.1     Product and Service Selection and Design

      1. When evaluating IT products and services that use vulnerability names, such as for possible
         acquisition, organizations should take into consideration the products and servicesâ€™ support for
         CVE and/or CCE (as appropriate). Most organizations use a variety of products and services to
         detect, track, and mitigate vulnerabilities. Using standardized vulnerability names across products
         and services makes it much easier and faster to correlate information and to aggregate data from
         many disparate sources into a unified interface, such as a security dashboard.

      2. Organizations developing their own custom security software that will use vulnerability names
         should ensure that the software uses authoritative CVE and/or CCE names, as appropriate, and
         uses CPE names with them when indicating which IT products the CVE and CCE names apply
         to. Using CVE, CCE, and CPE names supports interoperability with other software and services.

3.2     Vulnerability Communications and Reporting

      1. Organizations should use authoritative CVE and CCE names in their internal vulnerability
         assessment and reporting, including assessment reports, notifications to system owners of
         detected vulnerabilities, and alerts identifying the vulnerabilities being targeted by active exploits.
         Use of CVE and CCE names will help to minimize confusion regarding which vulnerability is
         being referenced and whether a particular vulnerability has been mitigated. Organizations should
         also use CPE names when indicating which IT products the vulnerabilities apply to.

      2. Organizations should use authoritative CVE and CCE names in their external vulnerability
         communications, as well as the CPE names for the IT products that the vulnerabilities apply to.
         For example, communications to incident response teams should reference, when known, the
         CVE or CCE names of the vulnerabilities that are being exploited and the CPE names of the
         products that are being exploited. This ensures that incident communications precisely identify
         relevant vulnerabilities and affected products, enable correlation and integration of reports, and
         enable correlation with supplemental information residing in other data repositories. Another
         example is that organizations should use CVE and CCE names when communicating with
         vendors that support CVE and CCE names. Suppose that a vendor-supplied patch that purports to
         fix a vulnerability is defective; a statement to the vendor that a given CVE vulnerability remains
         after applying the patch conveys important information clearly and succinctly. Communications
