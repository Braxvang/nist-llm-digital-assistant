AC-5      SEPARATION OF DUTIES

          Control: The information system enforces separation of duties through assigned access
          authorizations.
          Supplemental Guidance: The organization establishes appropriate divisions of responsibility and
          separates duties as needed to eliminate conflicts of interest in the responsibilities and duties of
          individuals. There is access control software on the information system that prevents users from
          having all of the necessary authority or information access to perform fraudulent activity without
          collusion. Examples of separation of duties include: (i) mission functions and distinct information
          system support functions are divided among different individuals/roles; (ii) different individuals
          perform information system support functions (e.g., system management, systems programming,
          quality assurance/testing, configuration management, and network security); and (iii) security
          personnel who administer access control functions do not administer audit functions.
          Control Enhancements: None.

AC-6      LEAST PRIVILEGE

          Control: The information system enforces the most restrictive set of rights/privileges or accesses
          needed by users (or processes acting on behalf of users) for the performance of specified tasks.
          Supplemental Guidance: The organization employs the concept of least privilege for specific duties
          and information systems (including specific ports, protocols, and services) in accordance with risk
          assessments as necessary to adequately mitigate risk to organizational operations, organizational
          assets, and individuals.
          Control Enhancements: None.


           LOW Not Selected              MOD AC-6                   HIGH AC-6



AC-7      UNSUCCESSFUL LOGIN ATTEMPTS

          Control: The information system enforces a limit of [Assignment: organization-defined number]
          consecutive invalid access attempts by a user during a [Assignment: organization-defined time
          period] time period. The information system automatically [Selection: locks the account/node for
          an [Assignment: organization-defined time period], delays next login prompt according to
          Assignment: organization-defined delay algorithm.]] when the maximum number of unsuccessful
          attempts is exceeded.
          Supplemental Guidance: Due to the potential for denial of service, automatic lockouts initiated by
          the information system are usually temporary and automatically release after a predetermined time
          period established by the organization.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The information system automatically locks the account/node until released by an administrator
                when the maximum number of unsuccessful attempts is exceeded.
