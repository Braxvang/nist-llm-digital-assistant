GUIDE TO COMPUTER SECURITY LOG MANAGEMENT



      Two levels of log servers, with the first level of distributed log servers receiving logs from the log
       generators and forwarding some or all of the log data they receive to a second level of more
       centralized log servers. (Additional tiers can be added to this architecture to make it even more
       flexible, scalable, and redundant.) In some cases, the first level servers act as log caching
       servers—simply receiving logs from log generators and forwarding them to other log servers.
       This can be done to protect the second level of log servers from direct attacks, and it is also useful
       when there are network reliability concerns between the log generators and the second level of
       log servers, such as those servers being accessible only over the Internet. In that case, having log
       caching servers on a reliable local network allows the log generators to transfer their logs to those
       servers, which can then transfer the logs to the second level of log servers when network
       connectivity permits.
Communications between log management infrastructure components typically occur over an
organization’s regular networks because the hosts generating log data may be located throughout the
organization’s networks. However, a physically or logically separate logging network can be used,
particularly for getting logs from key devices (e.g., firewalls and network intrusion detection systems that
often transfer large amounts of log data) and for transferring log data between log servers. During a
widespread malware incident or other network-based attack, regular networks might be unstable or
unavailable. Another motivation for using a separate logging network is protecting log data on the
organization’s regular networks from eavesdropping. If a separate logging network is not used, logging
communications on the regular network could be protected using additional security controls, such as data
encryption. Another benefit of having a separate logging network is protecting those components that are
only used for log management from attacks.

For a log management infrastructure, there might be some log-generating hosts that cannot automatically
participate in the infrastructure, such as computers that are not network-connected, and legacy systems
and appliance-based devices that cannot be configured to transfer their logs to the log servers. If their log
data needs to be incorporated into the log management infrastructure, organizations can adopt out-of-band
solutions such as manually transferring logs from a host to write-once media (e.g., CD-ROMs), and then
copying the data from the media to a log server.22 A log management infrastructure also needs to
accommodate hosts with intermittent or low-bandwidth connectivity, such as mobile hosts and hosts
connecting through dial-up modems. These hosts may be severely limited as to how they can participate
in the log management infrastructure, but this does not alter the importance of the logs that they contain.

An organization might have a single log management infrastructure for the entire enterprise, but it is more
common to have multiple separate infrastructures that do not necessarily interoperate. Having a single
log management infrastructure can provide a single point for reviewing all of the organization’s pertinent
log data, but for larger organizations the size of such an infrastructure and the volume of data it would
have to process and store typically make it infeasible. Larger organizations usually have multiple log
management infrastructures, sometimes dozens or hundreds. The scope of each infrastructure can be
dictated by many factors, including the organization’s internal structure, system types (e.g., a separate
infrastructure for enterprise security systems), log types (e.g., a separate infrastructure for application
audit logs), and facility locations.

     If the data does not need to be transferred to the log management infrastructure, then local administrators can manage and
     analyze it at the log source itself.
