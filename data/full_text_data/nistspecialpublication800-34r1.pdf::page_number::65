5.2.2    Client/Server Systems Contingency Solutions

Wide ranges of technical contingency solutions are available for client/server systems; several efficient
practices are discussed in this section.

Encryption is a popular security tool used on client devices. With increased use of digital signatures for
non-repudiation and the use of encryption for confidentiality and/or integrity, organizations should
consider including encryption in their backup strategy. Encryption should also be considered for backup
media that goes offsite for storage, to secure data should it be lost or stolen en route or at the alternate
site.

If encrypted data is sent offsite for storage, there should be a cryptographic key management system in
place to make sure the data is readable if it needs to be recovered onto a new or replaced system. The
cryptographic key and the encryption software both need to be on the new system, along with the keying
material. Keying material is the data, such as the keys and initialization points for encryption, used to
establish and maintain the encryption parameters. The keying material can be stored at a central location
(such as an enterprise key management and encryption system) or on removable media separate from the
backup media itself. 39

Client/server system data backups can be accomplished in various ways, including those listed below: 40

        Digital video disc (DVD). DVD-read only memory (DVD-ROM) drives come standard in most
         desktop computers; however, not all computers are equipped with writable DVD-ROM drives.
         DVDs are low-cost storage media and have a higher storage capacity of around 4.7 gigabytes
         (GB). To read from a DVD-ROM, the operating system’s file manager is sufficient; to write to a
         DVD-ROM, a rewritable DVD (DVD-RW) drive and the appropriate software are required.
        Network Storage. Data stored on networked client/server systems can be backed up to a
         networked disk. The amount of data that can be backed up from a client/server system is limited
         by the network disk storage capacity or disk allocation to the particular user. If users are
         instructed to save files to a networked disk, the networked disk itself should be backed up through
         the network or server backup program. Common types of network storage architecture include
         network attached storage (NAS) and storage area network (SAN). These storage systems
         incorporate resiliency and redundancy within their design and can be configured to maintain
         redundancy across several locations.
        External Hard Drives. Data replication or synchronization to an external hard drive is a
         common backup method for portable computers and stand-alone devices. Handheld devices or
         laptops may be connected to an external hard drive and replicate the desired data from the
         portable device to the external hard drive. Many external hard drives have backup software
         included for use in backing up primary drives.
        Internet Backup. Internet Backup, or Online Backup, is a commercial service that allows
         desktop and portable device users to back up data to a remote location over the Internet for a fee.
         A utility is installed onto the desktop or portable device that allows the user to schedule backups,
         select files and folders to be backed up, and establish an archiving scheme to prevent files from
         being overwritten. Data can be encrypted for transmission; however, this will impede the data
         transfer. The advantage of Internet Backup is that the user is not required to purchase data
