                  The Technical Specification for the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.2



4.      SCAP Content Processing Requirements and Recommendations

This section defines the processing requirements that SCAP content consumers MUST follow in order to
correctly process SCAP 1.2 content. This section also provides recommendations that are not mandatory;
organizations are encouraged to adopt them to promote stronger interoperability and greater consistency.
The topics covered in the first part of this section are legacy support, source data streams, and XCCDF
processing. The end of the section covers result-related topics: SCAP result data streams, XCCDF results,
OVAL results, OCIL results, and result data stream signing.

4.1     Legacy Support
Content consumers supporting SCAP 1.2 SHALL process SCAP 1.2 content and SCAP 1.0 content.
Content consumers SHALL process SCAP content as defined under the corresponding version of NIST
SP 800-126 (for SCAP 1.2, this revision; for SCAP 1.0, the original release).17 Content consumers that
process legacy SCAP content MUST be capable of outputting results in the same SCAP version as the
source content, and MAY convert the legacy SCAP results into SCAP 1.2 results.
Within the SCAP component specifications, certain constructs may be deprecated.18 SCAP content
consumers MUST support all deprecated constructs because they are still valid. This requirement ensures
that legacy content that made use of these deprecated constructs continues to be supported.
Content consumers supporting OVAL SHALL support OVAL Definition documents written against
OVAL versions 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7, 5.8, 5.9, and 5.10.

4.2     Source Data Streams
Content consumers SHALL be capable of validating SCAP content against the appropriate schemas and
Schematron stylesheets, detecting and reporting errors, and failing gracefully if there are errors. The
relevant XML schemas are located at http://scap.nist.gov/revision/1.2/#schema, and the relevant
Schematron rule sets at http://scap.nist.gov/revision/1.2/#schematron. See Section 3.1 for additional
information on the Schematron rule sets.
Content consumers SHOULD validate XML digital signatures if they exist in the content. Validating a
signature includes confirming that the signature value is valid, all of the reference hashes in the signature
and manifest are correct, and the public key used to verify the signature is from a trusted source. A data
stream with a signature that does not validate SHOULD NOT be evaluated by a content consumer.
Whenever a <ds:extended-component> that is not recognized by the tool is referenced from a
<ds:data-stream>, <ds:component>, or <ds:extended-component> element, the tool
SHALL issue a warning.
If more than one <ds:data-stream> element is specified on the <ds:data-stream-
collection>, the ID of the <ds:data-stream> to execute MUST be indicated to the content
consumer, and the content consumer MUST use the specified <ds:data-stream>. If more than one
<xccdf:Benchmark> is referenced by a <ds:data-stream>, the ID of the
<xccdf:Benchmark> to execute MUST be indicated to the content consumer, and the content
consumer MUST process the indicated <xccdf:Benchmark>. Because SCAP and its component
specifications do not formally define how to designate a particular data stream, benchmark, etc. in these
cases, it is expected that products will implement these capabilities in a proprietary way.
