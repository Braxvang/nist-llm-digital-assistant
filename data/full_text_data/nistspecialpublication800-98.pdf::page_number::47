                                                    SECTION 3: RFID APPLICATIONS AND APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS



In many cases, the data element is not sensitive. Organizations need to examine and invest in security
controls to protect RFID data depending on the sensitivity level of that data. They also need to consider
how data elements might be combined with other data to make inferences or build profiles, particularly if
data elements are shared across organizations or stored for long periods of time.

Another important characteristic of the data is whether it changes over time. In general, tag identifiers
never change, but the data associated with the identifier can change. For example, in asset management
applications, the RFID system may maintain information about product features such as make, model,
size, color, and serial number. These product features typically will be written once and then will not
change while the item remains in the system. However, if the asset management application’s primary
focus is tracking containers rather than specific items, then the data changes frequently as the container is
reused to store and transport new items. In access control applications, if a tag acts as a key for a
particular item, such as an automobile, then nothing should change once the tag is linked with that item.
If the access control application allows a security administrator to change someone’s access to different
areas and rooms based on changing business roles, then the system must store data related to the access
rules.

In general, the implementation specifics rather than the application type determine the extent to which
data must be modified. When data elements change, the supporting technology must support write
transactions and must have an access control mechanism to protect the integrity of the data. Sections
5.3.1 and 5.3.3.1 provide information on authentication and access control methods. When an element
does not change, it does not require this support. Organizations planning RFID implementations should
analyze what data is required to support the business process and which elements must be modifiable.
One important factor is whether tags and their identifiers will be used once and discarded, or reused. The
results of this exercise will help organizations identify appropriate RFID technology and security
mechanisms to meet their requirements.

3.3     RFID Transaction Environment

The conditions under which readers query tags are a significant determinant of an RFID system’s
technology requirements. The most important parameters regarding the RFID transaction environment
include:

 The distance between the reader and the tag,
 The amount of time in which a transaction must be completed, and
 Whether or not the reader has access to a network and can use the network to store related data.
Sections 3.3.1 through 3.3.3 discuss these parameters.

3.3.1    Distance between Reader and Tag

Distance requirements often determine the type of tag that can be deployed. The distance between the
reader and the tag also has security implications. In general, longer distances between the reader and the
tag could make it easier for an adversary to eavesdrop on their communications. Longer distances also
allow an adversary to use their own reader to perform unauthorized transactions more easily (as discussed
in Section 2.3.3.3).

In some cases, the RFID system designer has considerable latitude in setting the distance between reader
and tag. For example, an application controlling access to a garage might require drivers to place an
RFID-enabled badge within inches of a reader or it might require a general proximity of several feet to a
