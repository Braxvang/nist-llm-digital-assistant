 Boundary Protection                 Monitoring and control of communications at the external
                                     boundary of an information system to prevent and detect
                                     malicious and other unauthorized communications, through the
                                     use of boundary protection devices (e.g., proxies, gateways,
                                     routers, firewalls, guards, encrypted tunnels).
 Boundary Protection                 A device with appropriate mechanisms that: (i) facilitates the
 Device                              adjudication of different interconnected system security policies
                                     (e.g., controlling the flow of information into or out of an
                                     interconnected system); and/or (ii) monitors and controls
                                     communications at the external boundary of an information
                                     system to prevent and detect malicious and other unauthorized
                                     communications. Boundary protection devices include such
                                     components as proxies, gateways, routers, firewalls, guards, and
                                     encrypted tunnels.
 Certification                       A comprehensive assessment of the management, operational,
 [FIPS 200, NIST SP 800-37]          and technical security controls in an information system, made in
                                     support of security accreditation, to determine the extent to which
                                     the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and
                                     producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the
                                     security requirements for the system.
 Certification Agent                 The individual, group, or organization responsible for conducting
 [NIST SP 800-37]                    a security certification.
 Certification Practice              A statement of the practices that a Certification Authority
 Statement                           employs in issuing, suspending, revoking, and renewing
                                     certificates and providing access to them, in accordance with
                                     specific requirements (i.e., requirements specified in a certificate
                                     policy or requirements specified in a contract for services).
 Chief Information Officer           Agency official responsible for:
 [PL 104-106, Sec. 5125(b)]          (i) Providing advice and other assistance to the head of the
                                     executive agency and other senior management personnel of the
                                     agency to ensure that information technology is acquired and
                                     information resources are managed in a manner that is consistent
                                     with laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, and
                                     priorities established by the head of the agency;
                                     (ii) Developing, maintaining, and facilitating the implementation
                                     of a sound and integrated information technology architecture for
                                     the agency; and
                                     (iii) Promoting the effective and efficient design and operation of
                                     all major information resources management processes for the
                                     agency, including improvements to work processes of the agency.
