                                                  GUIDELINES FOR SECURING W IRELESS LOCAL AREA NETWORKS (WLANS)


Executive Summary

A wireless local area network (WLAN) is a group of wireless networking devices within a limited
geographic area, such as an office building, that exchange data through radio communications. WLAN
technologies are based on the IEEE 802.11 standard and its amendments.1 The fundamental components
of an IEEE 802.11 WLAN (hereafter referred to as a “WLAN” in this publication) are client devices, such
as laptops and smartphones, and access points (APs), which logically connect client devices with a
distribution system, typically the organization’s wired network infrastructure. Some WLANs also use
wireless switches, which act as intermediaries between APs and the distribution system.

The security of each WLAN is heavily dependent on how well each WLAN component—including client
devices, APs, and wireless switches—is secured throughout the WLAN lifecycle, from initial WLAN
design and deployment through ongoing maintenance and monitoring. Unfortunately, WLANs are
typically less secure than their wired counterparts for several reasons, including the ease of access to the
WLAN and the weak security configurations often used for WLANs (to favor convenience over security).
The purpose of this publication is to help organizations improve their WLAN security by providing
recommendations for WLAN security configuration and monitoring. This publication supplements other
NIST publications by consolidating and strengthening their key recommendations.

Organizations should implement the following guidelines to improve the security of their WLANs.

Have standardized security configurations for common WLAN components, such as client devices
and APs.

A standardized configuration provides a base level of security, reducing vulnerabilities and lessening the
impact of successful attacks. Standardized configurations can also significantly reduce the time and effort
needed to secure WLAN components and verify their security, particularly if the configuration can be
deployed and verified through automated means.

When planning WLAN security, consider the security not only of the WLAN itself, but also how it
may affect the security of other networks.

A WLAN is usually connected to an organization’s wired networks, and WLANs may also be connected
to each other. For WLANs that need wired network access, their client devices should be allowed access
only to the necessary hosts on the wired network using only the required protocols. Also, an organization
should have separate WLANs if there is more than one security profile for WLAN usage; for example, an
organization should have logically separated WLANs for external use (such as guests) and internal use.
Devices on one WLAN should not be able to connect to devices on a logically separated WLAN.

Have policies that clearly state which forms of dual connections are permitted or prohibited for
WLAN client devices, and enforce these policies through the appropriate security controls.

The term “dual connected” generally refers to a client device that is connected to both a wired network
and a WLAN at the same time. If an attacker gains unauthorized wireless access to a dual-connected
client device, the attacker could then use it to access or attack resources on the wired network.
Organizations should consider the risks posed not only by the traditional form of dual connectness, but
also by other forms involving multiple wireless networks. It is common today for client devices to be
connected to multiple wireless networks simultaneously, such as cell phone, WiMAX, Bluetooth, and
WLAN networks. Organizations should assess the risk of the possible combinations of network
