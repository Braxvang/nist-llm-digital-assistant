September 2023

            section chief or member; and public information, safety, or liaison
            officer.
            To support a response in an OT environment, an organization should
            consider including the following personnel in the response plan.
            Internal Resources
                   •   Designated Incident Commander
                   •   Operations leadership
                   •   Safety personnel
                   •   On-call OT systems personnel
                   •   On-call IT personnel
                   •   Physical security personnel
                   •   Administrative personnel
                   •   Procurement personnel
                   •   Public relations personnel
                   •   Legal personnel
            External Industry Partners
                   •   OT technical support (e.g., vendors, integrators)
                   •   Operational supply chain (e.g., suppliers, customers, distributors,
                       business partners)
                   •   Incident response team
                   •   Surge support
                   •   Impacted community (e.g., facility neighbors)
            Organizations are required to report incidents involving federal agencies
            in accordance with PPD-21 [PPD-21] and PPD-41 [PPD-41]. CISA
            maintains the list of sector-specific contacts.
            Legal departments can often assist with developing non-disclosure
            agreements or other contracts if an organization plans to utilize external
            resources for incident response. It may be beneficial to develop these
            contracts prior to an incident occurring so that incident response can be
            immediate. Private companies can be held on retainer in case of an OT
            incident.
