Special Publication 800-73-4      Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification – Part 1: PIV
                               Card Application Namespace, Data Model and Representation

    +   The optional DUNS and Organizational Identifier fields are deprecated and will be eliminated
        in a future version of SP 800-73.
    +   The Global Unique Identification number (GUID) field must be present, and shall include a
        Card Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) (see Section 3.4.1).
    +   The Expiration Date is mapped to the reserved for future use (RFU) tag 0x35, keeping that
        within the existing scope of the TIG SCEPACS specification. This field shall be 8 bytes in
        length and shall be encoded in ASCII as YYYYMMDD. The expiration date shall be the
        same as printed on the card.
    +   The optional Cardholder UUID field is mapped to RFU tag 0x36. If present, it shall include a
        Cardholder UUID as described in Section 3.4.2.
    +   The CHUID shall be signed in accordance with Section 3.1.2.1. The card issuer’s digital
        signature key shall be used to sign the CHUID and the associated certificate shall be placed in
        the signature field of the CHUID.
3.1.2.1 Asymmetric Signature Field in CHUID

FIPS 201 requires inclusion of the asymmetric signature field in the CHUID data object. The
asymmetric signature data element of the CHUID shall be encoded as a Cryptographic Message
Syntax (CMS) external digital signature, as defined in RFC 5652 [RFC5652].

The issuer asymmetric signature field is implemented as a SignedData type, as specified in
[RFC5652], and shall include the following information:

    +   The message shall include a version field specifying version v3
    +   The digestAlgorithms field shall be as specified in [SP800-78]
    +   The encapContentInfo shall:

        –   Specify an eContentType of id-PIV-CHUIDSecurityObject

        –   Omit the eContent field
    +   The certificates field shall include only a single X.509 certificate, which can be used to verify
        the signature in the SignerInfo field
    +   The crls field shall be omitted
    +   signerInfos shall be present and include only a single SignerInfo
    +   The SignerInfo shall:

        –   Use the issuerAndSerialNumber choice for SignerIdentifier

        –   Specify a digestAlgorithm in accordance with [SP800-78]

        –   Include, at a minimum, the following signed attributes:

            •   A MessageDigest attribute containing the hash computed in accordance with
                [SP800-78]
