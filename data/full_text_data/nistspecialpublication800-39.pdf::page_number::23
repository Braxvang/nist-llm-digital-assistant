executive steering committee, executive leadership council).29 The risk executive (function) fits
into the organizational governance structure in such a way as to facilitate efficiency and to
maximize effectiveness. While the organization-wide scope situates the risk executive (function)
at Tier 1, its role entails ongoing communications with and oversight of the risk management
activities of mission/business owners, authorizing officials, information system owners, common
control providers, chief information officers, chief information security officers, information
system and security engineers, information system security managers/officers, and other
stakeholders at Tiers 2 and 3.


     To be effective, organization‐wide risk management programs require the strong commitment,
     direct involvement, and ongoing support from senior leaders/executives. The objective is to
     institutionalize risk management into the day‐to‐day operations of organizations as a priority and
     an integral part of how organizations conduct operations in cyberspace—recognizing that this is
     essential in order to successfully carry out missions in threat‐laden operational environments.



2.3.3 Risk Management Strategy
An organizational risk management strategy, one of the key outputs of risk framing, addresses
how organizations intend to assess, respond to, and monitor risk—the risk associated with the
operation and use of organizational information systems. The risk management strategy makes
explicit the specific assumptions, constraints, risk tolerances, and priorities/trade-offs used within
organizations for making investment and operational decisions. The risk management strategy
also includes any strategic-level decisions and considerations on how senior leaders/executives
are to manage information security risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other
organizations, and the Nation. An organization-wide risk management strategy includes, for
example, an unambiguous expression of the risk tolerance for the organization, acceptable risk
assessment methodologies, risk response strategies, a process for consistently evaluating risk
across the organization with respect to the organization’s risk tolerance, and approaches for
monitoring risk over time. The use of a risk executive (function) can facilitate consistent,
organization-wide application of the risk management strategy. The organization-wide risk
management strategy can be informed by risk-related inputs from other sources both internal and
external to the organization to ensure the strategy is both broad-based and comprehensive.

An important Tier 1 risk management activity and also part of risk framing, is the determination
of risk tolerance. Risk tolerance is the level of risk or degree of uncertainty that is acceptable to
organizations and is a key element of the organizational risk frame. Risk tolerance affects all
components of the risk management process—having a direct impact on the risk management
decisions made by senior leaders/executives throughout the organization and providing important
constraints on those decisions. For example, risk tolerance affects the nature and extent of risk
management oversight implemented in organizations, the extent and rigor of risk assessments
performed, and the content of organizational strategies for responding to risk. With regard to risk
assessments, more risk-tolerant organizations may be concerned only with those threats that peer
organizations have experienced while less risk-tolerant organizations may expand the list to
include those threats that are theoretically possible, but which have not been observed in
operational environments. With regard to risk response, less risk-tolerant organizations are likely

   Organizations emphasize the need for inclusiveness within the risk executive (function) by senior leaders/executives
in mission/business areas to help ensure proper information security planning, resourcing, and risk management.
