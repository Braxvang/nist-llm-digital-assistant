NIST SP 800-186                                                  Discrete Logarithm-based Cryptography:
February 2023                                                          Elliptic Curve Domain Parameters

   2. Point Q

Output: ACCEPT or REJECT Q as an affine point on MA,B.

Process:

   1. If Q is the point at infinity ∅, output REJECT.
   2. Let Q = (u, v). Verify that both u and v are integers in the interval [0, p−1]. Output
      REJECT if verification fails.
   3. Verify that (u, v) is a point on MA,B by checking that (u, v) satisfies the defining equation
      Bv2 = u (u2 + A u + 1), where computations are carried out in GF(p). Output REJECT if
      verification fails.
   4. Otherwise, output ACCEPT.

D.1.2.2.          Full Public Key Validation
Inputs:
   1. Montgomery curve MA,B defined over the prime field GF(p)
   2. Point Q

Output: ACCEPT or REJECT Q as a point on MA,B of order n.

Process:

   1. Perform partial public key validation on Q using the procedure of Appendix D.1.2.1.
      Output REJECT if this procedure outputs REJECT.
   2. Verify that n Q = ∅. Output REJECT if verification fails.
   3. Otherwise, output ACCEPT.

D.1.3. Twisted Edwards Curves

D.1.3.1.          Partial Public Key Validation
Inputs:
   1. Edwards curve Ea,d defined over the prime field GF(p)
   2. Point Q

Output: ACCEPT or REJECT Q as an affine point on Ea,d.

Process:

   1. Verify that both x and y are integers in the interval [0, p−1]. Output REJECT if
      verification fails.
   2. Let Q = (x, y). Verify that (x, y) is a point on Ea,d by checking that (x, y) satisfies the
      defining equation a x2 + y2 = 1+ d x2 y2, where computations are carried out in GF(p).
      Output REJECT if verification fails.
