incidents. Because IDS and IPS systems offer many of the same capabilities, they are often collectively
called intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS). When an IDPS detects a potential incident, it
notifies administrators through IDPS console messages, emails, pages, or other mechanisms.

The two types of IDPSs most relevant for email security are host-based and network-based. 44 A host-
based IDPS monitors the characteristics of a single host and the events occurring within that host to
identify and stop suspicious activity. Host-based IDPS software must be installed on each individual
computer that is to be monitored or protected. Host-based IDPSs are very closely integrated with the
operating system of the host computer they protect. Thus, a host-based IDPS must be designed
specifically for each operating system (and often each version of that operating system). Host-based
IDPSs monitor various aspects of hosts, such as network traffic, system logs, running processes, file
access and modification, and system and application configuration changes.

Host-based IDPSs are especially useful when most of the network traffic to and from the mail server is
encrypted (e.g., SSL/TLS or S/MIME is in use) because the functionality and capability of network-based
IDPSs (see below) are severely limited when network traffic is encrypted. Also, because they are located
on the server, host-based IDPSs can detect some attacks and penetration attempts not recognized by
network-based IDPSs. Unfortunately, host-based IDPSs can have a negative impact on host performance.
In general, enabling more extensive detection capabilities and monitoring more events cause a greater
negative impact on the performance of the host. Host-based IDPSs may not detect some network-based
attacks such as certain DoS attacks. If a host-based IDPS is on a mail server that is compromised, it is
very likely that the attacker will also compromise the IDPS itself and vice versa.

A network-based IDPS monitors network traffic for particular network segments or network devices and
analyzes the network and application protocol activity to identify and stop suspicious activity. Most
network-based IDPSs use predefined “attack signatures” to detect and identify attacks. Attack signatures
are patterns that correspond to known types of intrusions. Network-based IDPSs also use other detection
methods to identify anomalous activity, protocol violations, and other unusual activity.

Unlike a host-based IDPS, a network-based IDPS can monitor network activity for many hosts
simultaneously. Network-based IDPSs can usually detect more network-based attacks and can more
easily provide a comprehensive picture of the current attacks against a network. Since network-based
IDPSs are installed on dedicated hosts, they do not have a negative effect on the performance of the mail
server host and are not immediately compromised by a successful attack on the mail server.

Network-based IDPSs do have some limitations. The timing of an attack can have a significant effect on
the ability of a network-based IDPS to detect an attack. For example, if an attacker spreads out the timing
of his attack over a period of hours or days, the attack may not be detected by the IDPS. Network
configuration, such as the use of asymmetric routing, can have a negative effect on the ability of a
network-based IDPS to detect attacks. Network-based IDPSs are also more susceptible to being disabled
by DoS attacks (even those not directly targeted at the IDPS). Also, depending on how the network-based
IDPS is integrated into the network, it is possible to negatively impact the availability of the network in
the event of an IDPS hardware failure.

Most host-based and network-based IDPSs require frequent updates to their attack signature databases so
that they can recognize new attacks. An IDPS that is not updated frequently will fail to recognize the
latest (and often most popular) attacks. Both types of IDPSs may be limited in their ability to detect zero-

     Other major IDPS categories include wireless IDPS, which examines wireless networking protocols only, and network
     behavior analysis software, which monitors network traffic flows for flow anomalies. Neither of these types of IDPS
     technologies analyzes email activity.
