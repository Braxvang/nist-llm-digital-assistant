with unencrypted data on a single computer. In addition, both approaches require all par-
ticipants to agree in advance on the computation to be performed. Nevertheless, both ap-
proaches are now suffciently performant that they can be used for many practical kinds of
privacy-preserving data analysis.28
Note that even when secure computing approaches are employed, the outputs of the compu-
tations can still compromise privacy if they are not protected with a formal privacy mecha-
nism, such as differential privacy.

ment to advance their use, see the National Strategy to Advance Privacy-Preserving Data
Sharing and Analytics [41].

3.9.3.    Trusted Execution Environments
Trusted execution environments (TEEs) (also called trusted hardware enclaves or secure
hardware enclaves) are another approach for computing encrypted data. TEEs are imple-
mented in computer hardware, typically within the silicon of a modern central processing
unit (CPU), and protect programs that run on that CPU from the surrounding environment.
For example, a TEE can cause data from a computer’s CPU to be automatically encrypted
when written to main memory and decrypted when read back to the CPU. In this way, data
in memory are protected from other devices that can access memory, such as a network
interface card. In addition to encryption, TEEs typically support attestation so that a pro-
gram running on a TEE can attest to a remote system that the result is a true, legitimate,
and faithful execution of the program.
Traditional cloud services require trusting the cloud provider, who may have a compro-
mised environment (e.g., an operating system that records encryption keys). A TEE de-
creases the need for trust because it allows a user to validate that they are communicating
with the remote program and offers assurance that no other program running on the cloud
provider can access the program’s data. Secure enclaves can thus allow untrusted infras-
tructure to operate on sensitive data in much the same way as technologies like FHE and
MPC.
Intel’s Software Guard Extensions (SGX) [140], ARM’s TrustZone [131], and AMD’s Se-
cure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) [13] are all examples of secure hardware enclaves.
All of these products are designed to provide similar security to cryptographic techniques
while also providing performance similar to a single CPU operating on unencrypted data.
These secure hardware products are necessarily complex, and various implementation er-
rors have been discovered that can allow attackers to defeat their security protections. Se-
cure hardware enclaves certainly offer increased security for data compared to plaintext
