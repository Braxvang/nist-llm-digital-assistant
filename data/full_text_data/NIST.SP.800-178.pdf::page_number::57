                                                                                               XACML does not allow policies to be modified by ordinary users. NGAC manages its access

                                                                                               users possess varying flavors of capabilities to access resource objects and access control data

                                                                                               their own policies. Examples of the latter extreme include social networking, messaging, and

                                                                                               Consider the NGAC expression, shown in Figure 8, of the equivalent XACML Policy1 specified
                                                                                               in Section 3.4. NGAC expresses the policy using five association relations, while XACML uses
                                                                                               just three rules. Note that as the number of Wards that are considered by the policy increases, so
                                                                                               will the number of NGAC association relations, but the number of XACML rules will always
