6. What is an IT security arrangement?

   An IT security arrangement is the result of the identification of an IT security service requirement and
   a decision on the way in which the organization will perform this service requirement. There are any
   number of service arrangements from which IT security managers may choose. An organization may
   select its internal employees and teams to provide the service required, it may choose to fully use an
   external service provider, or it may choose something in between with both external and internal
   employees performing an IT security service role.

7. Does the IT security services guide recommend “outsourcing” IT security services?

   No. The guide does not prescribe a specific service, service level, service mix, service arrangement,
   service agreement or service provider. Rather, it provides a methodology for assessing, analyzing and
   selecting IT security services appropriate for each organization. There are too many issues and too
   many variables for any document to prescribe what is best for a given organization. IT security
   managers and other senior officials should assess the risks and benefits of each alternative and select
   the most appropriate alternative for the organization.

8. What are some of the tools managers might use to manage IT security services?

   The guide discusses several tools managers might use to manage IT security services including the IT
   security services life cycle framework, metrics, and service agreements.

9. What are metrics?

   Metrics are a management tool that facilitates decision-making and accountability through practical,
   relevant data collection, data analysis, and performance data reporting. An example of a metric for a
   management service, a training and awareness program, might be the number of new employees who
   receive IT security training within their first 30 days on the job. Gathering this metric repeatedly,
   over time, will allow managers to assess how well the current training service provider performs its
   task today, to set targets for the service provider in the future, and then to assess how well it met the
   desired target.

10. What issues/factors affect IT security service decisions?

   There are innumerable factors that affect IT security service decisions and will vary by service,
   service arrangement and type of organization. Generally speaking, the factors and issues can be
   grouped into the following categories:

    Strategic/Mission–related to the organization’s mission and business function.
    Budgetary/Funding–related to cost, funding, and value of IT security
    Technical/Architectural–related to the technical and architectural environment of the organization
    Organizational/Cultural–related to the intangibles of the organization such as image, reputation,
     and resiliency
    Personnel–related to the organization’s contractors and employees
    Policy/Process–related to the organization’s business and IT security policies and procedures.
