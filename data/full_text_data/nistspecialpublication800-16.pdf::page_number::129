    Training Area: System Life Cycle Security             — Test & Evaluate
    Functional Specialty: Design & Develop

    Definition   —        The system life cycle is a model for building and operating an FT system
                          from its initial inception to its termination and disposal of assets. The
                          model includes six phases: Initiation, Development, Test and Evaluation,
                          Implementation, Operations, and Termination. Life cycle security is the
                          ensemble of processes and procedures which ensures data confidentiality, as
                          needed, as well as data and system integrity, and availability.


                          The test and evaluation phase is the series of steps followed to ensure that
                          the design and construction of a new or modified information system or
                          technology has successfully incorporated appropriate security safeguards.

    Beliavioral Outcome        —   Individuals are able to design tests to evaluate the adequacy of
                                   security safeguards in IT systems.

    Sample Learning Objectives —

    At the conclusion of this module, individuals will be able to:

    1.    Beginning   — Design and develop      tests for security safeguard performance under normal

          operating circumstances and workload levels.


    2.    Intermediate   — Design and develop     tests for security safeguard performance under

          abnormal, unusual, improbable, and/or illegal circumstances.


    3.    Advanced    — Ensure   that all security-related elements (e.g., system components,
          documentation) will be effectively tested.
