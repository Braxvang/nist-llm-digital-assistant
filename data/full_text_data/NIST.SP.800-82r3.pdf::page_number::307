  SC-45 (1)
               AUTHORITATIVE TIME SOURCE

OT Discussion: Organizations coordinate time synchronization on OT to allow for accurate
troubleshooting and forensics.
Control Enhancement: (1) OT Discussion: Syncing with an authoritative time source may be
selected as a control when data is being correlated across organizational boundaries. OT employ
suitable mechanisms (e.g., GPS, IEEE 1588) for timestamps.
Rationale for adding SC-45 to LOW, MOD, and HIGH baselines: Organizations may find
relative system time beneficial for many OT systems to ensure the safe and reliable delivery of
essential functions. Time synchronization can also make root cause analysis more efficient by
ensuring that audit logs from different systems are aligned so that organizations have an accurate
view of events across multiple systems when the logs are aggregated.
SC-47 ALTERNATE COMMUNICATIONS PATHS
                                                                              SUPPLEMENTED

 SC-47        Alternate Communications Paths                                                    Add

OT Discussion: Organizations consider which systems require alternate communication paths to
ensure that a loss of communication does not lead to an unacceptable loss of view or control or to
a safety event.
Rationale for adding SC-47 to HIGH baseline: For continuity of operations during an incident,
organizations should consider establishing alternate communications paths for command-and-
control purposes to continue to operate and take appropriate actions for high-impact systems
when the loss of availability or integrity may result in severe or catastrophic adverse impacts,
including impacts to safety and critical service delivery.
SC-51 HARDWARE-BASED PROTECTION
                                                                              SUPPLEMENTED
  CNTL                          CONTROL NAME                                CONTROL BASELINES
   NO.                       Control Enhancement Name
                                                                          LOW         MOD         HIGH

 SC-51        Hardware-Based Protection

OT Discussion: Some OT systems support write-protection by implementing physical key
switches or write-protect switches. Organizations define the systems for which write-protection
will be enabled and develop a process for how to take the system out of write-protect mode.
