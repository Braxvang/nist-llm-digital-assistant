             The Technical Specification for the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.1



  2. The @start-time and @end-time attributes SHALL be provided to indicate when the scan
     started and completed, respectively.

  3. The @test-system attribute SHALL be provided with a CPE Name value indicating the
     product that evaluated the checklist.

  4. If the <xccdf:TestResult> is the root XCCDF element, the <xccdf:benchmark>
     element‘s @href attribute SHALL be an absolute URL, NOT a relative URL.

  5. Regarding the definition and use of <xccdf:Profile> elements:

      a. If no <xccdf:Profile> was selected, then the <xccdf:Profile> SHALL be omitted.
      b. When using a profile during the processing of XCCDF content, the test results SHALL
         embed an <xccdf:profile> element that contains the name of the utilized profile.
      c. Reported rule results SHALL include all selected rules within the specified Profile.
      d. Reported value-settings SHALL include all those values that are exported by the reported
         rules. The specific settings are those determined by the reported Profile.

  6. The <xccdf:identity> element SHALL identify the security principal used to access rule
     evaluation on the target(s).

  7. Each IP address associated with the <xccdf:target> SHALL be enumerated using the
     <xccdf:target-address> element.

  8. The <xccdf:rule-result> elements SHALL report the result of the application of each
     selected rule against all specified targets.

          a. The @idref attribute of the <xccdf:rule-result> SHALL identify the selected
             rule.
          b. If an evaluated rule references a check system (e.g., OVAL, OCIL) that the SCAP
             implementation does not support, the implementation SHALL return a result of
             ―notchecked‖ for each such rule.

          c. The <xccdf:check/xccdf:check-content-ref> element SHALL record the
             reference to the check system specific result file and check name within the result file
             using the @href and @name attributes, respectively. This approach provides traceability
             between XCCDF and check results.

  9. Where applicable to the target system, each of the following <xccdf:fact> elements SHALL
     be provided:
