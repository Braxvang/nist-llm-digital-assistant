       November 2023

1852         Media Protection

1853   3.8.1. Media Storage
1854           REQUIREMENT: 03.08.01

1855           ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE
1856           Determine if:
1857           A.03.08.01[01]: system media that contain CUI are physically controlled until the media are
1858           sanitized or destroyed using approved equipment, techniques, and procedures.
1859           A.03.08.01[02]: system media that contain CUI are securely stored until the media are sanitized
1860           or destroyed using approved equipment, techniques, and procedures.

1861           ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS
1862           Examine
1863           [SELECT FROM: physical protection policy and procedures; media protection policy and
1864           procedures; procedures for media storage; access control policy and procedures; system media;
1865           system security plan; other relevant documents or records]
1866           Interview
1867           [SELECT FROM: personnel with system media protection and storage responsibilities; personnel
1868           with information security responsibilities]
1869           Test
1870           [SELECT FROM: processes for storing information media; mechanisms for supporting and/or
1871           implementing secure media storage/media protection]

1879           ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS
1880           Examine
1881           [SELECT FROM: physical protection policy and procedures; media protection policy and
1882           procedures; procedures for media access restrictions; access control policy and procedures;
1883           media storage facilities; access control records; system security plan; other relevant documents
1884           or records]
