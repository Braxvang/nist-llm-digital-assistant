     IMPERATIVE 8
     Securing Emerging Technologies

     Information technology is always rapidly evolving. The extraordinary growth of smart,
     connected technologies is a particularly promising and concerning arena since any
     small, connected element is a potential point of vulnerability to the local system and all
     connected systems. Recent attacks on major network providers have included sustained
     cyber-attacks launched through fringe (but connected) parts of the system. These
     have included WiFi controllers, closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras, printers, and
     baby monitors. NIST focused significant attention in FY18 on emerging network security
     topics, such as cybersecurity for the Internet of Things (IoT), low-power wide-area
     networks, public safety broadband networks, fog computing, and quantum computing.
     In FY19, more effort will shift to cybersecurity issues associated with the potential for 5G
     networks on security requirements of new use cases and new network architectures as
     well as the impact of artificial intelligence and machine learning on cyber defenses.
          â€¢    Cybersecurity for IoT. In FY18, to help federal agencies and other organizations
               better understand and manage the cybersecurity and privacy risks associated with
               their IoT devices, NIST published NISTIR 822876 for review and comment by
               industry and the public. Also in FY18, NIST initiated an Identity and Access
               Management for Smart Home Devices77 project and a feasibility demonstration
               project mapped to NISTIR 8228 that shows how to use existing security protocols
               to reduce opportunities for malicious access to IoT devices from the internet. That
               set the stage for publishing the resulting practice guide, SP 1800-15,78 in FY19 for
               review and comment by industry and the public. The guide is being expanded to
               include improved support for small business environments, control of access to
               and by IoT devices that do not yet support the Manufacturer Usage Description
               (MUD) protocol, and access to and utilization of threat signaling capabilities. NIST
               also co-chairs the IoT Task Group of the Interagency International Cybersecurity
               Standardization Working Group (IICS WG) with the Department of Homeland
               Security (DHS). In addition, NIST is actively engaging public and private sector
               stakeholders to better understand the IoT threat landscape and challenges (see
               the draft of NISTIR 8200).79 In FY19, after considering public comments, NIST plans
               to publish final versions of those documents and continue collaborating with
               stakeholders in developing guidance for IoT security and privacy.
