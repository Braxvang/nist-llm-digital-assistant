       December 2022                                                     Federation and Assertions


1091   5.5. Privacy Requirements
1092   The ultimate goal of a subscriber is to interact with and use the RP. Federation involves
1093   the transfer of personal attributes from a third party that is not otherwise involved in a
1094   transaction — the IdP. Federation also potentially gives the IdP broad visibility into
1095   subscriber activities and status. Accordingly, there are specific privacy requirements
1096   associated with federation.
1097   Communication between the RP and the IdP could reveal to the IdP where the subscriber
1098   is conducting a transaction. Communication with multiple RPs allows the IdP to build
1099   a profile of subscriber transactions that would not have existed without federation. This
1100   aggregation could enable new opportunities for subscriber tracking and use of profile
1101   information that do not always align with subscribers’ privacy interests.
1102   If an IdP discloses information on subscriber activities at an RP to any party, or processes
1103   the subscriber’s attributes for any purpose other than identity proofing, authentication,
1104   or attribute assertions (collectively “identity service”), related fraud mitigation, to
1105   comply with law or legal process, or, in the case of a specific user request, to transmit
1106   the information, the IdP SHALL implement measures to maintain predictability and
1107   manageability commensurate with the privacy risk arising from the additional processing.
1108   Measures MAY include providing clear notice, obtaining subscriber consent, or enabling
1109   selective use or disclosure of attributes. When an IdP uses consent measures, the IdP
1110    SHALL NOT make consent for the additional processing a condition of the identity
1111   service.
1112   If the same subscriber account is asserted to multiple RPs, and those RPs communicate
1113   with each other, the colluding RPs could track a subscriber’s activity across multiple
1114   applications and security domains. The IdP SHOULD employ technical measures, such as
1115   the use of pairwise pseudonymous identifiers described in Sec. 6.2.5 or privacy-enhancing
1116   cryptographic protocols, to provide disassociability and discourage subscriber activity
1117   tracking and profiling between RPs.
1118   An IdP MAY disclose information on subscriber activities to RPs for security purposes,
1119   such as communication of suspicious activity or a compromised subscriber account
1120   as described in Sec. 5.7, if stated within the trust agreement. An RP MAY disclose
1121   information on subscriber activities to IdPs for security purposes, such as communication
1122   of suspicious activity or a compromised RP subscriber account, if stated within the trust
1123   agreement.
1124   An IdP SHOULD signal subscriber account termination to RPs that have been
1125   provisioned with federated identifiers bound to that subscriber account using shared
1126   signaling as discussed in Sec. 5.7. RPs that receive such a signal from the IdP SHALL
1127   terminate the RP subscriber account and remove all personal information associated with
1128   the RP subscriber account, except what is required for audit and security purposes.
1129   The following requirements apply specifically to federal agencies:

                                                   30
