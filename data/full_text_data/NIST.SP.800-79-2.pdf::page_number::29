Special Publication 800-79-2                                            Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card Issuers
                                                                                         and Derived PIV Credential Issuers



3. TAXONOMY OF ISSUER CONTROLS

3.1 Introducing Issuer Controls

Assessment of a PIV Card or Derived PIV Credential Issuer is a broader endeavor than
assessment of the security of an information system under [SP 800-37-1]. The requirements
specified in [FIPS201-2] cover all major aspects of an issuer, including organizational
preparedness; security management and data protection; infrastructure; and issuance processes.
Each broad area is defined herein as an Issuer Authorization Topic (IAT). In addition to
providing structure to the assessment, IATs are also used to summarize the assessment results for
reporting. In addition, they are used to structure the report to senior organization management
that provides an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses within an issuer organization.

The Issuer Authorization Topics (IAT):

          Organizational Preparedness relates to the capability, knowledge, and understanding of
           senior management regarding the formation and operation of the issuer. Roles and
           responsibilities must be clearly identified, and policies and procedures must be defined,
           documented, implemented, and enforced.

          Security Management & Data Protection involves implementing and operating
           appropriate security management procedures, operational controls, and technical
           protection measures to ensure that privacy requirements are satisfied, the rights of
           individuals are assured, and personal data is protected.

          Infrastructure Elements represents the activities required to procure, deploy, and
           maintain the information system components used for issuance of PIV Cards or Derived
           PIV Credentials tokens. These information system components (e.g., PKI, biometrics,
           card or token personalization, etc.) must meet the technical specifications defined in
           [FIPS 201-2] and related documents and need to be authorized under [SP 800-37-1] for
           FISMA compliance.

          Processes are classes of functions that collectively span the entire lifecycle activities,15
           such as sponsorship, identity proofing/registration, adjudication, card /token production,
           activation/issuance, and maintenance of the PIV Card and the Derived PIV Credential.

Each IAT is sub-divided into one or more Authorization Focus Areas. A focus area is a set of
closely-related requirements that need to be met by an issuer. Under each focus area is a
procedure or technical product (termed an “Issuer Control”) that is used to satisfy a particular
requirement listed under a focus area. However, the manner in which the requirements are
satisfied and how the specifications are implemented and managed may vary from organization
to organization.
