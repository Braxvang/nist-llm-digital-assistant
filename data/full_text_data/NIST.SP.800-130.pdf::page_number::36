SP 800-130                                                             August 2013



FR:4.23 If multilevel security domains are supported, the CKMS design shall specify
how it maintains the separation of the keys and metadata belonging to each security level.

4.9.6 Upgrading and Downgrading
Under certain conditions, a domain authority may decide that a key and/or metadata from
an entity in a lower-level security domain (a domain providing less protection) can be
accepted and subsequently protected at the higher level required by its own Domain
Security Policy. This process is called upgrading. Upgrading is not without risk and
should only be done if the authority responsible for the higher-level domain has trust and
confidence in the source and authenticity of the key and/or metadata from the lower level.
A mistake in judgment by the domain authority could result in security compromises to
the domain entities. Likewise, under certain conditions, the domain authority for a
higher-level security domain may wish to pass a key and/or metadata down, or
downgrade, to a lower-level domain entity. In this case, the domain authority for the
higher-level domain should have confidence that the key and/or metadata being passed
down only require the lower level of security provided by the receiver.

FR:4.24 The CKMS design shall specify if and how it supports the upgrading or
downgrading of keys and metadata.

FR:4.25 The CKMS design shall specify how upgrading or downgrading capabilities are
restricted to the domain authority.

4.9.7 Changing Domain Security Policies
From time to time, it may be desirable to modify or update a Domain Security Policy.
The update may be the result of a management decision to upgrade the protections
provided to the keys and metadata elements, it may be the result of a desire to be
equivalent with another security domain, or it may be to support a new application.

Some CKMS may be designed so that their domain security policies may be configured
to permit communications with entities in different domains. For example, a security
domain may allow certain management officials to select the key and/or metadata
management functions that are used to support various applications. These domains are
said to be configurable. Even if a specific Domain Security Policy change is within the
capability of a configurable system, the domain management personnel should still
approve any policy change before the change is made.

FR:4.26 The CKMS design shall specify if and how its key and/or metadata management
functions may be configured to support differing domain security policies and differing
applications.

FR:4.27 The CKMS design shall specify if and how it can support changes in its Domain
Security Policy by being reconfigured to accommodate communications with entities in
different security domains.
