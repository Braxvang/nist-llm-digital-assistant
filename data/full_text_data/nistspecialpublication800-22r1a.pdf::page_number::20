In general, the following notation is used throughout this document. However, the tests in this document
have been designed and described by multiple authors who may have used slightly different notation.
The reader is advised to consider the notation used for each test separate from that notation used in other
tests.

Symbol             Meaning
x                The floor function of x; for a given real positive x, x = x-g, where x
                   is a non-negative integer, and 0 ≤ g < 1.
α                  The significance level.
d                  The normalized difference between the observed and expected number of frequency
                   components. See Sections 2.6 and 3.6.
∇ψ2m(obs);         A measure of how well the observed values match the expected value. See Sections
∇ 2ψ2m(obs)        2.11 and 3.11.
E[ ]               The expected value of a random variable.
ε                  The original input string of zero and one bits to be tested.
εi                 The ith bit in the original sequence ε.
H0                 The null hypothesis; i.e., the statement that the sequence is random.
log(x)             The natural logarithm of x: log(x) = loge(x) = ln(x).
log2(x)                         ln( x )
                   Defined as           , where ln is the natural logarithm.
                                ln( 2 )
M                  The number of bits in a substring (block) being tested.
N                  The number of M-bit blocks to be tested.
n                  The number of bits in the stream being tested.
fn                 The sum of the log2 distances between matching L-bit templates, i.e., the sum of the
                   number of digits in the distance between L-bit templates. See Sections 2.9 and 3.9.
π                  3.14159… unless defined otherwise for a specific test.
σ                  The standard deviation of a random variable = ∫ (x − µ )2 f ( x )dx .
    2
σ                  The variance of a random variable = (standard deviation)2.
sobs               The observed value which is used as a statistic in the Frequency test.
Sn                 The nth partial sum for values Xi = {-1, +1}; i.e., the sum of the first n values of Xi.
Σ                  The summation symbol.
Φ                  Standard Normal Cumulative Distribution Function (see Section 5.5.3).
ξj                 The total number of times that a given state occurs in the identified cycles. See
                   Section 2.15 and 3.15.
Xi                 The elements of the string consisting of ±1 that is to be tested for randomness, where
                   Xi = 2εi-1.
