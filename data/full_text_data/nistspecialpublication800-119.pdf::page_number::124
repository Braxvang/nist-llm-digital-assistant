                                                                GUIDELINES FOR THE SECURE DEPLOYMENT OF IPV6


attacker community is attacking IPv6 implementations and using IPv6 to compromise systems.

The US-CERT whitepaper warned administrators that malware could use IPv6 for covert communications
and tunnel traffic out of IPv4 networks. The US-CERT cited two causes in the whitepaper:

 Most current operating systems now support IPv6 by default.
 Firewall and IDS equipment not configured to recognize IPv6 traffic could be bypassed.
The warning that attackers could use IPv6 to tunnel traffic did not surprise the security community. As
early as 200250, security researchers began documenting instances of attackers enabling IPv6 on
compromised systems to evade IPv4 security controls.

Also in 2005, a security researcher released an IPv6 attack toolkit at a security conference. This toolkit
includes tools to attack ICMPv6, detect IPv6 hosts, and hijack autoconfiguration.

These two events demonstrated that the attacker community is taking advantage of IPv6 and is developing
techniques and tools for exploitation. If an organization’s security controls are not already monitoring for
IPv6 traffic, then IPv6 traffic to and from client devices may not be detectable by existing security
controls. The mitigation for this risk is to reconfigure or deploy security controls to be both IPv4 and
IPv6 aware.

     6.1.2   Unauthorized IPv6 Clients

The Internet is actively deploying IPv6. IPv6 support is available for most operating systems. The
commands to enable IPv6 on these operating systems are easily accessible and user-friendly. Using IPv6
autoconfiguration, a host can configure its own global address if it is able to find a prefix.

Recent operating systems not only support IPv6 but also often enable IPv6 by default. This exposes
organizations to vulnerabilities it may not be able to detect or mitigate. The following options are
available to reduce this risk:

          Locate and disable any IPv6 enabled equipment.
          Block IPv6 and IPv6 tunnel traffic at the perimeter.
          Include IPv6 use policies in the organization’s security plan.
     6.1.3   Vulnerabilities in IPv6

The IETF regards security as an important design constraint when developing standards for IPv6. Work
to address a lack of confidentiality and integrity in IPv4 has resulted in the development of IPsec. IPv6
with IPsec resolves these issues, but IPsec has not addressed other weaknesses found in the TCP/IP
protocol stack.

IPv6 does not solve many traditional layer 2 attacks like sniffing traffic, traffic flooding, man-in-the-
middle attacks, rogue devices or Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) table overflow attacks. Some of
these attacks are dealt with partially in IPv6 while other attacks, similar in nature, exploit different
features.

Although most modern operating systems have supported IPv6 since at least 2003, the protocol stacks of
