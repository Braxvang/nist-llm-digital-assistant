NIST SP 800-82r3                                         Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

            regarding the employees and the public. The importance of safety and
            developing a safety culture plays a critical role in determining risk
            tolerance.
            Organizations should consider incorporating an analysis of cybersecurity
            effects on OT systems that impact personnel safety and the environment,
            as well as mitigating controls. More specifically, organizations may want
            to consider employing a comprehensive process to systematically predict
            or identify the operational behavior of each safety-critical failure
            condition, fault condition, or human error that could lead to a hazard or
            potential human harm.
            Organizations may also want to consider the impact of legacy systems
            and components on their environment. Specifically, legacy systems may
            be unable to adequately support cybersecurity to prevent risks from
            exceeding organizational tolerance levels.
            Another major concern for OT system operators is the availability of
            services provided by the OT system. The OT system may be part of
            critical infrastructure (e.g., water or power systems), where there is a
            significant need for continuous and reliable operations. As a result, OT
            systems may have strict requirements for availability or recovery.
            Organizations should understand and plan for the levels of redundancy
            required to achieve the desired resilience for their operating
            environments and incorporate these requirements into their risk framing.
            This will help organizations make risk decisions that avoid unintended
            consequences on those who depend on the services provided. More
            specifically, organizations should consider identifying interdependent
            OT systems that pose cybersecurity risks that threaten system
            availability.
            Additionally, organizations should consider how an incident could
            propagate to a connected system and system components. An OT may be
            interconnected with other systems, such that failures in one system or
            process can easily cascade to other systems either within or outside of
            the organization. Impact propagation could occur due to both physical
            and logical dependencies. Properly communicating the results of risk
            assessments to the operators of connected or interdependent systems and
            processes is one way to manage such impacts.
            Logical damage to an interconnected OT could occur if the cyber
            incident propagates to connected OT systems. For example, a virus or
            worm may propagate to a connected OT and impact that system.
            Physical damage could also propagate to other interconnected OT or
            related physical domains. For example, the impact could result in a
            physical hazard that degrades nearby physical environments or common
            shared dependencies (e.g., power supply) or result in a shortage of
            material that will be needed for a later stage in an industrial process.
