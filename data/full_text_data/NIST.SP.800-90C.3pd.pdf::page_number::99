       NIST SP 800-90C 3pd (Third Public Draft)                                       Recommendation for RBG Constructions
       September 2022

2844   known-answer test
2845   A test that uses a fixed input/output pair to detect whether a deterministic component was implemented correctly or
2846   to detect whether it continues to operate correctly.

2847   min-entropy
2848   A lower bound on the entropy of a random variable. The precise formulation for min-entropy is (âˆ’log2 max pi) for a
2849   discrete distribution having probabilities p1, ..., pk. Min-entropy is often used as a measure of the unpredictability of a
2850   random variable.

2851   must
2852   Used in SP 800-90C to indicate a requirement that may not be testable by a CMVP testing lab. Note that must may
2853   be coupled with not to become must not.

2854   noise source
2855   A source of unpredictable data that outputs raw discrete digital values. The digitization mechanism is considered part
2856   of the noise source. A distinction is made between physical noise sources and non-physical noise sources.

2857   non-physical entropy source
2858   An entropy source whose primary noise source is non-physical.

2859   non-physical noise source
2860   A noise source that typically exploits system data and/or user interaction to produce digitized random data.

2861   non-validated entropy source
2862   An entropy source that has not been validated by the CMVP as conforming to SP 800-90B.

2863   null string
2864   An empty bitstring.

2865   personalization string
2866   An optional input value to a DRBG during instantiation to make one DRBG instantiation behave differently from
2867   other instantiations.

2868   physical entropy source
2869   An entropy source whose primary noise source is physical.

2870   physical noise source
2871   A noise source that exploits physical phenomena (e.g., thermal noise, shot noise, jitter, metastability, radioactive
2872   decay, etc.) from dedicated hardware designs (using diodes, ring oscillators, etc.) or physical experiments to produce
2873   digitized random data.

2874   prediction resistance
2875   A property of a DRBG that provides assurance that compromising the current internal state of the DRBG does not
2876   allow future DRBG outputs to be predicted past the point where the DRBG has been reseeded with sufficient entropy.
2877   See SP 800-90A for a more complete discussion. (Contrast with backtracking resistance.)

2878   pseudocode
2879   An informal, high-level description of a computer program, algorithm, or function that resembles a simplified
2880   programming language.

2881   random bit generator (RBG)
2882   A device or algorithm that outputs a random sequence that is effectively indistinguishable from statistically
2883   independent and unbiased bits.

2884   randomness
2885   As used in this Recommendation, the unpredictability of a bitstring. If the randomness is produced by a non-deterministic
2886   source (e.g., an entropy source or RBG3 construction), the unpredictability is dependent on the quality of the source. If
