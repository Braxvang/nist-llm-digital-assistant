A STATISTICAL TEST SUITE FOR RANDOM AND PSEUDORANDOM NUMBER GENERATORS FOR CRYPTOGRAPHIC APPLICATIONS




       100000
       000001
       001010             Since a3,3 ≠ 1, but the 4th row contains a “1” in the 3rd column (see B or C), the
D      000001             two rows are switched.
       001011
       000010

       100000
       000001
       001010             Since row 5 contains a “1” in the 3rd column (see D), row 5 is replaced by the
E      000001             exclusive-OR of row 1 and row 5.
       000001
       000010

       100000
       000001
       001010             Since a4,4 ≠ 1 and no other row contains a “1” in this column (see E), the
F      000001             matrix is not altered.
       000001
       000010

       100000
       000001
       001010             Since a5,5≠ 1, but row 6 contains a 1 in column 5 (see F), the two rows are
G      000001             switched. Since no row below this contains a “1” in the 5th column, the end of
       000010             the forward process is complete.

The Subsequent Backward Row Operations:

       100000
       000000
       001010             Since a6,6 = 1 and rows 2 and 4 contain ones in the 6th column (see G), rows 2
H      000000             and 4 are replaced by the exclusive-OR of that row and row 6.
