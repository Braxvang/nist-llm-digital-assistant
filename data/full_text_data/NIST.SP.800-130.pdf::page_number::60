A key may be garbled, lost, or destroyed to the extent that it cannot be reconstructed by
error correction codes. If the key is a symmetric key or a private key, this could result in
the loss of the data protected by the key. A CKMS should employ methods for backing-
up, archiving, and recovering keys as necessary to provide for the recovery of valuable
data. For example, Appendix B of [SP 800-57-part1] provides guidance on recovery
procedures for various key types.

A garble in key metadata could result in the misuse of the key or the denial of service.
Therefore, metadata may also require backup, archiving, and recovery.

FR: 6.73 The CKMS design shall specify the methods used to authenticate the identity
and verify the authorization of the entity submitting keys and/or metadata for storage.

FR: 6.74 The CKMS design shall specify the methods used to verify the integrity of keys
and/or metadata submitted for storage.

FR: 6.75 The CKMS design shall specify the methods used to protect the confidentiality
of symmetric and private stored keys and metadata.

FR: 6.76 If a key wrapping key (or key pair) is used to protect stored keys, then the
CKMS design shall specify the methods used to protect the key wrapping key (or key
pair) and control its use.

FR: 6.77 The CKMS design shall specify the methods used to protect the integrity of
stored keys and metadata.

FR: 6.78 The CKMS design shall specify how access to stored keys is controlled.

FR: 6.79 The CKMS design shall specify the techniques used for correcting or
recovering all stored keys.

6.6 Cryptographic Key and Metadata Security: During Key Establishment
Keys and metadata can be established between entities wishing to communicate using
key transport or key agreement methods. These methods are typically used to establish
keys over electronic communications networks, but they could also be used to provide
extra security (beyond physical protection) when keys are manually distributed. When
keys are transported, one entity generates the key to be shared, and the key and possibly
its metadata are distributed to the other entity. When keys are agreed upon, both entities
contribute information that is used to derive a shared key. Metadata may be transported
under the protection of the shared key. [SP 800-56A] and [SP 800-56B] specify
cryptographic schemes for key establishment.

6.6.1 Key Transport
When cryptographic keys and metadata are transported (distributed) from one entity (the
sender) to another (the intended receiver), they should be protected. Symmetric keys and
