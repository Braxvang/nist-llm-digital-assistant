       November 2023

2748   media
2749   Physical devices or writing surfaces including, but not limited to, magnetic tapes, optical disks, magnetic disks,
2750   Large-Scale Integration (LSI) memory chips, and printouts (but not including display media) onto which
2751   information is recorded, stored, or printed within a system. [7]

2752   mobile code
2753   Software programs or parts of programs obtained from remote systems, transmitted across a network, and executed
2754   on a local system without explicit installation or execution by the recipient.

2755   mobile device
2756   A portable computing device that has a small form factor such that it can easily be carried by a single individual; is
2757   designed to operate without a physical connection (e.g., wirelessly transmit or receive information); possesses local,
2758   non-removable, or removable data storage; and includes a self-contained power source. Mobile devices may also
2759   include voice communication capabilities, on-board sensors that allow the devices to capture information, or built-in
2760   features that synchronize local data with remote locations. Examples include smartphones, tablets, and e-readers.

2761   multi-factor authentication
2762   Authentication using two or more different factors to achieve authentication. Factors include something you know
2763   (e.g., PIN, password), something you have (e.g., cryptographic identification device, token), or something you are
2764   (e.g., biometric). See authenticator.

2765   network
2766   A system implemented with a collection of interconnected components. Such components may include routers,
2767   hubs, cabling, telecommunications controllers, key distribution centers, and technical control devices.

2768   network access
2769   Access to a system by a user (or a process acting on behalf of a user) communicating through a network (e.g., local
2770   area network, wide area network, the internet).

2771   nonfederal organization
2772   An entity that owns, operates, or maintains a nonfederal system.

2773   nonfederal system
2774   A system that does not meet the criteria for a federal system.

2775   nonlocal maintenance
2776   Maintenance activities conducted by individuals communicating through an external network (e.g., the internet) or
2777   an internal network.

2778   NSA-approved cryptography
2779   Cryptography that consists of an approved algorithm, an implementation that has been approved for the protection of
2780   classified information and/or controlled unclassified information in a specific environment, and a supporting key
2781   management infrastructure. [8]

2782   on behalf of (an agency)
2783   A situation that occurs when: (i) a non-executive branch entity uses or operates an information system or maintains
2784   or collects information for the purpose of processing, storing, or transmitting Federal information; and (ii) those
2785   activities are not incidental to providing a service or product to the government. [5]

2786   organization
2787   An entity of any size, complexity, or positioning within an organizational structure. Adapted from [7]

2788   organization-defined parameter
2789   The variable part of a security requirement that is instantiated by an organization during the tailoring process by
2790   assigning an organization-defined value as part of the requirement. Adapted from [8].
