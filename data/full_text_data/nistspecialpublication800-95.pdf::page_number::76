                                                                                             GUIDE TO SECURE WEB SERVICES



In UDDI v2, there is no way for the requester to verify the integrity or origin of data retrieved through the
registry. Some integrity assumptions may be made because publishers are required to authenticate to the
registry, but it is not possible to determine whether or not a particular publisher is legitimate.

In UDDI v3, all data entries stored in the registry can be signed using XML Signatures. After receiving
information about a candidate, the requester can retrieve the public key associated with the candidate and
verify the integrity of the data from the registry. This is the best solution for verifying that entries in a
UDDI registry are valid.

In UDDI v2, it is possible to include digital signatures for entries in the optional “description” element of
each data type, as this element is designed to contain textual information about the entry. Both the
requester and the publisher must agree on a protocol for performing this type of signature so that
verification can be possible.

3.9.5    Service Publishing API

The publishing API is used to publish information about a Web service in the UDDI registry. According
to the UDDI specification, SOAP over HTTPS should be used exclusively for all calls in the publisher
API. In addition, the publisher must authenticate with the UDDI registry via the “get_authToken” call.
All calls within the publisher API require the authentication token to be passed as an argument.

The UDDI specification does not define what authentication methods should be used, so they can range
from a simple username/password combination to a SAML assertion, depending on the implementation.
Once the publisher has received the authorization token, it must be kept securely until it is has been
discarded so that an attacker cannot use the token.

In a UDDI registry, there are limits for how much each publisher can publish. In UDDI v2, the limits are
broken up between Tier 1 publishers and Tier 2 publishers. Tier 1 publishers are limited to publishing a
hard-coded number of UDDI entries. 52 Tier 2 publishers have no hard-coded limit and they are to be
strictly monitored by the UDDI registry’s operator. In UDDI v3, operators have more fine-grained
control over the limits imposed upon publishers through policies.

A requester can independently verify the validity of these structures using the UDDI API. In UDDI v3,
an additional method for verifying the publisher of any data structure is an XML Signature. When using
a UDDI v3 registry, XML Signatures should be used, as they are the best method for verification. If
signatures are to be used in a UDDI v2 registry, it may be possible to place them in the description
element. The publisher and the inquirer must have a predefined method for calculating signatures in this
case.

Publisher assertions are used to establish a relationship between two businessEntities, such as one entity
being a subsidiary of the other. For a publisherAssertion to be recognized by the UDDI registry, both
entities must create the publisherAssertion. This allows inquirers to be certain that there is a relationship
between two entities.

The publisher is also responsible for verifying that the records and assertions published are correct. Any
mistake made while publishing will result in incorrect results when inquirers access the UDDI registry.
