                                                                  COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE



Scenario 9: Anonymous Threat
On a Thursday afternoon, the organization’s physical security team receives a call from an IT manager,
reporting that two of her employees just received anonymous threats against the organization’s systems.
Based on an investigation, the physical security team believes that the threats should be taken seriously
and notifies the appropriate internal teams, including the incident response team, of the threats.
The following are additional questions for this scenario:
    1. What should the incident response team do differently, if anything, in response to the notification
       of the threats?
    2. What impact could heightened physical security controls have on the team’s responses to
       incidents?

Scenario 10: Peer-to-Peer File Sharing
The organization prohibits the use of peer-to-peer file sharing services. The organization’s network
intrusion detection sensors have signatures enabled that can detect the usage of several popular peer-to-
peer file sharing services. On a Monday evening, an intrusion detection analyst notices that several file
sharing alerts have occurred during the past three hours, all involving the same internal IP address.
    1. What factors should be used to prioritize the handling of this incident (e.g., the apparent content
       of the files that are being shared)?
    2. What privacy considerations may impact the handling of this incident?
    3. How would the handling of this incident differ if the computer performing peer-to-peer file
       sharing also contains sensitive personally identifiable information?

Scenario 11: Unknown Wireless Access Point
On a Monday morning, the organization’s help desk receives calls from three users on the same floor of a
building who state that they are having problems with their wireless access. A network administrator who
is asked to assist in resolving the problem brings a laptop with wireless access to the users’ floor. As he
views his wireless networking configuration, he notices that there is a new access point listed as being
available. He checks with his teammates and determines that this access point was not deployed by his
team, so that it is most likely a rogue access point that was established without permission.
    1. What should be the first major step in handling this incident (e.g., physically finding the rogue
       access point, logically attaching to the access point)?
    2. What is the fastest way to locate the access point? What is the most covert way to locate the
       access point?
    3. How would the handling of this incident differ if the access point had been deployed by an
       external party (e.g., contractor) temporarily working at the organization’s office?
    4. How would the handling of this incident differ if an intrusion detection analyst reported signs of
       suspicious activity involving some of the workstations on the same floor of the building?
    5. How would the handling of this incident differ if the access point had been removed while the
       team was still attempting to physically locate it?
