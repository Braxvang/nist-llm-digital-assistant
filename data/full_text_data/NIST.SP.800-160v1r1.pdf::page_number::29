the object. 21 The rules govern subject-to-object and subject-to-subject behaviors and outcomes.
Each security policy rule must be accurate, consistent, compatible, and complete with respect to
stakeholder objectives for the defined scope of control. 22 Inconsistency, incompatibility,
inaccuracy, or incompleteness in the security policy rules lead to protection gaps. It is equally
important that the security protection capabilities of the system are aligned with and can achieve
the expectations of the policy.

Privileges 23 define the set of allowed and disallowed behavior and outcomes granted to a subject.
Privileges are the basis for making mediated access decisions. A restrictive default practice for
security policy enforcement is to design the enforcement mechanism to allow only what the
policy explicitly allows and to deny everything else. For a system to be deemed trustworthy
secure, there must be sufficient confidence that the system is capable of enforcing the security
policy on a continuous basis for the duration of the time that the policy is in effect (Appendix F).

           The Concept of an Adequately Secure System
Adequate security is a concept that enables meaningful judgments about the idealistic nature of
security objectives. The definition of security expresses an ideal that encapsulates three essential
characteristics of a secure system:
•    It enables the delivery of the required system capability despite intentional and unintentional
     forms of adversity.
•    It enforces constraints to ensure that only the desired behaviors and outcomes associated with
     the required system capability are realized while satisfying the first characteristic.
•    It enforces constraints based on a set of rules to ensure that only authorized human-to-
     machine and machine-to-machine interactions and operations are allowed to occur while
     satisfying the second characteristic.

These characteristics are to be achieved to the extent practicable, resulting in a gap between the
ideal secure system and the security performance that the system can dependably achieve. 24 The
judgment that a system is adequately secure 25 requires an evidence-based determination that
security performance is optimized against all other performance objectives and constraints. The
scope of conditions relevant to security and the acceptable level of security are specific to
stakeholder needs. To be adequately secure, the system:
•    Meets minimum tolerable levels 26 of security, as determined by experience, analysis, or a
     combination of both
•    Is as secure as reasonably practicable (ASARP)

   Active entities exhibit behavior (e.g., a process in execution) while passive entities do not (e.g., data, file).
22
   At the highest level of assurance, security policies are formally specified and verified.
23
   Privileges are also referred to as authorizations or rights.
24
   Because system security is asymmetric – that is, things can be observed to be insecure, but no observation allows one to declare an arbitrary
system secure [22] – the ideal cannot be achieved without some uncertainty.
25
   The concept of adequately secure is an adaptation of the concept of adequately safe from [23].
26
   Below such levels, the system is considered insecure.
