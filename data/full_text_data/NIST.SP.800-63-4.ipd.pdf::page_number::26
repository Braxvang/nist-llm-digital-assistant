      NIST SP 800-63-4 ipd                                               Digital Identity Guidelines

669       • Step 3: The RP requests authentication from the claimant. The IdP provides
670         an assertion and optionally additional attributes to the RP through a federation
671         protocol.
672       • Step 4: The claimant proves possession and control of the authenticators to the
673         verifier function of the IdP through an authentication process.
674            – Within the IdP, the verifier and CSP functions interact to verify the binding
675              of the claimant’s authenticators with those bound to the claimed subscriber
676              account and optionally to obtain additional subscriber attributes.
677       • Step 5: All communication, including assertions, between the RP and the IdP
678         happens through federation protocols.
679       • Step 6: The IdP provides the RP with the authentication status of the subscriber
680         and relevant attributes and an authenticated session is established between the
681         subscriber and the RP.
682   For both models, the verifier does not always need to communicate in real time with
683   the CSP to complete the authentication activity (e.g., some uses of digital certificates).
684   Therefore, the line between the verifier and the CSP represents a logical link between
685   the two entities. In some implementations, the verifier, RP, and CSP functions may
686   be distributed and separated. However, if these functions reside on the same platform,
687   the interactions between the functions are signals between applications or application
688   modules running on the same system rather than using network protocols.
689   In all cases, the RP should request the attributes it requires from a CSP or IdP before
690   authenticating the claimant.
691   The following sections provide more detailed digital identity models for identity proofing,
692   authentication, and federation.

693   4.2. Enrollment and Identity Prooﬁng
694   The previous section introduced the entities and interactions in the conceptual digital
695   identity model. This section provides additional details regarding the participants’
696   relationships and responsibilities with respect to identity proofing and enrollment
697   processes.
698   [SP800-63A], Enrollment and Identity Proofing provides general information and
699   normative requirements for the identity proofing and enrollment processes as well as
700   requirements specific to identity assurance levels (IALs). In addition to a “no identity
701   proofing” level, IAL0, this document defines three IALs that indicate the relative strength
702   of an identity proofing process.
703   An individual, referred to as an applicant at this stage, opts to enroll with a CSP. If the
704   applicant is successfully proofed, the individual is then enrolled in the identity service as
705   a subscriber of that CSP.
