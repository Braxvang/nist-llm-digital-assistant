D.7 AUTHORIZING OFFICIAL DESIGNATED REPRESENTATIVE
The authorizing official designated representative is an organizational official that acts on behalf
of an authorizing official to coordinate and conduct the required day-to-day activities associated
with the security authorization process. Authorizing official designated representatives can be
empowered by authorizing officials to make certain decisions with regard to the planning and
resourcing of the security authorization process, approval of the security plan, approval and
monitoring the implementation of plans of action and milestones, and the assessment and/or
determination of risk. The designated representative may also be called upon to prepare the final
authorization package, obtain the authorizing officialâ€™s signature on the authorization decision
document, and transmit the authorization package to appropriate organizational officials. The
only activity that cannot be delegated to the designated representative by the authorizing official
is the authorization decision and signing of the associated authorization decision document (i.e.,
the acceptance of risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations,
and the Nation).

D.8 COMMON CONTROL PROVIDER
The common control provider is an individual, group, or organization responsible for the
development, implementation, assessment, and monitoring of common controls (i.e., security
controls inherited by information systems).72 Common control providers are responsible for: (i)
documenting the organization-identified common controls in a security plan (or equivalent
document prescribed by the organization); (ii) ensuring that required assessments of common
controls are carried out by qualified assessors with an appropriate level of independence defined
by the organization; (iii) documenting assessment findings in a security assessment report; and
(iv) producing a plan of action and milestones for all controls having weaknesses or deficiencies.
Security plans, security assessment reports, and plans of action and milestones for common
controls (or a summary of such information) is made available to information system owners
inheriting those controls after the information is reviewed and approved by the senior official or
executive with oversight responsibility for those controls.

D.9 INFORMATION SYSTEM OWNER
The information system owner is an organizational official responsible for the procurement,
development, integration, modification, operation, maintenance, and disposal of an information
system.73 The information system owner is responsible for addressing the operational interests of
the user community (i.e., individuals who depend upon the information system to satisfy mission,
business, or operational requirements) and for ensuring compliance with information security
requirements. In coordination with the information system security officer, the information
system owner is responsible for the development and maintenance of the security plan and
ensures that the system is deployed and operated in accordance with the agreed-upon security
controls. In coordination with the information owner/steward, the information system owner is

72
  Organizations can have multiple common control providers depending on how information security responsibilities
are allocated organization-wide. Common control providers may also be information system owners when the common
controls are resident within an information system.
73
   The information system owner serves as the focal point for the information system. In that capacity, the information
system owner serves both as an owner and as the central point of contact between the authorization process and the
owners of components of the system including, for example: (i) applications, networking, servers, or workstations; (ii)
owners/stewards of information processed, stored, or transmitted by the system; and (iii) owners of the missions and
business functions supported by the system. Some organizations may refer to information system owners as program
managers or business/asset owners.
