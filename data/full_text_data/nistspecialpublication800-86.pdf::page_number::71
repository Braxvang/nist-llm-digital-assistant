          atypical port) might not be detected. Another motivation for using unexpected port numbers is to
          slip traffic through perimeter devices that filter based on port numbers. There are several ways to
          attempt to identify unexpected port usage, including the following:

          –    Configuring IDS sensors to alert on connections involving unknown server ports

          –    Configuring application proxies or IDS sensors that perform protocol analysis to alert on
               connections that use an unexpected protocol (e.g., FTP traffic using the standard HTTP port)

          –    Performing traffic flow monitoring and identifying new and unusual traffic flows

          –    Configuring a protocol analyzer to analyze a particular stream as something else.
      ! Alternate Access Points. Attackers often enter networks from alternate access points to avoid
        detection by security controls that are monitoring major access points, such as the organization’s
        Internet gateway. A classic example of an alternate access point is a modem in a user’s
        workstation. If an attacker can dial into the workstation and gain access, attacks can be launched
        from that workstation against other hosts. In such cases, little or no information regarding the
        network activity might be logged because the activity would not pass through firewalls, IDS-
        monitored network segments, and other common data collection points. Organizations typically
        address this potential problem by limiting alternate access points, such as modems and wireless
        access points, and ensuring that each is monitored and restricted through firewalls, IDS sensors,
        and other controls.
      ! Monitoring Failures. Inevitably, systems and applications will occasionally experience failures
        or outages for various reasons (e.g., system maintenance, software failures, attacks). In the case
        of dedicated monitoring systems such as IDS sensors, use of redundant equipment (e.g., two
        sensors monitoring the same activity) can lessen the impact of monitoring failures.105 Another
        strategy is to perform multiple levels of monitoring, such as configuring network-based and host-
        based firewalls to log connections.
6.4      Examining and Analyzing Network Traffic Data

When an event of interest has been identified, analysts assess, extract, and analyze network traffic data
with the goal of determining what has happened and how the organization’s systems and networks have
been affected. This process might be as simple as reviewing a few log entries on a single data source and
determining that the event was a false alarm, or as complex as sequentially examining and analyzing
dozens of sources (most of which might contain no relevant data), manually correlating data among
several sources, then analyzing the collective data to determine the probable intent and significance of the
event. However, even the relatively simple case of validating a few log entries can be surprisingly
involved and time-consuming.

Although current tools (e.g., SEM software, NFAT software) can be helpful in gathering and presenting
network traffic data, such tools have rather limited analysis abilities and can be used effectively only by
well-trained, experienced analysts. In addition to understanding the tools, analysts should also have
reasonably comprehensive knowledge of networking principles, common network and application
protocols, network and application security products, and network-based threats and attack methods.106 It
is also very important that analysts have knowledge of the organization’s environment, such as the
network architecture and the IP addresses used by critical assets (e.g., firewalls, publicly accessible

      In most organizations, the cost of redundant monitoring makes it feasible only for the highest risk areas.
