D.1.1 VULNERABILITY AND PATCH MANAGEMENT
A vulnerability is a software flaw that introduces a potential security exposure. The number of
vulnerabilities discovered and patches developed to address those vulnerabilities continues to
grow, making manual patching of systems and system components an increasingly difficult task.
To the extent possible, organizations should identify, report, and remediate vulnerabilities in a
coordinated, organization-wide manner using automated vulnerability and patch management
tools and technologies.

Vulnerability scanners are commonly used in organizations to identify known vulnerabilities on
hosts and networks and on commonly used operating systems and applications. These scanning
tools can proactively identify vulnerabilities, provide a fast and easy way to measure exposure,
identify out-of-date software versions, validate compliance with an organizational security policy,
and generate alerts and reports about identified vulnerabilities.

Patch management tools scan for vulnerabilities on systems and system components participating
in an organizationâ€™s patching solution, provide information regarding needed patches and other
software updates on affected devices, and allow an administrator to decide on the patching
implementation process. Patch management tools and utilities are available from various vendors
to assist in the automated identification, distribution, and reporting of software patches. It is
critical to understand the impact of patches before applying and to deploy them within the context
of a defined patch management policy, providing assurance that systems will not lose critical
functionality due to an unintended side effect of a patch. In some cases where a patch cannot be
deployed, other compensating security controls may be necessary.

The implementation and effective use of vulnerability assessment and patch management
technologies46 can assist organizations in automating the implementation, assessment, and
