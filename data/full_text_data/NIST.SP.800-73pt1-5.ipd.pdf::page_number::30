      NIST SP 800-73pt1-5 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification: Part 1
      September 2023                                 PIV Card Application Namespace, Data Model, and Representation

771   OID of the CHUID on the PIV client-application programming interface is
772   “2.16.840.1.101.3.7.2.48.0.”
773   A data object SHALL be identified on the PIV Card Application card command interface using
774   its BER-TLV tag. For example, the CHUID is identified on the card command interface to the
775   PIV Card Application by the three-byte identifier '5FC102'.
776   Table 2 lists the ACRs of the thirty-six PIV Card Application data objects.
777                      Table 3. Object identifiers of the PIV data objects for interoperable use
