      September 2023                                                                      and Key Sizes for PIV

406       PIV Card Application Administration Keys
407   PIV Cards may support card activation by the card management system to support card
408   personalization and post-issuance card updates. PIV Cards that support card personalization and
409   post-issuance updates perform a challenge response protocol using a symmetric cryptographic
410   key (i.e., the PIV Card Application Administration Key) to authenticate the card management
411   system. After successful authentication, the card management system can modify information
412   stored in the PIV Card. Table 7 establishes specific requirements for cryptographic algorithms
413   and key sizes for PIV Card Application Administration Keys.
