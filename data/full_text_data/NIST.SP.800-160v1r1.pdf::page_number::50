•    Defining security requirements
•    Determining measures of success
•    Determining life cycle security concepts 52

The security objectives are foundational, establishing and scoping what it means to be adequately
secure in terms of protection against asset loss and the significance of such loss. The security
objectives have associated measures of success. These measures of success constitute specific
and measurable criteria relative to operational performance measures and stakeholder concerns.
Measures of success include both the strength of protection and the level of assurance in the
protection capability that has been engineered. These measures influence developing security
requirements and assurance claims.

Protection needs are determined based on the security objectives, life cycle concepts, and
stakeholder concerns. The protection needs are subsequently transformed into stakeholder
security requirements and associated constraints, as well as the measures needed to validate that
all requirements have been met. A well-defined and stakeholder-validated problem definition and
context provide the foundation for all systems engineering and systems security engineering and
supporting activities.

The problem context may be interpreted within a life cycle phase as being informed by solutions
from earlier life cycle stages, thereby providing a more accurate statement of the problem and its
associated constraints. For example, the stakeholder requirements may be the solution of an early
life cycle phase, which then constrains activities completed in later life cycle stages.

           The Solution Context
The solution context establishes the security aspects and constraints for the architecture and
design of the system that (1) satisfies the requirements and objectives of the problem context, (2)
realizes the design for the system, and (3) produces sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the
requirements and objectives of the problem context have been satisfied. 53 The solution context is
based on a balanced preemptive and reactive system security protection strategy 54 that exercises
control over events, conditions, asset loss, and the significance of loss to the degree possible,
practicable, and acceptable to stakeholders. The solution context includes:
•    Defining the security aspects of the solution
•    Realizing the security aspects of the solution

52
   The term life cycle security concept refers to the processes and activities associated with the system throughout the life cycle (from concept
development through retirement) with specific security considerations. It is an extension of the concept of operation and includes the processes
and activities related to development, prototyping, assessment of alternative solutions, training, logistics, maintenance, sustainment, evolution,
modernization, refurbishment, and disposal. Each life cycle concept has one or more security considerations and constraints that must be fully
integrated into the life cycle to ensure that the system security objectives can be met. Life cycle security concepts include those applied during
acquisition and program management. Life cycle security concepts can affect such things as Requests for Information, Requests for Proposal,
Statements of Work, source selections, development and test environments, operating environments, supply chains, supporting infrastructures,
distribution, logistics, maintenance, training, clearances, and background checks.
53
   Security constraints are transformed and incorporated into system design requirements with metadata-tagging to identify security relevance.
54
   The system security protection strategy is consistent with the overall concept of secure function. The concept of secure function, defined during
the problem context, constitutes a strategy for a preemptive and reactive protection capability throughout the system life cycle (Section D.2). The
strategy has the objective to provide freedom from specific concerns associated with asset loss and loss consequences.
