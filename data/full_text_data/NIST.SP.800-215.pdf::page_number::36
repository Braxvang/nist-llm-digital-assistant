NIST SP 800-215                                                           Guide to a Secure Enterprise
November 2022                                                                     Network Landscape

The following are the minimal security services found in most commercial SASE offerings are:
   •   Firewall services
   •   Secure web gateway services
   •   Anti-malware services
   •   IPS services
   •   CASB services
   •   DLP services
Some of the advanced security features found in SASE offerings include:
   •   Browser isolation technology: This is often combined with secure web gateway solutions
       and provides improved web activity security to tackle threats in real time.
   •   Continuous adaptive risk and trust assessment (CARTA) strategy: This strategy involves
       constantly monitoring sessions and performs adaptive behavior analysis on monitoring
       parameters to dynamically change security levels and permissions if the trust profile (e.g.,
       trust deficit) of a device changes.
