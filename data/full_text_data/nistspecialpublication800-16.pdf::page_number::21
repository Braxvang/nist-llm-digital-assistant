Information Technology Security Training Requirements


   •    Chapter 2, Learning Continuum        — Model and Overview: Introduces a role-based
        learning model that presents learning as a continuum from awareness through training to
        education and presents concepts associated with the model. Briefly discusses FT security
        awareness and education, and explains that detailed treatment of these areas is outside the
        scope of this document. Provides a comparison highlighting the differences among the
        three levels of learning and provides a transition to the following chapters, which
        concentrate on the two training layers of the model. Security Basics and Literacy and
        Roles and Responsibilities Relative to IT Systems.     Discusses learning styles and
        effective teaching methods, ways of learning and implications for instruction, and
        presents some additional considerations for adult learning.


   •    Chapter 3, IT Security Basics and Literacy: Presents a core set of generic IT security
        terms and concepts for all Federal employees as a baseline for further, role-based
        learning, expands on those basic concepts, and provides a mechanism for students to
        relate and apply on the job the information learned.


    •   Chapter 4, Training Development Methodology: Role-Based Training: Builds on the
        Security Basics and Literacy training layer by presenting specific performance-based
        training requirements and outcomes mapped to job functions. Examines six role
        categories relative to FT systems— Manage, Acquire, Design and Develop, Implement and
        Operate, Review and Evaluate, and Use (with a seventh category, "Other" included to
        provide extensibility). Presents a matrix to relate the categories to three training content
        categories   —Laws and Regulations,   Security Program, and System Life Cycle Security.
        Identifies a set of 12 high-level IT security body of knowledge topics and concepts
        appropriate to each cell in the matrix from which curriculum content can be constructed.
        The training requirements presented here were derived from the IT security program
        requirements established in Appendix III of 0MB Circular A- 130.


    •   Chapter 5, Evaluating Training Effectiveness: Requires evaluation as a component of
        an organization's IT security training program. Identifies purposes of evaluation,
        presents progressive levels of training evaluation, and provides guidance in evaluation
        planning and implementation.


In addition, this document is supported by several Appendices designed to facilitate its ease of
use and to amplify portions of the document which require a more in-depth treatment. These
include the following.


    •   Appendix A, Information Technology Security Learning Continuum: Shows a full-
        page presentation of the Learning Model introduced in Chapter 2.
