      it. Another way in which external parties may be affected is if an attacker gains access to sensitive
      information regarding them, such as credit card information. In some jurisdictions, organizations are
      required to notify all parties that are affected by such an incident. Regardless of the circumstances, it
      is preferable for the organization to notify affected external parties of an incident before the media or
      other external organizations do so. Handlers should be careful to give out only appropriate
      information—the affected parties may request details about internal investigations that should not be
      revealed publicly.

      OMB Memorandum M-07-16, Safeguarding Against and Responding to the Breach of Personally
      Identifiable Information, requires Federal agencies to develop and implement a breach notification
      policy for personally identifiable information (PII).14 Incident handlers should understand how their
      incident handling actions should differ when a PII breach is suspected to have occurred, such as
      notifying additional parties or notifying parties within a shorter timeframe. Specific recommendations
      for PII breach notification policies are presented in OMB Memorandum M-07-16. Also, the National
      Conference of State Legislatures has a list of state security breach notification laws.15
2.4     Incident Response Team Structure

An incident response team should be available for anyone who discovers or suspects that an incident
involving the organization has occurred. One or more team members, depending on the magnitude of the
incident and availability of personnel, will then handle the incident. The incident handlers analyze the
incident data, determine the impact of the incident, and act appropriately to limit the damage and restore
normal services. The incident response team’s success depends on the participation and cooperation of
individuals throughout the organization. This section identifies such individuals, discusses incident
response team models, and provides advice on selecting an appropriate model.

2.4.1     Team Models

Possible structures for an incident response team include the following:

 Central Incident Response Team. A single incident response team handles incidents throughout the
  organization. This model is effective for small organizations and for organizations with minimal
  geographic diversity in terms of computing resources.
 Distributed Incident Response Teams. The organization has multiple incident response teams, each
  responsible for a particular logical or physical segment of the organization. This model is effective for
  large organizations (e.g., one team per division) and for organizations with major computing
  resources at distant locations (e.g., one team per geographic region, one team per major facility).
  However, the teams should be part of a single coordinated entity so that the incident response process
  is consistent across the organization and information is shared among teams. This is particularly
  important because multiple teams may see components of the same incident or may handle similar
  incidents.
 Coordinating Team. An incident response team provides advice to other teams without having
  authority over those teams—for example, a departmentwide team may assist individual agencies’
  teams. This model can be thought of as a CSIRT for CSIRTs. Because the focus of this document is
