cases, this external data will generate false positives within the receiving organization's network and may
cause resources to be spent on nonexistent problems.

Organizations participating in incident information sharing should have staff skilled in taking technical
indicator information from sharing communities and disseminating that information throughout the
enterprise, preferably in an automated way. Organizations should also attempt to ensure that they only
share an indicator for which they have a relatively high level of confidence that it signifies an actual
incident.

4.4   Recommendations

The key recommendations presented in this section for handling incidents are summarized below.

 Plan incident coordination with external parties before incidents occur. Examples of external
  parties include other incident response teams, law enforcement agencies, Internet service providers,
  and constituents and customers. This planning helps ensure that all parties know their roles and that
  effective lines of communication are established.
 Consult with the legal department before initiating any coordination efforts. There may be
  contracts or other agreements that need to be put into place before discussions occur.
 Perform incident information sharing throughout the incident response life cycle. Information
  sharing is a key element of enabling coordination across organizations. Organizations should not wait
  until an incident has been fully resolved before sharing details of it with others.
 Attempt to automate as much of the information sharing process as possible. This makes cross-
  organizational coordination efficient and cost effective. Organizations should attempt to achieve a
  balance of automated information sharing overlaid with human-centric processes for managing the
  information flow.
 Balance the benefits of information sharing with the drawbacks of sharing sensitive
  information. Ideally organizations should share the necessary information and only the necessary
  information with the appropriate parties. Business impact information is often shared in a team-to-
  coordinating team relationship, while technical information is often shared within all types of
  coordination relationships. When sharing information with peer and partner organizations, incident
  response teams should focus on exchanging technical information.
 Share as much of the appropriate incident information as possible with other organizations.
  Organizations should consider which types of technical information should or should not be shared
  with various parties. For example, external indicators, such as the general characteristics of attacks
  and the identity of attacking hosts, are usually safe to share with others, but there may be both
  security and liability reasons why an organization would not want to reveal the details of an exploited
  vulnerability.
