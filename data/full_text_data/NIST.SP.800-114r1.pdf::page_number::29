                                                                                                 characteristics, and typically places messages that appear to be spam in a separate email folder. Most

                                                                                                 spam will still reach users, and some desired email messages will accidentally be classified as spam. Still,
                                                                                                 spam filtering software can significantly reduce the amount of spam that reaches users. Many email
                                                                                                 clients also offer spam filtering capabilities.

                                                                                                 Users can refine spam filtering capabilities through the following customization options:

                                                                                                  Blacklists. A blacklist is a list of email senders who have previously sent spam to a user. When a user
                                                                                                   receives a spam message, he or she can request that the sender’s email address be added to a blacklist.
                                                                                                   This will cause future emails from the same sender to be classified as spam automatically.

                                                                                                   received spam messages. When a user receives email, the user corrects any errors that the spam
                                                                                                   filtering software has made. The Bayesian filter then analyzes the benign messages and the spam to
                                                                                                   record their characteristics. For example, a Bayesian filter might record that a user has received
                                                                                                   35 spam messages containing the phrase “FREE FREE FREE” but no benign messages with that
                                                                                                   phrase. When a user receives a new email, the filter looks for that phrase, as well as any other
                                                                                                   characteristics associated with benign or spam messages, and assigns a spam probability to the
