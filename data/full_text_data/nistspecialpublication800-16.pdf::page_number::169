CHAPTER 5. EVALUATING TRAINING EFFECTIVENESS
        Evaluate: "To determine or fix the value of; to examine carefully"^



5.1     Value of Evaluation in a Training Program

Evaluating training effectiveness is a vital step to ensure that the training delivered is meaningful.
Training is "meaningful" only when it meets the needs of both the student (employee) and the
organization. If training content is incorrect, outdated, or inappropriate for the audience, the
training will not meet student or organizational needs. If the delivery vehicle (e.g., classroom or
computer-based training) is inappropriate, either in relation to the simplicity/complexity of the
content or to the type of audience           —   or if there is an inadequate mix of vehicles in an agency's
overall training program           —   the training will not meet needs. Spending time and resources on
training that does not achieve desired effects can reinforce, rather than dispel, the perception of
security as an obstacle to productivity. Further, it can require the expenditure of far more
resources in data or system recovery after a security incident occurs than would have been spent
in prevention activities.


All meaningless training is expensive, even where the direct cost outlay, or cost-per-student, may
be low.   Because agencies cannot afford to waste limited resources on ineffective training,
evaluation of training effectiveness should become an integral component of an agency's IT
security training program. A robust training evaluation effort may be the second most effective
                                                                          —
vehicle for garnering management support for IT security the first being the occurrence of a
serious security incident.


In broader context, attention to IT security training evaluation is in line with a changing focus in
the overall field of information technology regarding how results of systems efforts are measured.
The focus is beginning to change from being solely a machine view, i.e., measuring the
functionality of the technology (e.g., speed, gigabytes), to encompass a people view, i.e., the
functionality of the people who use the technology. Thus, in organizations where it is recognized
that system utility is affected         — even determined—
                                           or                         ^by users, it becomes apparent that to

achieve its full utility, a percentage of the system budget must be devoted to people needs such as
training.'*
