Special Publication 800-157                                             Guidelines for Derived PIV Credentials


                                    Figure 1-1 Use of Derived PIV Credential

Derived PIV Credentials are based on the general concept of derived credential in [SP800-63], which
leverages identity proofing and vetting results of current and valid credentials. When applied to PIV,
identity proofing and vetting processes do not have to be repeated to issue a Derived PIV Credential.
Instead, the user proves possession of a valid PIV Card to receive a Derived PIV Credential. The Derived
PIV Credential is a Derived PIV Authentication certificate, which is an X.509 public key certificate that
has been issued in accordance with the requirements of this document and the X.509 Certificate Policy for
the U.S. Federal PKI Common Policy Framework [COMMON]. While the PIV Card may be used as the
basis for issuing other types of derived credentials, the issuance of these other credentials is outside the
scope of this document. Only derived credentials issued based on the PIV Card and in accordance with
this document are considered to be Derived PIV credentials.

This document provides the technical guidelines on:

          The primary lifecycle activities for the Derived PIV Credential – initial issuance and maintenance
           – and the requirements for each activity to ensure security; and

          Technical requirements for the Derived PIV Credential including certificate policies,
           cryptographic specifications, types of cryptographic implementation that are permitted and
           mechanisms for activation and use of the credential.

The publication also includes an informative annex that provides recommendations for the inclusion of
digital signature and key management keys on mobile devices.

1.3       Audience:

This document is targeted at stakeholders who will be responsible for procuring, designing,
implementing, and managing deployments of Derived PIV Credentials for mobile devices.

1.4       Document Structure

The structure of the rest of this document is as follows. Each section is labeled as either normative (i.e.,
mandatory for compliance) or informative (i.e., non-mandatory).

          Section 2 describes Derived PIV Credential lifecycle activities and related requirements. This
           section is normative, with the exception of Section 2.1, which is informative.

          Section 3 describes the technical requirements for implementing Derived PIV Credentials. This
           section is normative.

          Appendix A contains guidance on digital signature and key management keys. This appendix is
           informative.

          Appendix B provides detailed interface requirements for the removable hardware
           implementations. This appendix is normative for implementation of Derived PIV Credentials on
           removable (non-embedded) hardware cryptographic tokens.

          Appendix C provides example issuance processes for Derived PIV Credentials. This appendix is
           informative.
