                                                                                   GUIDELINES ON ELECTRONIC MAIL SECURITY



Users should also be aware of the dangers of phishing attacks and how to avoid them. The Federal Trade
Commission (FTC) posted a consumer alert outlining steps that users should take: [FTC06]

 Do not reply to email messages or popup ads asking for personal or financial information.
 Do not trust phone numbers in emails or popup ads. Voice over IP technology can be used to register
  a phone with any area code.
 Do not email personal or financial information.
 Review credit card and bank account statements regularly.
 Be cautious about accessing untrusted Web sites, because some Web browser vulnerabilities can be
  exploited simply by visiting a site. Users should also be cautious about opening any attachment or
  downloading any file from untrusted emails or Web sites.
 Forward phishing-related emails to spam@uce.gov and to the organization that is impersonated in the
  email.
 Request a copy of your credit report from each of the three credit reporting agencies yearly: Equifax,
  Transunion, and Experian. If an identity thief opens up accounts in your name, they will likely show
  up on a credit report. 39
6.3     Blocking Spam-Sending Servers

Regardless of the communication medium, there are always entities that attempt to exploit any means of
communication to publicize their ideas or products. Email is no exception. The most common terms for
these messages are unsolicited commercial email (UCE), which is better known as spam. Most email
users receive spam on a daily basis. Because email is largely unregulated, system administrators should
police email traffic that traverses the servers they operate to reduce the amount of spam that reaches users.
An added benefit of implementing server-based spam control is that it will reduce mailbox sizes, which in
turn reduces server storage requirements. 40

To control spam messages, administrators must address the following three concerns:

 Ensure that spam cannot be sent from the mail servers they control (see Section 6.4).
 Implement spam filtering for inbound messages (see Section 6.2).
 Block messages from known spam-sending serversâ€”the topic of this section.
Because the Internet has no centralized policing authority, non-profit organizations and commercial
companies have created lists of mail servers that have been identified as being used to send unsolicited
email messages. These lists are often referred to as open relay blacklists (ORB) or DNS blacklists
(DNSBL). Many popular mail server applications can be configured to query multiple ORBs and reject
messages originating from the listed mail servers. These lists are updated on a daily basis; therefore,
using them can drastically reduce spam message delivery. Additionally, most mail servers can be
configured to reject messages from an explicitly defined set of domains.

      Under the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003, consumers can request a free credit report from each of the
      three consumer credit reporting companies once every twelve months. See http://www.ftc.gov/os/statutes/fcrajump.htm for
      more information.
