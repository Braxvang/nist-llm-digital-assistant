corrections when risk exceeds organizational risk tolerance. During the disposal phase of the
system development life cycle, it is standard procedure for organizations to verifiably remove
prior to disposal, any information from information systems that may cause adverse impacts, if
compromised, and also assess any risk associated with these activities.45

Early integration of information security requirements into the system development life cycle is
the most cost-effective method for implementing the organizational risk management strategy at
Tier 3.46 Incorporating risk management into the system development life cycle ensures that the
risk management process is not isolated from the other management processes employed by the
organization to develop, acquire, implement, operate, and maintain the information systems
supporting organizational missions and business functions. To support system development life
cycle integration, risk management (including information security considerations) is also
incorporated into program, planning, and budgeting activities to help ensure that appropriate
resources are available when needed—thus facilitating the completion of program and project
milestones established by organizations. To incorporate risk management into program, planning
and budgeting activities, risk and information security professionals are an integral part of the
teams and structures used to address information system and organizational requirements.

The overall resilience of organizational information systems (i.e., how well systems operate while
under stress) is a key factor and performance measure in determining the potential survivability of
missions/business functions. The use of certain information technologies may introduce inherent
vulnerabilities into these information systems—resulting in risk that may have to be mitigated by
reengineering the current mission/business processes. The wise use of information technologies
during the design, development, and implementation of organizational information systems is of
paramount importance in managing risk.


  Making information security‐related requirements and activities an integral part of the system
  development life cycle ensures that senior leaders/executives consider the risks to organizational
  operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation resulting from the operation
  and use of information systems and take appropriate actions to exercise the organization’s due
  diligence.



2.6 TRUST AND TRUSTWORTHINESS
Trust is an important concept related to risk management. How organizations approach trust
influences their behaviors and their internal and external trust relationships. This section
introduces some conceptual ways of thinking about trust, defines the concept of trustworthiness,
and shows how the concept of trustworthiness can be used in developing trust relationships.
Appendix G describes several trust models that can be applied in an organizational context, and

   While the presentation of the system development life cycle is expressed as a linear flow, in reality, the knowledge
gained during a later phase of the life cycle or changes in system requirements or operational environments may dictate
revisiting an earlier phase. For example, changes in the threat environment during the operation/maintenance phrase
may dictate the need to initiate a new or revised system capability.
46
   The Risk Management Framework (RMF), described in NIST Special Publication 800-37, provides a structured
process that integrates risk management activities into the system development life cycle. The RMF operates primarily
at Tier 3 but also interacts with Tier 1 and Tier 2 (e.g., providing feedback from authorization decisions to the risk
executive [function], disseminating updated risk information to authorizing officials, common control providers, and
information system owners).
