federal use in sending protected messages. In those instances, users should be presented
with a warning banner explaining that the cryptographic mechanisms used are weak and,
therefore, that integrity and authentication cannot be assured.


5.3 Procurement Guidance
The following recommendations are for any individual that makes a purchasing decision
for acquiring an S/MIME-enabled component.

   1. In support of security and compatibility across the Federal Government, ensure
      that all federal information systems support Cipher Suite 1.

   2. Procurements should support Cipher Suite B, either Level 1, Level 2, or both.

   3. Federal clients may support RC2 for use only in the event that users receive
      correspondence encrypted with this weaker and unapproved algorithm.

   4. Ensure that federal agencies do not use SHA-1 for digital signature generation;
      however, it can be used for the verification of digital signatures signed using
      SHA-1. Cryptographic algorithm implementations should be modular so as to
      allow for new algorithms.

If an S/MIME client needs to generate a key pair, ensure that the S/MIME client or some
related administrative utility or function is capable of generating public/ private key pairs
on behalf of the user.

5.4 Recommendations for System Installers
The system installer is the individual that installs the S/MIME application and performs
the initial configuration of the system.

   1. Federal clients shall be configured to support Cipher Suite 1 for interoperability
      as described above in Section 5.2.

   2. Systems shall be configured so that they only permit the use of approved
      cryptographic algorithms and approved key sizes to encrypt or sign new
      messages.

   3. Installers should install and configure S/MIME clients so that they default to the
      use of an approved cipher algorithm suite. Furthermore, installers should
      configure clients so that there is a straightforward means for end users to change
      default settings and select algorithms as needed for interoperability and in
      accordance with organizational needs and policies.

   4. System installers should configure clients so that end users can use unique
      certificates for each security function (e.g., encryption, digital signatures) at their
      disposal.
