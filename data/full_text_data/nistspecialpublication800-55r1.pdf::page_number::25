obsolete measures should be phased out and new ones that measure completion and effectiveness
of more current items should be used. New measures will also be required if the organization’s
mission is redefined or if changes are made to information security policies and guidelines.

3.4.3   Data Management Concerns

To ascertain the quality and validity of data, data collection methods and data repositories used
for measures data collection and reporting, either directly or as data sources, should be
standardized. The validity of data is suspect if the primary data source is an incident-reporting
database that stores only the information reported by a few organizational elements, or if
reporting processes between organizations are inconsistent. The importance of standardizing
reporting processes cannot be overemphasized. When organizations are developing and
implementing processes that may serve as inputs into an information security measurement
program, they must ensure that data gathering and reporting are clearly defined to facilitate the
collection of valid data.

Organizations must understand that although they may collect substantial amounts of
information security data, not all data will be useful for their information security measurement
program at any given point in time. Any data collection specifically for the purpose of
information security measures must be as nonintrusive as possible—and of maximum usefulness
to ensure that available resources are used primarily to correct problems rather than collect data.
Establishment of an information security measurement program will require a substantial
investment to ensure that the program is implemented in a way that will maximize its benefits.
Benefits of the program are expected to outweigh the costs of investing resources to maintain the
program.

Finally, the information contained in information security data repositories represents a
significant collection of operational and vulnerability data. Due to the sensitivity of this data,
information security performance measurement data repositories need to be protected
accordingly.

3.4.4   Automation of Measurement Data Collection

Efficient data management is facilitated by automating measurement data collection. Automating
measurement data collection standardizes data collection and reporting, and helps institutionalize
measurement activity by integrating it into business processes. In addition, automated data
collection minimizes opportunities for human error, leading to greater accuracy of available data.
Standardized collection and reporting can also increase data availability, as collections are likely
to be housed in a centralized database or similar data repository.

As a complement to automating performance measurement, organizations should also consider
how performance measurement automation can supplement other automated information security
tasks. For example, Extensible Markup Language (XML)-formatted configuration checklists can
allow organizations to use Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS), Government Off-The-Shelf
(GOTS), or open-source tools to automatically check their information security configuration
and map it to technical compliance requirements. While these checklists are primarily used for
