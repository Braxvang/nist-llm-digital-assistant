                                            COOP vs. ISCP – The Basic Facts
     FUNCTIONS
         COOP plans address national, primary, or mission essential functions; ISCPs address federal
          information systems.
          o     COOP functions have specific criteria; not all government mission/business processes meet
                COOP criteria.
          o     COOP functions may be supported by information systems.
          o     Information systems support government mission/business processes, but not all government
                mission/business processes fall within the scope of COOP.
     SCOPE
         COOP planning applies to mission essential functions of federal government departments and
          agencies.
         ISCPs apply to all information systems in federal organizations.
     AUTHORITIES
         COOP is mandated for federal organizations by HSPD-20/NSPD-51, FCDs 1 and 2, and the
          National Continuity Policy Implementation Plan (NCPIP); ISCPs are mandated for federal
          organizations by FISMA.


2.2.3         Crisis Communications Plan

Organizations should document standard procedures for internal and external communications in the
event of a disruption using a crisis communications plan. A crisis communications plan is often
developed by the organization responsible for public outreach. The plan provides various formats for
communications appropriate to the incident. The crisis communications plan typically designates specific
individuals as the only authority for answering questions from or providing information to the public
regarding emergency response. It may also include procedures for disseminating reports to personnel on
the status of the incident and templates for public press releases. The crisis communication plan
procedures should be communicated to the organization’s COOP and BCP planners to ensure that the
plans include clear direction that only approved statements are released to the public by authorized
officials. Appendix D provides further discussion of topics addressed by the crisis communications plan
and informational resources.

2.2.4         Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) Plan

Critical infrastructure and key resources (CIKR) are those components of the national infrastructure that
are deemed so vital that their loss would have a debilitating effect of the safety, security, economy, and/or
health of the United States. 10 A CIP plan is a set of policies and procedures that serve to protect and
recover these national assets and mitigate risks and vulnerabilities. CIP plans define the roles and
responsibilities for protection, develop partnerships and information sharing relationships, implement the
risk management framework defined in the National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP) and Homeland
Security Presidential Directive (HSPD) - 7 for CIKR assets, and integrate federal, state and local
emergency preparedness, protection, and resiliency of critical infrastructure.
