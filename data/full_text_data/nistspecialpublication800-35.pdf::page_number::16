importance of developing agreements that define the service levels for the service providers; however,
this guide does not prescribe the service or service level that best fits the organization’s needs. The
specific needs of each organization should always be considered when applying the processes and
concepts that are presented in this guide. Finally, in this publication, NIST provides information and
advice for decision makers and other relevant parties on the security and policy issues for obtaining IT
security services.

1.3   Limitations

Section 5 of this document discusses a sampling of possible IT security services but does not represent an
exhaustive list. In addition to clearly identified IT security services, organizations may also wish to
acquire a service, which contains a significant security component such as systems administration. These
types of services are not addressed in this guide; however, the information that is included in this guide
can be extended and adapted to cover other related services.

This guide does not advocate a position for or against the development of external arrangements (such as
outsourcing) for IT security services. The reader should refer to OMB Circular A-76, Performance of
Commercial Activities, to establish the foundation for the decision whether activities should be performed
under contract with a commercial activity or performed in-house using Government facilities and
personnel.

1.4   Intended Audience

This guide is meant for organizations that provide IT security services regardless of whether the service is
provided from within the organization or procured from an outside provider. The goal is to help IT
security decision makers and managers implement and manage the most appropriate IT security services,
service levels, and service arrangements to best meet the organization’s mission and needs.

1.5   Document Organization

The remainder of this document is organized as follows:

Chapter 2 discusses the roles and responsibilities of the various people involved with the selecting,
implementing, and managing of the IT security services life cycle.

Chapter 3 provides an introduction to IT security services, including an overview of the security services
life cycle and of selected IT security services. This chapter discusses the framework of a security services
life cycle, an overview of issues to address throughout the life cycle, an overview of the various service
arrangements that IT security decision makers could consider, and a look at tools that will be useful to the
IT security decision maker in the security services life cycle.

Chapter 4 provides a more in-depth discussion of the issues related to obtaining IT security services. In
the context of the security services life cycle, this chapter discusses how the security service begins, what
is captured in assessing the current environment and the needs for any new service, what a service
agreement should include, and how a service agreement should end or be discontinued.

Chapter 5 provides a more detailed look at a few specific IT security services, serving as an example of
the application of the previous information.

In addition to these chapters, three appendixes are attached:
