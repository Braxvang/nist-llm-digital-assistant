                         3. The computation of a digital signature from data,
                         4. The verification of a digital signature,
                         5. The computation of an authentication code from data,
                         6. The verification of an authentication code from data and a
                            received authentication code.
Key agreement            A DLC primitive specified in SP 800-56A [SP 800-56A] or
primitive                an RSA Secret Value Encapsulation (RSASVE) operation
                         specified in SP 800-56B [SP 800-56B].
Key derivation key       A key that is used as an input to a key derivation function or
                         key expansion function to derive other keys.
Nonce                    A time-varying value that has at most a negligible chance of
                         repeating; for example, a random value that is generated
                         anew for each use, a time-stamp, a sequence number, or
                         some combination of these. It can be a secret or non-secret
                         value.
Pre-shared key           A secret key that is established between communicating
                         parties before a communication protocol starts.
Pseudorandom             A function that can be used to generate output from a random
function (PRF)           seed and a data variable, such that the output is
                         computationally indistinguishable from truly random output.
Pseudorandom key         As used in this Recommendation, a binary string that is
                         taken from the output of a PRF.
Secret keying material   The binary data that is used to form secret keys, such as
                         AES encryption keys or HMAC keys.
Shall                    This term is used to indicate a requirement that needs to be
                         fulfilled to claim conformance to this Recommendation. Note
                         that shall may be coupled with not to become shall not.
Shared secret            A secret value that has been computed using a key
                         agreement algorithm.
Should                   This term is used to indicate an important recommendation.
                         Ignoring the recommendation could result in undesirable
                         results. Note that should may be coupled with not to become
                         should not.
