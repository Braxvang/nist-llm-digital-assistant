                                                                                              For most systems, identification and authentication is often the first line of defense.
                                                                                              Identification is the means of verifying the identity of a user, process, or device, typically as a
                                                                                              prerequisite for granting access to resources in a system. Identification and authentication is a
                                                                                              technical measure that prevents unauthorized individuals or processes from entering a system.
                                                                                              Identification and authentication is a critical building block of information security since it is the

                                                                                              often requires that the system be able to identify and differentiate between users. For example,
                                                                                              access control is often based on least privilege, which refers to granting users only those accesses
                                                                                              required to perform their duties. User accountability requires linking activities on a system to
                                                                                              specific individuals and, therefore, requires the system to identify users.
                                                                                              Systems recognize individuals based on the authentication data the systems receive.
                                                                                              Authentication presents several challenges: collecting authentication data, transmitting the data
                                                                                              securely, and knowing whether the individual who was originally authenticated is still the
                                                                                              individual using the system. For example, a user may walk away from a terminal while still
                                                                                              logged on, and another person may start using it.
                                                                                              There are four means of authenticating a user's identity that can be used alone or in combination.
                                                                                              User identity can be authenticated based on:
                                                                                                 •   something the individual knows – e.g., a password or Personal Identification Number
                                                                                                     (PIN);

                                                                                                 •   something the individual is (static biometric) – e.g., fingerprint, retina, face; and
                                                                                                 •   something the individual does (dynamic biometrics) – e.g., voice pattern, handwriting,
