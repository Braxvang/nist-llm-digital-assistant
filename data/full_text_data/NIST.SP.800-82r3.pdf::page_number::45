NIST SP 800-82r3                                          Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

The IIoT system architecture is fully distributed and can support a wide range of interactions and
communication paradigms, including:
   •   Peer-to-peer networking (e.g., security cameras communicating about identified objects)
   •   Edge-device collaboration (e.g., wind turbines in remote locations)
   •   Distributed queries across data stored in devices, in the cloud, and anywhere in between
   •   Distributed data management that defines where and what data is to be stored and for
       how long
   •   Data governance, including quality, discovery, usability, privacy, and security
The proximity network connects edge nodes (e.g., sensors, actuators, devices, OT systems and
assets) to the stack. It typically connects these edge nodes as one or more clusters to a gateway
that bridges to other networks. The access network enables connectivity for data and control flow
between the edge and platform tiers. This connection may be a corporate network or an overlay
private network over the public internet or a 4G/5G network.
While this guide contains recommendations that are applicable and could be used as a reference
to protect IIoT against cybersecurity threats, readers are encouraged to perform a risk-based
assessment on their systems and tailor the recommended guidelines and solutions to meet their
specific security, business, and operational requirements.

       Comparing OT and IT System Security
OT has many characteristics that differ from traditional IT systems, including different risks and
priorities. Some of these include significant risk to the health and safety of human lives, serious
damage to the environment, and financial issues, such as production losses. OT has different
performance and reliability requirements and uses OSs and applications that may be considered
unconventional in a typical IT network environment. Security protections must be implemented
in a way that maintains system integrity during normal operations as well as during cyber attacks
[Knapp].
Initially, OT systems had little resemblance to IT systems because they were isolated and ran
proprietary control protocols using specialized hardware and software. Widely available and
low-cost Ethernet, Internet Protocol (IP), and wireless devices are now replacing older
proprietary technologies, which increases the likelihood of cybersecurity vulnerabilities and
incidents. OT are increasingly resembling IT systems as they adopt IT technologies to promote
corporate connectivity and remote access capabilities (e.g., using industry standard computers,
OSs, and network protocols). This integration supports new IT capabilities but provides
significantly less isolation for OT from the outside world than predecessor systems, creating a
greater need to secure them. While security solutions have been designed to deal with these
issues in typical IT systems, special precautions must be taken when introducing these same
solutions to OT environments. In some cases, new security solutions are needed that are tailored
to the OT environment.
