       The BIOS image must be digitally signed in accordance with the BIOS Update Authentication
        requirements in Section 3.1.
       An RTU, as defined in Section 2.5, must verify the digital signature of the BIOS update image
        before writing the image to the BIOS flash memory.
       As the system BIOS is not protected from modification at runtime, the RTU must include a
        verification component capable of verifying the system BIOS prior to execution, per the
        Firmware Integrity Protection requirements in Section 3.3. The verification component must
        execute on boot and verify the system BIOS before any updatable BIOS code is executed.
       If it is determined that the system BIOS is inauthentic, the RTU must initiate a recovery process,
        and the inauthentic system BIOS must never be executed.

The general steps for implementing this mechanism are:
   1. A digitally signed BIOS image is verified and written into the BIOS flash memory.
   2. On every boot, execution is transferred to the RTU.
   3. If the verification component of the RTU determines the BIOS flash memory is authentic,
       execution is transferred to the BIOS.
   4. If it is determined that the BIOS flash memory is inauthentic, the RTU initiates a recovery
       process, and the inauthentic BIOS is never executed.

See Appendix D for an example of this update mechanism.
