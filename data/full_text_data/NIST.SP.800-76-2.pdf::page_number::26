5.        Fingerprint on-card comparison specifications

5.1       Scope
[FIPS] allows (but does not require) Agencies to use on-card comparison (OCC) of fingerprint minutiae. This Section
gives specifications for OCC for PIV. This specification includes enrollment data to be placed on the card,
authentication data to be sent to the card, and OCC certification information. This Section also specifies the data
structure for the storage of card parameters, and the procedure for preparation of OCC fingerprint minutiae
templates from those for off-card comparisons.
[800-73] indicates where OCC data is stored and that this data is separate and different from the mandatory off-card
comparison fingerprint templates. [800-73, Part 2] specifies the secure channel mechanisms to realize on-card
comparison over the [FIPS]-specified interfaces.

5.2       Background
NIST conducted two studies to support the use of on-card biometric comparison in identity management applications.
                                               11
―      The Secure Biometric Match on Card activity engaged commercial providers to execute fingerprint
       authentication over a contactless interface within a specific time limit. The study required privacy protection via
       secured communication protocols and integrity protection using cryptographic signatures computed from the
       biometric data. In addition, the card was authenticated to the reader. The activity has been published as NIST
       Interagency Report 7452 [SBMOC].
―      The MINEX II evaluation was initiated to measure the core algorithmic speed and accuracy of fingerprint minutia
       matchers running on ISO/IEC 7816 smartcards. Conducted in phases, the test required card- and fingerprint
       matcher-provider teams to submit on-card comparison enabled cards. The latest results were reported in NIST
       Interagency Report 7477 [MINEX II].
The main attraction of on-card comparison has been that someone who finds a card has only a small chance of
authenticating to it with fingerprints (related to the configured false match rate) – the fact that template data never
leaves the card means that the attacker has no prior knowledge. See the related discussion in Section 5.4. In the off-
card comparison world, the PIN entry requirement is used to mitigate this risk.

5.3       Approach to the use of standards
The PIV specification for on-card matching leverages international standards. Specifically, PIV Cards shall
―      be prepared and used by executing the commands of ISO/IEC 7816-4:2005 [CARD-CMD] per [800-73, Part 2]
―      embed the biometric data in the data structures defined in ISO/IEC 7816-11:2004 [CARD-BIO],
                                                                                                                     12
―      use the core three-byte-per-minutia format defined in the ISO/IEC 19794-2:2011 [CARD-MIN] standard
       (implementers may choose to prepare these from INCITS 378:2004 templates, as shown in Figure 3), and
―      adopt certain defined constants from ISO/IEC 19785-3:2007.

     FIPS 201-2 uses the term "on-card biometric comparison". It is standardized and preferred over the term "match-on-card".

     This second edition of the minutia standard was completed on 2011-12-14.
