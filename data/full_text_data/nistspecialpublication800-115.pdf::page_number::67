                                                        TECHNICAL GUIDE TO INFORMATION SECURITY TESTING AND ASSESSMENT



Appendix B—Rules of Engagement Template

This template provides organizations with a starting point for developing their ROE. 42 Individual
organizations may find it necessary to include information to supplement what is outlined here.

1.         Introduction

1.1.       Purpose

Identifies the purpose of the document as well as the organization being tested, the group conducting the
testing (or, if an external entity, the organization engaged to conduct the testing), and the purpose of the
security test.

1.2.       Scope

Identifies test boundaries in terms of actions and expected outcomes.

1.3.       Assumptions and Limitations

Identifies any assumptions made by the organization and the test team. These may relate to any aspect of
the test to include the test team, installation of appropriate safeguards for test systems, etc.

1.4.       Risks

Inherent risks exist when conducting information security tests—particularly in the case of intrusive tests.
This section should identify these risks, as well as mitigation techniques and actions to be employed by
the test team to reduce them.

1.5.       Document Structure

Outlines the ROE’s structure, and describes the content of each section.

2.         Logistics

2.1.       Personnel

Identifies by name all personnel assigned to the security testing task, as well as key personnel from the
organization being tested. Should include a table with all points of contact for the test team, appropriate
management personnel, and the incident response team. If applicable, security clearances or comparable
background check details should also be provided.

2.2.       Test Schedule

Details the schedule of testing, and includes information such as critical tests and milestones. This
section should also address hours during which the testing will take place—for example, it may be
prudent to conduct technical testing of an operational site during evening hours rather than during peak
business periods.

       The structure of this template is intended to be illustrative. Organizations should organize their ROEs in whatever manner
       they choose.
