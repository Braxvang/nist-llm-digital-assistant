investments, gaps, and opportunities for collaboration within and across federal
agencies. 10 FEA facilitates identification of duplicative or wasteful investments, areas
where investments should be made, and where departments and agencies can
collaborate to improve government operations or services.
       The FEA consists of five reference models:
       • The Performance Reference Model (PRM) is a common framework for
         performance measurement that can be applied throughout the FEA.
       • The Business Reference Model (BRM) is a function-driven framework for
         describing the business operations of the federal government independent of
         the agencies.
       • The Service Component Reference Model (SRM) is a business- and
         performance-driven functional framework that classifies service components
         with respect to how they support business and/or performance objectives.
       • The Data and Information Reference Model (DRM) describes, at an aggregate
         level, the data and information that support program and business line
         operations.
       • The Technical Reference Model (TRM) is a component-driven technical
         framework used to identify the standards, specifications, and technologies that
         support and enable the delivery of service components and capabilities.
    OMB requires agencies to integrate security into their enterprise architecture
development life cycle. 11 In addition to complying with OMB requirements, the
integration of information security into the agency enterprise architecture efforts
benefits both the agencies and the federal government:
       • Reduction of the reporting burden. The FEA requires agencies to collect and
         analyze significant amounts of data. The security efforts already under way
         can provide information relevant to the data, technology, and performance
         metrics in place throughout a department, such as the information contained in
         FISMA quarterly and annual reports, accreditation letters, and plan of actions
         and milestones (POA&M).
       • Integration of security data. Organizations should use existing information
         security data sources to identify data for their FEA submissions, thus allowing
         for a continuous and reliable transmission and roll-up of security requirements
         and controls from initial security certification and accreditation documentation
         and POA&Ms into the FEA.
       • Preservation of security requirements. Documenting and preserving
         information about applicable security requirements ensures that it can be used
         as a part of any higher-level federal management or decision-making process.
         If, for example, the federal government were to try and implement a large-
         scale reorganization (such as creating a new department or agency), a
         security-aware FEA would be able to clearly outline not only the intersections of
         common business lines but also the corresponding security requirements. In
         another example, if a department were to mandate using a specific type of
         technological tool, the FEA would be able to highlight the security and privacy
         requirements for the technology as well as the requirements for the data that
