7.       Facial image specifications

7.1      Scope
[FIPS] establishes requirements and options for agency-collection, storage, and use of a facial image from PIV
applicants. The facial imagery shall be stored in the format specified here. The face specification has a very similar
format, and is functionally identical to, the ISO/IEC 19794-5:2005 face image adopted by the International Civil Aviation
Organization for e-Passports [ICAO]. However, note that two images are involved in one-to-one applications:
―     The enrollment image i.e., the PIV image as specified here.
―     The live authentication image for which additional capture specifications are typically necessary to address
      subject height variations and the illumination environment (see [BSI-FACE], for example).
The image is suitable for automated face recognition and therefore fielded implementations shall conform to the
accuracy specifications given in this Section.

7.2      Acquisition and format
This Section provides specifications for the retention of facial images. Facial images collected during PIV Registration
shall be formatted such that they conform to INCITS 385-2004 [FACESTD]. In addition to establishing a format,
[FACESTD] specifies how a face image should be acquired. This is done to improve image quality and, ultimately,
performance. The images shall be embedded within the CBEFF structure defined in Section 9. Because [FACESTD] is
generic across applications it includes either-or requirements. Table 12 is an application profile of [FACESTD] tailored
for PIV. It gives concrete specifications for much of the generic content. Column 3 references [FACESTD] and
columns 4 and 5 give [FACESTD] requirements. For PIV, column 6 of Table 12 gives normative practice or value
specifications. The table is not conformant with the Implementation Conformance Statement [ICS] standard.
Particularly, it extends the function of ICS but, because it has the needed rows, it may be useful in construction of a
traditional ICS. Nevertheless, a "values supported column" [ICS, Clause 9.1] should be added by implementers for
checking conformance to the specifications.
While the INCITS 385 standard has been superseded by the ISO/IEC 19794-5 standard, it is retained here because PIV
has used it since inception – see Section 1.6.
