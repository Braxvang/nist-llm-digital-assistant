Special Publication 800-79-2                                                 Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card Issuers
                                                                                              and Derived PIV Credential Issuers


EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 ([HSPD-12]), dated August 27, 2004, established a
policy for creation, issuance, and use of personal identification credentials in the Federal
Government. The Directive requires the development and use of a standard for secure and
reliable forms of identification for federal employees and contractors. The Personal Identity
Verification (PIV) specifications of the resulting standard (Federal Information Processing
Standard (FIPS) 201) is the foundation for securely identifying every individual seeking access
to valuable and sensitive federal resources, including buildings, information systems, and
computer networks. The implementation of PIV specifications, in turn, involves operations such
as the collection, access protection, and dissemination of personal information, which itself
requires privacy protection.

NIST developed and published FIPS 201, Personal Identity Verification (PIV) of Federal
Employees and Contractors, as well as several NIST Special Publications (SPs) to provide
additional specifications and supporting information in response to [HSPD-12]. These
documents provide the required foundation for standardizing the processes related to the
adoption and use of government-wide personal identification credentials as a means to verify the
identity of the credential holders.

In light of the requirements for both improved security and protection of personal privacy,
[HSPD-12] established four control objectives, one of which includes the call for forms of
identification that are “issued by providers whose reliability has been established by an official
accreditation process.” In response, Appendix A.1 of FIPS 201 specifies that NIST “…develop a
new accreditation methodology that is objective, efficient, and will result in consistent and
repeatable accreditation decisions…” This led to development of NIST SP 800-79 in 2005,
Guidelines for the Accreditation of Personal Identity Verification Card Issuers.1

The update to this Special Publication (SP) reflects the second revision of FIPS 201 published in
2013[FIPS 201-2]. It provides appropriate and useful guidelines for assessing the reliability of
issuers of PIV Cards and provides guidelines for issuers of the newly introduced Derived PIV
Credential for mobile devices.2 The reliability of an issuer is of utmost importance when an
organization (e.g., a federal agency) is required to trust the identity credentials of individuals that
were created and issued by another organization. This trust only exists if the relying organization
has the necessary level of assurance of the issuing organization that the credential is established
via a formal authorization process and thus reliable.

    NIST SP 800-37-1, Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems [SP 800-37-1] has
    deprecated the use of the term accreditation in favor of the term authorization. This is reflected in the title of the present
    revision.

    A mobile device, for the purpose of this document is a portable computing device that: (i) has a small form factor such that it
    can easily be carried by a single individual; (ii) is designed to operate without a physical connection (e.g., wirelessly transmit or
    receive information); (iii) possesses local, non-removable or removable data storage; and (iv) includes a self-contained power
    source. Mobile devices may also include voice communication capabilities, on-board sensors that allow the devices to capture
    information, and/or built-in features for synchronizing local data with remote locations. Examples include smart phones,
    tablets, and e-readers.
