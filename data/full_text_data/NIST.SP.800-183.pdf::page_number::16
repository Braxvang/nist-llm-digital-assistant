                                                                                               A decision trigger creates the final result(s) needed to satisfy the purpose, specification, and

                                                                                                     1. A decision trigger is a conditional expression that triggers an action. A decision trigger’s
                                                                                                        outputs can control actuators and transactions (see Figure 3 and Figure 4). Decision

                                                                                                     2. A NoT, may or may not control an actuator (via a decision trigger).

                                                                                                     3. A decision may have a binary output, but there will also be situations where the output of
                                                                                                        a decision trigger is a non-discrete output, i.e., a continuum of output values.

                                                                                                     4. A decision trigger may have a built-in adaption capability as the environment element

                                                                                                     5. A decision trigger will likely have a corresponding virtual implementation, i.e., code.
