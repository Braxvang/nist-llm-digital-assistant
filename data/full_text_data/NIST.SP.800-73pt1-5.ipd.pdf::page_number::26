      NIST SP 800-73pt1-5 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification: Part 1
      September 2023                                 PIV Card Application Namespace, Data Model, and Representation

690   Note that the option to include an Intermediate CVC is included as a temporary measure to
691   accommodate the use of certification authorities that do not support the issuance of X.509
692   certificates that contain elliptic curve subject public keys. A future version of SP 800-73 is
693   expected to deprecate the Intermediate CVC data element.

694   3.3.8. Pairing Code Reference Data Container
695   The Pairing Code Reference Data Container, which SHALL be present if the PIV Card supports
696   the virtual contact interface, includes a copy of the PIV Cardâ€™s pairing code (see Section 5.1.3).
697   The Security Object enforces the integrity of the Pairing Code Reference Data Container
698   according to the issuer.

699           Inclusion of Universally Unique Identifiers (UUIDs)
700   This specification provides support for two UUIDs on a PIV Card. The Card UUID is unique for
701   each card, and it SHALL be present on all PIV Cards. The Cardholder UUID is a persistent
702   identifier for the cardholder, and it is optional to implement. The requirements for these UUIDs
703   are provided in the following subsections.

704   3.4.1. Card UUID
705   FIPS 201 requires PIV Cards to include a Card UUID. The Card UUID SHALL be included on
706   PIV Cards as follows:
707       1. The value of the GUID data element of the CHUID data object SHALL be a 16-byte
708          binary representation of a valid UUID [RFC4122]. The UUID SHALL be version 1, 4, or
709          5, as specified in [RFC4122, Section 4.1.3].
710       2. The same 16-byte binary representation of the UUID value SHALL be present as the
711          value of an entryUUID attribute, as defined in [RFC4530], in any CMS-signed data
712          object that is required to contain a pivFASC-N attribute on a PIV Card (i.e., in the
713          mandatory cardholder fingerprint template and facial image data objects as well as in the
714          optional cardholder iris images data object when present.
715       3. If the PIV Card supports secure messaging and/or authentication using the secure
716          messaging key, then the same 16-byte binary representation of the UUID value SHALL
717          be used as the Subject Identifier in the secure messaging CVC, as specified in SP 800-73-
718          5 Part 2, Section 4.1.5.
719       4. The string representation of the same UUID value SHALL be present in the X.509
720          Certificate for PIV Authentication and the X.509 Certificate for Card Authentication in
721          the subjectAltName extension encoded as a URI, as specified by [RFC4122, Section 3].
