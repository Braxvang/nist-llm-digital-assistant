     TECHNOLOGIES
     NIST has maintained a long-standing commitment to advancing innovation and to
     supporting cybersecurity and privacy research in emerging technologies and priorities,
     such as artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things (IoT). With a dedicated technical
     staff, one-of-a-kind facilities, and NIST’s trusted, objective, non-regulatory role, NIST is
     well-positioned to help the Nation and its partners advance in these promising areas.


     Cybersecurity for the Internet of Things (IoT)
     NIST’s Cybersecurity for the Internet of Things (IoT) program supports the development
     and application of standards, guidelines, and related tools to improve the cybersecurity
     of connected devices and the environments in which they are deployed. By collaborating
     with stakeholders across government, industry, international bodies, and academia, the
     program aims to cultivate trust and foster an environment that enables innovation on a
     global scale.
     Accomplishments of the NIST IoT program in FY 2019 included:
       •   Publication of the Final NISTIR 8228, Considerations for Managing Internet of
           Things (IoT) Cybersecurity and Privacy Risks, which provides guidance for federal
           agencies and other organizations to better understand and manage the risks
           associated with individual IoT devices throughout the life cycles of those devices
           [6]. It addresses three high-level goals for risk mitigation: device security, data
