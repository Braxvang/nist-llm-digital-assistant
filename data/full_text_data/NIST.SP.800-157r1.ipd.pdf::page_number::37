1013   Appendix D.      Glossary
1014   This appendix is informative.
1015   Selected terms used in the guideline are defined below. All other significant technical
1016   terms used within this document are defined in other key documents, including [FIPS201],
1017   [SP800-63A], [SP800-63B], and [SP800-73].
1018   applicant
1019   A PIV cardholder who has applied for but has not yet been issued a derived PIV
1020   credential.

1021   derived PIV application
1022   A standardized application based on the PIV Card’s PIV application that resides on a
1023   removable or wireless hardware cryptographic token. It hosts a PKI-based derived PIV
1024   credential and associated mandatory and optional elements.

1025   home agency
1026   The government agency responsible for maintaining the PIV identity account and issuing
1027   a PIV Card. While another agency may perform the enrollment and identity proofing
1028   process in some cases, the home agency is responsible for monitoring ongoing eligibility
1029   and initiating termination if appropriate.

1030   PKI-based derived PIV credential
1031   An X.509 derived PIV authentication certificate, which is issued in accordance with the
1032   requirements specified in this document where the PIV authentication certificate on the
1033   applicant’s PIV Card serves as the original credential. The derived PIV credential is an
1034   additional common identity credential under HSPD-12 and FIPS 201 that is issued by a
1035   federal department or agency.

1036   non-PKI-based derived PIV credential
1037   An authenticator that has been bound to a PIV identity account at a subscriber’s home
1038   agency and that can be used for federated authentication to applications as an alternative
1039   to the subscriber’s PIV Card.

1040   subscriber
1041   A PIV cardholder to whom a derived PIV credential has been issued.

1042   verifier
1043   An entity that verifies the claimant’s identity by verifying the claimant’s possession and
1044   control of one or more authenticators using an authentication protocol. To do this, the
1045   verifier needs to confirm the binding of the authenticators with the subscriber account and
1046   check that the subscriber account is active.
