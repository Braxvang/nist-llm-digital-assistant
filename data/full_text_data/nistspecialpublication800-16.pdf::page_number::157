       INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SECURITY TRAINING MATRIX                              — Cell 3.5E
 Training Area: System Life Cycle Security               — Operations
 Functional Specialty: Review & Evaluate

 Definition   —        The system life cycle is a model for building and operating an IT system
                       from its initial inception to its termination and disposal of assets. The
                       model includes six phases: Initiation, Development, Test and Evaluation,
                       Implementation, Operations, and Termination. Life cycle security is the
                       ensemble of processes and procedures which ensures data confidentiality, as
                       needed, as well as data and system integrity, and availability.


                       The operations phase includes the ongoing day-to-day use (production) and
                       maintenance or enhancement of the system without compromising the
                       integrity and effectiveness of the installed safeguards.


 Behavioral Outcome         —   Individuals responsible for review and evaluation are able to
                                examine the operational system to determine the adequacy and
                                effectiveness of safeguards and to ensure that a consistent and
                                appropriate level of security (i.e., one with an acceptable level of
                                risk) is maintained.


 Knowledge Levels         —
 1.           — Understand,
      Beginning                    Participate, Identify
 2. Intermediate — Analyze, Determine, Apply
 3.Advanced — Decide, Recommend,             Interpret


 Sample Learning Objectives —

 At the conclusion of this module, individuals will be able to:

 1.    Beginning   —   Participate in the evaluation of an operational system to determine the
       adequacy and effectiveness of security safeguards and environment, leading to continued
       approval to operate (recertification and re-accreditation).

 2.    Intermediate   — Determine    the adequacy of security environments and the capability of
       security strategies, architectures, and safeguards to maintain the integrity of those security
       environments. Prepare recommendations for system approval decisions.

 3.    Advanced    — Recommend IT system       recertification/re-accreditation and/or corrective
       actions required to achieve/maintain certification/accreditation.

 Sample Job Functions          —
 •    Auditor, External                         •   Designated Approving Authority (DAA)
 •    Auditor, Internal                         •   IT Security Officer/Manager
