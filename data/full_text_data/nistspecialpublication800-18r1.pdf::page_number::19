                           Guide for Developing Security Plans for Federal Information Systems


       •   Requests a copy of the system security plan of the general support system and
           ensures that it provides adequate protection for the application and information;
           and

       •   Includes a reference to the general support system security plan in the major
           application system security plan.


2.3 General Support Systems
A general support system is an interconnected set of information resources under the
same direct management control that shares common functionality. A general support
system normally includes hardware, software, information, data, applications,
communications, facilities, and people and provides support for a variety of users and/or
applications. A general support system, for example11, can be a:

       •   LAN including smart terminals that support a branch office;
       •   Backbone (e.g., agency-wide);
       •   Communications network;
       •   Agency data processing center including its operating system and utilities,
       •   Tactical radio network; or
       •   Shared information processing service facility

A general support system can have a FIPS 199 impact level of low, moderate, or high in
its security categorization depending on the criticality or sensitivity of the system and any
major applications the general support system is supporting. A general support system is
considered a major information system when special management attention is required,
there are high development, operating, or maintenance costs; and the system/information
has a significant role in the administration of agency programs. When the general support
system is a major information system, the system's FIPS 199 impact level is either
moderate or high.

A major application can be hosted on a general support system. The general support
system plan should reference the major application system security plan.


2.4 Minor Applications
Agencies are expected to exercise management judgment in determining which of their
applications are minor applications and to ensure that the security requirements of minor
applications are addressed as part of the system security plan for the applicable general
support systems or, in some cases, the applicable major application. It is very common
that a minor application may have a majority of its security controls provided by the
general support system or major application on which it resides. If this is the case, the
information system owner of the general support system or major application is the
information system owner for the minor application and is responsible for developing the
