Appendix B                                            Frequently Asked Questions


Q. Do organizations need to update a system security plan?
A. Yes. Both organizations should update their system security plans and other
   relevant documentation at least annually or whenever there is a significant
   change to their information systems or to the interconnection. Refer to NIST SP
   800-18 Revision 1, Guide for Developing Security Plans for Federal Information
   Systems, for information on updating system security plans.

Q. Do individual personal computers (PCs) connecting to an application
   housed behind a firewall through the Internet require ISA(s)?
A. No. An ISA is an agreement established between organizations rather than
   individual systems. Each system involved in interconnection is governed by an
   organization’s DAA who has the authority to formally assume responsibility for
   operating a system at an acceptable level of risk.

Q. Can an ISA be terminated by any of the participating parties?
A. Yes. The language in the ISA should stipulate how, when, and by whom the
   agreement can be terminated. This action item will be decided during the drafting
   of the agreement.

Q. Do both parties need to answer each item in the ISA?
A. Yes. Both parties need to answer each item even if the item affects only one of
   the parties.

Q. Are there any federal requirements regarding ISA?
A   Yes. ISAs must be addressed by all federal organizations. ISA requirements are
    set forth by OMB and NIST (in NIST SP 800-53, Revision 1, Recommended
    Security Controls for Federal Information Systems). ISAs are also mentioned in
    the FY05 FISMA Reporting Guidance. The NIST SP 800-53 requirement states:
    “The organization authorizes all connections from the information system to other
    information systems outside of the accreditation boundary and monitors/controls
    the system interconnections on an ongoing basis. Appropriate organizational
    officials approve information system interconnection agreements.”
