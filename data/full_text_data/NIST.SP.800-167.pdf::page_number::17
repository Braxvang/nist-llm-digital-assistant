NIST SP 800-167                                                                         GUIDE TO APPLICATION W HITELISTING


be considered include the following:

    External Requirements. The organization may be subject to oversight or review by another
     organization that requires application whitelisting.
    System and Network Environments. It is important to understand the characteristics of the
     organization’s system and network environments to select compatible application whitelisting
     solutions with the necessary functionality. Aspects to consider include the following:
     o   Characteristics of the devices that need application whitelisting, especially the operating systems
         (OSs) and applications; and
     o   Technical attributes of the interfaces of other systems with which the application whitelisting
         solution might be integrated, such as centralized logging servers and security information and
         event management (SIEM) software.
The outcome of the organization’s requirements analysis should be a determination of the types of
applications or application components (executables, libraries, registry entries, configuration files, etc.)
that need to be monitored; the types of threats the application whitelisting should protect against (Section
2.1); and the types of application whitelisting that should be used to balance security, usability, and
maintainability (Section 2.2). For example, the organization may decide to block execution of all
unauthorized application components on higher-risk client systems, while monitoring (but not blocking)
execution of unauthorized application components on lower-risk client systems. These decisions should
be captured in policy.

Another outcome of the analysis is the documentation of the requirements for the application whitelisting
technologies themselves, including security capabilities (e.g., authentication, cryptography, key
management), performance requirements, management requirements (including reliability,
interoperability, and scalability), the security of the technology itself, usability, and maintenance
requirements (e.g., applying updates).

In many cases, a single application whitelisting product cannot meet all of the organization’s identified
needs. For example, the organization may need to monitor applications on devices running several
different OSs, yet no appropriate product can work on all those platforms. Also, some operating systems
may have application whitelisting technologies built-in. Organizations can solve this problem in several
ways, such as acquiring multiple products or replacing older devices. Organizations should ensure that
effective solutions are identified for all the types of end user devices that need their applications
monitored, if possible, and that a waiver and risk management process is created for unusual cases that
cannot be addressed by the identified solutions.

Examples of challenging platforms for application whitelisting include mobile devices11 and industrial
control systems (ICS)12. One of the main benefits of using mobile devices is being able to acquire a wide
variety of applications easily, quickly, and cheaply (often free). Unfortunately, this philosophy makes it
infeasible in many cases to implement whitelisting for mobile devices. If mobile devices are tightly
managed, much like some desktops or laptops, and only allowed to acquire approved apps from an
enterprise-sponsored app store, then whitelisting may be practical, but for user-controlled unmanaged
mobile devices, whitelisting may not be an option as of this writing.
