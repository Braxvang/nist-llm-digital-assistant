            ENFORCEMENT / AUDITING

OT Discussion: Some OT devices allow for the configuration and use of mode change switches.
Where available, these should be used to prevent unauthorized changes. For example, many
PLCs have key switches that allow the device to be placed in a programming mode or a running
mode. Those PLCs should be placed in a running or remote mode to prevent unauthorized
programming changes, and the key should be removed from the key switch and managed
appropriately.
Control Enhancement: (1) No OT Discussion for this control.
