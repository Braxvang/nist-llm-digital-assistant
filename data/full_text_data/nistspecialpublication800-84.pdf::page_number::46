At [insert time] on [insert date], an electrical fire in the [insert facility name] caused extensive damage
and the termination of operations in the data center. The [insert plan name] was fully activated in
response to this incident, and operations will be conducted at the [insert alternate facility name] for the
foreseeable future. [Insert organization name] employees will be displaced from the building until
smoke, water, and other health hazards are removed. Despite the problem at the [insert facility name],
Directors and Administrators show no sign of altering their agendas and expect a seamless transition of IT
operations to the [insert alternate facility name].

SAMPLE FACILITATOR QUESTIONS

The following questions are designed to be used by the facilitator to guide the discussion and ensure the
pre-defined objectives are met; depending on the flow of the exercise, the facilitator may elect to use
these questions or other questions to ensure participants meet the objectives through the discussion:

    1. Who has authority to activate the [insert plan name]?
    2. If the plan were activated, what level of staffing should be available at the [insert facility name]?
    3. How would you be notified of plan activation and by whom?
    4. What are the roles and responsibilities of the team at the [insert facility name]?
    5. How would the transfer of operations have occurred if critical personnel were injured in the fire
       and could not report to the [insert facility name]?
    6. Are IT recovery procedures fully documented? Are they accurate? Should additional procedures
       be documented in the contingency plan?
