Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific use of the representative payee information
and not on the time required to re-establish access to the representative payee information.
Benefits payment processes are not necessarily tolerant of delays. In many cases, disruption of
access to representative payee information can be expected to have a very serious adverse effect
on individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: In the case of very large data bases
containing representative payee information relating to the general public, there is a significant
probability that processing delays will affect the benefits payments to large numbers of
individuals. The larger the number of records affected, the longer the delays that can be
expected to result. This can result in financial hardship for some individuals and in serious
disruption of agency operations. In such cases, the availability impact level would be at least
moderate. In the case of permanent loss of records, the impact might even be high.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
representative payee information is moderate.
C.2.8.12 General Information Information Type

An additional management and support sub-function information type has been defined to
address General Information as a catch-all information type that may not be defined by the FEA
BRM. As such, agencies may find it necessary to identify additional information types not
defined in the BRM and assign impact levels to those types. Agency personnel may uniquely
identify information types using a FIPS 199 process to identify information not contained neatly
in the FEA BRM.

Not all of these information types are likely to have the same impact levels. The impacts to some
information types will jeopardize system functionality and the agency mission more than other
information types. General Information impact levels must be assessed in the context of the
agencies mission.
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is based on the effects of unauthorized disclosure of
representative general information on the ability of the agency to accomplish its mission.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for general information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific use of the general information and not on the
time required to detect the modification or destruction of information.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
general information is low.
