       NIST SP 800-50r1 ipd                                                     Building a Cybersecurity and

1086      •   Licenses (per-seat) for learning platform or content
1087      •   Awareness materials, such as posters, notepads, and themed items for awareness
1088          activities
1089      •   Professional services for curriculum design and development and the presentation of
1090          content, as well as any additional associated costs
1091   There are strategic and cost-benefit decisions that the organization must make to ensure that the
1092   CPLP is adequately funded. Some materials may be available from other federal agencies,
1093   partner organizations, or online vendor resources. Some materials may already exist in-house and
1094   should be inventoried and evaluated to determine whether they are current and meet the existing
1095   training goals. The implementation timeline will help indicate when additional funding may be
1096   required to support tools, major curriculum and content deliverables, new staffing requirements,
1097   and other learning program elements and activities.

        The following are example questions that can help guide development of budget requirements:
           • What mission and business needs will be influenced or impacted?
           • Are there regulations, legislative requirements, or other internal or external
               requirements that would influence the decision?
           • What shared federal or other external resources can be leveraged?
           • What internal resources can be leveraged? This can include existing content and
               delivery mediums.
           • Is it more cost-effective to develop the material in-house versus outsourcing?
           • Is the learning requirement specific to the organization or the system? This would
               include information such as specific policies, procedures, or rules of behavior.
           • When must the learning material be ready? Are there critical schedules that need to be
               met? Would outsourcing allow for delivery schedules to be met?
           • How many people need to be trained?
           • How often will the material need to be updated?
           • What delivery mediums will be required, and what are the associated costs?
           • Are there in-house resources to do the job?
           • Does the organization have the subject-matter expertise to provide content for the
               training?
           • Are resources available to effectively manage and monitor contractor activity during
               acquisitions?
           • Does the course sensitivity preclude the use of a contractor?

1100   The Learning Program Manager must work with senior leadership to advocate for the Program
1101   against competing priorities and develop a strategy to address any shortfall in funding that may
1102   impact the organization’s ability to meet its learning goals. This may mean adjusting the learning
1103   strategy to be more in line with the available budget, advocating for additional funding, or
1104   reallocating current resources. It may also mean that the program plan needs to be phased in over
1105   some predefined time period as funding becomes available.
