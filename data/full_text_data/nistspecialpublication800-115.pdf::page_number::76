Appendix F—Glossary

Selected terms used in the publication are defined below.

Active Security Testing: Security testing that involves direct interaction with a target, such as sending
packets to a target.

Banner Grabbing: The process of capturing banner information—such as application type and version—
that is transmitted by a remote port when a connection is initiated.

Covert Testing: Testing performed using covert methods and without the knowledge of the
organization’s IT staff, but with full knowledge and permission of upper management.

External Security Testing: Security testing conducted from outside the organization’s security
perimeter.

False Positive: An alert that incorrectly indicates that a vulnerability is present.

File Integrity Checking: Software that generates, stores, and compares message digests for files to detect
changes made to the files.

Information Security Testing: The process of validating the effective implementation of security
controls for information systems and networks, based on the organization’s security requirements.

Internal Security Testing: Security testing conducted from inside the organization’s security perimeter.

Network Discovery: The process of discovering active and responding hosts on a network, identifying
weaknesses, and learning how the network operates.

Network Sniffing: A passive technique that monitors network communication, decodes protocols, and
examines headers and payloads for information of interest. It is both a review technique and a target
identification and analysis technique.

Operating System (OS) Fingerprinting: Analyzing characteristics of packets sent by a target, such as
packet headers or listening ports, to identify the operating system in use on the target.

Overt Testing: Security testing performed with the knowledge and consent of the organization’s IT staff.

Passive Security Testing: Security testing that does not involve any direct interaction with the targets,
such as sending packets to a target.

Password Cracking: The process of recovering secret passwords stored in a computer system or
transmitted over a network.

Penetration Testing: Security testing in which evaluators mimic real-world attacks in an attempt to
identify ways to circumvent the security features of an application, system, or network. Penetration
testing often involves issuing real attacks on real systems and data, using the same tools and techniques
used by actual attackers. Most penetration tests involve looking for combinations of vulnerabilities on a
single system or multiple systems that can be used to gain more access than could be achieved through a
single vulnerability.
