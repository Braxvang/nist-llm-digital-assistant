does not apply to Key Signing Keys. KSK’s shall follow the guidance set in Part 1 of this
Recommendation [SP 800-57 Part 1].

It is recommended that zone administrators migrate DNSSEC zone signing algorithms to
ECDSA by 2015 or when support for ECDSA appears in DNSSEC components,
whichever is sooner.

To minimize the risk when using 1024-bit RSA ZSK’s with DNSSEC, ZSK’s should be
changed more frequently: every one to three months, with a signature validity period of
five to seven days. The ZSK-rollover sequence discussed in [SP 800-81] is recommended
to maintain a valid chain of authentication in DNS data.

8.1.5 Special Considerations for NSEC3
There is a special variant to DNSSEC that minimizes the risk of information leakage and
is known as the Hashed Next Secure (NSEC3) RR [RFC 5155]. In DNSSEC, a client can
map the contents of the zone by sending a series of queries for the Next Secure (NSEC)
RR type found in error messages. These NSEC RRs provide signed proof that the queried
name did not exist, but also provides two names that do exist in the zone as part of that
proof. NSEC3 attempts to minimize this information leakage of zone names by using the
hash values of the two existing names (currently using SHA-1 only). However, this
requires the server and client to be able to perform multiple SHA-1 hash calculations
during runtime; note that this method could be used to mount a Denial of Service attack
against the server if multiple requests are made.
NSEC3 was designed to solve a specific class of information leakage that could lead to a
complete mapping of network resources in a DNS zone. NSEC3 deployment risks are
often greater than the usefulness provided by using NSEC3, unless there is an overriding
need to deploy NSEC3 beyond zone content protection (examples include protecting
personally identifying information that may be contained in the DNS). However, it is a
good idea to use NSEC3-aware client software, because a client may access a zone that
uses NSEC3 RRs with DNSSEC.
System installers and administrators should develop a transition plan to migrate from
SHA-1 to SHA-256, and to do so when SHA-256 becomes available in major software
distributions. This would involve deploying both SHA-1 and SHA-256-based NSEC3
RRs until it is observed that SHA-256-aware implementations have become widely used
in the Internet community.

8.2 Security/Compliance Issues
1. Even though 1024-bit RSA keys are allowed until October 1, 2015 to accommodate
   older versions of DNS clients, 2048-bit RSA keys are strongly recommended for use.

2. Although not strictly necessary to the specification, a Key Signing Key should be
   used to maintain security chains from the parent zone (e.g., .gov) to the zone (e.g.,
   nist.gov). This KSK should be securely transmitted to the delegating parent
   according to the policy and procedure established by the parent zone.
