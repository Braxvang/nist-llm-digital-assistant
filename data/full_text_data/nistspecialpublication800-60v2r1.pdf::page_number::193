Many activities associated with access to care information are not time critical and the adverse
effects of unauthorized modification or destruction of health care information on agency mission
functions and/or public confidence in the agency will be limited. However, the consequences of
unauthorized modification or destruction of health care information may result in incorrect,
inappropriate, or excessively delayed treatment of patients. In these cases, serious adverse
effects can include legal actions and danger to human life. Unauthorized modification or
destruction of information affecting external communications that contain health care
information (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect operations and public
confidence in the agency and the agency mission.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
access to care information is moderate.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to care. Access to care is generally
tolerant of delay. Typically, disruption of access to care information can be expected to have
only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Some access to care information could
be deemed time-critical and is dependent on the severity of the health issue requiring immediate
access to care, patient movements, etc.. Delays in the communication of specific situations may
cause serious impacts to the patient or care provide. This can result in assignment of a moderate
impact level to such information.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
access to care information is low.

D.14.2 Population Health Management and Consumer Safety Information Type

Population Health Management and Consumer Safety assesses health indicators and consumer
products as a means to protect and promote the health of the general population. This includes
monitoring of health, health planning, and health management of humans, animals, animal
products, and plants, as well as tracking the spread of diseases and pests. It also includes
evaluation of consumer products, drug, and foods to assess the potential risks and dangers;
education of the consumer and the general population; and facilitation of health promotion and
disease and injury prevention. The recommended provisional security categorization for
population health management and consumer safety information is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Moderate), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of population health
management and consumer safety information on the ability of responsible agencies to assess
health indicators and consumer products as a means to protect and promote the health of the
general population that will have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or
