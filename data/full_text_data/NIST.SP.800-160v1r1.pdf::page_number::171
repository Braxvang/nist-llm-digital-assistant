I.4.1. Security Purpose
-   Continually identify, analyze, treat, and monitor the risks associated with the uncertainty of
    achieving security objectives and the effects of security protection efforts on achieving
    system objectives.

I.4.2. Security Outcomes
-   Security-relevant risks are identified.
-   Security-relevant risks are analyzed.
-   Security-relevant risk treatments are selected.
-   Security-relevant risk treatments are implemented.
-   Security-relevant risks are evaluated on an ongoing basis to assess changes in status and
    progress in treatment.
-   Security-relevant risks are recorded and maintained in the risk profile.

I.4.3. Security Activities and Tasks
RM-1     PLAN RISK MANAGEMENT
         RM-1.1 Define the security aspects of the risk management strategy.
         Note 1: The nature of security risk includes intentional and unintentional casual events,
         considerations of the intended behaviors and outcomes, functions (security and other
         functions), and the potential effects of security risk realization. Casual events may be
         combinations of events in the operational environment and events in the system environment.
         Note 2: The security aspects scope of the risk management process, risk management approach,
         risk criteria, measures, parameters, rating scale, and treatment alternatives are defined. This
         includes security aspects of the risk management process at all levels of the supply chain (e.g.,
         suppliers, subcontractors) and how they are incorporated into the project risk management
         process.
         Note 3: The strategy can include those security-relevant issues (i.e., risks with a likelihood of
         occurrence of 1) and opportunities (i.e., risks with positive outcomes) within scope and
         approach. Opportunity aspects include opportunity criteria, measures, parameters, rating scale,
         and treatment alternatives.
         RM-1.2 Define and record the security context of the risk management process.
         Note 1: This includes the identification of security-relevant stakeholders and descriptions of
         their perspectives, risk categories, and technical and managerial objectives, assumptions, and
         constraints.
         Note 2: Security opportunities provide potential benefits for the system or project. Security
         contexts consider the security impact of not pursuing an opportunity and the security risk of not
         achieving the effects provided by the opportunity.
