                                 GUIDE TO PROTECTING THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION (PII)



 Audit Review, Analysis, and Reporting (AU-6). Organizations can regularly review and analyze
  information system audit records for indications of inappropriate or unusual activity affecting PII,
  investigate suspicious activity or suspected violations, report findings to appropriate officials, and
  take necessary actions.

 Identification and Authentication (Organizational Users) (IA-2). Users can be uniquely identified
  and authenticated before accessing PII. 65 The strength requirement for the authentication mechanism
  depends on the impact level of the PII and the system as a whole. OMB M-07-16 specifies that
  Federal agencies must ―allow remote access only with two-factor authentication where one of the
  factors is provided by a device separate from the computer gaining access,‖ and also must ―use a
  ‗time-out‘ function for remote access and mobile devices requiring user re-authentication after thirty
  minutes of inactivity.‖
 Media Access (MP-2). Organizations can restrict access to information system media containing PII,
  including digital media (e.g., CDs, USB flash drives, backup tapes) and non-digital media (e.g.,
  paper, microfilm). This could also include portable and mobile devices with a storage capability.
 Media Marking (MP-3). Organizations can label information system media and output containing
  PII to indicate how it should be distributed and handled. The organization could exempt specific
  types of media or output from labeling so long as it remains within a secure environment. Examples
  of labeling are cover sheets on printouts and paper labels on digital media.
 Media Storage (MP-4). Organizations can securely store PII, both in paper and digital forms, until
  the media are destroyed or sanitized using approved equipment, techniques, and procedures. One
  example is the use of storage encryption technologies to protect PII stored on removable media.
 Media Transport (MP-5). Organizations can protect digital and non-digital media and mobile
  devices containing PII that is transported outside the organization‘s controlled areas. Examples of
  protective safeguards are encrypting stored information and locking the media in a container.
 Media Sanitization (MP-6). Organizations can sanitize digital and non-digital media containing PII
  before it is disposed or released for reuse. 66 An example is degaussing a hard drive—applying a
  magnetic field to the drive to render it unusable.
 Transmission Confidentiality (SC-9). Organizations can protect the confidentiality of transmitted
  PII. This is most often accomplished by encrypting the communications or by encrypting the
  information before it is transmitted. 67

 Protection of Information at Rest (SC-28). Organizations can protect the confidentiality of PII at
  rest, which refers to information stored on a secondary storage device, such as a hard drive or backup
  tape. This is usually accomplished by encrypting the stored information.

 Information System Monitoring (SI-4). Organizations can employ automated tools to monitor PII
  internally or at network boundaries for unusual or suspicious transfers or events. An example is the
  use of data loss prevention technologies.
