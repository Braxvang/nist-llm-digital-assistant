Establishing the time when a digital signature was generated is often a critical
consideration. A signed message that includes the (purported) signing time provides no
assurance that the private key was used to sign the message at that time unless the
accuracy of the time can be trusted. With the appropriate use of digital signature-based
timestamps from a Trusted Timestamp Authority (TTA) and/or verifier-supplied data that
is included in the signed message, the signatory can provide some level of assurance
about the time that the message was signed.


KEY WORDS: digital signatures, timeliness, timestamp, Trusted Timestamp Authority
