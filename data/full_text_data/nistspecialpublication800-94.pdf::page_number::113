                                                  GUIDE TO INTRUSION DETECTION AND PREVENTION SYSTEMS (IDPS)



Promiscuous Mode: A configuration setting for a network interface card that causes it to accept all
incoming packets that it sees, regardless of their intended destinations.

Sensor: An intrusion detection and prevention system component that monitors and analyzes network
activity and may also perform prevention actions.

Shim: A layer of host-based intrusion detection and prevention code placed between existing layers of
code on a host that intercepts data and analyzes it.

Signature: A pattern that corresponds to a known threat.

Signature-Based Detection: The process of comparing signatures against observed events to identify
possible incidents.

Spanning Port: A switch port that can see all network traffic going through the switch.

Stateful Protocol Analysis: The process of comparing predetermined profiles of generally accepted
definitions of benign protocol activity for each protocol state against observed events to identify
deviations.

Stealth Mode: Operating an intrusion detection and prevention sensor without IP addresses assigned to
its monitoring network interfaces.

Threshold: A value that sets the limit between normal and abnormal behavior.

Triangulation: Identifying the physical location of a detected threat against a wireless network by
estimating the threat’s approximate distance from multiple wireless sensors by the strength of the threat’s
signal received by each sensor, then calculating the physical location at which the threat would be the
estimated distance from each sensor.

Tuning: Altering the configuration of an intrusion detection and prevention system to improve its
detection accuracy.

Whitelist: A list of discrete entities, such as hosts or applications, that are known to be benign.

Wireless Intrusion Detection and Prevention System: An intrusion detection and prevention system
that monitors wireless network traffic and analyzes its wireless networking protocols to identify and stop
suspicious activity involving the protocols themselves.
