1883   quantitative and qualitative measurement instruments.

1884   5.2.1. Compliance Reporting
1885   One element of the report is to indicate whether the CPLP has met the regulatory compliance
1886   requirements for the organization. The Learning Program Manager should be aware of all
1887   regulations that require reports to be created for their organization. As a subject-matter expert on
1888   the topic of providing training programs for the agency or organization’s employees, the
1889   Learning Program Manager should typically engage in self-development processes that maintain
1890   an awareness of these needs. In some organizations, this may all be handled by a single
1891   individual or group that is assigned to manage legal and regulatory compliance. For those
1892   organizations where the duties are separated, it is critical to maintain collaborative
1893   communication to ensure that the program meets compliance.
1894   A fully developed and integrated CPLP may become a useful tool for supporting enterprise risk
1895   management, although many are initially developed to address compliance requirements in laws,
1896   regulations, policies, or standards. Meeting these compliance measures is often the primary focus
1897   of higher level leadership, but should be only the starting point for a robust CPLP program.
1898   Examples of common quantifiable metrics to demonstrate CPLP compliance include training a
1899   certain percentage of the workforce and the results of practical exercises. Organizations should
1900   determine which compliance measures they must achieve and consider those inputs when
1901   developing the CPLP.
1902   Learning Program Managers should work with policy owners to ensure that the results of the
1903   learning efforts satisfy compliance requirements. The CPLP needs to build in methods that allow
1904   for this type of reporting. That conversation could include questions such as:
1905      •   Which personnel received (or participated in) the learning element?
1906      •   How well does the participation level match the goal of user coverage?
1907      •   How far should the CPLP go in pursuit of expected coverage?
1908      •   Have individuals in compliance-identified roles met their learning requirements?

1909          Evaluating CPLP Effectiveness
1910   Because the focus of this program is on learning and mastering content, it is important to analyze
1911   issues that are typically assigned to the learning and educational branch of the organization. The
1912   cybersecurity and privacy Learning Program Manager needs to be involved in the creation of
1913   course material to ensure that it is accurate, relevant, and timely. This requires analyzing the
1914   accuracy, quality, and appropriateness of delivery of the material in the context of the desired
1915   outcomes. The Learning Program Manager should expect to take an active role in course
1916   development and to follow up after teaching to determine whether the material was delivered as
1917   intended.
1918   Another primary goal of a CPLP is to empower users to demonstrate better decision-making
1919   behaviors. While these types of behavioral improvements tend to be more difficult to measure,
