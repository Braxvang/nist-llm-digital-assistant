                                                                                            SECTION 5: RFID SECURITY CONTROLS



 Digital signatures that are not generated by the tag are subject to replay attacks. An adversary could
  query a tag to obtain its evidence of authenticity (i.e., the digital signature created by a previous
  reader) and then replicate that data on a cloned tag.
 The use of digital signatures to support authentication of readers to tags would require tags to support
  relatively complex cryptographic functions beyond the capacity of most common tag designs.
  Consequently, password or symmetric key authentication systems likely will support tag access
  control, as opposed to tag authenticity verification, for the foreseeable future.
5.3.2     RF Interface Protection

Several types of technical controls focus on the RF interface to tags, including:

 Cover-coding can be used to obscure the content of messages from readers to tags.
 Data can be encrypted prior to its transmission.
 Shielding can be installed to limit eavesdropping and rogue scanning.
 The selection of an operating radio frequency can be used to avoid interference from other sources or
  achieve certain operating characteristics such as the ability to propagate through metals, liquids, and
  other materials that are opaque to many frequencies.
 Reader and active tag transmission characteristics can be tuned to reduce the likelihood of
  eavesdropping and help mitigate interference and the hazards from electromagnetic radiation.
 The RF interface for tags can be temporarily shut off to prevent unauthorized access when the tag is
  not expected to be used for authorized purposes.
 The RF interface may be turned off by default until a user takes an action to activate it.
 Readers may periodically poll tags to determine the presence of the tags, assess system health, and
  acquire environmental data.
These controls are discussed further in Sections 5.3.2.1 through 5.3.2.8.

5.3.2.1 Cover-Coding

Control: Cover-coding is a method for hiding information on the forward channel from eavesdroppers.

In the EPCglobal Class-1 Generation-2 standard, cover-coding is used to obscure passwords and
information written to a tag using the write command. The EPCglobal Class-1 Generation-2 cover-
coding protocol works as follows:

1. The reader sends a message to the tag requesting a key.
2. The tag generates a random 16-bit number (i.e., the key) and returns it to the reader.
3. The reader produces ciphertext (i.e., a message unintelligible to an eavesdropper who cannot intercept
   the key) by applying an exclusive-or (XOR) operation 56 to the key and the plain text.

     The XOR operation is a binary operation denoted with the symbol “⊕” that works as follows: 1 ⊕ 1 = 0; 1 ⊕ 0 = 1; 0 ⊕ 1 =
     1; 0 ⊕ 0 = 0. When the XOR operation is applied to two multi-bit strings, the XOR operation is applied to the first bit of the
     each string to produce the first bit of the result, the second bit of each string to produce the second bit of the result, and so


                                                                5-15
