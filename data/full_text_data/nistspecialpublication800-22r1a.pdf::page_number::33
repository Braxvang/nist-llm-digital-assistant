A STATISTICAL TEST SUITE FOR RANDOM AND PSEUDORANDOM NUMBER GENERATORS FOR CRYPTOGRAPHIC APPLICATIONS




        For example, if n = 20, M = Q = 3, and ε = 01011001001010101101, then partition the stream
                      n 
        into N =          = 2 matrices of cardinality M•Q (3•3 = 9). Note that the last two bits (0 and 1)
                   3 • 3 
                                                0 1 0     0 1 0
        will be discarded. The two matrices are 1 1 0 and 1 0 1 . Note that the first matrix
                                                0 1 0     0 1 1
        consists of the first three bits in row 1, the second set of three bits in row 2, and the third set of
        three bits in row 3. The second matrix is similarly constructed using the next nine bits in the
        sequence.

(2)     Determine the binary rank ( R ) of each matrix, where  = 1,..., N . The method for determining
        the rank is described in Appendix A.

        For the example in this section, the rank of the first matrix is 2 (R1 = 2), and the rank of the
        second matrix is 3 (R2 = 3).

(3)     Let FM = the number of matrices with R = M (full rank),
              FM-1 = the number of matrices with R = M-1 (full rank - 1),
              N – FM - FM-1 = the number of matrices remaining.

        For the example in this section, FM = F3 = 1 (R2 has the full rank of 3), FM-1 = F2 = 1 (R1 has rank
        2), and no matrix has any lower rank.

(4)     Compute
                       (FM − 0.2888N ) 2 (FM −1 − 0.5776N ) 2 (N − FM − FM −1 − 0.1336N ) 2
        χ 2 (obs) =                     +                    +                              .
                           0.2888N            0.5776N                  0.1336N


        For the example in this section,
                                  2                 2                       2
          2
        χ (obs) =
                  (
                  1 − 0.2888 • 2 ) (1 − 0.5776 • 2 ) (2 −1 −1 − 0.1336 • 2 )
                                    +                 +                       = 0.596953.
                         0.2888 • 2            0.5776 • 2                   0.1336 • 2
                                      2
(5)     Compute P − value = e − χ (obs) / 2 . Since there are 3 classes in the example, the P-value for the
                                       χ 2 (obs) 
        example is equal to igamc1,              .
                                            2     

                                                          0.596953
        For the example in this section, P-value = e                 2 = 0.741948.


2.5.5 Decision Rule (at the 1% Level)
If the computed P-value is < 0.01, then conclude that the sequence is non-random. Otherwise, conclude
that the sequence is random.
