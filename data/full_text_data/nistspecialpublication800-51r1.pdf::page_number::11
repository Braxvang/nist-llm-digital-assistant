                                                                 GUIDE TO USING VULNERABILITY NAMING SCHEMES



4.      Recommendations for Software Developers and Service Providers

This section makes recommendations for how software developers and service providers should take
advantage of CVE and CCE’s capabilities. This improves interoperability, thus increasing the efficiency
of security management and improving the effectiveness of security operations. Also, as described in the
introduction to Section 3, using CPE names when indicating which products CVE and CCE names apply
to further supports interoperability and standardization.

4.1     Name Creation

      1. Software developers should participate in the CVE issuance processes to help ensure that CVEs
         provide the necessary information and are created in a timely manner, such as while planning a
         public vulnerability announcement or immediately after a vulnerability has been publicly
         announced. For more information on the CVE issuance process, see
         http://cve.mitre.org/cve/identifiers/index.html or contact cve@mitre.org.

      2. Authors of CVE names should reference applicable vendor patch identification whenever
         possible.

      3. Software developers are encouraged to work with the MITRE Corporation to establish unique
         CCE identifiers for their products’ security configuration settings. Basic information on this is
         available at http://cce.mitre.org/lists/creation_process.html. Software developers should contact
         the CCE Content Team at cce@mitre.org for more information on the process.

4.2     Name Use

      1. Software developers and service providers should incorporate support for CVE and CCE into
         their products and services that reference publicly known software vulnerabilities. Also, CPE
         names should be used when indicating which products the CVE and CCE names apply to.

      2. Software developers and service providers should incorporate the appropriate authoritative CVE
         and/or CCE names in their security advisories and other vulnerability-related documentation and
         communications, as well as the CPE names that indicate which products the CVE and/or CCE
         names apply to. Using CVE, CCE, and CPE names supports the use of standardized security
         automation technologies, which rely on common vulnerability and product names, and ensures
         clarity when referencing a given vulnerability.
