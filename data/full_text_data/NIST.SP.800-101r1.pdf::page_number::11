                                                               Guidelines on Mobile Device Forensics


1. Introduction

 1.1   Purpose and Scope

       This guide provides basic information on mobile forensics tools and the preservation,
       acquisition, examination and analysis, and reporting of digital evidence present on mobile
       devices. This information is relevant to law enforcement, incident response and other types of
       investigations. This guide focuses mainly on the characteristics of cellular mobile devices,
       including feature phones, smartphones, and tablets with cellular voice capabilities. It also
       covers provisions to be taken into consideration during the course of an incident investigation.

       This guide is intended to address common circumstances that may be encountered by
       organizational security staff and law enforcement investigators involving digital electronic data
       residing on mobile devices and associated electronic media. It is also intended to complement
       existing guidelines and delve more deeply into issues related to mobile devices and their
       examination and analysis.

       Procedures and techniques presented in this document are a compilation of best practices
       within the discipline and references have been taken from existing forensic guidelines. This
       publication is not to be used as a step-by-step guide for executing a proper forensic
       investigation when dealing with mobile devices nor construed as legal advice. Its purpose is to
       inform readers of the various technologies involved and potential ways to approach them from
       a forensic point of view. Readers are advised to apply the recommended practices only after
       consultation with management and legal officials for compliance with laws and regulations
       (i.e., local, state, federal, and international) that are applicable.

 1.2   Audience and Assumptions

       The intended audience is varied and ranges from forensic examiners to response team
       members handling a computer security incident to organizational security officials
       investigating an employee-related incident. The practices recommended in this guide are
       designed to highlight key technical principles associated with the handling and examination of
       mobile devices. Readers are assumed to have a basic understanding of traditional digital
       forensic methodologies and capabilities involving stand-alone computers. Due to the changing
       nature of mobile devices and their related forensic procedures and tools, readers are expected
       to be aware of and employ additional resources for the most current information.

 1.3   Document Structure

       The guide is divided into the following chapters and appendices:

              Chapter 1 explains the authority, purpose and scope, audience and assumptions of the
               document and outlines its structure.

              Chapter 2 provides a background on mobile device characteristics, the internal
               memory of mobile devices, and characteristics of identity modules and cellular
               networks.
