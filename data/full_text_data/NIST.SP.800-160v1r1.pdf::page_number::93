     outcomes. For example, a protection control enforcement function enforces a decision to
     grant or deny access to a resource.
•    Protection Control Infrastructure Functions: These functions support and help protection
     control enforcement and control decision functions fulfill their purposes. The functions also
     provide data or services or perform operations upon which protection control enforcement
     and decision functions depend. For example, a protection control infrastructure function
     includes secure storage, secure communication, and anomaly detection mechanisms.

Other functions, including control functions for other purposes besides protection, can
potentially adversely affect the correct operation of the protection control functions. For the
purposes of secure design and evaluation, the functions are designated other system functions.
Ideally, these functions should be non-interfering. This non-interference objective may be
achieved through assurance with constraints on the requirements, architecture, design, and use of
these functions.

System functions can be mapped to one or more protection control decision functions, protection
control enforcement functions, or protection control infrastructure functions, or other system
functions for the purpose of secure design and evaluation. The distinction guides and informs a
principled design to limit interference among functions with confidence. Such confidence can be
achieved by employing Trustworthy System Control, applying the design criteria described in
Section D.4.2, and optimally placing a function in the system architecture to limit the side effects
and interactions that may interfere with the protection control functions.

System analyses can determine the extent to which functions may interfere with other functions,
including identifying any needed actions to increase assurance (Appendix F). For example, to
satisfy a specific size or form-factor constraint, a system function mapped to a system function
designated as “other” may occupy the same privilege domain as control enforcement, control
decision, or control infrastructure functions, thereby elevating the privilege of that system
function. If the size or form-factor constraint does not exist, it would be prudent to allocate that
system function elsewhere to avoid giving the function elevated privilege. This would increase
the assurance that the enforcement, decision, and infrastructure functions are isolated from the
other parts of the system and would not be adversely impacted by their behavior or provide an
avenue for attack.

D.4.2. Essential Design Criteria for Mechanisms
To effectively achieve the objectives of trustworthy secure design, mechanisms (i.e., engineered
features and devices) must satisfy four essential design criteria. They must be non-bypassable,
evaluatable, always invoked, and tamper-proof [35]. Generally, a design for any control function
that provides protection should adhere to these criteria. 71 Table 3 briefly describes the essential
design criteria.

  The argument that any control function should be non-bypassable, evaluatable, always invoked, and tamper-proof follows from an in-depth
examination of Systems Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) as described in [36], specifically the discussions on why controls may fail and how
to address failure.
