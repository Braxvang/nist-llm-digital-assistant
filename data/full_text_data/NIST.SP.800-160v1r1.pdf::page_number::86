Appendix D. Trustworthy Secure Design
This appendix discusses the approach and considerations for applying technical 63 concepts of a
trustworthy secure system design. The concepts described provide a balanced and integrated
approach that optimally protects against asset loss. The discussions include the design approach
for trustworthy systems (Section D.1), authorized and intended behaviors and outcomes of the
system (Section D.2), security design order of precedence (Section D.3), and functional design
and trade space considerations (Section D.4).

A principled system design strengthens trustworthiness claims [2]. The concepts in this appendix
and the principles in Appendix E provide a sound basis for reasoning about a system and enable
the demonstration of system trustworthiness. Applying concepts and principles and using other
enablers (e.g., standards, specifications, design patterns, security policy models, cryptographic
algorithms, security protocols, strength of mechanism, and known adversities) should be planned
for, appropriately scoped, and revisited throughout the system life cycle and engineering effort.

Finally, trustworthiness and assurance needs and considerations also inform trustworthy secure
design. Appendix F provides further discussion of the concepts of trustworthiness and assurance.


                                                   TRUSTWORTHY SECURE DESIGN
                         Trustworthy secure design is a means to provide stakeholders with the
                         confidence that their conflicting capability needs, concerns, priorities,
                         and constraints are satisfied.




D.1.       Design Approach for Trustworthy Systems
The design approach for engineering trustworthy secure systems is intended to establish and
maintain the ability to deliver system capabilities at an acceptable level of performance 64 while
minimizing the occurrence and extent of loss. This approach provides a system structure for
optimal employment of the engineered features and devices. The system design must provide the
intended behaviors and outcomes, avoid the unintended behaviors and outcomes, prevent loss,
and limit loss when it occurs. A trustworthy secure design includes a situational awareness
capability and margin 65 to account for adversity due to the unknowns and uncertainty inherent in
the system and in its operational environment. The situational awareness capability helps to
determine accountability for the actions of all users and entities (e.g., audit, logging, event

   Note that human factor elements of trust are not discussed. A system may be trustworthy, but a user may not trust it. Similarly, a user may trust
an untrustworthy system.

   An acceptable level of performance lies between the minimum threshold of acceptability and the objective of maximum performance. This
level may vary across operational or system states and modes (e.g., patrolling in clear weather versus severe weather conditions), may vary across
contingency conditions (e.g., normal, degraded), and may be subject to operational priorities (e.g., search and rescue, manhunt).
65
   The term margin refers to a spare amount, measure, or degree allowed or given for contingencies or special situations. The allowances are
carried to account for uncertainties and risks. Two types of margins are used in systems engineering: design margin and operational margin. See
the design principle of Loss Margins.
