                                                                 COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE



    reducing the amount of administrative work that team members are responsible for performing, can
    be a significant boost to morale.
 Cost. Cost is a major factor, especially if employees are required to be onsite 24/7. Organizations
  may fail to include incident response-specific costs in budgets, such as sufficient funding for training
  and maintaining skills. Because the incident response team works with so many facets of IT, its
  members need much broader knowledge than most IT staff members. They must also understand how
  to use the tools of incident response, such as digital forensics software. Other costs that may be
  overlooked are physical security for the team’s work areas and communications mechanisms.
 Staff Expertise. Incident handling requires specialized knowledge and experience in several
  technical areas; the breadth and depth of knowledge required varies based on the severity of the
  organization’s risks. Outsourcers may possess deeper knowledge of intrusion detection, forensics,
  vulnerabilities, exploits, and other aspects of security than employees of the organization. Also,
  MSSPs may be able to correlate events among customers so that they can identify new threats more
  quickly than any individual customer could. However, technical staff members within the
  organization usually have much better knowledge of the organization’s environment than an
  outsourcer would, which can be beneficial in identifying false positives associated with organization-
  specific behavior and the criticality of targets. Section 2.4.3 contains additional information on
  recommended team member skills.
When considering outsourcing, organizations should keep these issues in mind:

 Current and Future Quality of Work. Organizations should consider not only the current quality
  (breadth and depth) of the outsourcer’s work, but also efforts to ensure the quality of future work—
  for example, minimizing turnover and burnout and providing a solid training program for new
  employees. Organizations should think about how they could objectively assess the quality of the
  outsourcer’s work.
 Division of Responsibilities. Organizations are often unwilling to give an outsourcer authority to
  make operational decisions for the environment (e.g., disconnecting a web server). It is important to
  document the appropriate actions for these decision points. For example, one partially outsourced
  model addresses this issue by having the outsourcer provide incident data to the organization’s
  internal team, along with recommendations for further handling the incident. The internal team
  ultimately makes the operational decisions, with the outsourcer continuing to provide support as
  needed.
 Sensitive Information Revealed to the Contractor. Dividing incident response responsibilities and
  restricting access to sensitive information can limit this. For example, a contractor may determine
  what user ID was used in an incident (e.g., ID 123456) but not know what person is associated with
  the user ID. Employees can then take over the investigation. Non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) are
  one possible option for protecting the disclosure of sensitive information.
 Lack of Organization-Specific Knowledge. Accurate analysis and prioritization of incidents are
  dependent on specific knowledge of the organization’s environment. The organization should provide
  the outsourcer regularly updated documents that define what incidents it is concerned about, which
  resources are critical, and what the level of response should be under various sets of circumstances.
  The organization should also report all changes and updates made to its IT infrastructure, network
  configuration, and systems. Otherwise, the contractor has to make a best guess as to how each
  incident should be handled, inevitably leading to mishandled incidents and frustration on both sides.
  Lack of organization-specific knowledge can also be a problem when incident response is not
  outsourced if communications are weak among teams or if the organization simply does not collect
  the necessary information.
