components of IPsec include the Authentication Header (AH), Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP),
Internet Key Exchange (IKE), and IP Payload Compression Protocol (IPComp). 22

In many environments, network layer controls such as IPsec provide a much better solution than transport
or application layer controls because of the difficulties in adding controls to individual applications.
Another advantage of network layer controls is that since IP information (e.g., IP addresses) is added at
this layer, the controls can protect both the data within the packets and the IP information for each packet.
Nevertheless, network layer controls provide less control and flexibility for protecting specific
applications than transport and application layer controls.

6.3     Application Layer “VPNs”

As discussed in Section 2.1, each application layer protocol provides protection for only a single
application. In many cases, the protocol protects only a portion of the application data. For example, the
S/MIME and OpenPGP application protocols can be used in conjunction with email servers to encrypt the
body of an email, but not the email headers (which include addressing information). Doing the
encrypting at the mail server creates a secure path between the mail servers, but only for the data covered
by the cryptographic changes.

It is difficult to call such encryption a VPN. It is not a network: it is a set of paths. Even if the entire
message is encrypted, such as with Voice over IP (VoIP) that is using encryption, it is by no means a
network: it is just a collection of encrypted data. Thus, it is incorrect to call anything above the network
layer a “VPN”, although many companies market their application-layer encryption products as such.

A commonly used application layer protocol suite is Secure Shell (SSH), which contains secure
replacements for several unencrypted application protocols, including telnet, Remote Copy Protocol
(RCP), and FTP. The SSH client program itself provides protection for remote logins to another system.
Some organizations extend the use of the SSH application by establishing SSH tunnels between hosts,
and then passing other communications through the tunnels. This allows many applications to be
protected at one time through a single tunnel. Generally, the tunnel is constructed between a remote
user’s system and a server within the organization that the user can log into. Because a single SSH tunnel
can provide protection for one or more applications at the same time, it is technically a transport layer
VPN protocol, not application layer.

SSH tunnel-based VPNs are resource-intensive to set up. They require the installation and configuration
of SSH client software on each user’s machine, as well as the reconfiguration of client applications to use
the tunnel. Each user must also have login privileges on a server within the organization. Generally,
users need to have solid technical skills so that they can configure systems and applications themselves,
as well as troubleshoot problems that occur. Because of this, using SSH tunnels as a VPN is uncommon,
particularly when compared to SSL VPN deployment.

6.4     Summary

Section 6 describes the main alternatives to SSL VPNs. Data link layer VPN protocols, such as PPTP,
L2TP, and L2F; network layer VPN protocols, primarily IPsec; and application layer “VPN” protocols,
including OpenPGP and SSH, are all effective alternatives to SSL VPNs for particular needs and
environments. Table 6-1 provides a high-level comparison of the alternatives. The following summarizes
the key points from Section 6:
