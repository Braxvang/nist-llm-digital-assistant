     Cybersecurity Framework Smart Grid Profile
     In FY 2019, engineers from NISTâ€™s EL and ITL developed an example Smart Grid
     implementation of a NIST Cybersecurity Framework Profile. The Smart Grid Profile
     applies risk management strategies from the Cybersecurity Framework to the smart
     grid and serves as a foundation for refinements to support new grid architectures. The
     Profile provides cybersecurity risk management guidance to power system owners and
     operators by prioritizing cybersecurity activities based on their effectiveness in helping
     achieve common high-level business objectives for the smart grid. The Profile also
     provides a list of considerations relevant to the challenges that power system owners
     and operators may experience as they implement these cybersecurity activities in
     infrastructures with high concentrations of distributed energy resources. The results were
     published in NIST Technical Note 2051, Cybersecurity Framework Smart Grid Profile [18].


     Security Aspects of Electronic Voting
     The Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA)1 encourages the upgrading of voting
     equipment across the United States and has established the Election Assistance
     Commission (EAC)2 and the Technical Guidelines Development Committee (TGDC).3
     NIST chairs the TGDC and provides technical support related to human factors, security,
     and laboratory accreditation. In FY 2019, NIST developed the Voluntary Voting System
     Guidelines 2.0 (VVSG 2.0) for national-level voting system standards. VVSG 2.0 is a
     recommendation from the Technical Guidelines Development Committee (TGDC) to the
     Election Assistance Commission (EAC) for a voting system standard written to address
     the next generation of voting equipment.
     In FY 2019, NIST provided technical leadership to create an Election Profile of the
     Cybersecurity Framework in partnership with the Department of Homeland Security
     (DHS) and the private sector chair of the DHS Sector Coordinating Committee.
     The Election Profile will serve as a one-stop cybersecurity playbook that matches
     cybersecurity requirements with operational methodologies across all election
     processes, from voter registration through election reporting and auditing. The profile
     can be used by Secretaries of State and state and local election officials to identify
     and prioritize opportunities to improve their cybersecurity posture. NIST has provided
     training on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and profile development and plans to
     hold future workshops to identify election processes and assets that need protection,
