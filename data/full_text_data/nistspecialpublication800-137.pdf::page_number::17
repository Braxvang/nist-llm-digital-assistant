and monitor risk across the organization. The ongoing monitoring activities implemented at the
information systems tier provide security-related information to authorizing officials (AOs) in
support of ongoing system authorization decisions and to the risk executive (function) in support
of ongoing organizational risk management.

At Tier 3, RMF Step 6 Monitor activities and ISCM activities are closely aligned. The assessment
methods relevant for implemented security controls are the same whether the assessments are
being done solely in support of system authorization or in support of a broader, more
comprehensive continuous monitoring effort. Information systems tier officials and staff conduct
assessments and monitoring, and analyze results on an ongoing basis. The information is
leveraged at the organization, mission/business processes, and information systems tiers to
support risk management. Though frequency requirements differ, each tier receives the benefit of
security-related information that is current and applicable to affected processes. RMF Step 6
activities performed within the context of an ISCM program support information system risk
determination and acceptance, i.e., authorization (RMF Step 5) on an ongoing basis.

2.2     ONGOING S YSTEM AUTHORIZATIONS
Initial authorization to operate is based on evidence available at one point in time, but systems
and environments of operation change. Ongoing assessment of security control effectiveness
supports a system’s security authorization over time in highly dynamic environments of operation
with changing threats, vulnerabilities, technologies, and missions/business processes. Through
ISCM, new threat or vulnerability information is evaluated as it becomes available, permitting
organizations to make adjustments to security requirements or individual controls as needed to
maintain authorization decisions. The process for obtaining system authorization, and more
generally, for managing information security and information system-related risk, is the RMF.19
The RMF, illustrated in Figure 2-2, provides a disciplined and structured process that integrates
information system security and risk management activities into the SDLC. The monitoring step
(Step 6) of the RMF includes interactions between the three tiers as illustrated in the
organizational view of ISCM in Figure 2-1. Interaction between the tiers includes data from
system owners, common control providers, and authorizing officials on security control
assessments and ongoing authorization of system and common controls provided to the risk
executive (function). 20 There is also dissemination of updated risk-related information such as
vulnerability and threat data and organizational risk tolerance from Tiers 1 and 2 to authorizing
officials and information system owners. When the RMF is applied within an organization that
has also implemented a robust ISCM strategy, organizational officials are provided with a view of
the organizational security posture and each system’s contribution to said posture on demand.

     System authorization to operate may be partially dependent on assessment/monitoring and ongoing security
     authorization of common controls. NIST SP 800-37, as amended, provides information on security authorization
     of common controls.

     Roles and responsibilities of organizational officials within a continuous monitoring program are discussed in
     Section 2.4. NIST SP 800-37, as amended, describes the interaction of the risk executive (function) in the context
     of the RMF.
