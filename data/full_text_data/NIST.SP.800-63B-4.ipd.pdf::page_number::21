      NIST SP 800-63B-4 ipd                                             Digital Identity Guidelines
      December 2022                                      Authentication and Lifecycle Management


521   4.2.2. Authenticator and VeriÔ¨Åer Requirements
522   Cryptographic authenticators used at AAL2 SHALL use approved cryptography.
523   Authenticators procured by federal government agencies SHALL be validated to meet
524   the requirements of [FIPS140] Level 1. Software-based authenticators that operate within
525   the context of an operating system MAY , where applicable, attempt to detect compromise
526   (e.g., by malware) of the platform in which they are running. They SHOULD NOT
527   complete the operation when such a compromise is detected. At least one authenticator
528   used at AAL2 SHALL be replay resistant as described in Sec. 5.2.8. Authentication at
529   AAL2 SHOULD demonstrate authentication intent from at least one authenticator as
530   discussed in Sec. 5.2.9.
531   Communication between the claimant and verifier SHALL be via an authenticated
532   protected channel to provide confidentiality of the authenticator output and resistance
533   to AitM attacks.
534   Verifiers operated by or on behalf of federal government agencies at AAL2 SHALL be
535   validated to meet the requirements of [FIPS140] Level 1.
536   When a biometric factor is used in authentication at AAL2, the performance requirements
537   stated in Sec. 5.2.3 SHALL be met, and the verifier SHOULD make a determination that
538   the biometric sensor and subsequent processing meet these requirements.
539   OMB Memorandum [M-22-09] requires federal government agencies to offer at least
540   one phishing-resistant authenticator option to public users at AAL2. While phishing
541   resistance as described in Sec. 5.2.5 is not generally required for authentication at AAL2,
542   verifiers SHOULD encourage the use of phishing-resistant authenticators at AAL2
543   whenever practical since phishing is a significant threat vector.

544   4.2.3. Reauthentication
545   Periodic reauthentication of subscriber sessions SHALL be performed as described in
546   Sec. 7.2. At AAL2, authentication of the subscriber SHALL be repeated at least once per
547   12 hours during an extended usage session, regardless of user activity. Reauthentication of
548   the subscriber SHALL be repeated following any period of inactivity lasting 30 minutes
549   or longer. The session SHALL be terminated (i.e., logged out) when either of these time
550   limits is reached.
551   Reauthentication of a session that has not yet reached its time limit MAY require only
552   a memorized secret or a biometric in conjunction with the still-valid session secret. The
553   verifier MAY prompt the user to cause activity just before the inactivity timeout.

554   4.2.4. Security Controls
555   The CSP SHALL employ appropriately tailored security controls from the baseline
556   security controls defined in [SP800-53] or equivalent federal (e.g., [FEDRAMP]) or
557   industry standard that the organization has determined for the information systems,

                                                   9
