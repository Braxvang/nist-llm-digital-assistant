                                                                GUIDELINES ON FIREWALLS AND FIREWALL POLICY


2.4   Summary of Recommendations

The following items summarize the major recommendations from this section:

 The use of NAT should be considered a form of routing, not a type of firewall.
 Organizations should only permit outbound traffic that uses the source IP addresses in use by the
  organization.
 Compliance checking is only useful in a firewall when it can block communication that can be
  harmful to protected systems.
 When choosing the type of firewall to deploy, it is important to decide whether the firewall needs to
  act as an application proxy.
 Management of personal firewalls should be centralized to help efficiently create, distribute, and
  enforce policies for all users and groups.
