In the above table, the digital signature algorithm suite is given as both RSA-SHA1 and RSA-SHA256.
This is because as of the time of writing, RSA-SHA1 is the only algorithm that is both Mandatory for
implementations and Approved for use in the Federal Government. However, RSA-SHA1 will be phased
out and replaced by RSA-SHA256 within the Federal Government. It is expected that not all software
will be updated – especially outside the Federal Government. Because of this, DNS administrators may
wish to deploy and use both algorithms for a period of time so DNSSEC client software that does not
understand RSA-SHA256 can still get some protection from DNSSEC. The DNS root zone uses
RSA/SHA-256 for signing, so deployment of RSA/SHA-256 enabled DNS validators has quickened. It is
recommended that new DNSSEC deployments (i.e. initial signing) consider using RSA/SHA-256 or ECDSA,
rather than going through the complicated process of algorithm rollover.

The use of RSA in DNSSEC is approved until the year 2015. By this time, it is expected that Elliptic
Curve Cryptography (ECC) will be specified in the DNSSEC. USG DNS administrators should plan to
migrate to the use of ECDSA (or similar) when it becomes available in DNSSEC components. ECC has
an advantage of having the same precieved strength as RSA with a smaller key size. This means that the
ZSK can be the same size as the KSK and have a longer cryptoperiod than a 1024 bit RSA ZSK.

9.3.1   Key Pair Generation—Illustrative Example

Every DNSSEC-aware name server implementation should provide a utility program for generating
asymmetric key pairs (a public-private key pair). The use of one such program, dnssec-keygen (provided
by BIND 9.X), is illustrated below:

        dnssec-keygen –a algorithm – b bits –n type [options] name

   where algorithm (under –a parameter) can be one of the following:

        •   RSASHA1

        •   RSASHA1-NSEC3-SHA1

        •   DSASHA1

        •   RSASHA256
