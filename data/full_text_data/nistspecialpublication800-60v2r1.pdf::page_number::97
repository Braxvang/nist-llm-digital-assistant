can be expected to have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or
individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Where payment activities are part of an
agencyâ€™s service delivery mission (e.g., payment of benefits), the consequences of loss of
information availability that result in failure of payments to go to the appropriate entity can range
from minor to life-threatening. In such cases, the availability impact level can be moderate or
high. (See C.2.8.11.)

Recommended Availability Impact Level: For most Federal government payment systems, the
provisional availability impact level recommended for payments information is low.
C.3.2.6 Collections and Receivables Information Type

Collections and Receivables include deposits, fund transfers, and receipts for sales or service.
Receivable management supports activities associated with recognizing and recording debts due
to the Government, performing follow-up actions to collect on these debts, and recording cash
receipts. The recommended security categorization for the collections and receivables
information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Moderate), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of collections and
receivables information on the ability of responsible agencies to recognize and record debts due
to the Government, perform follow-up actions to collect on these debts, and record cash receipts.
In most cases, unauthorized disclosure of receivable management information will have only a
limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for collections and receivables information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. An
accumulation of small changes to data or deletion of small entries can result in revenue
shortfalls. In most cases, the adverse effects of consequent negative publicity and institution of
corrective action programs on mission functions or public confidence in the agency can be
serious.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact recommended for
collections and receivables information is moderate.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the collections and receivables
information. Collections and receivables processes are generally tolerant of delay. Typically,
