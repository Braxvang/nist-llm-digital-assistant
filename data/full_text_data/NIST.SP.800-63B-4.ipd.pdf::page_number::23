      NIST SP 800-63B-4 ipd                                             Digital Identity Guidelines
      December 2022                                      Authentication and Lifecycle Management


593   described in Sec. 5.2.8. All authentication and reauthentication processes at AAL3
594    SHALL demonstrate authentication intent from at least one authenticator as described
595   in Sec. 5.2.9.
596   Multi-factor authenticators used at AAL3 SHALL be hardware cryptographic modules
597   validated at [FIPS140] Level 2 or higher overall with at least [FIPS140] Level 3 physical
598   security. Single-factor cryptographic devices used at AAL3 SHALL be validated at
599   [FIPS140] Level 1 or higher overall with at least [FIPS140] Level 3 physical security.
600   Verifiers at AAL3 SHALL be validated at [FIPS140] Level 1 or higher.
601   Verifiers at AAL3 SHALL be verifier compromise resistant as described in Sec. 5.2.7
602   with respect to at least one authentication factor.
603   Hardware-based authenticators and verifiers at AAL3 SHOULD resist relevant side-
604   channel (e.g., timing and power-consumption analysis) attacks.
605   When a biometric factor is used in authentication at AAL3, the verifier SHALL make a
606   determination that the biometric sensor and subsequent processing meet the performance
607   requirements stated in Sec. 5.2.3.

608   4.3.3. Reauthentication
609   Periodic reauthentication of subscriber sessions SHALL be performed as described in
610   Sec. 7.2. At AAL3, authentication of the subscriber SHALL be repeated at least once
611   per 12 hours during an extended usage session, regardless of user activity, as described in
612   Sec. 7.2. Reauthentication of the subscriber SHALL be repeated following any period of
613   inactivity lasting 15 minutes or longer. Reauthentication SHALL use both authentication
614   factors. The session SHALL be terminated (i.e., logged out) when either of these time
615   limits is reached. The verifier MAY prompt the user to cause activity just before the
616   inactivity timeout.

617   4.3.4. Security Controls
618   The CSP SHALL employ appropriately tailored security controls from the baseline
619   security controls defined in [SP800-53] or equivalent federal (e.g., [FEDRAMP]) or
620   industry standard that the organization has determined for the information systems,
621   applications, and online services that these guidelines are used to protect. The CSP
622    SHALL ensure that the minimum assurance-related controls for the appropriate systems,
623   or equivalent, are satisfied.

624   4.3.5. Records Retention Policy
625   The CSP SHALL comply with its respective records retention policies in accordance
626   with applicable laws, regulations, and policies, including any NARA records retention
627   schedules that may apply. If the CSP opts to retain records in the absence of any


                                                  11
