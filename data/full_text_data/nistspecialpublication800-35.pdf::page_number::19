2.    Roles and Responsibilities

The list of participants for selecting, implementing, and managing a given service will depend on the type
and scope of the service, the service arrangement, and type/size of organization. A large federal agency
that is seeking to partner with an external organization for many of its IT security functions will have
different requirements and therefore a more extensive list of participants than a small business seeking a
limited-scope IT security training program for its employees. The following roles are generic to many
different services. The actual list of participants may be less than or greater than the list provided below.
For instance, if an internal group within an organization provides the security service, the contracting
officer and Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) may not have a role.

2.1   Chief Information Officer

The CIO is responsible for the organization’s IT planning, budgeting, investment, performance and
acquisition. As such, the CIO oversees senior organization personnel in obtaining efficient and effective
IT security services.

2.2   Contracting Officer

The Contracting Officer has the authority to enter into, administer, and/or terminate contracts and make
related determinations and findings.

2.3   Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative

The Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) is a qualified employee appointed by the
Contracting Officer to act as its technical representative in managing the technical aspects of a particular
contract.

2.4   IT Investment Board (or equivalent)

The IT Investment Board, or its equivalent, is responsible for managing the capital planning and
investment control process defined by the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 (Section 5).

2.5   IT Security Program Manager

The IT Security Program Manager is responsible for developing or applying enterprise standards for IT
security. This individual plays a leading role in introducing an appropriate, structured methodology to
help identify, evaluate, and minimize IT security risks to the organization. IT security program managers
coordinate and perform system risk analyses, analyze risk mitigation alternatives, and build the business
case for the acquisition of appropriate security solutions that help ensure mission accomplishment in the
face of real-world threats. They also support senior management in ensuring that security management
activities are conducted as required to meet the organization’s needs.

2.6   IT System Security Officer

The IT System Security Officer is responsible for ensuring the security of an information system
throughout its life cycle.
