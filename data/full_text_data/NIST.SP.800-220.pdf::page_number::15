Identity and Access Management (IdAM) is a fundamental and critical cybersecurity capability
to ensure that the right people and things have the appropriate access to the proper resources
at the right time. To advance the state of IdAM, NIST:
•   Conducts focused research to better understand new and emerging technologies, impacts
    on existing standards, and ways to implement IdAM solutions;
•   Leads in the development of national and international IdAM standards, guidance, best
    practices, profiles, and frameworks to create an enhanced, interoperable suite of secure,
    privacy-enhancing solutions;
•   Evolves its IdAM standards, guidelines, and resources; and
•   Produces example solutions that bring together the IdAM requirements needed to address
    specific business cybersecurity challenges.
IdAM is an important component of cloud computing security, and NIST publishes access
control characteristics and general access control guidelines for various cloud service models.
NIST also performs research and development regarding access control rules and methods.
Personal Identity Verification (PIV)
As required by Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12, NIST developed and maintains
FIPS 201 for the personal identity verification (PIV) of federal employees and contractors. In FY
2019, NIST initiated a revision of FIPS 201 to incorporate the changing business requirements
of federal departments and agencies and to adapt to an evolving technology environment.
Revision activities began in FY 2019 with a business requirement meeting to engage with
federal stakeholders about the revision goals.
In FY 2020, the PIV team updated the draft standard based on the revision goals and published
a public draft of FIPS 201. Comments received were adjudicated in FY 2021 and subsequently
reflected in the final FIPS 201. The standard expands the set of PIV authenticators beyond the
current practices (including the current smart card form factor) while addressing the interagency
