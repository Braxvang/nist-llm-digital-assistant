ESTABLISHING WIRELESS ROBUST SECURITY NETWORKS: A GUIDE TO IEEE 802.11I



2.2.2    Infrastructure Mode

In infrastructure mode, an IEEE 802.11 WLAN comprises one or more Basic Service Sets (BSS), the
basic building blocks of a WLAN. A BSS includes an AP and one or more STAs. The AP in a BSS
connects the STAs to the DS. The DS is the means by which STAs can communicate with the
organizationâ€™s wired LANs and external networks such as the Internet. The IEEE 802.11 infrastructure
mode is depicted in Figure 2-2.

The DS and use of multiple BSSs and their associated APs allow for the creation of wireless networks of
arbitrary size and complexity. In the IEEE 802.11 specification, this type of multi-BSS network is
referred to as an extended service set (ESS). Figure 2-3 conceptually depicts a network with both wired
and wireless capabilities. It shows three APs with their corresponding BSSs, which comprise an ESS; the
ESS is attached to the wired infrastructure. In turn, the wired infrastructure is connected through a
perimeter firewall to the Internet. This architecture could permit various STAs, such as laptops and
PDAs, to provide Internet connectivity for their users.

2.3     Summary

WLANs are usually implemented as extensions to existing wired LANs, and are used by devices within a
fairly limited range, such as an office building. The need for interoperability among different brands of
WLAN products led to the development of various WLAN standards. IEEE 802.11 is the dominant
WLAN standard. At the time that the IEEE 802.11i amendment was finalized, WLAN equipment based
on IEEE 802.11b was the most popular; it was intended to provide performance, throughput, and security
features comparable to wired LANs. Unfortunately, IEEE 802.11 technologies that rely on WEP have
several well-documented security problems, which are described in Section 3. To address these, IEEE
amended 802.11 with 802.11i, which was approved in June 2004. The subsequent sections of this guide
cover IEEE 802.11i features and security considerations in depth.
