D.7 Energy
Energy refers to all actions performed by the government to ensure the procurement and
management of energy resources, including the production, sale and distribution of energy, as
well as the management of spent fuel resources. Energy management includes all types of mass-
produced energy (e.g., hydroelectric, nuclear, wind, solar, or fossil fuels). Also included in this
mission area is the oversight of private industry.

D.7.1 Energy Supply Information Type

Energy Supply involves all activities devoted to ensuring the availability of an adequate supply
of energy for the United States and its citizens. Energy Supply includes the sale and
transportation of commodity fuels such as coal, oil, natural gas, and radioactive materials. This
function also includes distributing and transferring power, electric generation, and/or storage
located near the point of use. Impacts to some information and information systems associated
with energy supply may affect the security of critical infrastructures, particularly in the areas of
energy transmission and transport. The following recommended provisional categorization of the
energy supply information type is particularly subject to change where critical infrastructure
elements or nuclear materials are involved:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low 37 ), (integrity, Moderate38), (availability, Moderate 38 )}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of energy supply
information on the ability of responsible agencies to conduct activities related to the sale and
transportation of commodity fuels such as coal, oil, natural gas, and radioactive materials. This
function also includes distributing and transferring power, electric generation, and/or storage
located near the point of use. Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting
external communications (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect operations
and/or public confidence in the agency, but the damage to the mission would usually be limited.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: The consequences of unauthorized
disclosure of energy supply information can have a serious economic impact with respect to
competitive advantages and financial and commodity market dynamics. Also, the unauthorized
disclosure of supply information may assist terrorists in the theft of energy products or disruption
of energy distribution channels. Facilitation of theft of nuclear materials is a particularly
catastrophic potential result of unauthorized disclosure of specific types of energy supply
information. In these cases, the confidentiality impact must be considered to be high.

[Some information regarding transportation and storage of nuclear materials is classified. The
classified information is national security related and is outside the scope of this guideline.
Other information, such as Nuclear Regulatory Commission “SAFEGUARDS” information is
not national security information, but must be treated as having high confidentiality impact.]

37
   Risk level is usually high where safety of radioactive materials, highly flammable fuels, or major transmission
   channels or control processes is at risk.
38
   Risk level is usually moderate or high where mission-critical procedures are involved.
