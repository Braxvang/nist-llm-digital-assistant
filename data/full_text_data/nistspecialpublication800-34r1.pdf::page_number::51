Notifications sent via email should be done with caution because there is no way to ensure receipt and
acknowledgement. Although email has potential as an effective method of disseminating notifications to
work or personal accounts, there is no way to guarantee that the message will be read. If using an email
notification method, recovery personnel should be informed of the necessity to frequently and regularly
check their accounts. Notifications sent during business hours should be sent to the work address,
whereas personal email messaging may be useful in the event that the local area network (LAN) is down.

The notification strategy should define procedures to be followed in the event that specific personnel
cannot be contacted. Notification procedures should be documented clearly in the contingency plan.
Copies of the procedures can be made and located securely at alternate locations. A common manual
notification method is a call tree. This technique involves assigning notification duties to specific
individuals, who in turn are responsible for notifying other recovery personnel. The call tree should
account for primary and alternate contact methods and should discuss procedures to be followed if an
individual cannot be contacted. Figure 4-2 presents a sample call tree.

Personnel to be notified should be clearly identified in the contact lists appended to the plan. This list
should identify personnel by their team position, name, and contact information (e.g., home, work, cell
phone, email addresses, and home addresses). An entry may resemble the following format:
