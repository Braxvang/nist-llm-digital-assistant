A prescriptive de-identifcation rule – even one that accounts for varying population densi-
ties – may still be insuffcient for de-identifcation if the rule fails to consider the interac-
tion between geographic locations and other quasi-identifers in the dataset. Randomized
transformations should be made with caution to avoid the creation of inconsistencies in
underlying data (e.g., moving the location of a residence along a coast into a body of water
or across geopolitical boundaries).
Single locations may become identifying if they represent locations linked to a single in-
dividual that are recorded over time (e.g., a work/home commuting pair). Such behavioral
time-location patterns can be quite distinct and allow for re-identifcation even with a small
number of recorded locations per individual [107, 106]. In 2021, one study concluded that
“[t]he risk of re-identifcation remains high even in country-scale location datasets” [60].
Data of higher resolution are typically more identifying. For example, in July 2021,
the Catholic publication The Pillar published a report in which it had purchased the de-
identifed geolocation information for users of a homosexual dating platform. With these
data, the journalists identifed a prominent Catholic offcial as a user of the platform by sim-
ply matching the geolocation data to the offcial’s residence. The offcial promptly resigned
[130].

4.3.6.   De-Identifying Genomic Information
Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is the molecule inside human cells that carries the genetic
instructions used for the proper functioning of living organisms. DNA present in the cell
nucleus is inherited from both parents, while DNA present in the mitochondria is only
inherited from an organism’s mother. DNA is a repeating polymer that is made from four
chemical bases: adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T). Human DNA
consists of roughly 3 billion bases, of which 99 % are the same in all people [69].
Modern technology allows for the complete specifc sequence of an individual’s DNA to
be determined within a certain accepted error threshold, and full-genome sequencing is
increasingly common as costs have dropped signifcantly below $1000 per genome in the
United States. Even less expensive is the use of a DNA microarray to probe for the presence
or absence of specifc DNA sequences at predetermined points in the genome. This ap-
proach is typically used to determine the presence or absence of specifc single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) [68]. DNA sequences and SNPs are the same for monozygotic
(identical) twins, individuals resulting from divided embryos, and clones. With these ex-
ceptions, it is believed that no two humans have the same complete DNA sequence. Indi-
vidual SNPs may be shared by many individuals, but a suffciently large number of SNPs
that show suffcient variability is generally believed to produce a combination that is unique
to an individual.
Thus, there are some sections of the DNA sequence and some combinations of SNPs that
have high variability within the human population and others that have signifcant con-
