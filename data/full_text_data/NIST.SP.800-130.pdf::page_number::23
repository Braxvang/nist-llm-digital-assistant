SP 800-130                                                               August 2013



have a good understanding of the application(s) that are to be supported, since they will
likely affect the design choices.

The CKMS designer should also study the potential users of the system. How many users
will use the CKMS and for what purposes? Are the users mobile or stationary? Do the
users need to be knowledgeable about the CKMS, or will it be transparent to them? Are
users operating under stressful conditions, where time is of the essence in performing
their jobs? Some CKMS have failed because the designer assumed that the user
understood the purpose and importance of cryptographic keys and public key certificates.
If users are hampered from doing their work by a CKMS, then the CKMS will likely not
be a successful security solution because it will not be used.

The goal of the CKMS designer is to specify a set of security mechanisms that function
well together, provide a desired level of security that meets the needs of the application(s)
and using organization(s), are affordable, and have a minimum negative impact on
operations. These, as well as other CKMS goals, should be considered before a CKMS is
designed, implemented, and operated.

FR: 3.1 The CKMS design shall specify its goals with respect to the communications
networks on which it will function.

FR:3.2 The CKMS design shall specify the intended applications that it will support.

FR:3.3 The CKMS design shall list the intended number of users and the responsibilities
that the CKMS places on those users.

3.2 Maximize the Use of COTS in a CKMS
Customers generally prefer Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) products. Such products
are often less costly to acquire, operate, and maintain than custom products designed and
built for a single customer. However, COTS products designed and built to satisfy the
“least common denominator” requirements of a large number of customers may not
completely satisfy any of the customers. If the CKMS designer uses products that meet a
range of requirements in a specific market sector, the CKMS will be more likely to be
accepted in that market.

Using standard interfaces generally improves the extensibility of the product. Extensions
and improvements should be allowed and supported by the COTS design of a CKMS so
that the CKMS can be configured to meet varying functional and workload demands,
including those based on the number of users, transactions, keys, and application data.

FR:3.4 The CKMS design shall specify the COTS products used in the CKMS.

FR:3.5 The CKMS design shall specify which security functions are performed by
COTS products.
