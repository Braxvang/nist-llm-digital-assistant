5.       Test Assertions

Test assertions are statements of behavior, action, or condition that can be measured or
tested. They provide the procedures to guide the tester in executing and managing the test.
They include the purpose of the test, starting conditions and prerequisites, success criteria,
and post-test conditions, when applicable. A list of test assertions can be seen in Appendices
B and C.
The following three sets of test assertions are included in this document:
     +    PIV client API test assertions (see Section 3.1 for overview).
     +    PIV card command interface test assertions (per Section 3.2.1).
     +    PIV data objects accessibility and storage test assertions (per Section 3.2.2).
An overview of each of the above classes of test assertions is given in Sections 5.2 through
5.4.
5.1 Mapping from Test Categories to Test Assertions

All the DTRs in Appendix A conceptually come under one of the two broad categories of
tests stated in Section 3, i.e., PIV Middleware tests and PIV Card Application tests.
Similarly, each test assertion makes specific references to the related sections in SP 800-73-4
or the related DTRs. However, overall there is a many-to-many mapping from the test suite
elements (individual tests) under each of these two broad categories of tests to the DTRs (i.e.,
one test can map to many DTRs and one DTR can map to many tests). A similar type of
relationship exists between DTRs and test assertions. To narrow the search space for cross
references, Table 5-1 presents a cross-referencing guide showing the relevant DTR sections
(with the section in SP 800-73-4 from which they were derived) and test assertion sections
with respect to test classes in the two broad categories of tests.
