Q. What is IT contingency planning?
A. IT contingency planning is one modular piece of a larger contingency and
   continuity-planning program that encompasses IT, business processes, risk
   management, financial management, crisis communications, safety and security
   of personnel and property, and continuity of government. Each piece is operative
   in its own right, but together can create a coordinated synergy that efficiently
   and effectively protects the entire organization.

Q. In what time frame must systems and data be recovered and restored
   when a disruption occurs?
A. When a disruption occurs, a recovery strategy must be implemented within the
   recovery time objective (RTO) period.

Q. What is the contingency planning policy statement?
A. The contingency planning policy statement is the first step in developing an IT
   contingency plan. This policy may exist at the department, agency, and/or
   program level of the organization. The statement should define the organizations
   overall contingency objectives; identify leadership, roles and responsibilities,
   resource requirements, test, training, and exercise schedules; and plan
   maintenance schedules and the minimum required backup frequency.

Q. What is a business impact analysis (BIA)?
A. The BIA is a critical step to understanding the information systems components,
   interdependencies, and potential downtime impacts. The contingency plan
   strategy and procedures should be designed specifically around the results of the
   BIA. A BIA is conducted by identifying the system’s critical resources. Each
   critical resource is then further examined to determine how long functionality of
   the resource could be withheld from the information system before an
   unacceptable impact is experienced.

Q. What is Maximum Allowable Outage (MAO)?
A. Based on the potential impacts, the amount of time the information system can
   be without the critical resource then provides a recourse recovery priority around
   which to plan.

Q. What is the Recovery Time Objective?
A. The balancing point between the MAO and the cost to recover establishes the
   information system’s RTO. Recovery strategies must be created to meet the
