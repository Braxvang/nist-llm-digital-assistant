INTRODUCTION
It is often said that cybersecurity is about people, process, and technology. That’s a
convenient way to think about cybersecurity challenges, and it is the primary approach
that the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) takes in carrying out its
cybersecurity mission. This report highlights NIST’s Fiscal Year (FY) 2018 cybersecurity-
related accomplishments and includes many examples of how the NIST Information
Technology Laboratory (ITL) delivers value to the nation by focusing on each element
of the people, process, and technology triad. Importantly, NIST strives to address those
three areas in an integrated fashion, knowing that siloed thinking about cybersecurity is
not a viable path to success.
NIST carries out its cybersecurity responsibilities through an open, transparent, and
inclusive approach, teaming with organizations in the private sector, non-profit sphere,
academia, and government at multiple levels. It does so by cooperating with partners in
the United States and abroad who contribute to the research, development, standards,
and applications that are all needed to advance both the state-of-the-art and the state-
of-practice when it comes to cybersecurity. NIST is also assisted in identifying emerging
managerial, technical, administrative, and physical safeguard issues by the Information
Security and Privacy Advisory Board (ISPAB).3 ISPAB is the Federal Advisory Committee4
that advises NIST, the Secretaries of Commerce and Homeland Security, and the Office of
Management and Budget on security and privacy matters.
All of NIST’s cybersecurity work is conducted in an environment that demands
technical excellence and integrity and that aims to cultivate trust in technologies and
institutions. NIST’s portfolio of cybersecurity programs works along the full spectrum
of cybersecurity challenges and potential, from foundational research to applied
engineering and transition to practice.
NIST knows that improving all aspects of cybersecurity is an imperative, not just for the
agency but for all of society that relies on technologies, products, and systems. NIST’s
FY18 premier cybersecurity accomplishments and brief insights into FY19 priorities are
captured in the cybersecurity imperatives that follow.
