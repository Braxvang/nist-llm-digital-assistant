4.3     Security Capabilities

Network-based IDPS products provide a wide variety of security capabilities. Sections 4.3.1 through
4.3.4 describe common security capabilities, divided into four categories: information gathering, logging,
detection, and prevention, respectively. Some network-based IDPS products also provide some security
information and event management (SIEM) capabilities; see Section 8.2.2 for information on SIEM.

4.3.1    Information Gathering Capabilities
