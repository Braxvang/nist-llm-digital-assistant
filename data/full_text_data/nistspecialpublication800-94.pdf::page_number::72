GUIDE TO INTRUSION DETECTION AND PREVENTION SYSTEMS (IDPS)



typically intended for network perimeter use, so they would be deployed in close proximity to the
perimeter firewalls, often in front to limit incoming attacks that could overwhelm the firewalls.

NBA products provide a variety of security capabilities. They offer extensive information gathering
capabilities, collecting detailed information on each observed host and constantly monitoring network
activity for changes to this information. NBA technologies typically perform extensive logging of data
related to detected events. They also typically have the capability to detect several types of malicious
activity, including DoS attacks, scanning, worms, unexpected application services, and policy violations,
such as a client system providing network services to other systems. Because NBA sensors work
primarily by detecting significant deviations from normal behavior, they are most accurate at detecting
attacks that generate large amounts of network activity in a short period of time and attacks that have
unusual flow patterns. Most NBA sensors can also reconstruct a series of observed events to determine
the origin of a threat.

NBA products automatically update their baselines on an ongoing basis. As a result, typically there is not
much tuning or customization to be done, other than updating firewall ruleset-like policies that most
products support. A few NBA products offer limited signature customization capabilities; these are most
helpful for inline sensors because they can use the signatures to find and block attacks that a firewall or
router might not be capable of blocking. Besides reviewing tuning and customizations periodically to
ensure that they are still accurate, administrators should also ensure that significant changes to hosts are
incorporated, such as new hosts and new services. Generally it is not feasible to automatically link NBA
systems with change management systems, but administrators could review change management records
regularly and adjust host inventory information in the NBA to prevent false positives.

NBA technologies have some significant limitations. They are delayed in detecting attacks because of
their data sources, especially when they rely on flow data from routers and other network devices. This
data is often transferred to the NBA in batches from every minute to a few times an hour. Attacks that
occur quickly may not be detected until they have already disrupted or damaged systems. This delay can
be avoided by using sensors that do their own packet captures and analysis; however, this is much more
resource-intensive than analyzing flow data. Also, a single sensor can analyze flow data from many
networks, while a single sensor can generally directly monitor only a few networks at once. Therefore, to
do direct monitoring instead of using flow data, organizations might have to purchase more powerful
sensors and/or more sensors.
