       NIST SP 800-171Ar3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                         Assessing CUI Security Requirements
       November 2023

1567           ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE
1568           Determine if:
1569           A.03.05.07.ODP[01]: password composition and complexity rules are defined.
1570           A.03.05.07.a[01]: a list of commonly used, expected, or compromised passwords is maintained.
1571           A.03.05.07.a[02]: a list of commonly used, expected, or compromised passwords is updated
1572           periodically.
1573           A.03.05.07.a[03]: a list of commonly used, expected, or compromised passwords is updated
1574           when organizational passwords are suspected to have been compromised.
1575           A.03.05.07.b: passwords are verified not to be found on the list of commonly used, expected, or
1576           compromised passwords when they are created or updated by users.
1577           A.03.05.07.c: passwords are only transmitted over cryptographically protected channels.
1578           A.03.05.07.d: passwords are stored in a cryptographically protected form.
1579           A.03.05.07.e: a new password is selected upon first use after account recovery.
1580           A.03.05.07.f: the following composition and complexity rules are enforced: <A.03.05.07.ODP[01]:
1581           rules>.
