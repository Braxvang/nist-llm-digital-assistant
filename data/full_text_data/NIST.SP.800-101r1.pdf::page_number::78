                                                        Guidelines on Mobile Device Forensics

Electromagnetic Interference – An electromagnetic disturbance that interrupts, obstructs, or
otherwise degrades or limits the effective performance of electronics/electrical equipment.

Electronic Serial Number (ESN) – A unique 32-bit number programmed into CDMA
phones when they are manufactured.

Encryption – Any procedure used in cryptography to convert plain text into cipher text to
prevent anyone but the intended recipient from reading that data.

Enhanced Data for GSM Evolution (EDGE) – An upgrade to GPRS to provide higher data
rates by joining multiple time slots.

Enhanced Messaging Service (EMS) – An improved message system for GSM mobile
devices allowing picture, sound, animation and text elements to be conveyed through one or
more concatenated SMS messages.

Examination – A technical review that makes the evidence visible and suitable for analysis; as
well as tests performed on the evidence to determine the presence or absence of specific data.

Exculpatory Evidence – Evidence that tends to decrease the likelihood of fault or guilt.

Feature Phone – A mobile device that primarily provide users with simple voice and text
messaging services.

File Signature Anomaly – A mismatch between the internal file header and its external file
name extension; a file name inconsistent with the content of the file (e.g., renaming a graphics
file with a non-graphics extension).

File System – A software mechanism that defines the way that files are named, stored,
organized, and accessed on logical volumes of partitioned memory.

Flash ROM – Non-volatile memory that is writable.

Forbidden PLMNs – A list of Public Land Mobile Networks (PLMNs) maintained on the
SIM that the mobile phone cannot automatically contact, usually because service was declined
by a foreign provider.

Forensic Copy – A bit-for-bit reproduction of the information contained on an electronic
device or associated media, whose validity and integrity has been verified using an accepted
algorithm.

Forensic Specialist – Locates, identifies, collects, analyzes, and examines data, while
preserving the integrity and maintaining a strict chain of custody of information discovered.

General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) – A packet switching enhancement to GSM and
TDMA wireless networks to increase data transmission speeds.

Global Positioning System (GPS) – A system for determining position by comparing radio
signals from several satellites.
