 993   The authorization decision letter (see Appendix F for examples) informs the EIMO that the
 994   issuer is (i) authorized to operate, (ii) authorized to operate on an interim basis, or (iii) not
 995   authorized to operate. The supporting rationale includes the justification for the DAO’s decision.
 996   The terms and conditions for the authorization provide a description of any limitations or
 997   restrictions placed on the operation of the issuer, including which issuing facilities are included
 998   in the decision. The authorization decision letter SHALL be attached to the authorization
 999   submission package, which becomes the authorization decision package.
1000   The DAO sends the authorization decision package to the EIMO and retains a copy of it. The
1001   EIMO carefully reviews the terms and conditions of authorization before initiating the necessary
1002   steps for issuer operations. Both parties mark the authorization decision package appropriately
1003   for storage under the organization’s record retention policy.
