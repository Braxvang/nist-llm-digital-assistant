interoperability testing on implementations of NIST-approved cryptographic algorithms
using implementations developed by NIST as assured-baseline implementations.

FR:9.3 If a CKMS claims interoperability with another system, then the CKMS design
shall specify the tests that have been performed and passed that verify the claim.

FR:9.4 If a CKMS claims interoperability with another system, then the CKMS design
shall specify any configuration settings that are required for interoperability.

9.4 Self-Testing
A device may be designed, implemented, and operated correctly when first deployed, but
fail some time later. When a failure is detected in a device, the device can be repaired or
replaced, but undetected failures can have major security implications. A CKMS should
use devices that test themselves for integrity and security failures. For example, [FIPS
140] specifies several self-tests to help verify the correct operation of a cryptographic
module, including all its security functions.

FR:9.5 The CKMS design shall specify all self-tests created and implemented by the
designer and the corresponding CKMS functions whose correct operation they verify.

9.5 Scalability Testing
Scalability is the ability of a system, network, or process, to correctly process increasing
amounts of work in a graceful manner, or its ability to be enlarged to accommodate that
increase. Scalability testing involves testing a device or system to learn how it reacts
when the number of transactions to be processed or participants to be handled over a
given period of time increases dramatically. Every device has its limitations, but some
device designs scale better than others. If systems are not designed for modular
scalability, adding additional devices may not be feasible. In addition, subtle problems
often arise that cannot be solved by simply buying more equipment. Scalability testing is
used to stress devices and systems so that these problems are known and mitigated before
they become fully operational.

FR:9.6 The CKMS design shall specify all scalability analysis and testing performed on
the system to date.

9.6 Functional Testing and Security Testing
The types of tests previously described can be performed to meet particular test goals.
Functional testing attempts to verify that an implementation of some function operates
correctly. A functional test might determine that a cryptographic algorithm
implementation correctly computes the ciphertext from the plaintext, given the key.
Security testing attempts to verify that an implementation functions securely. A security
test might determine that, while a cryptographic algorithm implementation functions
correctly (i.e. it produces the correct results), fluctuations in power consumption during
the cryptographic process could lead to the compromise of the key. Thus, a cryptographic
algorithm implementation could pass functional testing, but fail security testing.
