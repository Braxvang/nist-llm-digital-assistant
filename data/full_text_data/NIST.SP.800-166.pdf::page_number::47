                                                                        DATA MODEL TEST GUIDELINES

8.    Test Assertions for the Derived PIV Application

This section lists the test assertions used to determine conformity to the derived test requirements
(DTR) listed in Section 6. The Implementation Under Test (IUT), in this case a Derived PIV
Application submitted by a vendor, must meet the stated objective(s) of the assertion by way of a
test or submission of documents/artifacts in order to be deemed conformant to the associated
DTR(s).

8.1   Transport Layer Conformance

8.1.1 UICC

8.1.1.1 GlobalPlatform Support for UICC Tokens

 Test Assertion          TA-08.01.01.01
 Purpose                 Confirms that for Universal Integrated Circuit Card (UICC)
                         implementations used to host a Derived PIV Application, the UICC
                         implements the GlobalPlatform Card Secure Element Configuration
                         v1.0 [GPSE].
 DTR(s)                  • DTR-06.01.01.01
 Vendor                  The vendor to provide evidence in its documentation that the UICC that
 Documentation           hosts the Derived PIV Application implements the GlobalPlatform Card
                         Secure Element Configuration v1.0 [GPSE].

8.1.2 USB

8.1.2.1 ICCD Specification Support for USB Tokens

 Test Assertion          TA-08.01.02.01
 Purpose                 Confirms that for USB Integrated Circuit(s) Card Devices (ICCD)
                         implementations used to host a Derived PIV Application, the ICCD uses
                         the Bulk-in/Bulk-Out command pipe for APDU transport and
                         implements the Universal Serial Bus Device Class - Smart Card ICCD
                         Specification for USB Integrated Circuit(s) Card Devices [ICCDSPEC].
 DTR(s)                  • DTR-06.01.02.01
                         • DTR-06.01.02.03
 Vendor                  The vendor to provide evidence in its documentation that the ICCD that
 Documentation           hosts the Derived PIV Application implements the Universal Serial Bus
                         Device Class - Smart Card ICCD Specification for USB Integrated
                         Circuit(s) Card Devices [ICCDSPEC]. The vendor confirms that the
                         APDUs are received from the secure element using the Bulk-In
                         command pipe.
