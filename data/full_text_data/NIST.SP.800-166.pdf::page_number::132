                              then the hashAlgorithm field in signature->parameters is
                              populated with SHA-256 (OID = 2.16.840.1.101.3.4.2.1). For
                              RSA with PKCS #1 v1.5 padding, the parameters field is
                              populated with NULL. For ECDSA, the parameters field is
                              absent.

9.3.4.2 Subject Public Key Algorithm

 Test Assertion           TA-09.03.04.02
 Purpose                  Verifies that the public key algorithm used for generating the keys
                          is one of the following OIDs: 1.2.840.113549.1.1.1 (RSA
                          Encryption) or 1.2.840.10045.2.1 (elliptic curve key).
 DTR(s)                   • DTR-07.03.04.03
                          • DTR-07.03.04.04
 Issuer Documentation     None.

 Precondition(s)          •   A token with the Derived PIV Application is inserted into an
                              appropriate token reader.
                          •   Suitable drivers have been loaded between the test system and
                              an instance of the reader.
                          •   A Security Object is present within the Derived PIV
                              Application.
 Test Scenario            1. Send the SELECT command with
                                • AID == 'A0 00 00 03 08 00 00 20 00 01 00'
                          2. Send the GET DATA command with
                                • Data field of the command containing the tag
                                   ('5FC106') of the Security Object
                          3. Extract and parse the certificates field contents
                             from the Security Object.
                          4. Extract subjectPublicKeyInfo->algorithm->algorithm
                             field value from the extracted certificate.
                          5. Match the algorithm value to the Table 3-4 of
                             [SP800-78].
                          6. If the algorithm is elliptic curve, ensure that an
                             OID from Table 3-5 of [SP800-78] is populated in
                             the subjectPublicKeyInfo->algorithm->parameters-
                             >namedCurve field.

                          Note: If the RSA algorithm is used, the
                          subjectPublicKeyInfo->algorithm->parameters field will
                          be NULL.
 Expected Result(s)       1. From Step 1, the command returns the application property
                             template with the status word '90 00'.
                          2. From Step 2, the command returns the requested data object
                             along with the status word '90 00'.
                          3. From Step 5, the Derived PIV Credential Issuer’s (content
                             signing) key pair is generated using an allowed asymmetric key
                             algorithm.
