                                                                   INTERFACE TEST GUIDELINES

                         NOTE: If multiple key references are being tested the
                         security status of the card will need to be reset before a
                         subsequent key reference can be tested
                      19. Send GET DATA command with
                          • Data field of the command containing the tag of the
                            Cardholder Fingerprints data object
                      20. If Printed Information data object is supported, send GET
                          DATA command with
                          • Data field of the command containing the tag of the
                            Printed Information data object
                      21. Send GET DATA command with
                          • Data field of the command containing the tag of the
                            Cardholder Facial Image data object
                      22. If Cardholder Iris Images data object is supported, send
                          GET DATA command with
                          • Data field of the command containing the tag of the
                            Cardholder Iris Images data object
                      23. If the virtual contact interface is supported, send GET
                          DATA command with
                          • Data field of the command containing the tag of the
                            Pairing Code Reference Data Container data object
                      24. Send GET DATA command with
                          • Data field of the command containing a tag that does
                            not identify any of the data objects resident on the
                            card
 Expected Result(s)   1. The command returns the application property template with the
                         status word '90 00' at the end.
                      2. For steps 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 13, 14A, 14B, 15, and 16 the command
                         returns the requested data object along with the status word '90
                         00' at the end.
                      3. For steps 5, 7, and 12 the command returns '69 82' (security status
                         not satisfied), due to lack of PIN entry.
                      4. For steps 11 and 17 the command returns '69 82' (security status
                         not satisfied), due to lack of PIN entry or successful OCC.
                      5. In step 18, the command returns the status word '90 00'
                      6. For steps 19, 21, and 22 the command returns:
                             • The requested data object along with the status word '90
                                 00' at the end, if step 18 was performed using key
                                 reference '00' or '80'
                             • Status word '69 82' (security status not satisfied), if step 18
                                 was performed using key reference '96' or '97'.
                      7. For steps 20 and 23 the command returns the requested data
                         object along with the status word '90 00' at the end.
                      8. In step 24, the command returns '6A 82' (data object not found).
