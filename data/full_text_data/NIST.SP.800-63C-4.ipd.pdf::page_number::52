       NIST SP 800-63C-4 ipd                                              Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022                                                      Federation and Assertions


1368   authenticator to the subscriber directly for use with an FAL3 login. The administrator of
1369   the RP SHALL store a unique identifier for the bound authenticator in the RP subscriber
1370   account. The administrator of the RP SHALL determine through independent means that
1371   the party to which the authenticator is issued is the identified subject of the RP subscriber
1372   account.
1373   For subscriber-provided authenticators, if no bound authenticators are associated with
1374   the RP subscriber account, the RP SHALL perform a binding ceremony to establish the
1375   connection between the authenticator, the subscriber, and the RP subscriber account as
1376   shown in Fig. 11. The RP SHALL first establish an authenticated session using federation
1377   with an assertion that meets all the other requirements of FAL3, including an indication
1378   that the assertion is intended for use at FAL3 with an RP-managed bound authenticator.
1379   The subscriber SHALL immediately be prompted to present and authenticate with the
1380   proposed authenticator. Upon successful presentation of the authenticator, the RP SHALL
1381   store a unique identifier for the authenticator (such as its public key) and associate this
1382   with the RP subscriber account associated with the federated identifier. If the subscriber
1383   fails to successfully present an appropriate authenticator, the binding ceremony fails. The
1384   binding ceremony session SHALL have a timeout of five minutes or less. The session
1385   used during the ceremony is not an authenticated session for the purposes of logging
1386   in. Upon successful completion of the binding ceremony, the RP SHALL immediately
1387   request a new assertion from the IdP at FAL3, including prompting the subscriber for the
1388   newly-bound authenticator.
1389   An RP MAY allow a subscriber to bind multiple subscriber-provided authenticators at
1390   FAL3. If this is the case, and the RP subscriber account has one or more existing bound
1391   authenticators, the binding ceremony makes use of the existing ability to reach FAL3.
1392   The subscriber SHALL first be prompted to present an existing bound authenticator to
1393   reach FAL3. Upon successful authentication, the RP SHALL immediately prompt the
1394   subscriber for the newly-bound authenticator.
1395   An RP MAY allow a subscriber to unbind a bound subscriber-provided authenticator
1396   from their RP subscriber account, thereby removing the ability to use that authenticator
1397   for FAL3. When a bound authenticator is unbound, the RP SHALL terminate all
1398   current FAL3 sessions for the subscriber and SHALL require reauthentication of the
1399   subscriber from the IdP. Note that in many cases, a subscriber will need to unbind a bound
1400   authenticator to account for a lost or compromised authenticator, and the subscriber will
1401   therefore not have access to the authenticator during the unbinding process.
