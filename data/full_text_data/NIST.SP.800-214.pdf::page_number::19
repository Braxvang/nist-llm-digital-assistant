NIST has maintained a long-standing commitment to advancing innovation and supporting
cybersecurity and privacy research in emerging technologies and priorities, such as AI, the
Internet of Things (IoT), and cloud-native applications based on microservices architecture.
NIST's dedicated technical staff, one-of-a-kind facilities, and trusted, objective, non-regulatory
role position it well to help the Nation and its partners advance in these promising areas.
Cybersecurity for the Internet of Things (IoT)
NIST’s Cybersecurity for IoT program supports the development and application of
standards, guidelines, and related tools to improve the cybersecurity of connected
devices and the environments in which they are deployed. By collaborating with stakeholders
across government, industry, international bodies, and academia, the program aims to
cultivate trust and foster an environment that enables innovation on a global scale.
Accomplishments in FY 2020 included development of the following publications:
• NISTIR 8259, Foundational Cybersecurity Activities for IoT Device Manufacturers,
  recommends six foundational cybersecurity activities that manufacturers can perform to
  produce more secure devices during the pre-market and post-market product phases. These
  activities also provide the technical means for customers to secure their own devices, thereby
  lessening the prevalence and severity of IoT device compromises.
• NISTIR 8259A, IoT Device Cybersecurity Capability Core Baseline, identifies a core baseline
  of technical cybersecurity capabilities for manufacturers to support the protection of an
  organization’s devices, data, systems, and ecosystems across a broad set of use cases.
• NIST posted an online catalog of device cybersecurity capabilities and supporting non-
  technical manufacturer capabilities that are needed for applying NIST SP 800-53 controls in
  the federal environment. The catalog takes advantage of GitHub’s “issues” feature to provide
  a highly accessible means for the community to provide feedback.
