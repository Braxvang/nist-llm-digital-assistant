In contrast, wireless readers support applications in which personnel must move around to read tags. 14
Figure 2-5 shows an example of a mobile handheld reader. A mobile reader usually uses different
communications protocols on its RF and enterprise subsystem interfaces, even though both interfaces are
wireless. Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.11, also known as Wi-Fi, is a
common protocol for the enterprise subsystem interface, although it is also used for the RF interface on
some active tag implementations. The most common RF interface protocols are defined in ISO/IEC
standards, which include ISO/IEC 14443, ISO/IEC 15693, and the ISO/IEC 18000-series.

     Wireless protocols are also used on the enterprise subsystem interface when an organization decides not to extend the wired
     infrastructure to the reader.
