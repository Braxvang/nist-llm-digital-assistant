1858   10.   Usability Considerations
1859   This section is informative.
1860   Ergonomic of Human-System Interaction — Part 11: Usability: Definitions and Concepts
1861   [ISO/IEC9241-11] defines usability as the “extent to which a system, product or service
1862   can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency
1863   and satisfaction in a specified context of use.” This definition focuses on users, goals,
1864   and context of use as key elements necessary for achieving effectiveness, efficiency and
1865   satisfaction. A holistic approach considering these key elements is necessary to achieve
1866   usability.
1867   From the usability perspective, one of the major potential benefits of federated identity
1868   systems is to address the problem of user fatigue associated with managing multiple
1869   authenticators. While this has historically been a problem with usernames and passwords,
1870   the increasing need for users to manage many authenticators — whether physical or
1871   digital — presents a usability challenge.
1872   While many other approaches to authentication have been researched extensively and
1873   have well-established usability guidelines, federated identity is more nascent and,
1874   therefore, lacks the depth and conclusiveness of research findings. As ongoing usability
1875   research matures, usability guidelines for federated identity systems will have stronger
1876   supporting data. For example, additional data is needed to support guidance on the
1877   translation of technical attribute names and values into user-friendly language.
1878   As stated in the usability sections in 800-63A and 800-63B, overall user experience is
1879   critical to the success of any authentication method. This is especially true for federated
1880   identity systems as federation is a less familiar user interaction paradigm for many users.
1881   Users’ prior authentication experiences may influence their expectations.
1882   The overall user experience with federated identity systems should be as smooth and easy
1883   as possible. This can be accomplished by following usability standards (such as the ISO
1884   25060 series of standards) and established best practices for user interaction design.
1885         Note: In this section, the term “users” means “claimants” or “subscribers.”
1886         The terms “entity” and “entities” refer to the parties of federated systems.
1887   Guidelines and considerations are described from the users’ perspective.
1888   Accessibility differs from usability and is out of scope for this volume. [Section508] was
1889   enacted to eliminate barriers in information technology and requires federal agencies to
1890   make their electronic and information technology public content accessible to people with
1891   disabilities. Refer to Section 508 law and standards for accessibility guidance.
