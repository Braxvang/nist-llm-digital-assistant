                                                              COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE



   structures, such as the IT help desk, for an initial POC. The organization should recognize that
   external parties, such as other incident response teams, would report some incidents. Federal
   agencies are required under the law to report all incidents to the United States Computer
   Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT). All organizations are encouraged to report incidents to
   their appropriate Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs). If an organization does
   not have its own CSIRT to contact, it can report incidents to other organizations, including
   Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs).
7. How are incidents reported?
   Most organizations have multiple methods for reporting an incident. Different reporting methods
   may be preferable as a result of variations in the skills of the person reporting the activity, the
   urgency of the incident, and the sensitivity of the incident. A phone number should be established
   to report emergencies. An email address may be provided for informal incident reporting,
   whereas a web-based form may be useful in formal incident reporting. Sensitive information can
   be provided to the team by using a public key published by the team to encrypt the material.
8. What information should be provided when reporting an incident?
   The more precise the information is, the better. For example, if a workstation appears to have
   been infected by malware, the incident report should include as much of the following data as
   practical:
    The user’s name, user ID, and contact information (e.g., phone number, email address)
    The workstation’s location, model number, serial number, hostname, and IP address
    The date and time that the incident occurred
    A step-by-step explanation of what happened, including what was done to the workstation
     after the infection was discovered. This explanation should be detailed, including the exact
     wording of messages, such as those displayed by the malware or by antivirus software alerts.
9. How quickly does the incident response team respond to an incident report?
   The response time depends on several factors, such as the type of incident, the criticality of the
   resources and data that are affected, the severity of the incident, existing Service Level
   Agreements (SLA) for affected resources, the time and day of the week, and other incidents that
   the team is handling. Generally, the highest priority is handling incidents that are likely to cause
   the most damage to the organization or to other organizations.
10. When should a person involved with an incident contact law enforcement?
   Communications with law enforcement agencies should be initiated by the incident response team
   members, the chief information officer (CIO), or other designated official—users, system
   administrators, system owners, and other involved parties should not initiate contact.
11. What should someone do who discovers that a system has been attacked?
   The person should immediately stop using the system and contact the incident response team. The
   person may need to assist in the initial handling of the incident—for instance, physically
   monitoring the system until incident handlers arrive to protect evidence on the system.
12. What should someone do who is contacted by the media regarding an incident?
   A person may answer the media’s questions in accordance with the organization’s policy
   regarding incidents and outside parties. If the person is not qualified to represent the organization
   in terms of discussing the incident, the person should make no comment regarding the incident,
