Special Publication 800-79-2                                            Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card Issuers
                                                                                         and Derived PIV Credential Issuers



During the authorization decision process, the DAO must evaluate the assessment findings for
the issuer and for each issuing facility within the authorization boundary. If the issuer has
outsourced some of its services or functions, the DAO must review all relevant assessments and
authorizations that have been granted to the external service provider and include them as a part
of the overall evaluation of risk to the organization.

An authorization decision by a DAO must always be granted for a specific PCI or DPCI before
commencement of operations, and for each issuer there can be only one authorization decision.
In issuing this decision, the DAO must indicate the authorization boundary to which the
authorization applies. A DAO grants an authorization to an issuer, and then specifies which
facilities (along with any exceptions or restrictions) are permitted to operate under that
authorization. This allows the issuer and any authorized issuing facilities to begin operations
while any remaining facilities focus on addressing deficiencies identified during the assessment.
At a later date, these facilities can be reassessed. After reviewing the new findings, the DAO can
reissue the authorization for the issuer and expand the authorization boundary to which the
authorization applies by including the newly assessed facilities.

The major input to the authorization decision is the assessment report. To ensure the assessment
report is properly interpreted and the justification for the authorization decision properly
communicated, the DAO should meet with the Assessor, the OIMO, and the Issuing Facility
Manager(s) prior to issuing an authorization decision to discuss the assessment findings and the
terms and conditions of the authorization.

There are three authorization alternatives that can be rendered by the DAO:

          Authorization to operate;
          Interim authorization to operate; or
          Denial of authorization to operate.


2.9.1 Authorization to Operate (ATO)
If, after reviewing the results of the assessment phase, the DAO deems that the operations of the
issuer and its facilities conform to control objectives of FIPS 201-2 to an acceptable degree, and
will continue to do so reliably during the authorization validity period, an authorization to
operate (ATO) may be issued.12 The issuer and its issuing facilities are authorized to perform
services in compliance with all relevant policies, in conformance to all relevant standards, and in
accordance with the documented operations plan. The DAO shall indicate exactly which issuing
facilities are included in the ATO authorization decision. An ATO can only be granted to an
issuer if there are no limitations or restrictions imposed on any of its issuing facilities that are
included in the authorization boundary. The ATO is transmitted to the OIMO.

After receiving an ATO that conforms to SP 800-79-2, re-authorization shall be performed
within three (3) years or when there is a significant change in personnel or operating procedures
(includes both improvement and degradation of operations) or when additional issuing facilities

     Note The PCI/DPCI ATO can be affected by the underlying system authorization status (see Section 2.9.4).
