                The Technical Specification for the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.1



accordance with risk management frameworks such as NIST Special Publication 800-535, Department of
Defense (DoD) Instruction 8500.2, and the Payment Card Industry (PCI) framework.

By detailing the specific and appropriate usage of the SCAP 1.1 components and their interoperability,
NIST encourages the creation of reliable and pervasive SCAP content and the development of a wide
array of products that leverage SCAP capabilities.

Organizations that develop SCAP 1.1-based content or products should implement the following
recommendations:

Follow the requirements listed in this document and in the associated component specifications.

Organizations should ensure that their implementation and use of SCAP 1.1 is compliant with the
requirements detailed in each component specification and the information presented in this document.

If requirements are in conflict between component specifications, this document will provide clarification.
If a component specification is in conflict with this document, the requirements in this document take
precedence.

When creating SCAP content, adhere to the conventions specified in this document.

Security products and checklist authors assemble content from SCAP data repositories to create viable
SCAP-expressed security guidance. A security configuration checklist that documents desired security
configuration settings, installed patches, and other system security elements using a standardized SCAP
format is known as an SCAP-expressed checklist. Such a checklist would use XCCDF to describe the
checklist, CCE to identify security configuration settings to be addressed or assessed, and CPE to identify
platforms for which the checklist is valid. The use of CCE and CPE entries within XCCDF checklists is
an example of an SCAP conventionâ€”a requirement for valid SCAP usage. These conventions are
considered part of the definition of SCAP 1.1. Organizations producing SCAP content should adhere to
these conventions to ensure the highest degree of interoperability. NIST provides an SCAP Content
Validation Tool that organizations can use to help validate the correctness of their SCAP content. The
tool checks that SCAP content is well-formed, all cross references are valid, and required values are
appropriately set.
