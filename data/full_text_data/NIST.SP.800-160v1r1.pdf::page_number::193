K.2.1. Security Purpose
-   Provide an acquirer with a product or service that meets agreed security requirements.

K.2.2. Security Outcomes
-   A response to the acquirer’s request addresses the acquirer’s security requirements.
-   An agreement established between the acquirer and supplier includes security requirements.
-   A product or service that satisfies the acquirer’s security requirements is provided.
-   Supplier security obligations defined in the agreement are satisfied.
-   Responsibility for the acquired product or service, as directed by the agreement, is securely
    transferred.

K.2.3. Security Activities and Tasks
SP-1     PREPARE FOR THE SUPPLY
         SP-1.1 Identify the security aspects of an acquirer’s need for a product or service.
         SP-1.2 Define the security aspects of the supply strategy.
         Note: This strategy describes or references the security aspects of the life cycle model, risks and
         issues mitigation, and a schedule of security-relevant milestones. It also includes key security-
         relevant drivers and characteristics of the acquisition, such as responsibilities and liabilities,
         specific security-relevant models, security-relevant methods or processes, level of criticality,
         formality, and priority of relevant trade-off factors.

SP-2     RESPOND TO A REQUEST FOR SUPPLY OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICES
         SP-2.1 Evaluate a request for a product or service to determine the security-relevant feasibility
         and how to respond.
         SP-2.2 Prepare a response that satisfies the security criteria in the solicitation.

SP-3     ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN AN AGREEMENT
         SP-3.1 Negotiate and approve an agreement with the acquirer that includes security
                acceptance criteria.
         Note 1: This includes configuration management, risk reporting, reporting of security measures,
         and security measure analysis; security requirements; secure development; security verification;
