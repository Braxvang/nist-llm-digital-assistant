allowed as long as the business publicly notifies users of any data it has collected, including PII
and other user information [37]. The collection of data without the user’s consent hinders
confidentiality and may be a privacy violation because the collected data may be used in an
unwanted manner without the user’s knowledge.
One common privacy violation is user location tracking. Location services are commonly used
by applications such as social media, navigation and weather apps, and web browsers. In terms
of organizational security and personal privacy, mobile devices with location services enabled
are at increased risk of targeted attacks because it is easier for potential attackers to determine
where the user and the mobile device are located and to correlate that information with other
sources about who the user associates with and the kinds of activities they perform in a particular
location. Although there can be positive cybersecurity impacts from accessing location services
(e.g., enabling location-based policies and device configurations), this should require user
consent and a thorough description of what type of personal information the enterprise can
access.

3.1.12. Data Loss via Synchronization
Mobile devices may interact with other systems to perform data exchange, synchronization, and
storage. This can include both local and remote device syncing. Local synchronization generally
involves connecting a mobile device to a desktop or laptop computer wirelessly or via a cable.
Remote system synchronization often involves automatic backups of data to a cloud-based
storage system. When all of these components are under the organization’s control, risk is
generally acceptable, but one or more of these components are often external to the enterprise.
Examples include connecting a personally owned mobile device to an organization-issued laptop,
connecting an organization-issued mobile device to a personally owned laptop, connecting an
organization-issued mobile device to a remote photo backup service, and connecting a mobile
device to an untrusted charging station. In all of these scenarios, the organization’s data is at risk
of being stored in an unsecured location outside of the organization’s control. In these scenarios,
the transmission of malware from one device to another is also a possibility.

3.1.13. Shadow IT Usage
Organizations that implement a fully managed mobile device policy should be cognizant of the
risks associated with shadow IT. The term “shadow IT” typically denotes staff members’ work-
related use of IT-related hardware, software, or cloud services without the knowledge of the IT
organization. The canonical example of shadow IT is a department that performs mission-critical
work using an independently purchased server running software that is not approved, managed,
or even known by the larger IT organization. IT staff may not learn of the existence of this
system until it fails or is breached, jeopardizing the critical mission.
Staff members often resort to the use of shadow IT systems when enterprise-provided systems
and processes are seen as cumbersome or impeding work or when the enterprise fails to provide
necessary systems. In the mobile systems environment, staff members may be motivated to use
