 6     Gateway Decomposition

         Media gateway control protocols address the requirements of IP telephony
         networks that are built using “decomposed” VOIP gateways. Decomposed VOIP
         gateways consist of Media Gateways (MGs) and Media Gateway Controllers
         (MGC), and appear to the outside as a single VOIP gateway. MGC handles the
         signaling data between the MGs and other network components such as H.323
         gatekeepers or SIP Servers, or towards SS7 Signaling Gateways. MGs focus on
         the audio signal translation function, performing conversion between the audio
         signals carried on telephone circuits and data packets carried over the Internet or
         other packet networks. A single MGC can control multiple MGs, which leads to
         cost reductions when deploying larger systems. Common examples are the Media
         Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) and Megaco/H.248, which are described
         within the next subsections.


 6.1     MGCP

 6.1.1    Overview

         MGCP is used to communicate between the separate components of a
         decomposed VOIP gateway. It is a complementary protocol to SIP and H.323.
         The MGCP protocol was derived from version 1.1 of the SGCP protocol, which
         was a fusion of the SGCP version 1 and IPDC. MGCP is currently being
         maintained by PacketCable (called NCS (Network Call Signaling Protocol)) and
         the Softswitch Consortium. In October 1999, MGCP was converted into an
         informational RFC 2705.

         There are plans for the MGCP specification to be enhanced by international
         standards bodies. One is the IP Cablecom activity proposing J.162 (Network Call
         Signaling) and J.171 (Trunking Gateway Control Protocol, a variant of J.162). A
         similar version of these proposals will also be provided within ETSI as
         EuroPacketCable specifications. At the present time, MGCP is the de-facto
         industry standard and has not yet been superseded by MEGACO/H.248.
