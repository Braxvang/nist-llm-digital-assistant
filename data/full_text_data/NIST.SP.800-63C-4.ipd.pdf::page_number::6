      NIST SP 800-63C-4 ipd                                              Digital Identity Guidelines
      December 2022                                                      Federation and Assertions


131   Taking into account feedback provided in response to our June 2020 Pre-Draft Call
132   for Comments, as well as research conducted into real-world implementations of the
133   guidelines, market innovation, and the current threat environment, this draft seeks to:
134      1. Advance Equity: This draft seeks to expand upon the risk management content
135         of previous revisions and specifically mandates that agencies account for impacts
136         to individuals and communities in addition to impacts to the organization. It also
137         elevates risks to mission delivery – including challenges to providing services to
138         all people who are eligible for and entitled to them – within the risk management
139         process and when implementing digital identity systems. Additionally, the guidance
140         now mandates continuous evaluation of potential impacts across demographics,
141         provides biometric performance requirements, and additional parameters for the
142         responsible use of biometric-based technologies, such as those that utilize face
143         recognition.
144      2. Emphasize Optionality and Choice for Consumers: In the interest of promoting
145         and investigating additional scalable, equitable, and convenient identify verification
146         options, including those that do and do not leverage face recognition technologies,
147         this draft expands the list of acceptable identity proofing alternatives to provide
148         new mechanisms to securely deliver services to individuals with differing means,
149         motivations, and backgrounds. The revision also emphasizes the need for digital
150         identity services to support multiple authenticator options to address diverse
151         consumer needs and secure account recovery.
152      3. Deter Fraud and Advanced Threats: This draft enhances fraud prevention
153         measures from the third revision by updating risk and threat models to account
154         for new attacks, providing new options for phishing resistant authentication, and
155         introducing requirements to prevent automated attacks against enrollment processes.
156         It also opens the door to new technology such as mobile driver’s licenses and
157         verifiable credentials.
158      4. Address Implementation Lessons Learned: This draft addresses areas where
159         implementation experience has indicated that additional clarity or detail was
160         required to effectively operationalize the guidelines. This includes re-working
161         the federation assurance levels, providing greater detail on Trusted Referees,
162         clarifying guidelines on identity attribute validation sources, and improving address
163         confirmation requirements.
164   NIST is specifically interested in comments on and recommendations for the following
165   topics:
166   Federation and Assertions
167       • What additional privacy considerations (e.g., revocation of consent, limitations of
168         use) may be required to account for the use of identity and provisioning APIs that
169         had not previously been discussed in the guidelines?
