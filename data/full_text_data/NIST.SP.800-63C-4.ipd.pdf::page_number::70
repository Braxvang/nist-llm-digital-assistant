       NIST SP 800-63C-4 ipd                                               Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022                                                       Federation and Assertions


1791   and revoke any RPs that were previously approved during a runtime decision. This list
1792   includes information on which attributes were approved. Similarly, if a subscriber’s
1793   runtime decisions at the RP are stored in some fashion, the RP also needs to allow the
1794   subscriber to view and revoke any IdPs that were approved during a runtime decision.

1795   9.3. Data Minimization
1796   Federation enables the data exposed to an RP to be minimized, which can yield privacy
1797   protections for subscribers. Although an IdP may collect additional attributes beyond
1798   what the RP requires for its use case, only those attributes that were explicitly requested
1799   by the RP are to be transmitted by the IdP. In some instances, an RP does not require a
1800   full value of an attribute. For example, an RP may need to know whether the subscriber
1801   is over 13 years old, but has no need for the full date of birth. To minimize collection of
1802   potentially sensitive PII, the RP may request a derived attribute value (e.g., Question: Is
1803   the subscriber over 13 years old? Response: Y/N or Pass/Fail). This minimizes the RP’s
1804   collection of potentially sensitive and unnecessary PII. Accordingly, Sec. 7.3 requires the
1805   RP to, where feasible, request derived attribute values rather than full attribute values. To
1806   support this RP requirement IdPs are, in turn, required to support a derived attribute value.

1807   9.4. Agency-Speciﬁc Privacy Compliance
1808   Section 5.5 identifies agency requirements to consult their SAOP to determine privacy
1809   compliance requirements. It is critical to involve the agency’s SAOP in the earliest stages
1810   of digital authentication system development to assess and mitigate privacy risks and
1811   advise the agency on compliance obligations such as whether the federation triggers the
1812   Privacy Act of 1974 or the E-Government Act of 2002 requirement to conduct a PIA. For
1813   example, if the agency is serving as an IdP in a federation, it is likely that the Privacy Act
1814   requirements will be triggered and require coverage by either a new or existing Privacy
1815   Act system of records since credentials would be maintained at the IdP on behalf of any
1816   RP it federates with. If, however, the agency is an RP and using a third-party IdP, digital
1817   authentication may not trigger the requirements of the Privacy Act, depending on what
1818   data passed from the RP is maintained by the agency at the RP (in such instances the
1819   agency may have a broader programmatic SORN that covers such data).
1820   The SAOP can similarly assist the agency in determining whether a PIA is required.
1821   These considerations should not be read as a requirement to develop a Privacy Act SORN
1822   or PIA for use of a federated credential alone. In many cases it will make the most sense
1823   to draft a PIA and SORN that encompasses the entire digital authentication process or
1824   includes the digital authentication process as part of a larger programmatic PIA that
1825   discusses the program or benefit the agency is establishing online access.
1826   Due to the many components of digital authentication, it is important for the SAOP to
1827   have an awareness and understanding of each individual component. For example, other
1828   privacy artifacts may be applicable to an agency offering or using federated IdP or RP
