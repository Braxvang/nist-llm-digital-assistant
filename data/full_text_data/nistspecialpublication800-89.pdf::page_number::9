SP 800-89                                                               November 2006




Key                 A parameter used in conjunction with a cryptographic algorithm
                    that determines its operation in such a way that an entity with
                    knowledge of the key can reproduce the operation, while an entity
                    without knowledge of the key cannot. Examples of the use of a key
                    that are applicable to this Recommendation include:
                      1. The computation of a digital signature from data, and
                      2. The verification of a digital signature.

Key pair            A public key and its corresponding private key.

Message             The data that is signed. Also known as “signed data” during the
                    signature verification and validation process.

Non-assurance       A signed message that does not contain all information required
message             for an assurance message.

Owner               A key pair owner is the entity that is authorized to use the private
                    key of a key pair.

Party               An individual (person), organization, device or process. Used
                    interchangeably with “entity”.

Private key         A cryptographic key that is used with an asymmetric (public key)
                    cryptographic algorithm. For digital signatures, the private key is
                    uniquely associated with the owner and is not made public. The
                    private key is used to compute a digital signature that may be
                    verified by the corresponding public key.

Private-key­        A message that is sent by a signatory that will be used to obtain
possession          assurance of possession. Also known as an assurance message.
assurance message

Public key          A cryptographic key that is used with an asymmetric (public key)
                    cryptographic algorithm and is associated with a private key. The
                    public key is associated with an owner and may be made public. In
                    the case of digital signatures, the public key is used to verify a
                    digital signature that was signed by the corresponding private key.

Relying party       A party that depends on the validity of the digital signature
                    process.

Shall               Used to indicate a requirement of this Recommendation.
