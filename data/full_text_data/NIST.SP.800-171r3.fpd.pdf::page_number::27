395             Restricting the execution of privileged commands and access to security-relevant information
396             via remote access reduces the exposure of the organization and its susceptibility to threats by
397             adversaries. A privileged command is a human-initiated command executed on a system that
398             involves the control, monitoring, or administration of the system, including security functions
399             and security-relevant information. Security-relevant information is information that can
400             potentially impact the operation of security functions or the provision of security services in a
401             manner that could result in failure to enforce the system security policy or maintain isolation of
402             code and data. Privileged commands give individuals the ability to execute sensitive, security-
403             critical, or security-relevant system functions. Controlling access from remote locations helps to
404             ensure that unauthorized individuals are unable to execute such commands with the potential to
405             do serious or catastrophic damage to the system.

417             REQUIREMENT: 03.01.16
418             a. Establish usage restrictions, configuration requirements, and connection requirements for
419                each type of wireless access to the system.
420             b. Authorize each type of wireless access to the system prior to establishing such
421                connections.
422             c.   Disable, when not intended for use, wireless networking capabilities prior to issuance and
423                  deployment.

424             DISCUSSION
425             Establishing usage restrictions, configuration requirements, and connection requirements for
426             wireless access to the system provides criteria to support access authorization decisions. These
427             restrictions and requirements reduce susceptibility to unauthorized system access through
428             wireless technologies. Wireless networks use authentication protocols that provide credential
429             protection and mutual authentication. Organizations authenticate individuals and devices to
430             protect wireless access to the system. Special attention is given to the variety of devices with
431             potential wireless access to the system, including small form factor mobile devices (e.g., smart
432             phones, smart watches). Wireless networking capabilities that are embedded within system
