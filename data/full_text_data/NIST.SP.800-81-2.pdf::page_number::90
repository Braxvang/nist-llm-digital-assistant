SECURE DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM (DNS) DEPLOYMENT GUIDE




9.10 Recommendations Summary

The following items provide a summary of the major recommendations from this section:

   •   Checklist item 15: Name servers that deploy DNSSEC signed zones or query signed zones
       should be configured to perform DNSSEC processing.

   •   Checklist item 16: The private keys corresponding to both the ZSK and the KSK should not be
       kept on the DNSSEC-aware primary authoritative name server when the name server does not
       support dynamic updates. If dynamic update is supported, the private key corresponding to the
       ZSK alone should be kept on the name server, with appropriate directory/file-level access control
       list-based or cryptography-based protections.

   •   Checklist item 17: Signature generation using the KSK should be done offline, using the KSK-
       private stored offline; then the DNSKEY RRSet, along with its RRSIG RR, can be loaded into the
       primary authoritative name server.
