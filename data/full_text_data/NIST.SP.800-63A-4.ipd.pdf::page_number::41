       NIST SP 800-63A-4 ipd                                                Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022                                                  Enrollment and Identity Proofing


1090   5.4. Identity Assurance Level 2
1091   Like IAL1, IAL2 identity proofing allows for both remote and in-person identity proofing
1092   processes in order to maximize accessibility while still mitigating against impersonation
1093   attacks and other identity proofing errors. Remote IAL2 identity proofing can be
1094   accomplished by the CSP via a fully automated process, a CSP operator attended process,
1095   or a combination of the two.

1096   5.4.1. Automated Attack Prevention
1097   The CSP SHALL implement a means to prevent automated attacks on the identity
1098   proofing process. Acceptable means include, but are not limited to: bot detection,
1099   mitigation, and management solutions; behavioral analytics; web application firewall
1100   settings; and traffic analysis.

1101   5.4.2. Evidence and Core Attribute Collection Requirements
1102   5.4.2.1. Evidence Collection
1103   For remote or in-person identity proofing, the CSP SHALL collect one of the following
1104   from the applicant:
1105      1. One piece of SUPERIOR evidence
1106      2. One piece of STRONG evidence and one piece of FAIR evidence

1107   5.4.2.2. Collection of Attributes
1108   Validated evidence is the preferred source of identity attributes. If the presented identity
1109   evidence does not provide all the attributes the CSP considers core attributes, it MAY
1110   collect attributes that are self-asserted by the applicant.

1111   5.4.3. Evidence and Core Attributes Validation Requirements
1112   The CSP SHALL validate the genuineness of each piece of SUPERIOR and STRONG
1113   evidence by one of the following:
1114      1. Visual inspection by trained personnel
1115      2. The use of technologies that can confirm the integrity of physical security features
1116         or detect if the evidence is fraudulent or has been inappropriately modified
1117      3. If present, confirming the integrity of digital security features
1118   The CSP SHALL validate all core attributes by:
1119      1. Validating the accuracy of attributes (such as account or reference number,
1120         name, and date of birth) obtained from pieces of evidence by comparison with
1121         authoritative or credible sources, and
