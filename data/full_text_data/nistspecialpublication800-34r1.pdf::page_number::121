Estimated Downtime

Working directly with mission/business process owners, departmental staff, managers, and other
stakeholders, estimate the downtime factors for consideration as a result of a disruptive event.

    •     Maximum Tolerable Downtime (MTD). The MTD represents the total amount of time
          leaders/managers are willing to accept for a mission/business process outage or disruption and
          includes all impact considerations. Determining MTD is important because it could leave
          continuity planners with imprecise direction on (1) selection of an appropriate recovery method,
          and (2) the depth of detail which will be required when developing recovery procedures,
          including their scope and content.

    •     Recovery Time Objective (RTO). RTO defines the maximum amount of time that a system
          resource can remain unavailable before there is an unacceptable impact on other system
          resources, supported mission/business processes, and the MTD. Determining the information
          system resource RTO is important for selecting appropriate technologies that are best suited for
          meeting the MTD.

    •     Recovery Point Objective (RPO). The RPO represents the point in time, prior to a disruption or
          system outage, to which mission/business process data must be recovered (given the most recent
          backup copy of the data) after an outage.

The table below identifies the MTD, RTO, and RPO (as applicable) for the organizational
mission/business processes that rely on {system name}. Values for MTDs and RPOs are expected to be
specific time frames, identified in hourly increments (i.e., 8 hours, 36 hours, 97 hours, etc.).

Include a description of the drivers for the MTD, RTO, and RPOs listed in the table above (e.g., mandate,
workload, performance measure, etc.).
