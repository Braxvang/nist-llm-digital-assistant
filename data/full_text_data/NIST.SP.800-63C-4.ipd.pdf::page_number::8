      NIST SP 800-63C-4 ipd                                              Digital Identity Guidelines
      December 2022                                                      Federation and Assertions


195   Call for Patent Claims

196   This public review includes a call for information on essential patent claims (claims
197   whose use would be required for compliance with the guidance or requirements in this
198   Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) draft publication). Such guidance and/or
199   requirements may be directly stated in this ITL Publication or by reference to another
200   publication. This call also includes disclosure, where known, of the existence of pending
201   U.S. or foreign patent applications relating to this ITL draft publication and of any
202   relevant unexpired U.S. or foreign patents.
203   ITL may require from the patent holder, or a party authorized to make assurances on its
204   behalf, in written or electronic form, either:
205      a) assurance in the form of a general disclaimer to the effect that such party does not
206         hold and does not currently intend holding any essential patent claim(s); or
207     b) assurance that a license to such essential patent claim(s) will be made available
208        to applicants desiring to utilize the license for the purpose of complying with the
209        guidance or requirements in this ITL draft publication either:
210            i. under reasonable terms and conditions that are demonstrably free of any unfair
211               discrimination; or
212           ii. without compensation and under reasonable terms and conditions that are
213               demonstrably free of any unfair discrimination.
214   Such assurance shall indicate that the patent holder (or third party authorized to make
215   assurances on its behalf) will include in any documents transferring ownership of patents
216   subject to the assurance, provisions sufficient to ensure that the commitments in the
217   assurance are binding on the transferee, and that the transferee will similarly include
218   appropriate provisions in the event of future transfers with the goal of binding each
219   successor-in-interest.
220   The assurance shall also indicate that it is intended to be binding on successors-in-interest
221   regardless of whether such provisions are included in the relevant transfer documents.
222   Such statements should be addressed to: mailto:dig-comments@nist.gov.
