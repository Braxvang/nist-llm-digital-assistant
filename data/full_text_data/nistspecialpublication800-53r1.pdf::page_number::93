Special Publication 800-53, Revision 1              Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems

IA-2      USER IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION

          Control: The information system uniquely identifies and authenticates users (or processes acting on
          behalf of users).
          Supplemental Guidance: Users are uniquely identified and authenticated for all accesses other than
          those accesses explicitly identified and documented by the organization in accordance security
          control AC-14. Authentication of user identities is accomplished through the use of passwords,
          tokens, biometrics, or in the case of multifactor authentication, some combination thereof. NIST
          Special Publication 800-63 provides guidance on remote electronic authentication including
          strength of authentication mechanisms. For purposes of this control, the guidance provided in
          Special Publication 800-63 is applied to both local and remote access to information systems.
          Remote access is any access to an organizational information system by a user (or an information
          system) communicating through an external, non-organization-controlled network (e.g., the
          Internet). Local access is any access to an organizational information system by a user (or an
          information system) communicating through an internal organization-controlled network (e.g.,
          local area network) or directly to a device without the use of a network. Unless a more stringent
          control enhancement is specified, authentication for both local and remote information system
          access is NIST Special Publication 800-63 level 1 compliant. FIPS 201 and Special Publications
          800-73, 800-76, and 800-78 specify a personal identity verification (PIV) credential for use in the
          unique identification and authentication of federal employees and contractors. In addition to
          identifying and authenticating users at the information system level (i.e., at system logon),
          identification and authentication mechanisms are employed at the application level, when
          necessary, to provide increased information security for the organization.
          In accordance with OMB policy and E-Authentication E-Government initiative, authentication of
          public users accessing federal information systems may also be required to protect nonpublic or
          privacy-related information. The e-authentication risk assessment conducted in accordance with
          OMB Memorandum 04-04 is used in determining the NIST Special Publication 800-63
          compliance requirements for such accesses with regard to the IA-2 control and its enhancements.
          Scalability, practicality, and security issues are simultaneously considered in balancing the need to
          ensure ease of use for public access to such information and information systems with the need to
          protect organizational operations, organizational assets, and individuals. Related security controls:
          AC-14, AC-17.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The information system employs multifactor authentication for remote system access that is NIST
                Special Publication 800-63 [Selection: organization-defined level 3, level 3 using a hardware
                authentication device, or level 4] compliant.
          (2)   The information system employs multifactor authentication for local system access that is NIST
                Special Publication 800-63 [Selection: organization-defined level 3 or level 4] compliant.
          (3)   The information system employs multifactor authentication for remote system access that is NIST
                Special Publication 800-63 level 4 compliant.
