D.18.2 Criminal Rehabilitation Information Type

Criminal Rehabilitation includes all government activities devoted to providing convicted
criminals with the educational resources and life skills necessary to rejoin society as responsible
and contributing members. The recommended provisional categorization of the criminal
rehabilitation information type follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of criminal rehabilitation
information on the ability of responsible agencies to provide convicted criminals with the
educational resources and life skills necessary to rejoin society as responsible and contributing
members. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of most criminal rehabilitation
information would have a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or
individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Exceptions that might have a
potential for more serious consequences are based on privacy information processed in criminal
rehabilitation systems (e.g., information required by the Privacy Act of 1974 (The Privacy Act
Information provisional impact levels are documented in the Personal Identity and
Authentication information type) or other statutes and executive orders to receive special
handling to protect the privacy of individuals). This can result in assignment of a moderate
impact level to such information.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for criminal rehabilitation information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of criminal rehabilitation information
would have a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.
Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external communications
(e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect operations and/or public confidence in the
agency, but the damage to the mission would usually be limited.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
most criminal rehabilitation information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to criminal rehabilitation information.
The effects of disruption of access to most criminal rehabilitation information or information
systems would have a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.
