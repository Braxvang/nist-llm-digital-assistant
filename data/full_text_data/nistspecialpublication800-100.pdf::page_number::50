        1. System-level prioritization: prioritize corrective actions to address
           system-level security weaknesses and vulnerabilities found during the
           baseline assessment against the predefined prioritization criteria. This
           prioritization is performed at the operating unit level by system owners and
           program managers. 39
        2. Enterprise-level prioritization: prioritize enterprise-wide security
           corrective actions identified during the baseline assessment based on
           predefined prioritization criteria. This prioritization is performed at the
           enterprise level by agency information security stakeholders.
   The prioritization methodology relies primarily on existing data sources and
inputs. Specific data inputs for the two types of prioritization are highlighted in
Table 5-1.

    Some of the data inputs need to be manipulated further to support the corrective
action prioritization process:
