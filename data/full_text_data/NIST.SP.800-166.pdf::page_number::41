 DTR-07.03.02.07   The authorityInfoAccess field shall contain an      •   [PROF], Worksheet
                   id-ad-caIssuers (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.48.2)                    titled - End Entity

                   specify the location of an LDAP accessible              Profile
                   directory server or HTTP accessible Web server
                   where certificates issued to the issuer of this
                   certificate may be found.
                   If LDAP is used, the URI must include the DN
                   of the entry containing the relevant certificates
                   and specify the directory attribute in which the
                   certificates are located. If the directory in which
                   the certificates are stored expects the "binary"
                   option to be specified, then the attribute type
                   must be followed by ";binary" in the URI.
                   If HTTP is used, the URI must point to a file
                   that has an extension of ".p7c" containing a
                   certs-only CMS message (see RFC 5751,

 DTR-07.03.02.08   The cRLDistributionPoints extension is              •   [PROF], Worksheet

                   If LDAP is used, the URI must include the DN            Profile
                   of the entry containing the CRL and specify the
                   directory attribute in which the CRL is located
                   (certificateRevocationList).
                   If HTTP is used, the URI must point to a file
                   that has an extension of ".crl" that contains the
                   DER encoded CRL. (see [RFC2585], Internet
