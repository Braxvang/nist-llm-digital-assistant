        The "Training" level of the learning continuum strives to produce relevant and needed
        security skills and competency by practitioners of functional specialties other than IT
        security (e.g., management, systems design and development, acquisition, auditing).                                               The
        training layers are discussed in detail in Chapters 3 (Security Basics and Literacy) and 4
        (Training Development Methodology: Role-Based Training).




        2.2.3   Education

       The "Education" level integrates all of the security skills and competencies of the various
       functional specialties into a common body of knowledge, adds a multi-disciplinary study
        of concepts, issues, and principles (technological and social), and strives to produce FT
        security specialists and professionals capable of vision and pro-active response.


        Historically, "computer security specialists" were practitioners appointed from the ranks
        of "computer specialists" (or another functional specialty), as if designation alone made
        those individuals specialists in security. Security responsibilities were often assigned as
        collateral to the duties of the primary functional specialty.


At best. Federal agencies paid for occasional training courses for their designated Computer
Security Officers or specialists; but few agency officials recognized a need to enroll their
designees in a formal computer security educational program or required evidence of                   —
qualification or certification as a condition of appointment or collateral designation. IT Security
professionalization was not mandated as a component of agency computer security training
programs: it was outside the scope of the then-current Federal computer security training
guidelines (SP 500-172).


Now, however, the IT Security Specialist/Officer/Program Manager functions have become too
technologically and managerially complex to be successfully accomplished                                           —   especially on an
ancillary or collateral basis   —
                                ^by practitioners lacking a comprehensive set of competencies.

Moreover, organization officials, customers, technical personnel, and other stakeholders are
creating pressures and demands for creative and dependable solutions to a growing range,
number, and severity of security and privacy concerns                                         —   solutions which can only be achieved by
