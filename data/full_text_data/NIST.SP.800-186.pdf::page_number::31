NIST SP 800-186                                                 Discrete Logarithm-based Cryptography:
February 2023                                                         Elliptic Curve Domain Parameters

                              E: y 2 + x y = x 3 + x 2 + b,
and the Koblitz curve has the form
                              Ea: y2 + x y = x 3 + ax 2 + 1,
where a = 0 or 1.
For each pseudorandom curve, the cofactor is h = 2. The cofactor of each Koblitz curve is h = 2
if a = 1, and h = 4 if a = 0.
The coefficients of the pseudorandom curves and the coordinates of the base points of both kinds
of curves are given in terms of both the polynomial and normal basis representations discussed in
Section 3.1.3.
For each m, the following parameters are given:
Field Representation:
   •   The normal basis type T
   •   The field polynomial (a trinomial or pentanomial) f(z)

Koblitz Curve:
   •   The coefficient a
   •   The base point order n
   •   The base point x coordinate Gx
   •   The base point y coordinate Gy

Pseudorandom curve:
   •   The base point order n

Pseudorandom curve (Polynomial Basis representation):
   •   The coefficient b
   •   The base point x coordinate Gx
   •   The base point y coordinate Gy

Pseudorandom curve (Normal Basis representation):
   •   The 160-bit input Seed to the SHA-1 based algorithm (i.e., the domain parameter seed)
   •   The coefficient b (i.e., the output of the SHA-1 based algorithm)
   •   The base point x coordinate Gx
   •   The base point y coordinate Gy

Integers (such as T, m, and n) are given in decimal form. Bit strings and field elements are given
in hexadecimal.
