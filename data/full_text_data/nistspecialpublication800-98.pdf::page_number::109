                                              should require additional controls to prevent the associated hazard

                                              The introduction of RFID technology represents a new challenge to
                                              the security of the enterprise network that should be mitigated by
                                              policy and associated technical, operational, and management
                                              controls. Elements of the network security policy that might require
                                              revision include (a) perimeter security (i.e., firewalls and extranets),
                                              (b) database security, (c) application security, and (d) wireless
                                              connections (i.e., between readers and the enterprise network).

                                              malicious code insertion, exploitation of buffer overflow
                                              vulnerabilities, and other attacks. In addition, if readers are
                                              connected to the enterprise infrastructure via a wireless link, then the
                                              policy should require mutual authentication between the reader and
                                              its network access point. It should also provide for data
                                              confidentiality and integrity services for wireless traffic, if needed.
