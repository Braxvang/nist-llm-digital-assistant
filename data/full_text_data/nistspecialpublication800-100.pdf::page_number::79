CHAPTER 8                                                            Security Planning


8.2.4    Senior Agency Information Security Officer
     The SAISO is the agency official responsible for serving as the CIO’s primary
liaison to the agency’s information system owners and ISSOs. The SAISO has the
following responsibilities related to system security plans:
      • Carrying out the CIO’s responsibilities for system security planning;
      • Coordinating the development, review, and acceptance of system security plans
        with information system owners, ISSOs, and the authorizing official;
      • Coordinating the identification, implementation, and assessment of the common
        security controls; and
      • Possessing professional qualifications, including training and experience,
        required to develop and review system security plans.

8.2.5    Information System Security Officer
    The ISSO is the agency official assigned responsibility by the SAISO, authorizing
official, management official, or information system owner for ensuring that the
appropriate operational security posture is maintained for an information system or
program. The ISSO has the following responsibilities related to system security
plans:
      • Assisting the SAISO in identifying, implementing, and assessing the common
        security controls; and
      • Actively supporting the development and maintenance of the system security
        plan, to include coordinating system changes with the information system
        owner and assessing the security impact of those changes.

8.3     Rules of Behavior
    The rules of behavior, which are required in OMB Circular A-130, Appendix III,
and are also a form of security control found in NIST SP 800-53, should clearly
delineate responsibilities and expected behavior of all individuals with access to the
system. The rules should state the consequences of inconsistent behavior or
noncompliance and be made available to every user prior to receiving authorization
for system access. It is required that the rules contain a signature page for each
user to acknowledge receipt, indicating that they have read, understand, and agree
to abide by the rules of behavior. Electronic signatures are acceptable for use in
acknowledging the rules of behavior.
    Table 8-1 lists examples from OMB Circular A-130, Appendix III, of what should
be covered in typical rules of behavior. These are examples only and agencies have
flexibility in the detail and content. When developing the rules of behavior, agencies
should be aware that the intended function of this document is to make all users
accountable for their actions by acknowledging that they have read, understood, and
agreed to abide by the rules of behavior. The rules, while not intended as a complete
copy of the security policy or procedures guide, should cover, at a high level, some
of the controls described in Table 8-1. Lastly, agencies can incorporate, by reference,
the agency body of policies and procedures governing information security and other
applicable policies in the text of the rules of behavior.
