   •   Network-tier policies — Allowed communication between enterprise network elements
       (e.g., firewall rules, which are relatively static). This can include restrictions on usage of
       allowed ports.
   •   Identity-tier policies — Access scope for services and resources based on service and
       user identities (e.g., dynamic application-to-application communication rules based on
       identities through a dedicated infrastructure layer, such as user identity provided by an
       enterprise Identity and Access Management (IAM) provider and service identity provided
       by a standard-based Secure Production Identity Framework for Everyone(SPIFFE) server
       [4])
Multi-tier policies can be implemented realistically and are non-disruptive to current compliance
practices. Other tiers of policy also exist. For example, in the context of the service mesh, there
are “application-tier” policies, which apply to the application payload itself. These include
coarse-grained Web Application Firewall (WAF) rules, fine-grained rules like Spring Cloud
Gateway payload validation, and the validation of request semantics via tools like the Open
Policy Agent (OPA). Many can even be enforced by a service mesh, but those policies are
beyond the scope of this document.
The difficulty with having all network-tier policies is that policies expressed through firewall
rules have to be continuously changed, depending on the application pair behind those firewalls.
The flexibility in having multi-tier policies is that network-tier policies can be relatively static
while identity-tier policies higher up in the stack (e.g., service to service) can be dynamic, as
illustrated in Fig. 2.

Implementing identity-tier policies is also a more agile process that allows for new policy
capabilities, such as writing policy in terms of identity and application-level action and verb. For
example, a network-tier policy would describe the subnets that contain application instances of
the client being allowed to call the subnet on a specific port. In contrast, an identity-tier policy
would allow the client application identity to communicate with the server application identity
via Hyper-text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) on port 443 and execute only the GET method
