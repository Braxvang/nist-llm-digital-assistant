Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of property protection information
depends on the type of property being protected and on the immediacy with which the
information is expected to be used. In most cases, unauthorized disclosure can be expected to
have limited adverse consequences.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Unauthorized modification or destruction
of information affecting external communications (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may
adversely affect operations or public confidence in the agency. However, the potential damage to
the protection mission will usually be of greater concern. If the modified or destroyed
information is tactical i.e., time-critical, there is a greater potential for actions being taken based
on incomplete or false information. This can have serious adverse effects on protection
operation. This can result in assignment of a moderate impact level to such information. .

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
most property protection information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to property protection information.
Missions supported by property protection information are not typically tolerant of delays, but
the consequences of loss of availability of most property protection information are limited.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: The consequences of inability of guard
forces and other emergency responders to receive property protection information in a timely
manner may result in catastrophic consequences for properties that could include critical
infrastructures and key national assets. In general, the availability impact level assigned to
property protection information is dependent on what is being protected. This can result in
assignment of a moderate or high impact level to such information.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact recommended for most
property protection information is low.

D.16.6 Substance Control Information Type

Substance control supports activities associated with the enforcement of legal substances (i.e.,
alcohol and tobacco) and illegal narcotics laws including trafficking, possession, sale,
distribution, and other related activities. The provisional security categorization recommended
for the substance control information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Moderate), (integrity, Moderate), (availability, Moderate)}
