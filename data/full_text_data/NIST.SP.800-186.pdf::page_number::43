Appendix B. Relationships Between Curve Models
The non-binary curves specified in this Recommendation are expressed in different curve models
defined over the same field GF(q) – namely as curves in short-Weierstrass form, as Montgomery
curves, or as twisted Edwards curves. These curve models are related as follows.

B.1.       Mapping Between Twisted Edwards Curves and Montgomery Curves
One can map points on the Montgomery curve MA,B to points on the twisted Edwards curve Ea,d ,
where a = (A+2)/B and d = (A-2)/B and, conversely, map points on the twisted Edwards curve
Ea,d to points on the Montgomery curve MA,B, where A = 2(a+d)/(a-d) and B = 4/(a-d). Here, it is
assumed that 𝑎𝑎 ≠ 0, 𝑑𝑑 ≠ 0, 𝐴𝐴 ≠ −2,2, and 𝐵𝐵 ≠ 0. For the curves in this specification, this
defines a birational equivalence between MA,B and Ea,d, thereby showing that the discrete
logarithm problem in either curve model is equally hard.
For the Montgomery curves and twisted Edwards curves in this specification, the mapping from
MA,B to Ea,d is defined by mapping the point at infinity ∅ and the point (0, 0) of order two on
MA,B to the point (0, 1) and the point (0, −1) , respectively, of order two on Ea,d, while mapping
every other point (u, v) on MA,B to the point (x, y) = (u/v, (u−1)/(u+1)) on Ea,d. The inverse
mapping from Ea,d to MA,B is defined by mapping the point (0, 1) and the point (0, −1) of order
two on Ea,d to the point at infinity ∅ and the point (0, 0), respectively, of order two on MA,B,
while every other point (x, y) on Ea,d is mapped to the point (u, v) = ((1+y)/(1−y), (1+y)/(1−y)x)
on MA,B.
Specifically, for the curves defined in Section 3, the following is true:
Using the above maps, the base point of Curve25519 corresponds to the base point of
Edwards25519. For points (u, v) ≠ ∅, (0,0) on Curve25519, the image under the mapping
corresponds to the point (α u/v, (u − 1)/(u + 1)) on Edwards25519. Here α is the element of
GF(p) defined by:
     α:     51042569399160536130206135233146329284\

                 00ba81e7).

The inverse mapping from Edwards25519 to Curve25519 maps points (x,y) (other than the points
(0, 1) and (0, −1)) to ((1 + y)/(1 − y), α(1 + y)/(1−y)x).
Similarly, the base point of Curve448 corresponds to the base point of E448. Every other point
(u, v) ≠ ∅ , (0,0) on Curve448 corresponds to the point (α u/v, (u + 1)/(u − 1)) on E448, where α
is the element of GF(p) defined by:
α:        1978884672954644395383540097538580382568351525910598021481997791960\

For points that are not the point at infinity ∅ and the point (0,0) of order two, the inverse
mapping from E448 to Curve448 sends (x, y) to the point ((y + 1)/(y − 1), α(y + 1)/(y−1)x).
