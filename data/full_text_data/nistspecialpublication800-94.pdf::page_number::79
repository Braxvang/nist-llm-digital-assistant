                                                  GUIDE TO INTRUSION DETECTION AND PREVENTION SYSTEMS (IDPS)



configured with detailed policies that define exactly how each application on a host should behave. As
the host environment changes, administrators should ensure that host-based IDPS policies are updated to
take those changes into account. Generally it is not feasible to automatically link host-based IDPSs with
change management systems, but administrators could review change management records regularly and
adjust host configuration and policy information in the host-based IDPS to prevent false positives.

Policies can often be set on a per-host basis or for groups of hosts, which provides flexibility. Some
products also permit multiple policies to be configured on a host for multiple environments; this is most
helpful for hosts that function in multiple environments, such as a laptop used both within an organization
and from external locations. Host-based IDPSs also offer whitelist and blacklist capabilities for hosts
(e.g., IP addresses of other hosts with which a host might communicate), applications, ports, filenames,
and other host characteristics. In fact, some products automatically update agents with the latest whitelist
and blacklist information, based on reports from other agents of newly detected malicious activity.
Another common feature of host-based IDPSs is customizing each alert, such as specifying which
response option should be performed for an alert.

The sophistication of signature capabilities for host-based IDPSs varies widely depending on the
detection techniques used by each product.

7.2.2.4 Technology Limitations

Host-based IDPSs have some significant limitations. Some of these limitations are described in Section
7.2.2.2. Other important limitations include the following:

 Alert Generation Delays. Although agents generate alerts on a real-time basis for most detection
  techniques, some techniques are used periodically to identify events that have already happened.
  Such techniques might only be applied hourly or even just a few times a day, causing significant
  delay in identifying certain events.
 Centralized Reporting Delays. Many host-based IDPSs are intended to forward their alert data to
  the management servers on a periodic basis, not in a near-real-time fashion. Alert data is typically
  transferred in batches every 15 to 60 minutes to reduce overhead for the IDPS components and the
  network. Smaller host-based IDPS implementations can usually transfer data more often, but for
  larger implementations, vendors typically recommend less frequent transfers. This can cause delays
  in initiating response actions, which especially increases the impact of incidents that spread quickly,
  such as malware infestations.
 Host Resource Usage. Unlike the other IDPS technologies, host-based IDPSs involve running
  agents on the hosts being monitored. These agents can consume considerable host resources,
  including memory, processor usage, and disk storage. The agentsâ€™ operation, particularly the shims,
  can also cause slowdowns in operations such as network and filesystem usage. Testing of host
  resource usage should be performed when evaluating host-based IDPS products for possible purchase.
 Conflicts with Existing Security Controls. Installing an agent can cause existing host security
  controls to be disabled automatically, such as personal firewalls, if those controls are perceived to
  duplicate functionality provided by the agent. Installing an agent can also cause conflicts with other
  security controls, especially those that use shims to intercept host activity (e.g., personal firewalls,
  VPN clients). For some products, a network shim is optional, although it does permit greater
  functionality, especially in prevention actions. To identify any potential conflicts, implementers
  should test agents on hosts that are running the host security controls used on the hosts to which the
  agents would be deployed.
