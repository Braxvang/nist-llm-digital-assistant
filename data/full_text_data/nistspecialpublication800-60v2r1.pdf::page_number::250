Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of general insurance
information on the abilities of responsible agencies to provide protection to individuals or
entities against specified risks. General insurance activities include both insurance issuing and
insurance servicing. Insurance issuing is any activity such as provider approval, underwriting,
and endorsements. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of insurance issuing
information will generally result in a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets,
or individuals.

Insurance servicing supports activities associated with administering and processing insurance
include payment processing, initial and final closings, loss mitigation, claims management, and
retiring insurance. The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of
insurance servicing information on the abilities of responsible agencies to administer and process
insurance. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of insurance servicing information will
generally result in a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: The more serious consequences may
result from 1) unauthorized disclosure of provider’s proprietary information, or 2) premature
disclosure of agency plans or changes under consideration for contracts, plans, or policies.
Unauthorized disclosure of information that can affect contract arrangements to the detriment of
the interests of the government, and of the public at large (e.g., planned or anticipated
termination of a major contract insurer), can result in damaging increases in public expense and
exposure to impact. In the case of unauthorized disclosure to an individual private sector
organization, unfair competitive advantage may result – with major financial consequences. In
the case of unauthorized disclosure of preliminary and unsubstantiated data that is both incorrect
and pessimistic (e.g., Medicare budget projections,), the consequent unwarranted alarm of the
public may have serious political and operational consequences for affected agencies. In the
more serious cases, the confidentiality impact will be at least moderate.

The more serious consequences of unauthorized disclosure of insurance servicing information
may result from unauthorized disclosure of private information concerning the insured (e.g.,
Privacy Act information). (The Privacy Act Information provisional impact levels are
documented in the Personal Identity and Authentication information type.) In the more serious
cases, the confidentiality impact will be at least moderate.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for general insurance information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of general insurance information may
depend on the urgency with which the information is typically needed. Unauthorized
modification or destruction of information affecting external communications (e.g., web pages,
electronic mail) typically has a limited adverse effect on agency operations and/or public
confidence in the agency.
