       INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SECURITY TRAINING MATRIX                             — Cell 3.4B
 Training Area: System Life Cycle Security               — implementation
 Functional Specialty: Acquire

 Definition   —        The system life cycle is a model for building and operating an FT system
                       from its initial inception to its termination and disposal of assets. The
                       model includes six phases: Initiation, Development, Test and Evaluation,
                       Implementation, Operations, and Termination. Life cycle security is the
                       ensemble of processes and procedures which ensures data confidentiality, as
                       needed, as well as data and system integrity, and availability.


                       The implementation phase is the installation of the system into the
                       operational environment in a manner that does not compromise the integrity
                       and effectiveness of the successfully tested security safeguards.

 Behavioral Outcome         —   Individuals with acquisition responsibilities are able to ensure that
                                the system, as implemented, meets all contractual requirements
                                related to the security and privacy of IT resources.
