2438   11.     Equity Considerations
2439   This section is informative.
2440   Accurate and equitable authentication service is an essential element of a digital
2441   identity system. While the accuracy aspects of authentication are largely the subject
2442   of the security requirements found elsewhere in this document, the ability for all
2443   subscribers to authenticate reliably is required to provide equitable access to government
2444   services as specified in Executive Order 13985, “Advancing Racial Equity and Support
2445   for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government” [EO13985]. In
2446   assessing equity risks, a CSP should consider the overall user population served by its
2447   authentication service. Additionally, the CSP further identifies groups of users within
2448   the population whose shared characteristic(s) can cause them to be subject to inequitable
2449   access, treatment, or outcomes when using that service. The usability considerations
2450   provided in Sec. 10 should also be considered to help ensure the overall usability and
2451   equity for all persons using authentication services.
2452   A primary aspect of equity is that the CSP needs to anticipate the needs of its subscriber
2453   population and offer authenticator options that are suitable for that population. Some
2454   examples of authenticator suitability problems are as follows:
2455         • SMS-based out-of-band authentication may not be usable for subscribers in rural
2456           areas where mobile phone service is not available.
2457         • OTP devices may be difficult for subscribers with vision difficulties to read.
2458         • Out-of-band authentication secrets sent via a voice telephone call may be difficult
2459           for subscribers with hearing difficulties to understand.
2460         • Facial matching algorithms may less effectively match facial characteristics of
2461           subscribers of some ethnicities.
2462         • The cost of hardware-based authenticators may be beyond the means of some
2463           subscribers.
2464         • Accurate manual entry of memorized secrets may be difficult for subscribers with
2465           some mobility and dexterity-related physical disabilities.
2466         • The use of certain authenticator types may be challenging for subscribers with
2467           some disabilities such as intellectual, developmental, learning, and neurocognitive
2468           difficulties.
2469   Normative requirements have been established requiring CSPs to mitigate the problems
2470   in this area that are expected to be most common. However, it is not feasible to anticipate
2471   all potential equity problems. Potential equity problems also will vary for different
2472   applications. Accordingly, CSPs need to provide mechanisms for subscribers to report
2473   inequitable authentication requirements and to advise them on potential alternative
2474   authentication strategies.
