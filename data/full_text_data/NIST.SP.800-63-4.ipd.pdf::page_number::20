      NIST SP 800-63-4 ipd                                               Digital Identity Guidelines
      December 2022


538   engineering objectives of predictability, manageability, and disassociability, organizations
539   can determine the types of capabilities a given system may need to be able to demonstrate
540   how organizational privacy policies and system privacy requirements have been
541   implemented.
542   The Privacy Act of 1974, 2010 Edition, [PrivacyAct] established a set of fair information
543   practices for the collection, maintenance, use, and disclosure of information about
544   individuals that is maintained by federal agencies in systems of records.
545   When designing and implementing digital identity management processes and systems,
546   privacy risk assessments are required for PII processing under these guidelines. Such
547   privacy risk assessments can be used to support Privacy Impact Assessments under OMB
548   Guidance for Implementing the Privacy Provisions of the E-Government Act of 2002
549   [M-03-22] as well as to select controls from NIST Special Publication 800-53, Security
550   and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations [SP800-53]. Further,
551   each volume of 800-63 (63A, 63B, and 63C) contains a specific section providing
552   detailed privacy requirements and considerations for the implementation of the processes,
553   controls, and requirements presented in that volume.

554   2.3.3. Equity
555   As defined in Executive Order 13985, Advancing Racial Equity and Support for
556   Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government [EO13985], equity refers
557   to the consistent and systematic fair, just, and impartial treatment of all individuals,
558   including individuals who belong to underserved communities that have been denied
559   such treatment, such as Black, Latino, and Indigenous and Native American persons,
560   Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, and other persons of color; members of religious
561   minorities; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) persons; persons
562   with disabilities; persons who live in rural areas; and persons otherwise adversely affected
563   by persistent poverty or inequality.
564   A personâ€™s ability to engage in an online transaction, such as accessing a critical service
565   like healthcare, is often dependent on their ability to successfully and safely present a
566   digital identity. Given the broad disparities that exist in the U.S. society and globally,
567   many people are either unable to successfully present a digital identity, or they face a
568   higher degree of burden in navigating online services than their more privileged peers,
569   leaving them locked out of critical services or broader participation in the online world.
570   In a public service context, this poses a direct risk to successful mission delivery. In a
571   broader societal context, challenges related to digital access can exacerbate existing
572   inequities and continue systemic cycles of exclusion for historically marginalized and
573   underserved groups.
574   Readers of this guidance are encouraged to consider existing inequities faced by the
575   populations they serve to identify opportunities to design or operate digital identity
576   systems and processes in ways that best support their needs. Readers are also encouraged
