APPENDIX E

THREAT EVENTS
REPRESENTATIVE THREAT EVENTS INITIATED BY THREAT SOURCES




T      his appendix provides: (i) a description of potentially useful inputs to the threat event
       identification task; (ii) representative examples of adversarial threat events expressed as
       tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and non-adversarial threat events; (iii) an
exemplary assessment scale for the relevance of those threat events; and (iv) templates for
summarizing and documenting the results of the threat identification Task 2-2. Organizations can
eliminate certain threat events from further consideration if no adversary with the necessary
capability has been identified. 51 Organizations can also modify the threat events provided to
describe specific TTPs with sufficient detail 52 and at the appropriate classification level. 53
Organizations can use the representative threat events and predicated/expected values for the
relevance of those events as a starting point with tailoring to adjust for any organization-specific
conditions. Table E-5, an output from Task 2-2, provides relevant inputs to the risk tables in
Appendix I.

  Each entry in Table E-2 implicitly assumes a level of adversary capability, intent, and targeting. Depending on the
results of threat source identification, some entries could be determined to be irrelevant, while other entries could be
combined. In addition, some entries could be rewritten in terms of an organization’s enterprise architecture.
52
   The level of detail of TTPs is established as part of the organizational risk frame. The level of detail in Table E-2 is
intended to support risk assessments at all three tiers, and to be tailorable to include additional details, as necessary.
More detailed descriptions of threat events that exploit software, for example, can be found in the Common Attack
Pattern Enumeration and Classification (CAPEC) site at http://capec.mitre.org.
53
  The threat events in Table E-2 are provided at the unclassified level. Additional threat events at the classified level
are available from selected federal agencies to individuals with appropriate security clearances and need to know.
