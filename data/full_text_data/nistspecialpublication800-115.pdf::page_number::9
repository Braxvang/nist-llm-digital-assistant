    individuals to ensure assessments are conducted in accordance with these requirements. Topics
    that an assessment policy should address include the organizational requirements with which
    assessments must comply, roles and responsibilities, adherence to an established assessment
    methodology, assessment frequency, and documentation requirements.
 Implement a repeatable and documented assessment methodology. This provides
  consistency and structure to assessments, expedites the transition of new assessment staff, and
  addresses resource constraints associated with assessments. Using such a methodology enables
  organizations to maximize the value of assessments while minimizing possible risks introduced
  by certain technical assessment techniques. These risks can range from not gathering sufficient
  information on the organization’s security posture for fear of impacting system functionality to
  affecting the system or network availability by executing techniques without the proper
  safeguards in place. Processes that minimize risk caused by certain assessment techniques
  include using skilled assessors, developing comprehensive assessment plans, logging assessor
  activities, performing testing off-hours, and conducting tests on duplicates of production systems
  (e.g., development systems). Organizations need to determine the level of risk they are willing to
  accept for each assessment, and tailor their approaches accordingly.
 Determine the objectives of each security assessment, and tailor the approach accordingly.
  Security assessments have specific objectives, acceptable levels of risk, and available resources.
  Because no individual technique provides a comprehensive picture of an organization’s security
  when executed alone, organizations should use a combination of techniques. This also helps
  organizations to limit risk and resource usage.
 Analyze findings, and develop risk mitigation techniques to address weaknesses. To ensure
  that security assessments provide their ultimate value, organizations should conduct root cause
  analysis upon completion of an assessment to enable the translation of findings into actionable
  mitigation techniques. These results may indicate that organizations should address not only
  technical weaknesses, but weaknesses in organizational processes and procedures as well.
