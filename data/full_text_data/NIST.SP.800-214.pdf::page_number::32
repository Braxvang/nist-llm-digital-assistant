that use or are enabled by cyber resources. Volume 2 provides a handbook for achieving the
identified cyber resiliency outcomes based on a systems engineering perspective on system life
cycle and risk management processes. Organizations can select, adapt, and use some or all of
the cyber resiliency constructs and apply the constructs to the technical, operational, and threat
environments for which systems need to be engineered.
Smart Grid Cybersecurity
In FY 2020, engineers from NIST’s Engineering Laboratory and ITL expanded on the Cybersecurity
Framework Smart Grid Profile created during FY 2019 by developing a draft profile for the specific
capability of voltage regulation on the electric distribution system. The draft profile compares
and contrasts distribution system voltage regulation for both a high distributed energy resource
(DER) environment and a conventional grid environment and prioritizes NIST Cybersecurity
Framework subcategory outcomes based upon their ability to assist power system stakeholders
in achieving voltage regulation within these environments.
Working with a representative from the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC),
NIST helped update the mapping between the NERC Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP)
requirements and version 1.1 of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. They also collaborated
with industry volunteers to help create a self-assessment tool for utilities to measure their
cybersecurity and compliance maturity and develop an improvement plan. NIST continues to
chair the Smart Electric Power Alliance (SEPA) cybersecurity working group and has established
an effort to determine threats to the power grid posed by customer energy Internet of Things
(IoT) devices (e.g., smart thermostats and water heaters) and provide suggested mitigations.
Methods for Securing Virtual Infrastructure
Microservices—an approach to software development using independent but interconnected
applications—simplify software scalability, usability, and availability. Because of these benefits,
this type of architecture is becoming commonplace for cloud-based and large
enterprise applications, but the characteristics of microservices-based applications
bring increased security challenges. The sheer number of microservices results in more
interconnections and more communication links to be protected. Additionally, the ephemeral
nature of microservices calls for secure service discovery mechanisms and the deployment
of security services that are not tightly coupled with application code. Given the
characteristics and associated security challenges, point security solutions (e.g.,
authentication, authorization, security monitoring) are inadequate.
In FY 2020, NIST published SP 800-204A, Building Secure Microservices-based Applications
Using Service Mesh Architecture. The publication provides deployment guidance for proxy-
based service mesh components as well as secure configuration recommendations that span
the entire application infrastructure space.
