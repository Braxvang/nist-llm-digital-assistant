                                                         Guidelines on Mobile Device Forensics

Isolating the mobile device from other devices used for data synchronization is important to
keep new data from contaminating existing data. If the device is found in a cradle or connected
with a personal computer, pulling the plug from the back of the personal computer eliminates
data transfer or synchronization overwrites. It is recommended that a capture of the personal
computer’s memory be extracted before “pulling the plug” as memory acquired generally
proves to be of significant forensic value. Caution should be used, as removing a device that if
performing a software update or backup has the potential to corrupt the mobile device’s file
system. The use of memory forensics tools for the capture of a personal computer’s memory
should be done by a qualified digital forensics professional. The mobile device should be
seized along with associated hardware. Media cards, UICCs, and other hardware residing in
the mobile device should not be removed. Also, seizing the computer that was connected to the
mobile device provides the ability to acquire synchronized data from the hard disk that might
not be obtained from the device. Any associated hardware such as media cards, UICCs, power
adapters, device sleeves, or peripherals, should be seized along with related materials such as
product manuals, packaging, and software.

Isolating a mobile device from all radio networks (e.g. WiFi, Cellular and Bluetooth) is
important to keep new traffic, such as SMS messages, from overwriting existing data. Besides
the risk of overwriting potential evidence, the question may arise whether data received on the
mobile device after seizure is within the scope of the original authority granted. Vulnerabilities
may exist that may exploit a weaknesses related to software vulnerabilities from the web
browser and OS, SMS, MMS, third-party applications and WiFi networks. The possibility of
such vulnerabilities being exploited may permit the argument that data may have been
modified during the forensic examination.

Three basic methods for isolating the mobile device from radio communication and preventing
these problems are to either: place the device in airplane mode, turn the device off, or lastly
place the device in a shielded container. Each method has certain drawbacks.

       Enabling “Airplane Mode” requires interaction with the mobile device using the
        keypad, which poses some risk – less so, if the technician is familiar with the device in
        question and documents the actions taken (e.g., on paper or on video). Note: airplane
        mode does not prevent the system from using other services such as GPS in all cases.

       Turning off the mobile device may activate authentication codes (e.g., UICC PIN
        and/or handset security codes), which are then required to gain access to the device,
        complicating acquisition and delaying examination.

       Keeping the mobile device on, but radio isolated, shortens battery life due to increased
        power consumption as devices unable to connect to a network raise their signal
        strength to maximum. After some period, failure to connect to the network may cause
        certain mobile devices to reset or clear network data that otherwise would be useful if
        recovered [Smi05]. Faraday containers may attenuate the radio signal, but not
        necessarily eliminate it completely, allowing the possibility of communications being
        established with a cell tower, if in its immediate vicinity. The risk of improperly
        sealing the Faraday container (e.g., bag improperly sealed, exposed cables connected
        to the forensic workstation may act as an antenna) and unknowingly allowing access
        to the cell network also exists.

To conserve power, some mobile devices are normally configured to enter energy savings
mode and shut off the display after a short period of inactivity. Some devices also shut
