editor of ANSI 504-1, Generic Identity Command Set (GICS).
GICS enables PIV, PIV-Interoperable (PIV-I) and Common
Access Card (CAC) card applications, and others, to be built
from a single platform. GICS defines an open platform where
identity applications can be instantiated, deployed, and used
in an interoperable way between the credential issuers and
credential users. During FY 2014, INCITS 504 Parts 1 and 2
have started an amendment process to better align them
with the new NIST SP 800-73-4 (PIV) specifications.
   CSD staff also provided significant input to standards of
major interest to U.S. government agencies and U.S. markets.
CSD played a role in the development and revision of:
•   ISO/IEC 7816 (Identification Cards, Integrated Circuit
     Cards);
•   ISO/IEC 24727 (Identification Cards, Integrated Circuit
     Card Programming Interfaces); and
•   ISO/IEC 24787 (Biometrics “Match On Card” Compari-
