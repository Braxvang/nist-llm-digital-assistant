NIST SP 800-160v1r1                                                 Engineering Trustworthy Secure Systems
November 2022

       -   An approach to ensure that sourced materials and system elements that do not meet
           specified quality, origin, and functionality (e.g., counterfeit) are not introduced into the
           system
       -   The skill and personnel levels required to effect repairs, replacements, and restoration while
           accounting for maintenance staff requirements and any relevant legislation regarding
           health, safety, security, and the environment
       -   Maintenance measures that provide insight into the security aspects of performance levels,
           effectiveness, and efficiency
       MA-1.2 Define the security aspects of the logistics strategy.
       Note: The logistics strategy defines the specific security considerations required to perform
       logistics throughout the life cycle. This generally includes:
       - Acquisition logistics to help ensure that security implications are considered early during the
           development stage
       - Operations logistics to help ensure that the necessary material and resources are securely
           made available in the right quantity and quality and at the right place and time;
           considerations for securely making material and resources available include identification
           and marking, packaging, distribution, handling, and provisioning
       - The security criteria for storage locations and conditions, as well as the number and type of
           replacement system security-specific elements, their anticipated replacement rate, and
           their storage life and renewal frequency
       MA-1.3 Identify the security-relevant constraints and objectives that result from the security
              aspects of maintenance and logistics to be incorporated into the system requirements,
              architecture, and design.
       MA-1.4 Identify trade-offs such that the security aspects of the system and associated
              maintenance and logistics actions result in a solution that is trustworthy, secure,
              affordable, operable, supportable, and sustainable.
       Note: The cost of secure maintenance and logistics should be considered within the lifetime cost
       of the system.
       MA-1.5 Identify the security aspects for enabling systems, products, and services needed to
              support maintenance and logistics.
       MA-1.6 Identify and plan for enabling systems, products, and services needed to support the
              security aspects of maintenance and logistics.
       MA-1.7 Obtain or acquire access to the security aspects of enabling systems, products, and
              services to be used in maintenance and logistics.

MA-2 PERFORM MAINTENANCE
Note: The need to perform maintenance may be driven by the need to address explicit security issues,
incidents, or failures. All maintenance actions must be accomplished in a secure manner with the
understanding that some actions may have a direct effect on the security posture of the system.
