APPENDIX D

THREAT SOURCES
TAXONOMY OF THREATS SOURCES CAPABLE OF INITIATING THREAT EVENTS




T      his appendix provides: (i) a description of potentially useful inputs to the threat source
        identification task; (ii) an exemplary taxonomy of threat sources by type, description, and
        risk factors (i.e., characteristics) used to assess the likelihood and/or impact of such threat
sources initiating threat events; (iii) an exemplary set of tailorable assessment scales for assessing
those risk factors; and (iv) templates for summarizing and documenting the results of the threat
source identification Task 2-1. The taxonomy and assessment scales in this appendix can be used
by organizations as a starting point with appropriate tailoring to adjust for organization-specific
conditions. Tables D-7 and D-8, outputs from Task 2-1, provide relevant inputs to the risk tables
in Appendix I.
