NIST SP 800-52 REV. 2                                                       GUIDELINES FOR TLS IMPLEMENTATIONS



4         Minimum Requirements for TLS Clients

This section provides a minimum set of requirements that a TLS client must meet in order to
adhere to these guidelines. Requirements are organized as follows: TLS protocol version support,
client keys and certificates, cryptographic support, TLS extension support, server authentication,
session resumption, compression methods, and operational considerations.

Specific requirements are stated as either implementation requirements or configuration
requirements. Implementation requirements indicate that federal agencies shall not procure TLS
client implementations unless they include the required functionality. Configuration
requirements indicate that system administrators are required to verify that particular features are
enabled or, in some cases, configured appropriately if present.

4.1       Protocol Version Support

The client shall be configured to use TLS 1.2 and should be configured to use TLS 1.3. The
client may be configured to use TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.0 to facilitate communication with private
sector servers. The client shall not be configured to use SSL 2.0 or SSL 3.0. Agencies shall
support TLS 1.3 by January 1, 2024. After this date, clients shall be configured to use TLS 1.3.
In general, clients that support TLS 1.3 should be configured to use TLS 1.2 as well. However,
TLS 1.2 may be disabled on clients that support TLS 1.3 if TLS 1.2 is not needed for
interoperability.

4.2       Client Keys and Certificates

Some applications may require client authentication. For TLS, this can be achieved by
performing mutual authentication using certificates.

4.2.1      Client Certificate Profile

When certificate-based client authentication is needed, the client shall be configured with a
certificate that adheres to the recommendations presented in this section. A client certificate may
be configured on the system or located on an external device (e.g., a PIV Card). For this
specification, the TLS client certificate shall be an X.509 version 3 certificate; both the public
key contained in the certificate and the signature shall provide at least 112 bits of security. If the
client supports TLS versions prior to TLS 1.2, the certificate should be signed with an algorithm
that is consistent with the public key: 30

      •    Certificates containing RSA (signature), ECDSA, or DSA public keys should be signed
           with those same signature algorithms, respectively;
      •    Certificates containing Diffie-Hellman certificates should be signed with DSA; and
      •    Certificates containing ECDH public keys should be signed with ECDSA.




30 This recommendation is an artifact of requirements in TLS 1.0 and 1.1.
