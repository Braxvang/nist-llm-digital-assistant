source IP address and port with destination IP address and port helps define the session. The highest layer
represents end user applications—firewalls can inspect application traffic and use it as the basis for policy
decisions.

Basic firewalls operate on one or a few layers—typically the lower layers—while more advanced
firewalls examine all of the layers shown in Figure 2-1. Those that examine more layers can perform
more granular and thorough examinations. Firewalls that understand the application layer can potentially
accommodate advanced applications and protocols and provide services that are user-oriented. For
example, a firewall that only handles lower layers cannot usually identify specific users, but a firewall
with application layer capabilities can enforce user authentication and log events to specific users.

2.1     Firewall Technologies

This section of the publication provides an overview of firewall technologies and basic information on the
capabilities of several commonly used types. Firewalling is often combined with other technologies—
most notably routing—and many technologies often associated with firewalls are more accurately part of
these other technologies. For example, network address translation (NAT) is sometimes thought of as a
firewall technology, but it is actually a routing technology. Many firewalls also include content filtering
features to enforce organization policies not directly related to security. Some firewalls include intrusion
prevention system (IPS) technologies, which can react to attacks that they detect to prevent damage to
systems protected by the firewall.

Firewalls are often placed at the perimeter of a network. Such a firewall can be said to have an external
and internal interface, with the external interface being the one on the outside of the network. These two
interfaces are sometimes referred to as unprotected and protected, respectively. However, saying that
something is or is not protected is often inappropriate because a firewall’s policies can work in both
directions; for example, there might be a policy to prevent executable code from being sent from inside
the perimeter to sites outside the perimeter.

2.1.1    Packet Filtering

The most basic feature of a firewall is the packet filter. Older firewalls that were only packet filters were
essentially routing devices that provided access control functionality for host addresses and
communication sessions. These devices, also known as stateless inspection firewalls, do not keep track of
the state of each flow of traffic that passes though the firewall; this means, for example, that they cannot
associate multiple requests within a single session to each other. Packet filtering is at the core of most
modern firewalls, but there are few firewalls sold today that only do stateless packet filtering. Unlike
more advanced filters, packet filters are not concerned about the content of packets. Their access control
functionality is governed by a set of directives referred to as a ruleset. Packet filtering capabilities are
built into most operating systems and devices capable of routing; the most common example of a pure
packet filtering device is a network router that employs access control lists.

In their most basic form, firewalls with packet filters operate at the network layer. This provides network
access control based on several pieces of information contained in a packet, including:

 The packet’s source IP address—the address of the host from which the packet originated (such as
  192.168.1.1)
 The packet’s destination address—the address of the host the packet is trying to reach (e.g.,
  192.168.2.1)
