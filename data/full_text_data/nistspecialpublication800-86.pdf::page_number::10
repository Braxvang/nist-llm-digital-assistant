GUIDE TO INTEGRATING FORENSIC TECHNIQUES INTO INCIDENT RESPONSE



operating systems, network traffic, and applications. The guide focuses on explaining the basic
components and characteristics of data sources within each category, as well as techniques for the
collection, examination, and analysis of data from each category. The guide also provides
recommendations for how multiple data sources can be used together to gain a better understanding of an
event.

Implementing the following recommendations should facilitate efficient and effective digital forensic
activities for Federal departments and agencies.

Organizations should ensure that their policies contain clear statements addressing all major
forensic considerations, such as contacting law enforcement, performing monitoring, and
conducting regular reviews of forensic policies and procedures.

At a high level, policies should allow authorized personnel to monitor systems and networks and perform
investigations for legitimate reasons under appropriate circumstances. Organizations may also have a
separate forensic policy for incident handlers and others with forensic roles; this policy would provide
more detailed rules concerning appropriate behavior. Forensic policy should clearly define the roles and
responsibilities of all people and external organizations performing or assisting with the organization’s
forensic activities. The policy should clearly indicate who should contact which internal teams and
external organizations under different circumstances.

Organizations should create and maintain procedures and guidelines for performing forensic tasks,
based on the organization’s policies and all applicable laws and regulations.

Guidelines should focus on general methodologies for investigating incidents using forensic techniques,
since it is not feasible to develop comprehensive procedures tailored to every possible situation.
However, organizations should consider developing step-by-step procedures for performing routine tasks.
The guidelines and procedures should facilitate consistent, effective, and accurate actions, which is
particularly important for incidents that may lead to prosecution or internal disciplinary actions; handling
evidence in a forensically sound manner puts decision makers in a position where they can confidently
take the necessary actions. The guidelines and procedures should support the admissibility of evidence
into legal proceedings, including information on gathering and handling evidence properly, preserving the
integrity of tools and equipment, maintaining the chain of custody, and storing evidence appropriately.
Because electronic logs and other records can be altered or otherwise manipulated, organizations should
be prepared, through their policies, guidelines, and procedures, to demonstrate the integrity of such
records. The guidelines and procedures should be reviewed periodically, as well as when significant
changes are made to the team’s policies and procedures.

Organizations should ensure that their policies and procedures support the reasonable and
appropriate use of forensic tools.

Organizations’ policies and procedures should clearly explain what forensic actions should and should not
be performed under various circumstances, as well as describing the necessary safeguards for sensitive
information that might be recorded by forensic tools, such as passwords, personal data (e.g., Social
Security numbers), and the contents of e-mails. Legal advisors should carefully review all forensic policy
and high-level procedures.

Organizations should ensure that their IT professionals are prepared to participate in forensic
activities.
