         RISK MANAGEMENT AND MEASUREMENT

         Organizations must balance a rapidly evolving cybersecurity and privacy
 threat landscape with the need to fulfill enterprise mission and business requirements.
  This evolution increasingly calls for a collaborative approach to managing discipline-
    specific enterprise risks. Risk management is integrated into NIST standards and
    guidelines to help better understand, measure, manage, and reduce cybersecurity
                            and privacy risk in a larger context.

Major Accomplishments in FY 2022:
• NIST kicked off the Journey to CSF 2.0 with a Request for Information (RFI), a summary
  analysis document of the RFI responses, and a workshop with 3,900+ attendees from 100
  countries. More planning is now underway for additional workshops and drafts.
• Updated guidance on assessing security and privacy controls was released, featuring updated
  assessment procedures to better enable automation.
• Guidance on managing cybersecurity risk in supply chains for all levels of an organization
  was released with specific sections focused on securing software supply chains. Additionally,
  NIST collaborated with software developers, service providers, and users to develop secure
  software development guidance that is now mandatory for federal agency software
  acquisition and use.
• New guidance and example implementations were developed and released to demonstrate
  how organizations can verify that the internal components of their computing devices are
  genuine and have not been tampered with.

           With our increasing dependence on computing technology and the rapid emergence
           of cyber-physical systems – from medical devices to automobiles to the electric grid –
           managing cybersecurity and privacy risk is an essential component in the safe and
           effective use of those systems. We are committed to our stakeholder-driven,
           collaborative, and thorough approach.
