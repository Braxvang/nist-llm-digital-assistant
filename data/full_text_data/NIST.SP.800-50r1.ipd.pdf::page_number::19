419        •    Institute learning activities that are appropriate for both internal and external members of the
420             workforce, including contractors and third parties
421        •    Identify learning obligations in contracts and agreements
422        •    Identify and track metrics to assess the effectiveness of learning efforts (e.g., determining whether
423             the number of a certain type of incident or event decreases after a targeted awareness campaign)


424             Privacy Risk Management Concepts to Emphasize
425   Members of the workforce who are in roles that can impact privacy must also have a clear
426   understanding of how to identify and address privacy risk that may arise.
427   The NIST Privacy Framework [5] provides a common language for understanding, managing,
428   and communicating privacy risk. Just as the workforce considers the risk associated with security
429   incidents, they must also consider privacy events – the potential problems that could arise from
430   system, product, or service operations with data, whether in digital or non-digital form, through a
431   complete life cycle from data collection through disposal. Privacy problems can arise from an
432   individual’s direct use of a product. Some problems can also arise simply from individuals’
433   interactions with systems, products, and services, even when the data being processed is not
434   directly linked to identifiable individuals. The problems that individuals can experience as a
435   result of data processing can be expressed in various ways. The NIST Privacy Framework
436   describes them as ranging from dignity-type effects (e.g., embarrassment or stigmas) to more
437   tangible harms (e.g., discrimination, economic loss, or physical harm). 8
438   As a result of the problems that individuals experience, an organization may in turn experience
439   impacts such as noncompliance costs, revenue loss arising from customer abandonment of
440   products and services, or harm to its external brand reputation or internal culture. Organizations
441   commonly manage these types of impacts at the enterprise risk management level. By connecting
442   problems that individuals experience to these well-understood organizational impacts,
443   organizations can bring privacy risk into parity with other risks that they manage in their broader
444   portfolio and drive more informed decision-making about resource allocation to strengthen
445   privacy programs. Fig. 3 illustrates the relationship between privacy risk and organizational risk.
