      NIST SP 800-171r3 fpd (Final Public Draft)                     Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information
      November 2023

280           DISCUSSION
281           Privileged accounts are typically described as system administrator accounts. Restricting
282           privileged accounts to specific personnel or roles prevents nonprivileged users from accessing
283           security functions or security-relevant information. Requiring the use of non-privileged accounts
284           when accessing nonsecurity functions or nonsecurity information limits exposure when operating
285           from within privileged accounts. Including roles addresses situations in which organizations
286           implement access control policies, such as role-based access control, and where a change of role
287           provides the same degree of assurance in the change of access authorizations for the user and the
288           processes acting on behalf of the user as would be provided by a change between a privileged and
289           non-privileged account.

293   3.1.7. Least Privilege – Privileged Functions
294           REQUIREMENT: 03.01.07
295           a. Prevent non-privileged users from executing privileged functions.
296           b. Log the execution of privileged functions.

297           DISCUSSION
298           Privileged functions include establishing system accounts, performing system integrity checks,
299           conducting patching operations, or administering cryptographic key management activities. Non-
300           privileged users do not possess the appropriate authorizations to execute privileged functions.
301           Circumventing intrusion detection and prevention mechanisms or malicious code protection
302           mechanisms are examples of privileged functions that require protection from non-privileged
303           users. This requirement represents a condition to be achieved by the definition of authorized
304           privileges in 03.01.01 and the enforcement of those privileges in 03.01.02.
305           The misuse of privileged functions – whether intentionally or unintentionally by authorized users
306           or by unauthorized external entities that have compromised system accounts – is a serious and
307           ongoing concern that can have significant adverse impacts on organizations. Logging the use of
308           privileged functions is one way to detect such misuse and mitigate the risks from insider threats
309           and advanced persistent threats.

313   3.1.8. Unsuccessful Logon Attempts
314           REQUIREMENT: 03.01.08
315           Limit the number of consecutive invalid logon attempts to [Assignment: organization-defined
316           number] in [Assignment: organization-defined time period].
