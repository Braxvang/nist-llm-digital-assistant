                                                                               COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE



Each agency must designate a primary and secondary POC with US-CERT and report all incidents
consistent with the agency’s incident response policy. Organizations should create a policy that states
who is designated to report incidents and how the incidents should be reported. Requirements, categories,
and timeframes for reporting incidents to US-CERT are on the US-CERT website.9 All Federal agencies
must ensure that their incident response procedures adhere to US-CERT’s reporting requirements and that
the procedures are followed properly.

All organizations are encouraged to report incidents to their appropriate CSIRTs. If an organization does
not have its own CSIRT to contact, it can report incidents to other organizations, including Information
Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs). One of the functions of these industry-specific private sector
groups is to share important computer security-related information among their members. Several ISACs
have been formed for industry sectors such as Communications, Electric Sector, Financial Services,
Information Technology, and Research and Education.10

2.3.4.4 Other Outside Parties

An organization may want to discuss incidents with other groups, including those listed below. When
reaching out to these external parties, an organization may want to work through US-CERT or its ISAC,
as a “trusted introducer” to broker the relationship. It is likely that others are experiencing similar issues,
and the trusted introducer can ensure that any such patterns are identified and taken into consideration.

 Organization’s ISP. An organization may need assistance from its ISP in blocking a major network-
  based attack or tracing its origin.
 Owners of Attacking Addresses. If attacks are originating from an external organization’s IP
  address space, incident handlers may want to talk to the designated security contacts for the
  organization to alert them to the activity or to ask them to collect evidence. It is highly recommended
  to coordinate such communications with US-CERT or an ISAC.
 Software Vendors. Incident handlers may want to speak to a software vendor about suspicious
  activity. This contact could include questions regarding the significance of certain log entries or
  known false positives for certain intrusion detection signatures, where minimal information regarding
  the incident may need to be revealed. More information may need to be provided in some cases—for
  example, if a server appears to have been compromised through an unknown software vulnerability.
  Software vendors may also provide information on known threats (e.g., new attacks) to help
  organizations understand the current threat environment.
 Other Incident Response Teams. An organization may experience an incident that is similar to ones
  handled by other teams; proactively sharing information can facilitate more effective and efficient
  incident handling (e.g., providing advance warning, increasing preparedness, developing situational
  awareness). Groups such as the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST)11, the
  Government Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (GFIRST)12, and the Anti-Phishing
  Working Group (APWG)13 are not incident response teams, but they promote information sharing
  among incident response teams.
 Affected External Parties. An incident may affect external parties directly—for example, an outside
  organization may contact the organization and claim that one of the organization’s users is attacking
