SP 800-152                                                   A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


   e) How keys and/or metadata are protected during distribution, and
   f) The types of entities to which keys and/or metadata can be delivered (e.g., user, user
      device, network device).

                SC-12      A Federal CKMS shall support the availability and security
PR:2.6
                           of its cryptographic keys and their associated metadata.
                           A Federal CKMS shall be implemented in accordance with
PR:2.7
                           the CKMS design that is specified in the CKMS design
                           documentation and support all the specified services,
                           functions, and features of the design.
                SA-5       A Federal CKMS compliance document shall be created prior
PR:2.8
                           to the initial operation of an FCKMS, describing how each
                           Profile requirement is satisfied and how each implemented
                           augmentation and/or feature is satisfied.

2.6   CKMS Profile

A CKMS Profile provides the requirements that a qualifying CKMS, its implementation, and
its operation must meet for a particular sector of interest, such as the Federal government. A
CKMS Profile specifies how the CKMS must be designed, implemented, tested, evaluated,
and operated. A CKMS Profile is a set of requirements that must be satisfied for a given
impact-level by a CKMS as implemented in an operational system.

2.7   FCKMS Profile

This FCKMS Profile (i.e., [SP 800-152]) specifies requirements, augmentations, and features
for the U.S. Federal government that will allow a CKMS designer and implementer to create
an FCKMS that can be used to protect Federal government information.

2.8   Differences between the Framework and This Profile

In the Framework, this section discusses the differences between a Framework and a profile
of that Framework. Essentially, the Framework requires that specific topics be addressed
during the design of a CKMS and described in design documentation. Any CKMS complies
with the Framework if its design documentation satisfies all the Framework Requirements.
A profile states the specific requirements that must be met in order to have a satisfactory
CKMS for the designated using sector. This Profile (i.e., SP 800-152) imposes specific
design and implementation requirements on a CKMS that can be used as an FCKMS, and
provides additional requirements for testing, procurement, installation, configuration,
administration, operation, maintenance and use.

2.9   Example of a Distributed CKMS Supporting a Secure E-Mail Application

In the Framework, this section provides a useful example of a secure email application.
