label an FTP server as a moderate risk because it transmits passwords in cleartext, but if the organization
only uses the FTP server as an anonymous public server that does not use passwords, then the actual risk
might be considerably lower. Assessors should determine the appropriate risk level for each vulnerability
and not simply accept the risk levels assigned by vulnerability scanners.

Network-based vulnerability scanning has some significant weaknesses. As with network sniffing and
discovery, this type of scanning uncovers vulnerabilities only for active systems. This generally covers
surface vulnerabilities, and is unable to address the overall risk level of a scanned network. Although the
process itself is highly automated, vulnerability scanners can have a high false positive error rate (i.e.,
reporting vulnerabilities when none exist). An individual with expertise in networking and OS security
should interpret the results. And because network-based vulnerability scanning requires more
information than port scanning to reliably identify the vulnerabilities on a host, it tends to generate
significantly more network traffic than port scanning. This may have a negative impact on the hosts or
network being scanned, or on network segments through which scanning traffic is traversing. Many
vulnerability scanners also include network-based tests for DoS attacks that, in the hands of an
inexperienced assessor, can have a marked negative impact on scanned hosts. Scanners often allow all
DoS attack tests to be suppressed so as to reduce the risk of impacting hosts through testing.

Another significant limitation of vulnerability scanners is that, like virus scanners and IDSs, they rely on
a repository of signatures. This requires the assessors to update these signatures frequently to enable the
scanner to recognize the latest vulnerabilities. Before running any scanner, an assessor should install the
latest updates to its vulnerability database. Some vulnerability scanner databases are updated more
regularly than others—this update frequency should be a major consideration when selecting a
vulnerability scanner.

Most vulnerability scanners allow the assessor to perform different levels of scanning that vary in terms
of thoroughness. While more comprehensive scanning may detect a greater number of vulnerabilities, it
can slow the overall scanning process. Less comprehensive scanning can take less time, but identifies
only well-known vulnerabilities. It is generally recommended that assessors conduct a thorough
vulnerability scan if resources permit.

Vulnerability scanning is a somewhat labor-intensive activity that requires a high degree of human
involvement to interpret results. It may also disrupt network operations by taking up bandwidth and
slowing response times. Nevertheless, vulnerability scanning is extremely important in ensuring that
vulnerabilities are mitigated before they are discovered and exploited by adversaries.

As with all pattern-matching and signature-based tools, application vulnerability scanners typically have
high false positive rates. Assessors should configure and calibrate their scanners to minimize both false
positives and false negatives to the greatest possible extent, and meaningfully interpret results to identify
the real vulnerabilities. Scanners also suffer from the high false negative rates that characterize other
signature-based tools—but vulnerabilities that go undetected by automated scanners can potentially be
caught using multiple vulnerability scanners or additional forms of testing. A common practice is to use
multiple scanners—this provides assessors with a way to compare results.

4.4   Wireless Scanning

Wireless technologies, in their simplest sense, enable one or more devices to communicate without the
need for physical connections such as network or peripheral cables. They range from simple technologies
like wireless keyboards and mice to complex cell phone networks and enterprise wireless local area
networks (WLAN). As the number and availability of wireless-enabled devices continues to increase, it
