Congress. The effects of loss of confidentiality of information associated with Congressional
liaison can facilitate attempts by competing interests to influence and/or impede a specific
legislative process or poison inter-branch relations. The consequences to agency programs and
even of the ability of an agency to perform its mission can be very serious. Premature public
release of information associated with Congressional liaison before internal coordination and
review has been conducted can result in unnecessary criticism of the preliminary data or
positions, and even damage public confidence in the agency. These consequences are
particularly likely where the release includes unedited internal commentary and discussion. In
general, unauthorized disclosure of much Congressional liaison information is likely to result in
serious harm to agency assets and/or operations. If the Congressional liaison information is
moved to the public domain, the confidentiality impact level becomes Not Applicable (NA).

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Some Congressional liaison
information used by Federal agencies (e.g., homeland security, law enforcement, defense,
intelligence community) is very sensitive or even classified national security information.
National security information is outside the scope of this guideline. The sensitivity level
associated with the very sensitive information is high.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for Congressional liaison information is moderate.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
Congressional liaison information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the Congressional liaison information.
Congressional liaison processes are usually tolerant of delays.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Excessive recovery delays can result in
damage to agency reputation and to interests associated with specific legislation. This can result
in assignment of a moderate impact level to such information.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
Congressional liaison information is low.

C.2.8 General Government

General Government involves the overhead costs of the Federal Government, including
legislative and executive activities; provision of central fiscal, personnel, and property activities;
and the provision of services that cannot reasonably be classified in any other service support
area. As a normal rule, all activities reasonably or closely associated with other service support
areas or information types shall be included in those service support areas or information types
rather than listed as a part of general government. This service support area is reserved for
