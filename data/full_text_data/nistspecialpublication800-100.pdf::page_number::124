                     Table 12-1. Information Security Services Life Cycle
    Phase                                                      Activity
Phase 1 –         When the need to initiate the services life cycle is recognized
Initiation        Consists of needs determination, security categorization, and the preliminary risk assessment
Phase 2 –         Involves developing an accurate portrait of the current environment before decision makers can
Assessment         implement a service and install a service provider
                  Baselines the existing environment; metrics creation, gathering, and analysis; total cost of
                   ownership
                  Analyzes opportunities and barriers
                  Identifies options and risks
Phase 3 –         Decision makers choose the appropriate solution from the viable options identified during the
Solution           assessment phase
                  Develops the business case
                  Develops the service arrangement
                  Develops the implementation plan
Phase 4 –         The service providers are implemented during this phase
Implementation    Identify the service provider and develop the service agreement
                  Finalize and execute the implementation plan
                  Manage expectations
Phase 5 –         The service’s life cycle becomes iterative; the service is operational, the service provided is fully
Operations         installed, and a constant assessment of the service level and source performance must be made
                  Monitor and measure organization performance
                  Evaluate and evolve
Phase 6 –         While unlikely, because of the iterative nature of the life cycle, the service and service provider
Closeout           could continue indefinitely
                  It is more likely that the environment will change such that information security program
                   managers will identify triggers that will initiate a new and replacement information security
                   service
                  Select the appropriate exit strategy
                  Implement the selected exit strategy



12.2 Selecting Information Security Services
    Before selecting specific services, organizations should review the current status
of their security programs and the security controls that are either planned or in
place to protect information systems and data. Organizations should use the risk
management process to identify an effective mix of management, operational, and
technical security controls that will mitigate risk to an acceptable level. The number
and type of appropriate security controls and their corresponding information
security services may vary throughout a particular system’s services life cycle. The
relative maturity of an organization’s security architecture is likely to influence the
types of security controls that are appropriate for a particular system. The blend of
security controls is tied to the mission of the organization and the role of the system
within the organization as it supports that mission. A more in-depth look at the
various types of security controls can be found in NIST SP 800-53, Revision 1,
Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems, February 2006.
Table 12-2 lists categories of information security services.
