      NIST SP 800-92r1 ipd                                                    Cybersecurity Log Management
      October 2023                                                                           Planning Guide

731             PMG-2, Revise Affected Policies
732   [Tasks]                                                                 [Previous Play] [Next Play]
733   Summary: Revise the organization’s policies to support the draft project plan. The desired
734   outcome is a set of draft revised policies that are ready for stakeholder review and feedback.
735   Tasks to perform include the following:
736      1. PMG-2.1: Identify which policies may be affected by the draft project plan. This may
737         include policies for software procurement, custom software development, and other
738         topics where cybersecurity logging capabilities are a vital part but not the focus.
739      2. PMG-2.2: Revise the affected policies so that they incorporate the organization’s
740         updated set of requirements, goals, and objectives.
741      3. PMG-2.3: Ensure that changes to all affected policies are harmonized.
742   Supporting information for tasks: It may be appropriate to specify future effective dates for
743   certain policy changes, depending on the timeframes for the corresponding items in the draft
744   project plan.

745             PMG-3, Address Feedback on Draft Plan and Policies
746   [Tasks]                                                                             [Previous Play]
747   Summary: Address stakeholder feedback on the draft plan and policies. The desired outcome is
748   a final project plan and policy set.
749   Tasks to perform include the following:
750      1. PMG-3.1: Identify all stakeholders who should be invited to provide feedback on the
751         draft plan and/or policies. It may be particularly important to get feedback from the
752         following:
753                o Legal counsel to ensure that the plan will adequately address all legal, regulatory,
754                  compliance, and other requirements and that the logging itself is performed in
755                  compliance with privacy laws
756                o System administrators and others who will be altering log generation, storage,
757                  transfer, access, and disposal practices to ensure that the changes are feasible and
758                  will not cause unexpected problems (e.g., a legacy system being configured to log
759                  every auditable event could generate an enormous number of log entries, impact
760                  the host’s performance, and cause log entries to be overwritten too quickly)
761                o Any parent or child organizations (subsidiaries, etc.)
762      2. PMG-3.2: Share the draft plan and policies with stakeholders, and encourage them to
763         provide feedback within a particular timeframe.
764      3. PMG-3.3: Review and adjudicate the feedback. Consider the point of view of each
765         stakeholder and the effect that addressing each comment may have on other parts of the
766         draft plan and policies.
