Special Publication 800-157                                                         Guidelines for Derived PIV Credentials


Therefore the hybrid approach is recommended when supported by mobile devices and applications.

The cryptographic module shall satisfy the requirements in Section 3.2 for either certificates issued under
id-fpki-common-pivAuth-derived-hardware or id-fpki-common-pivAuth-derived. As described in
Appendix A, these same cryptographic modules may also hold other keys, such as digital signature and
key management private keys and their corresponding certificates.

3.4    Activation Data

Use of the Derived PIV Authentication private key, or access to the plaintext or wrapped private key,
shall be blocked prior to password-based Subscriber authentication.12 The password should not be easily
guessable or otherwise individually identifiable in nature (e.g., part of a Social Security Number, phone
number). The required password length shall be a minimum of six characters.13

There shall be a mechanism to block use of the Derived PIV Authentication private key after a number of
consecutive failed activation attempts as stipulated by the department or agency. Throttling mechanisms
may be used to limit the number of attempts that may be performed over a given period of time.

For embedded tokens at LOA-3, the authentication mechanism may be implemented by hardware or
software mechanisms outside the boundary of the cryptographic module, provided that the strength of the
authentication mechanism meets the requirements in this section. For removable tokens, or embedded
tokens at LOA-4, the authentication mechanism shall be implemented and enforced by the cryptographic
module itself.

The password may need to be reset if the Subscriber has forgotten the password or if password-lockout
has occurred following repeated use of invalid passwords.14 Password reset may be performed at the
issuer’s facility, at an unattended kiosk operated by the issuer, or remotely via a general computing
platform.

       When password reset is performed in-person at the issuer's facility, or at an unattended kiosk
        operated by the issuer, it shall be implemented through one of the following processes:

             o    The Subscriber’s PIV Card shall be used to authenticate the Subscriber (via PKI-AUTH
                  mechanism as per Section 6.2.3.1 of [FIPS201]) prior to password reset. The issuer shall
                  verify that the Derived PIV Credential is for the same Subscriber that authenticated using
                  the PIV Card.

             o    A 1:1 biometric match shall be performed against the biometric sample retained during
                  initial issuance of the Derived PIV Credential, a stored biometric on the PIV Card, or
                  biometric data stored in the chain-of-trust [FIPS201]. The issuer shall verify that the
                  Derived PIV Credential is for the same Subscriber for whom the biometric match was
                  completed.

       For remote password reset the Subscriber’s PIV Card shall be used to authenticate the Subscriber
        (via PKI-AUTH authentication mechanism as per Section 6.2.3.1 of [FIPS201]) prior to password
        reset. If the reset occurs over a session that is separate from the session over which the PKI-AUTH

12 For embedded cryptographic tokens individual implementations may limit the set of characters from which the password may

   be chosen (e.g., to only decimal digits). Appendix B.2.1 requires that removable cryptographic tokens allow the use of decimal
   digits, lower case characters, and upper case characters.
13 Departments and agencies may choose to impose stronger password requirements for embedded cryptographic tokens.
14 Subscribers may change their passwords anytime by providing the current password and the new password values.
