4.1.3. Platform Management APIs
The major mobile OS platforms offer a set of APIs and supporting protocols that can be used by
third-party management tools [27][28]. Management APIs offer access to capabilities that are not
offered to normal developers, such as controlling app behavior, configuring device and security
settings, and querying sensitive device information. Access to these APIs may be restricted to a
subset of particular developers vetted by the platform owners. Additionally, access to these APIs
must be agreed to by either a device’s end user or a member of an organization’s IT staff. Note:
Most device platforms only permit one MDM solution to control these APIs.
The management capabilities offered by the platform owners are also supplemented by external
infrastructure, which is discussed further in Section 4.2.1. In some management situations, IT
administrators are able to directly manage the devices, while in other settings, IT administrators
send commands to the platform owner’s infrastructure, which are subsequently relayed onward
to the device. Both of these scenarios can be accommodated within the same management panel
and be made invisible to the user.

4.1.4. VPN Support
Mobile platforms support virtual private networks (VPNs) that can be leveraged by developers
via APIs. VPNs primarily provide confidentiality protection by encrypting user data. There are
three types of VPNs: OS-level VPNs, app level-VPNs, and web-based VPNs. OS-level VPNs
can be configured via management platforms and can sometimes be put into an “always-on”
state. OS-level VPNs may be more power-efficient and can encrypt a large amount of user
traffic. Protocols that may be used include Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) and Layer 2
Tunneling Protocol (L2TP). Unlike OS-level VPNs, app-level VPNs can be configured in
multiple ways. They can leverage system VPN APIs to protect user data, or they may simply
protect a single app’s data. More complicated setups can deploy VPNs per mobile app, often
known as a per-app VPN. Finally, web-based VPNs are easy for a user to take advantage of,
often by simply agreeing to a web page’s policy. Web-based VPNs use Transport Layer Security
(TLS) and may not leverage the same additional protections used by other types of VPNs.

4.1.5. Authentication Mechanisms
Mobile devices offer a variety of sensors that can enable standard and biometric-based
authentication. Biometric authentication on a mobile device may be used in combination with or
instead of passwords or PINs. Mobile hardware typically does not contain or store raw biometric
data. Instead, the biometric data is transformed (e.g., tokenized) and may be stored securely,
minimizing its susceptibility to reverse engineering and potential exposure to an attacker.
Biometric data is typically encrypted, stored on the device, and protected with a key available
only within a dedicated security environment. Sensors leveraged for biometric authentication
include:
   •   a fingerprint sensor for fingerprint-based authentication;
   •   dedicated cameras and other sensors to assist in facial recognition;
   •   a gyroscope, accelerometer, or pedometer for gait-based authentication; and
