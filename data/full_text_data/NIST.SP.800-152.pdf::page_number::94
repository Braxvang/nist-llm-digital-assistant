SP 800-152                                               A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


                         g) The latest system patches are installed,
                         h) The latest malware-detection software is installed,
                         i) The appropriate file system, directory and register
                             settings have been determined and properly configured,
                         j) The appropriate security-relevant information to be
                             logged has been determined and properly configured,
                         k) The required amount of physical security has been
                             determined and implemented,
                         l) Default passwords and keys have been replaced with
                             strong passwords and randomly generated keys,
                             respectively, especially for administrator accounts,
                         m) Unnecessary usernames and passwords have been
                             removed, including those associated with users no
                             longer authorized to use the system, and
                         n) Users and access privileges have been limited to those
                            needed for essential operations.
               SI-7     A Federal CKMS shall maintain software integrity.
PR:8.3

              CM-7      A Federal CKMS shall protect access to sensitive keys and
PR:8.4
                        metadata by non-validated software.
               SI-6     The software for Moderate and High impact-level systems
PR:8.5
                        shall be implemented with an integrity mechanism, and the
                        integrity of the software shall be verified during system
                        startup.
              SC-2      For Moderate and High impact-level systems, a Federal
PR:8.6
              SC-3      CKMS shall use trusted operating systems that separate
                        sensitive user applications and their data from each other.
             AC-3 (2)   For High impact-level systems, a Federal CKMS shall
PR:8.7
                        provide multiparty control of those system functions that are
                        considered by the FCKMS management authorities to be
                        most critical to the security provided by the FCKMS.

               SI-6     The software for Low impact-level systems should be
PA:8.2
                        implemented with an integrity mechanism, and the integrity
                        of the software should be verified during system startup.

              SC-2      For Low impact-level systems, a Federal CKMS could use
PF:8.1
              SC-3      trusted operating systems that separate sensitive user
                        applications from each other and from the operating system.
