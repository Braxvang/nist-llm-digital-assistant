MP-4      MEDIA STORAGE

          Control: The organization physically controls and securely stores information system media within
          controlled areas.
          Supplemental Guidance: Information system media includes both digital media (e.g., diskettes,
          magnetic tapes, external/removable hard drives, flash/thumb drives, compact disks, digital video
          disks) and non-digital media (e.g., paper, microfilm). A controlled area is any area or space for
          which the organization has confidence that the physical and procedural protections provided are
          sufficient to meet the requirements established for protecting the information and/or information
          system. This control applies to portable and mobile computing and communications devices with
          information storage capability (e.g., notebook computers, personal digital assistants, cellular
          telephones). Telephone systems are also considered information systems and may have the
          capability to store information on internal media (e.g., on voicemail systems). Since telephone
          systems do not have, in most cases, the identification, authentication, and access control
          mechanisms typically employed in other information systems, organizational personnel exercise
          extreme caution in the types of information stored on telephone voicemail systems.
          An organizational assessment of risk guides the selection of media and associated information
          contained on that media requiring physical protection. Organizations document in policy and
          procedures, the media requiring physical protection and the specific measures taken to afford such
          protection. The rigor with which this control is applied is commensurate with the FIPS 199
          security categorization of the information contained on the media. For example, fewer protection
          measures are needed for media containing information determined by the organization to be in the
          public domain, to be publicly releasable, or to have limited or no adverse impact on the
          organization or individuals if accessed by other than authorized personnel. In these situations, it is
          assumed that the physical access controls to the facility where the media resides provide adequate
          protection. The organization protects information system media identified by the organization
          until the media are destroyed or sanitized using approved equipment, techniques, and procedures.
          As part of a defense-in-depth protection strategy, the organization considers routinely encrypting
          information at rest on selected secondary storage devices. FIPS 199 security categorization guides
          the selection of appropriate candidates for secondary storage encryption. The organization
          implements effective cryptographic key management in support of secondary storage encryption
          and provides protections to maintain the availability of the information in the event of the loss of
          cryptographic keys by users. NIST Special Publications 800-56 and 800-57 provide guidance on
          cryptographic key establishment and cryptographic key management. Related security controls:
          CP-9, RA-2.
          Control Enhancements: None.
