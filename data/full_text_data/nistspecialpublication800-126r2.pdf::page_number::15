                 The Technical Specification for the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.2



Products and source content may want to claim conformance to one or more of the SCAP use cases,
which are defined in Section 5 of this document, for a variety of reasons. For example, a product may
want to assert that it uses SCAP content properly and can interoperate with other products using valid
SCAP content. Another example is a policy mandating that an organization use SCAP source content for
performing vulnerability assessments and other security operations.
This section provides the high-level requirements that a product or source content must meet for
conformance with the SCAP 1.2 specification. Such products and source content are referred to as SCAP
conformant. Most of the requirements listed in this section reference other sections in the document that
fully define the requirements.
If requirements are in conflict between component specifications, this document will provide clarification.
If a component specification is in conflict with this document, the requirements in this document SHALL
take precedence. If requirements are in conflict between this document and the errata for this document,
the errata SHALL take precedence.

2.1     Product Conformance
There are two types of SCAP-conformant products: content producers and content consumers. Content
producers are products that generate SCAP source data stream content, while content consumers are
products that accept existing SCAP source data stream content, process it, and produce SCAP result data
streams. Products claiming conformance with the SCAP 1.2 specification SHALL comply with the
following requirements:
      1. Adhere to the requirements detailed in each applicable component specification (for each selected
         SCAP component specification, and for each SCAP component specification required to
         implement the selected SCAP use cases). The authoritative references for each specification are
         listed in Appendix C.
      2. Adhere to the requirements detailed in the errata for this document [ERRATA].
      3. For content producers, generate well-formed SCAP source data streams. This includes following
         the source content conformance requirements specified in Section 2.2, and following the
         requirements in Section 5 for the use cases that the content producer supports.
      4. For content consumers, consume and process well-formed SCAP source data streams, and
         generate well-formed SCAP result data streams. This includes following all of the processing
         requirements defined in Section 4 for each selected SCAP component specification and each
         SCAP component specification required to implement the selected SCAP use cases.
      5. Make an explicit claim of conformance to this specification in any documentation provided to end
         users.

2.2     Source Content Conformance
Source content (i.e., source data streams) claiming conformance with the SCAP 1.2 specification SHALL
comply with the following requirements:
      1. Adhere to the requirements detailed in each applicable component specification (for each selected
         SCAP component specification, and each SCAP component specification required to implement
         the selected SCAP use cases). The authoritative references for each specification are listed in
         Appendix C.
      2. Adhere to the requirements detailed in the errata for this document [ERRATA].
      3. Follow all of the syntax, structural, and other source content design requirements defined in
         Section 3 for each selected SCAP component specification and for each SCAP component
