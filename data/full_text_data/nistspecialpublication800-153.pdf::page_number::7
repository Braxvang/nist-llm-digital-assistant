technologies for their WLAN client devices and determine how those risks should be mitigated. If one or
more of the networks cannot have its risk mitigated to an acceptable level, then dual connections
involving that network may pose too much risk to the organization and may need to be prohibited.

Ensure that the organization’s WLAN client devices and APs have configurations at all times that
are compliant with the organization’s WLAN policies.

After designing WLAN security configurations for client devices and APs, an organization should
determine how the configurations will be implemented, evaluate the effectiveness of the implementations,
deploy the implementations to the appropriate devices, and maintain the configurations and their
implementations throughout the devices’ lifecycles. Organizations should standardize, automate, and
centralize as much of their WLAN security configuration implementation and maintenance as practical.
This allows organizations to implement consistent WLAN security throughout the enterprise, to detect
and correct unauthorized changes to configurations, and to react quickly when newly identified
vulnerabilities or recent incidents indicate a need to change the WLAN’s security configuration.

Perform both attack monitoring and vulnerability monitoring to support WLAN security.

Security monitoring is important for all systems and networks, but it is generally even more important for
WLANs because of the increased risks that they face. Organizations should continuously monitor their
WLANs for both WLAN-specific and general (wired network) attacks. Organizations should do largely
the same vulnerability monitoring for WLAN components that they do for any other software: identifying
patches and applying them, and verifying security configuration settings and adjusting them as needed.
These actions should be performed at least as often for WLAN components as they are for the
organization’s equivalent wired systems.

Conduct regular periodic technical security assessments for the organization’s WLANs.

These assessments should be performed at least annually to evaluate the overall security of the WLAN. In
addition, organizations should perform periodic assessments at least quarterly unless continuous
monitoring of WLAN security is already collecting all of the necessary information about WLAN attacks
and vulnerabilities needed for assessment purposes.
