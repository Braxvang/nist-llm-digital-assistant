SP 800-152                                                   A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


                           functions and services for the key-management services that
                           they require.
                            A Federal CKMS should support control interfaces (as
PA:3.3
                           needed) that support the Federal CKMS roles and assure that:
                             a) It is intuitive to initiate and perform all supported key-
                                management service-control interactions with the
                                FCKMS (e.g., to select and invoke a key-management
                                function);
                             b) It is difficult to make an error or cause a security breach
                                when initiating or interacting with an FCKMS service;
                                and
                             c) It is easy to recover from an FCKMS service initiation
                                or control error.

                           A Federal CKMS could support the same interfaces as used
PF:3.3
                           by other Federal CKMSs.

3.5   Performance and Scalability

Performance and scalability should be considered when designing a CKMS. The
performance of an FCKMS will generally depend on factors that include 1) the simplicity of
the overall design, 2) the number and type of service-using organizations, 3) the sensitive
applications and number of users being supported, 4) the communications capabilities and
geographical distribution among the distributed devices of the FCKMS, and 5) the
capabilities of the computers, modules, and devices comprising it. The scalability of an
FCKMS depends on such factors as the flexibility of the underlying CKMS design and
implementation to support increasing service demands, and the ability to replace or upgrade
its devices and components as necessary.

FR:3.14 The CKMS design shall specify the performance characteristics of the CKMS,
including the average and peak workloads that can be handled for the types of functions and
transactions implemented, and the response times for the types of functions and transactions
under those respective workloads.

FR:3.15 The CKMS design shall specify the techniques that are supported and can be used
to scale the system to increased workload demands.

FR:3.16 The CKMS design shall specify the extent to which the CKMS can be scaled to
meet increased workload demands. This shall be expressed in terms of additional workload,
response times for the workload, and cost.

                           A Federal CKMS shall be scalable to support increasing
PR:3.3
                           numbers of FCKMS users and their computers,
                           communications, and sensitive applications.
