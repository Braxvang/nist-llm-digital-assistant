   RFC 4055 supplements RFC 3279, by describing the conventions for using the RSA-
   PSS signature algorithm, and the RSA-OAEP key transport algorithm.

14. [RFC 4251]
    The Secure Shell (SSH) protocol Architecture, http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4251.txt.
    RFC 4251 specifies a protocol for secure remote login and other secure network
    services over an insecure network. This document describes the architecture of the
    SSH protocol, as well as the notation and terminology used in SSH protocol
    documents. It also discusses the SSH algorithm naming system that allows local
    extensions. The SSH protocol consists of three major components: The Transport
    Layer Protocol provides server authentication, confidentiality, and integrity with
    perfect forward secrecy; the User Authentication Protocol authenticates the client to
    the server; and the Connection Protocol multiplexes the encrypted tunnel into several
    logical channels. Details of these protocols are described in separate documents.

15. [RFC 6402]
    Certificate Management over CMS (CMC), http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5272.txt.
    Formerly published as RFC 5272, RFC 6402 is a protocol standard for using
    certificate management services, such as enrollment, rekey, and revocation using
    PKCS #10 or the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS).

16. [RFC 5273]
    Certificate Management over CMS (CMC): Transport Protocols,
    http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5273.txt.
    RFC 5273 defines a number of transport mechanisms that are used to move CMC
    (Certificate Management over CMS (Cryptographic Message Syntax)) messages. The
    transport mechanisms described are: HTTP, file, mail, and TCP.

17. [RFC 5274]
    Certificate Management Messages over CMS (CMC): Compliance Requirements,
    http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5274.txt.
    RFC 5274 provides a set of compliance statements about the CMC (Certificate
    Management over CMS) enrollment protocol.

18. [RFC 5280]
    Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List
    (CRL) Profile, http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5280.txt.
    RFC 5280 defines the formats for X.509 public key certificates and the corresponding
    CRLs. This RFC also defines the certificates, the certification paths, and the CRL
    processing rules.

19. [RFC 5295]
    Specification for the Derivation of Root Keys from an Extended Master Session Key
    (EMSK), http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5295.txt.
