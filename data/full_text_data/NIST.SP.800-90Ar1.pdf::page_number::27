8.6.1        Seed Construction for Instantiation

Figure 5 depicts the seed-construction
process for instantiation. The seed material
used to determine a seed for instantiation
consists of entropy input from a randomness
source, a nonce and an optional (but
recommended) personalization string.
Entropy input shall always be used in the
construction of a seed; requirements for the
entropy input are discussed in Section 8.6.3.
Except for the case noted below, a nonce
shall be used; requirements for the nonce
are discussed in Section 8.6.7. A
                                                   Figure 5: Seed Construction for Instantiation
personalization string should also be used;
requirements for the personalization string are discussed in Section 8.7.1.
Depending on the DRBG mechanism and the randomness source, a derivation function may be
required to derive a seed from the seed material. However, in certain circumstances, the
CTR_DRBG mechanism based on block cipher algorithms (see Section 10.2) may be
implemented without a derivation function. When implemented in this manner, a (separate)
nonce (as shown in Figure 5) is not used. Note, however, that the personalization string could
contain a nonce, if desired.
8.6.2        Seed Construction for
             Reseeding

Figure 6 depicts the seed construction process
for reseeding an instantiation. The seed
material for reseeding consists of a value that is
carried in the internal state3, new entropy input
and, optionally, additional input. The internal
state value and the entropy input are required;
requirements for the entropy input are
discussed in Section 8.6.3. Requirements for
                                                     Figure 6: Seed Construction for Reseeding
the additional input are discussed in Section
8.7.2. As in Section 8.6.1, a derivation function may be required for reseeding.

8.6.3        Entropy Requirements for the Entropy Input

The entropy input shall have entropy that is equal to or greater than the security strength of the
instantiation. Additional entropy may be provided in the nonce or the optional personalization
string during instantiation, or in the additional input during reseeding and generation, but this is
not required and does not increase the “official” security strength of the DRBG instantiation that
is recorded in the internal state. The use of more entropy than the minimum value will offer a
