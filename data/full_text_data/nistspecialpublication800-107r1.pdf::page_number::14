function and key sizes specified in FIPS 186-3 3, then the security strength of this digital
signature is less than 80 bits (see Table 1 in Section 4.2); i.e., the strength of the digital
signature process is determined by the strength of SHA-1, rather than the strength of the
key, in this case. Therefore, SHA-1 shall not be used in any new digital signature
applications that require at least 80 bits of security strength. Furthermore, SHA-1 shall
not be used for the generation of digital signatures after the end of 2013 (see SP 800-
131A [SP 800-131A] for information about the required key lengths for digital signature
applications). More information on the security strengths of digital signature applications
using the approved hash algorithms and the recommended lifetimes of cryptographic
algorithm usage can be found in SP 800-57, Part 1.
There are several ways to use hash functions with digital signature algorithms as
described below.

5.2.1 Full-length Message Digests
When the untruncated output of an approved hash function (as specified in FIPS 180-4) is
used by an approved digital signature algorithm (as specified in FIPS 186-3), the
resulting full-length message digests can support security strengths up to those given in
Table 1 of Section 4.2 (for collision resistance).

5.2.2 Truncated Message Digests
In some specific situations, truncated message digests are used in generating digital
signatures. (Details about these situations, including the lengths required for the truncated
hash values, can be found in FIPS 186-3.) In such cases, the security strength that can be
supported by a hash function depends on the length of these truncated values, as well as
the particular hash function that is used.
As noted in Section 5.1, when the outputs of an approved L-bit hash function are
truncated to 位 bits (where 位 < L), the collision resistance strength supported by the
truncated message digests is reduced to 位 /2 bits. Therefore, in addition to the
requirements/restrictions imposed by FIPS 186-3, the value of 位 shall be at least twice the
desired security strength (in bits) required for the digital signature.
For example, if a security strength of 112 bits is required for digital signatures, a
(truncated) message digest of (at least) 224 bits must be used. If required/desired, any
approved hash functions except SHA-1 could be employed to generate (truncated)
message digests of exactly 224 bits in length. (For SHA-224 and SHA-512/224, the hash
function's output would not require truncation.) It is recommended that the hash function
chosen should minimize the number of truncation operations required to achieve the
required/desired length for the hash value. For the 224-bit example above, SHA-512/224
should be chosen over SHA-384 and SHA-512/256. All three hash functions employ one
(internal) truncation operation to produce their output, but SHA-384 and SHA-512/256
would each require an additional (external) truncation operation to pare their output down
to the desired length of 224 bits.
