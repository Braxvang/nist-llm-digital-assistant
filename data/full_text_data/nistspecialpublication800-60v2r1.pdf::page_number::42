communications that contain budget information (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may
adversely affect operations or public confidence in the agency, but the damage to the mission
would usually be limited. Public confidence consequences will be more serious for agencies that
have national defense, intelligence, or information security missions. In such cases, the impact
may be at least moderate.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
budget formulation information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the budget formulation information.

Although some budget formulation information is time-critical, the budget formulation processes
are usually tolerant of delays. Excessive recovery delays may result in loss of funding.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
budget formulation information is low.
C.2.3.2 Capital Planning Information Type

Capital Planning involves the processes for ensuring that appropriate investments are selected for
capital expenditures. The recommended provisional security categorization for capital planning
information is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of capital planning
information on the ability of responsible agencies to ensure that appropriate investments are
selected for capital expenditures. The effects of loss of confidentiality of capital investment
plans during the formative stage can result in attempts by affected entities and other interested
parties to influence and/or impede the policy and guideline development process. Premature
public release of draft plans before internal coordination and review can result in unnecessary
damage to public confidence in the agency. This is particularly likely where the release includes
unedited internal commentary and discussion. The diversion of investment funds that can result
from compromise of draft plans can pervert investment priorities in a manner that is prejudicial
to public interest. However, the consequence of loss of confidentiality of most capital planning
information is likely to do only limited harm to government assets, personnel, or missions.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized disclosure of some of
the background information that supports development of capital investment plans can reveal
sensitive vulnerabilities, capabilities, or methods of anti-terrorism, law enforcement, or national
security activities. Depending on the information in question, the confidentiality impact can be
moderate, high, or involve national security information (outside the scope of this guideline).
Also, some capital investment plans of some Federal agencies contain national security
information.
