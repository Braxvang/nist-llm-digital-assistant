GUIDE TO INTRUSION DETECTION AND PREVENTION SYSTEMS (IDPS)



 Test lab or real-world environment testing of selected IDPS products
 Previous real-world experience with IDPSs from individuals within the organization and trusted
  individuals at other organizations
 Vendor-provided information, such as product manuals and datasheets, whitepapers, product
  demonstrations, and discussions with vendor employees
 Third-party product reviews, including reviews of individual products and comparisons of multiple
  products.
Section 9.6.1describes the challenges in performing IDPS product testing as part of an evaluation.
Section 9.6.2 presents recommendations for using the data sources described above when conducting an
evaluation.

9.6.1     IDPS Testing Challenges

An organization performing its own in-depth hands-on testing of IDPS products ideally could generate
comprehensive data on the products that would accurately reflect how well-suited each product is to
meeting the organization’s needs. However, this is generally not feasible to achieve because of how
difficult and resource-intensive it is to perform IDPS testing well. The following are some of the major
reasons for these problems: 55

 Test Methodology. There is no standard methodology for performing IDPS testing. Also, details are
  not available for most of the methodologies used for commercial evaluation of IDPS products.
  Organizations performing IDPS testing need to create their own methodologies or perform a survey
  of existing methodologies, determine which would be best for their needs, and then design and
  implement testing processes using the selected methodology. Also, a different methodology,
  including test environments and test suites, is needed for each type of IDPS technology.
 Multiple Environments. Organizations performing IDPS testing should conduct it in both real-
  world and lab environments. The real-world testing helps evaluators to understand how well the
  product will likely function in their environment. The lab testing allows evaluators to better assess
  the detection and prevention capabilities of the product. Detection results can be difficult to
  understand when real-world activity is being monitored because the real-world activity is likely to
  contain different types of malicious activity, and it is sometimes unclear whether or not the detected
  activity was actually malicious. Prevention capabilities are generally not tested in real-world
  environments because they can easily cause disruptions to benign activity. It is very difficult to
  duplicate real-world environments in lab environments, so organizations performing IDPS testing
  generally need to do their testing separately in each environment.
 Test Availability. There are no standard IDPS test suites available. Organizations performing IDPS
  testing need to find ways to generate both malicious activity (to see how well the products identify
  them) and benign activity (to put the product under normal or heavy loads). The malicious activity
  should accurately reflect the composition of recent threats against the organization’s systems and
  networks; accordingly, it can take considerable time to identify those threats and acquire tests for
  them. The tests also need to take into account all detection methodologies used by the IDPSs,
  because usually different types of tests are needed to properly evaluate the effectiveness of each

     For more information on the challenges of IDPS testing, see NIST Interagency Report (IR) 7007, An Overview of Issues in
     Testing Intrusion Detection Systems. It is available at http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistir/nistir-7007.pdf. Although it is
     focused primarily on testing network-based IDPSs, most of the testing problems it discusses are applicable to testing any
     type of IDPS technology.
