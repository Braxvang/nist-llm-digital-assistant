Appendix B. Example of mSCP Usage by a Security Professional
This appendix provides examples of how a security professional might use mSCP content.
People in other roles might perform some of the same actions. The examples illustrated below
were accurate at the time of publication, but see the mSCP wiki for up-to-date usage guidance.
Note that the mSCP scripts are not meant to replace enterprise-class configuration and
management tools. Configurations should be tested on development systems before being
deployed on end usersâ€™ systems.
Preparing to use mSCP
All project components are available from the mSCP GitHub page [1] by navigating to
Releases and downloading the latest source code revision for the desired macOS version.
Alternatively, the project source code can be downloaded via git, as the example below
illustrates.

mSCP components rely on prerequisite software listed on the Getting Started page, and any
missing software must be installed.
Changing code branches and generating a baseline
After obtaining a copy of the source code, change the directory to the mSCP git folder,
macos_security.

Next, select the appropriate code branch that corresponds to the target OS version. Then choose a
baseline and use the generate_baseline.py script to create a baseline YAML file. The
