Special Publication 800-79-2                            Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card Issuers
                                                                         and Derived PIV Credential Issuers



functions in accordance with FIPS 201-2. An authorization decision granted under [SP 800-37-1]
signifies that an organization official accepts responsibility for the security (in terms of
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information) of the information system.
Authorization of an issuer’s reliability under SP 800-79-2 indicates that the organization official
asserts that the issuer meets the control objectives and has the ability to operate within the
objectives outlined in [HSPD-12] for “secure and reliable forms of identification” within an
acceptable level of risk. However in both cases, the organization official (Authorizing Official
(AO) in the case of [SP 800-37-1], and DAO in the case of SP 800-79-2) is fully accountable for
any adverse impacts to the organization if a breach in security, privacy, or policy occurs.

SP 800-79-2 focuses on the authorization of an organization’s capability and reliability, but
depends on adequate security for all the supporting information systems that have been
authorized under [SP 800-37-1]. Therefore, before the organization official authorizes the issuer
and its facilities, all relevant PCI or DPCI information systems used must be authorized.

In many cases, authorization under [SP 800-37-1] will be granted by an organization official
different than the official responsible for authorizing the issuer. The former is an organization
official tasked with making a decision on whether to authorize operation of an information
system based on its security posture. The latter must be someone designated specifically for
authorizing the operation of an issuer after it has been assessed and determined to be compliant
with FIPS 201-2 control objectives.

2.8 Preparing for the Assessment of an Issuer

To facilitate an assessment of an issuer in a timely, efficient, and thorough manner, it is essential
that the staff of the issuer and members of the Assessment team understand their specific roles
and responsibilities, and participate as needed. The issuer, its facility personnel, and the team
responsible for performing the assessment must cooperate and collaborate to ensure the success
of the assessment. Specific responsibilities of the assessment team are listed below.

2.8.1 Issuer Duties
Before the assessment can begin, an Assessor must be designated. The Assessor conducts the
assessment and oversees the assessment team. The assessment team may be made up of
employees from the organization or personnel provided by a public or private sector entity
contracted to provide services. Members of the assessment team should have various capabilities
that are required to perform the activities specified in this document. Assessment team members
should work together to prepare for, conduct, and document the findings of the assessment
within the authorization boundary. Each team must be made up of individuals that collectively
have the knowledge, skills, training and abilities to conduct, evaluate, and document
assessments, including those performed on the information systems being used by the issuer.
Once an assessment team is in place, the OIMO and other relevant personnel should begin the
preparation for the assessment. Thorough preparations by both the issuer organization and the
assessment team are important aspects of conducting an effective assessment. The issuer sets the
stage for the assessment by identifying all appropriate personnel and making them available
during the assessment. A fundamental requirement for authorization is interviews by the
assessment team of all issuer personnel. Personnel and officials must be notified of the pending
