GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



the implementing organization may need to obtain a license to use a particular desired frequency. Table
2-2 in Section 2.3.1.3 lists potential sources of interference on common RFID frequencies.

Ideally, an RF site survey will be performed before an RFID system is installed to determine what
frequencies are already in use. After the RFID system is installed, site surveys can be conducted to
determine if the RF characteristics of the site have changed (e.g., new sources of interference).

Applicability: All implementations whose radio frequency is not determined by other application
requirements. Organizations that implement a closed RFID system have more freedom to select an
operating frequency because they do not have to interoperate with other organizations. However, if tags
are based on a particular air interface standard, the range of potential frequencies will be limited to those
supported by the standard.

Benefits: Radio frequency selection permits the avoidance of RF interference with other radio systems
that could disrupt the RFID system or other technologies. A particular frequency might be desirable
because of radio interference on other frequency bands. Some frequencies also have desirable
propagation characteristics, such as the ability to penetrate certain materials.

Weaknesses:

 It may be difficult to identify sources of interference. For example, bug zappers have been found to
  create interference in passive RFID trials. 61 Interference can be caused by poorly grounded motors,
  noisy relays, old fluorescent light ballasts, and other devices that generate unintended RF noise in
  nearby environments. Each RFID technology deployment should be tested in its intended
  environment prior to production use to identify these sources of interference.
 New sources of interference can be later introduced at the site.
 When implementing an inter-enterprise RFID system, all organizations involved in the system will
  have to agree on a tag type that supports all the frequencies that the organizations collectively intend
  to use.
5.3.2.5 Adjustment of Transmission Characteristics Other than Frequency

Control: Operators adjust the level of transmitted RF energy from a reader or active tag. The use of
particular antenna types and configurations can also determine the direction of transmitted RF energy.
Additionally, the duty cycle of a reader can be controlled.

Applicability: All applications for which eavesdropping, radio interference, or hazards of
electromagnetic radiation are a concern.

Benefits: Reducing transmitted power can:

 Reduce the likelihood that an adversary can intercept communication,
 Limit radio interference with other legitimate radios, and
 Lessen hazards of electromagnetic radiation.
