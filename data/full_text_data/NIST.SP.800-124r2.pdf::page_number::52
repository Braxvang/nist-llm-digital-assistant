NIST SP 800-124r2                                                   Guidelines for Managing the Security

managed via global passphrases for connection to the enterprise WiFi network. Mobile devices
with WiFi network access can then reach any of the services on the enterprise network, meaning
that when a device is connected to the WiFi network, it can access everything on the typical
enterprise network.

5.3.3. Set Policy, Device Configuration, and Provision
In certain deployment models, mobile devices should be properly set up before they can be
provided to enterprise users. IT-focused and business-focused decision makers should work
together to define an acceptable mobile device usage policy for these devices. The usage policy
should address the standard security protections to be applied to all enterprise mobile devices and
specify the permissions and special configurations that apply to users with different
organizational roles. Devices can then be properly configured and provisioned to enforce the
chosen policy. For organizations with a less stringent stance on device usage, such as BYOD,
users should be made aware of the mobile device usage policy and signal their acknowledgement
of the policy.

5.3.4. Define EMM Policy
An EMM policy is a set of rules that defines what a user is allowed (or not allowed) to do on
their mobile device and the mobile device configuration requirements. EMM policies are put in
place to assist in securing enterprise data within the mobile device. To do so, the enterprise must
understand the types of data that the user handles (e.g., sensitive data), the risk factors, and the
proper way to protect that data from accidental or intentional threats. Upon understanding these
key factors, the enterprise then documents the EMM policy and applies the policy configurations
within the EMM.
These policies may vary per user or device since a particular user group or role within the
enterprise may have different permissions to adequately perform their duties. If the EMM policy
is not well defined, the user permissions may not accurately reflect the policy requirements, and
a user may be given too much or too little access to enterprise data. This could negatively impact
an employeeâ€™s ability to accomplish their work or allow the employee unauthorized access to
enterprise information. Some examples of elements to include in an EMM policy are password
requirements, device encryption, VPN requirements, and geofencing.

5.3.4.1.       Consider Personal Account Usage
One of the primary means of communication within an enterprise is email. While most
businesses provide work email accounts to their employees, others might allow an employee to
use a personal email account to handle business communication. Email may be used for general
communication between employees, account establishment, password initiation/reset, the sharing
of sensitive information, and enterprise alerts/notifications.
Using personal email accounts leaves the enterprise without security control over the personal
email accounts and the enterprise information that may be stored therein. Similar issues also
arise with other cloud-based services (e.g., cloud-based storage and sharing of documents).
Without this control, sensitive enterprise information could be transferred to unauthorized
