SP 800-130                                                              August 2013



Each entity participating in a key agreement process typically needs assurance as to the
identity of the other entity. This assurance is often provided by the key agreement
protocol.

FR: 6.83 The CKMS design shall specify each key agreement scheme supported by the
CKMS.

FR: 6.84 The CKMS design shall specify how each entity participating in a key
agreement is authenticated.

6.6.3 Key Confirmation
When keys are established between two entities, each entity may wish to have
confirmation that the other entity did, in fact, establish the correct key. Key confirmation
schemes are used to provide this capability. [SP 800-56A] and [SP 800-56B] specify key
confirmation schemes for use in Federal CKMS. Other methods may also be appropriate.

FR: 6.85 The CKMS design shall specify each key confirmation method used to confirm
that the correct key was established with the other entity.

FR: 6.86 The CKMS design shall specify the circumstances under which each key
confirmation is performed.

6.6.4 Key Establishment Protocols
Several automated protocols have been developed for the provision of cryptographic keys
for both storage and transmission. Often, these protocols are designed for a particular
application or set of applications. Some well-known key establishment protocols include:
       a) Internet Key Exchange (IKE)
       b) Transport Layer Security (TLS)
       c) Secure/Multipart Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME)
       d) Kerberos
       e) Over-The-Air-Rekeying (OTAR) Key Management Messages
       f) Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC)
       g) Secure Shell (SSH)

A high-level overview of items a) through f) can be found in [SP 800-57-part3], along
with guidance as to which cryptographic options are recommended for U.S. Government
use. For Secure Shell information, see [RFC 4251].

FR: 6.87 The CKMS design shall specify all the protocols that are employed by the
CKMS for key establishment and storage purposes.

6.7 Restricting Access to Key and Metadata Management Functions
This section describes how access to the key and metadata management functions may be
controlled. The requesting entity may be authenticated, and human exposure to keys and
other sensitive metadata may be prevented or severely restricted.
