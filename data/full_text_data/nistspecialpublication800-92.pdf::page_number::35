3.4      Security Information and Event Management Software

Security information and event management (SIEM) software34 is a relatively new type of centralized
logging software compared to syslog. 35 SIEM products have one or more log servers that perform log
analysis, and one or more database servers that store the logs.36 Most SIEM products support two ways of
collecting logs from log generators:

       Agentless. The SIEM server receives data from the individual log generating hosts without
        needing to have any special software installed on those hosts. Some servers pull logs from the
        hosts, which is usually done by having the server authenticate to each host and retrieve its logs
        regularly. In other cases, the hosts push their logs to the server, which usually involves each host
        authenticating to the server and transferring its logs regularly. Regardless of whether the logs are
        pushed or pulled, the server then performs event filtering and aggregation and log normalization
        and analysis on the collected logs.
       Agent-Based. An agent program is installed on the log generating host to perform event filtering
        and aggregation and log normalization for a particular type of log, then transmit the normalized
        log data to an SIEM server, usually on a real-time or near-real-time basis for analysis and storage.
        If a host has multiple types of logs of interest, then it might be necessary to install multiple
        agents. Some SIEM products also offer agents for generic formats such as syslog and SNMP. A
        generic agent is used primarily to get log data from a source for which a format-specific agent
        and an agentless method are not available. Some products also allow administrators to create
        custom agents to handle unsupported log sources.
There are advantages and disadvantages to each method. The primary advantage of the agentless
approach is that agents do not need to be installed, configured, and maintained on each logging host. The
primary disadvantage is the lack of filtering and aggregation at the individual host level, which can cause
significantly larger amounts of data to be transferred over networks and increase the amount of time it
takes to filter and analyze the logs. Another potential disadvantage of the agentless method is that the
SIEM server may need credentials for authenticating to each logging host. In some cases, only one of the
two methods is feasible; for example, there might be no way to remotely collect logs from a particular
host without installing an agent onto it.

SIEM products usually include support for several dozen types of log sources, such as OSs, security
software, application servers (e.g., Web servers, e-mail servers), and even physical security control
devices such as badge readers. For each supported log source type, except for generic formats such as
syslog, the SIEM products typically know how to categorize the most important logged fields (e.g., the
value in field 12 of application XYZâ€™s logs signifies the source IP address). This significantly improves
the normalization, analysis, and correlation of log data over that performed by software with a less
granular understanding of specific log sources and formats. Also, the SIEM software can perform event

      Other terms commonly used for SIEM-like products are security event management (SEM) and security information
      management (SIM). This publication uses the term SIEM because it is generally considered to have a broader meaning than
      the other terms. At one time, many products were either SEM-specific (generally focusing on incident response) or SIM-
      specific (generally focusing on auditing). Most current products perform both some SEM and some SIM functions, so the
      SIEM term is better-suited for them. The use of the term SIEM in this publication is not meant to be definitive, but rather to
      simply provide a basis for subsequent discussions in the publication.
35
      Another type of logging software is known as log management software. Although some of these products have similar
      functionality to SIEM products, they are typically intended to handle a wide range of log entries, and are not focused on the
      analysis of security-related log entries. As a result, a discussion of such products is outside the scope of this guide.
      However, this is not meant to imply that such products cannot be used for computer security log management.

      Nearly all available SIEM products are commercial.
