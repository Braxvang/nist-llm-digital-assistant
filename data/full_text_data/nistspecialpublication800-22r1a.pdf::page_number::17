A STATISTICAL TEST SUITE FOR RANDOM AND PSEUDORANDOM NUMBER GENERATORS FOR CRYPTOGRAPHIC APPLICATIONS



1.1.6    Considerations for Randomness, Unpredictability and Testing

The following assumptions are made with respect to random binary sequences to be tested:

         1.      Uniformity: At any point in the generation of a sequence of random or pseudorandom
                 bits, the occurrence of a zero or one is equally likely, i.e., the probability of each is
                 exactly 1/2. The expected number of zeros (or ones) is n/2, where n = the sequence
                 length.

         2.      Scalability: Any test applicable to a sequence can also be applied to subsequences
                 extracted at random. If a sequence is random, then any such extracted subsequence
                 should also be random. Hence, any extracted subsequence should pass any test for
                 randomness.

         3.      Consistency: The behavior of a generator must be consistent across starting values
                 (seeds). It is inadequate to test a PRNG based on the output from a single seed, or an
                 RNG on the basis of an output produced from a single physical output.

1.2     Definitions

         Term                  Definition
Asymptotic Analysis            A statistical technique that derives limiting approximations for functions
                               of interest.
Asymptotic Distribution        The limiting distribution of a test statistic arising when n approaches
                               infinity.
Bernoulli Random               A random variable that takes on the value of one with probability p and the
Variable                       value of zero with probability 1-p.
Binary Sequence                A sequence of zeroes and ones.
Binomial Distribution          A random variable is binomially distributed if there is an integer n and a
                               probability p such that the random variable is the number of successes in n
                               independent Bernoulli experiments, where the probability of success in a
                               single experiment is p. In a Bernoulli experiment, there are only two
                               possible outcomes.
Bit String                     A sequence of bits.
Block                          A subset of a bit string. A block has a predetermined length.
Central Limit Theorem          For a random sample of size n from a population with mean µ and
                               variance σ2, the distribution of the sample means is approximately normal
                               with mean µ and variance σ2/n as the sample size increases.
Complementary Error            See Erfc.
Function
Confluent Hypergeometric       The confluent hypergeometric function is defined as
Function                                       Γ(b)        1 zt a−1
                               Φ(a;b;z) =
                                            Γ(a)Γ(b − a)
                                                         ∫ 0
                                                             e t (1− t) b−a−1 dt,0 < a < b .
Critical Value                 The value that is exceeded by the test statistic with a small probability
                               (significance level). A "look-up" or calculated value of a test statistic (i.e.,
                               a test statistic value) that, by construction, has a small probability of
                   €           occurring (e.g., 5 %) when the null hypothesis of randomness is true.
Cumulative Distribution        A function giving the probability that the random variable X is less than or
Function (CDF) F(x)            equal to x, for every value x. That is,
                               F(x) = P(X ≤ x).
