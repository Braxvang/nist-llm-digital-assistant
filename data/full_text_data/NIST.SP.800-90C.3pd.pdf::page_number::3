     NIST SP 800-90C 3pd (Third Public Draft)                                     Recommendation for RBG Constructions
     September 2022


36   Certain commercial entities, equipment, or materials may be identified in this document in order to describe an
37   experimental procedure or concept adequately. Such identification is not intended to imply recommendation or
38   endorsement by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), nor is it intended to imply that the entities,
39   materials, or equipment are necessarily the best available for the purpose.

40   There may be references in this publication to other publications currently under development by NIST in accordance
41   with its assigned statutory responsibilities. The information in this publication, including concepts and methodologies,
42   may be used by federal agencies even before the completion of such companion publications. Thus, until each
43   publication is completed, current requirements, guidelines, and procedures, where they exist, remain operative. For
44   planning and transition purposes, federal agencies may wish to closely follow the development of these new
45   publications by NIST.

46   Organizations are encouraged to review all draft publications during public comment periods and provide feedback to
47   NIST. Many NIST cybersecurity publications, other than the ones noted above, are available at
