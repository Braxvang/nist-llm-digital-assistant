SP 800-130                                                               August 2013



   c) Rootkit detection and prevention software that protects CKMS devices from
      rootkit malware that changes the configuration setting of the operating system in
      order to replace system code and hide processes and files, including the rootkit
      code itself, from anti-virus and anti-spyware software.
The integrity of operating system and CKMS application software should be checked
upon installation and periodically thereafter. Examples of software integrity verification
upon installation include the chain of custody for the software and the verification of
integrity codes (e.g., hash values, message authentication codes, and digital signatures)
used to assure that the software has not been modified. Examples of periodic verification
include the daily verification of hash values, message authentication codes, digital
signatures, and modification dates on the installed software, etc.
In order to be effective, malware protection should be configured to perform the
following:
   a) A daily scan of installed software,
   b) A scan of removable media when first introduced into the CKMS,
   c) A scan of newly installed software and data files,
   d) A weekly update of the malware protection software, and
   e) A weekly update of the malware signature database.


FR:8.8 The CKMS design shall specify the following malware protection capabilities for
CKMS devices:
   a) Anti-virus protection software, including the specified time periods and events
      that trigger anti-virus scans, software update, and virus signature database
      updates;
   b) Anti-spyware protection software, including the specified time periods and events
      that trigger anti-spyware scans, software update, and virus signature updates; and
   c) Rootkit detection and protection software, including the specified time periods
      and events that trigger rootkit detection, software update, and signature updates.

FR:8.9 The CKMS design shall specify the following software integrity check
information for operating system and CKMS application software:
    a) If software integrity is verified upon installation, indicate how the verification is
       performed; and
    b) If software integrity is verified periodically, indicate how often the verification is
       performed.

8.2.4 Auditing and Remote Monitoring
A CKMS should audit security-relevant events by detecting and recording the event, the
date and time of the event, and the identity or role of the entity initiating the event. The
audit log should provide a record of the relevant security functions performed. The audit
capability may be spread over several CKMS devices and locations. The audit capability
