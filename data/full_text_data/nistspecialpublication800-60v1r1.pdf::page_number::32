The impact levels associated with the management and support information common to many
agencies are strongly affected by the mission-based information with which it is associated. That
is, agency-common management and support information used with very sensitive or critical
mission-based information types may have higher impact levels than the same agency-common
information used with less critical mission-based information types.
Further, information systems process many types of information. Not all of these information
types are likely to have the same security impact levels. The compromise of some information
types will jeopardize system functionality and agency mission more than the compromise of
other information types. System security impact levels must be assessed in the context of system
mission and function as well as on the basis of the aggregate of the component information
types.
Additionally, configuration and security policy enforcement information should be reviewed
and adjusted considering the information processed on the system. Configuration and
security policy information includes password files, network access rules, other hardware and
software configuration settings, and documentation affecting access to the information
system’s data, programs, and/or processes. At a minimum, a low confidentiality and
integrity impact level will apply to this set of information and processes due to a potential for
corruption, misuse, or abuse of system information and processes.
A factor specific to the confidentiality objective is information subject to special handling (e.g.,
information subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. § 552A). Regardless of other
considerations, some minimum confidentiality impact level must be assigned to any information
system that stores, processes, or generates such information. Examples of such information
include information subject to the Trade Secrets Act, the Privacy Act, Department of Energy
Safeguards Information, Internal Revenue Service Official Use Only Information, and
Environmental Protection Agency Confidential Business Information (e.g., subject to Toxic
Substances Control Act; Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act). Some of these statutory and
regulatory specifications are listed in Volume II, Appendix E, “Legislative and Executive
Sources Establishing Sensitivity/Criticality.”

4.4 Step 4: Assign System Security Category
Once the security impact levels have been selected, reviewed and adjusted as necessary for the
security objectives of each individual information type processed by an information system, it is
necessary to assign a system security category based on the aggregate of information types. The
Step 4 activities include the following: (i) review identified security categorizations for the
aggregate of information types; (ii) determine the system security categorization by identifying
the high water mark for each of the security objectives (confidentiality, integrity, availability)
based on the aggregate of the information types; (iii) adjust the high water mark for each system
security objective, as necessary, by applying the factors discussed in section 4.4.2; (iv) assign the
overall information system impact level based on the highest impact level for the system security
objectives; and (v) document all security categorization determinations and decisions.
