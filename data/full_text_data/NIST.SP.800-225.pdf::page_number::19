                       USABLE CYBERSECURITY


 The mission of the Usable Cybersecurity priority area is to “champion the human in
 cybersecurity.” Through human-centered research and projects, the usability team
   seeks to better understand and improve users’ cybersecurity interactions and
       empower people to be active, informed participants in cybersecurity.

Major Accomplishments in FY 2022:
• NIST received a provisional patent for the Phish Scale – a method to help organizations
  contextualize phishing training click rates. The scale was further expanded based on real-
  world data and feedback from the growing number of organizations that have adopted the
  Phish Scale.
• A parent-child study examining youths’ cybersecurity and privacy perceptions,
  knowledge, and behaviors found that conversations with parents were key to youth
  gaining solid understandings regarding the topics. Results were shared in research and
  government forums.
• A research study identified the approaches and challenges of U.S. Government
  cybersecurity awareness programs − including emphasis on compliance rather than
  impact − and informed new government awareness and training guidelines.
• Survey findings on consumer perceptions and experiences with updates for smart home
  devices revealed a lack of transparency and user misconceptions. Results informed
  Internet of Things cybersecurity guidelines and labeling efforts.

          We amplify the voices and
          needs of people within a
          field that is most often
          viewed through a
          technology-dominant lens.
