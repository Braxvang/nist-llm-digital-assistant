      NIST SP 800-90C 3pd (Third Public Draft)                      Recommendation for RBG Constructions
      September 2022

149       beyond those needed for the security strength are acquired from the randomness source. SP
150       800-90A will be revised to agree with this change.
151   8. SP 800-90C allows the use of both physical and non-physical entropy sources. See the
152      definitions of physical and non-physical entropy sources in Appendix E. Also, multiple
153      validated entropy sources may be used to provide entropy, and two methods are provided in
154      Section 2.3 for counting the entropy provided in a bitstring.
155   9. The CMVP is considering providing information on an entropy source validation certificate
156      that indicates whether an entropy source is physical or non-physical.
157   10. The CMVP is developing a program to validate entropy sources against SP 800-90B with the
158       intent of allowing the re-use of those entropy sources in different RBG implementations.
159       Question: Are there any issues that still need to be addressed in SP 800-90C to allow the re-
160       use of validated entropy sources in different RBG implementations? Note that in many cases,
161       specific issues need to be addressed in the FIPS 140 implementation guide rather than in this
162       document.
