D.13.2 Labor Rights Management Information Type

Labor Rights Management refers to those activities undertaken to ensure that employees and
employers are aware of and comply with all statutes and regulations concerning labor rights,
including those pertaining to wages, benefits, safety and health, whistleblower, and
nondiscrimination policies. The recommended provisional categorization of the labor rights
management information type follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of labor rights
management information on the ability of responsible agencies to ensure that employees and
employers are aware of and comply with all statutes and regulations concerning labor rights,
including those pertaining to wages, benefits, safety and health, whistleblower, and
nondiscrimination policies. In some cases, premature release of draft labor rights bulletins might
adversely affect the effectiveness of agency operations. In general, the consequences of
unauthorized disclosure of most labor rights management information would have, a limited
adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for labor rights management information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Unauthorized
modification or destruction of information affecting external communications (e.g., web pages,
electronic mail) may adversely affect operations and/or public confidence in the agency, but the
damage to the mission would usually be limited. The consequences of unauthorized modification
or destruction of labor rights management information would have, at most, a limited adverse
effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
labor rights management information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to labor rights management
information. The effects of disruption of access to most labor rights management information
or information systems would have a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency
assets, or individuals.
