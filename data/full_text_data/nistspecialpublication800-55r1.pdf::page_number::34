5.1       Stakeholder Interest Identification

Phase 1 of the measures development process (see Figure 5-1) identifies relevant stakeholders
and their interests in information security measurement. Anyone within an organization can be

      •   Agency Head;
      •   CIO;
      •   SAISO/CISO;
      •   ISSO;
      •   Program manager/information system owner;
      •   Information system administrator/network administrator;
