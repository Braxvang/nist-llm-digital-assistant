used in the CKMS, including:
   a) Protection requirements to ensure that the product has not been tampered with
      during the delivery process or that tampering is detected,
   b) Protection requirements to ensure that the product has not been replaced during
      the delivery process or that replacement is detected,
   c) Protection requirements to ensure that an unrequested delivery is detected, and
   d) Protection requirements to ensure that the product delivery is not suppressed or
      delayed and that suppression or delay is detected.

                                  process,
                               c) Delivered but unauthorized items are not used, and
                               d) Product delivery is not suppressed or delayed.

                                  delivery item is detected,
                               b) Any delay or cancellation of product delivery is
                                  detected, or

and maintenance environments of the CKMS, including:
