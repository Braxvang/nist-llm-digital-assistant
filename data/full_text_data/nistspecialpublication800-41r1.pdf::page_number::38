                                                                    GUIDELINES ON FIREWALLS AND FIREWALL POLICY


5.2     Configure

The configuration phase involves all facets of configuring the firewall platform. This includes installing
hardware and software, configuring policies, configuring logging and alerting, and integrating the firewall
into the network architecture.

5.2.1    Hardware and Software Installation

Once the firewall has been chosen and acquired, the hardware, operating system, and underlying firewall
software should be installed for a software-based firewall. Next, for both software-based and hardware-
based firewalls, patches and vendor updates should be installed on the system. During this stage, the
firewall should also be hardened to decrease the risk of vulnerabilities and protect the system against
unauthorized access. Any console software needed for remote access should also be installed at this time.

During the installation and configuration, only the administrator doing that work should be able to
manage the firewall. All other management services for the firewall, such as SNMP, should be disabled,
and these services should be left disabled permanently unless needed. If the firewall supports having a
separate administrator account for each person performing firewall administration duties, configure such
accounts.

Network firewalls should be placed in a room that meets the product’s recommended environmental
requirements for temperature, humidity, space, power, etc. This room should also be physically secured to
prevent unauthorized personnel from accessing the firewall.

Comparing the logs of multiple systems when analyzing problems is very important, so the internal
clocks in each firewall should be consistent with those in all other systems used by the organization. The
best way to do this is to have all systems synchronize with an authoritative time source.

5.2.2    Policy Configuration

Once hardware and software has been installed and secured, administrators can create the firewall’s
policies. Some firewalls implement policy through explicit rules; some firewalls require configuring
firewall settings that then create internal rules; some firewalls create policies and rules automatically; and
still others use a combination of these three types of configuration. The end result is a set of rules called a
ruleset that describes how the firewall acts. Some vendors have restrictions or suggestions on the order of
the rules in a ruleset. While it is common to think of a firewall’s rules affecting traffic that appears on the
internal or external interfaces, most firewalls also allow configuring policies that are not traffic-based,
such as who can view or change the rules, or where external DNS servers and time synchronization
servers can be found.

These rulesets should implement the organization’s firewall policy as documented in the system security
plan, and should be as specific as possible with regards to the network traffic they control. To create a
ruleset, it should first be determined what types of traffic (protocols, source and destination addresses,
etc.) are required by approved applications for the organization. This should include protocols that the
firewall itself may need (DNS, Simple Network Management Protocol [SNMP], NTP, logging, etc.)

The details of creating a ruleset vary by type of firewall and specific products. For example, many
firewalls check traffic against rules in a sequential manner until a match is found. For these firewalls,
rules with the highest chance of matching traffic patterns should be placed as high in the list as possible to
improve firewall performance. Other firewalls have more complex ways of processing rulesets, such as
first checking “deny” rules and then checking “allow” rules.
