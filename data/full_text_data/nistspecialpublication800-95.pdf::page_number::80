4.    Human User’s Entry Point into the SOA: Web Portals

A Web portal is a starting point for Web activities. By logging into a Web portal, a user is granted access
to the information and services connected to the authenticating portal. Common implementations for
portals are Internet search engines that expand into information centers, and Web interfaces for corporate
knowledge management systems.

Web portals that sit at the boundary of a SOA have multiple roles: a Web server for users and a requester
to other Web services in the SOA. This dual role brings with it security implications that could impact
Web services interacting with the portal. Some of these implications include:

 Authentication. Who is sending this message?
 Authorization. Is the authenticated subject entitled to access?
 Audit. Can it be proved that this transaction occurred?
 Integrity. Was the message, or the system, tampered with?
 Confidentiality. Can the information be read while it is in transit? In storage?
 Privacy. Can personally identifiable information be released to the public?
 Availability. Is it vulnerable to a denial of service attack (brute force or otherwise)?
 Non-Repudiation. Can it be proven that the sender and the recipient did in fact send and receive the
  message?
 Policy Administration. How easy is it to apply or change a security policy rule or configuration
  parameter?
Additionally, Web service faces many challenges to fulfilling these basic security requirements. The
threats to Web services security include both the traditional exploits associated with the underlying
protocols such as HTTP, as well as new threats associated with new protocols and services, such as SOAP
and XML.

This section expands on the information provided above, with particular focus on explaining the role of
proxy agents, authorization and access control considerations for portals, and potential mechanisms for
enforcing XML filtering constraints on content provided to portal users.

4.1   Proxy Agents

As mentioned above, Web services that reside on the edge of the SOA are used to represent users during
communications from the client on the edge of the service and other Web services. A number of Web
service invocations are at the request of users through edge applications, such as portals, Web servers, and
single sign-on servers. These edge applications are server-based Web applications that interface, as proxy
agents on behalf of the user, with the Web services in the SOA. All security functions that require direct
interaction with users (via their clients) are expected to be performed by the edge applications. The Web
services connected to the portal would then presume that when the edge applications assert a user’s
authenticity and privileges, such an assertion is trustworthy.

For Web services to communicate, the interacting parties must trust each other. When communicating
using Web services, there are a number of different entities involved: the client application through which
