NIST SP 800-160v1r1                                                 Engineering Trustworthy Secure Systems
November 2022

       -   Permanent termination of system functions and delivery of services: The security aspects
           address the removal, decommissioning, or destruction of the associated system elements
           while preserving the security posture of any remaining functions and services.
       -   Transform the system and environment into an acceptable state: The security aspects
           address any alterations made to the system, its operation, and the environment to ensure
           that stakeholder protection needs and concerns are addressed by the remaining portions of
           the system and the functions and services it provides. When the entire system is removed,
           the security aspects address alterations to the environment to return it to its original or
           agreed-upon secure state.
       -   Address security concerns for material, data, and information: The security aspects address
           protections for sensitive components, technology, data, and information removed from
           service, dismantled, stored, prepared for reuse, or destroyed. The aspects may include the
           duration of protection level/state, downgrades, releasability, and criteria that define
           authorized access and use during the storage period. The protection needs for disposal are
           defined by stakeholders and agreements and may be subject to regulatory requirements,
           expectations, and constraints.
       -   Transition the system and system elements for future use: The security aspects address the
           transition of the system or system elements for future use in a modified or adapted form,
           including legacy migration and return to service. The security aspects may include
           constraints, limitations, or other criteria to enable recovery of the systemsâ€™ functions and
           services within a specified time or to ensure security-oriented interoperability with future
           enabling systems and other systems. These aspects may also include periodic inspections to
           account for the security posture and return-to-service readiness of stored system elements,
           associated data and information, and all supporting operations and sustainment support
           materials. The security aspects apply to all system functions and services and are not limited
           to only security protection-oriented functions and services of the system.
       DS-1.2 Identify the security-relevant constraints and objectives of disposal on the system
              requirements, architecture and design characteristics, and implementation techniques.
       DS-1.3 Identify the security aspects for enabling systems or services needed to support
              disposal.
       DS-1.4 Identify and plan for enabling systems or services needed to support the security
              aspects of disposal.
       DS-1.5 Obtain or acquire access to the security aspects of enabling systems or services to be
              used in disposal.
       DS-1.6 Specify security criteria for containment facilities, storage locations, inspection, and
              storage periods (if the system is to be stored).
       DS-1.7 Define the security aspects of preventive methods to preclude disposed elements and
              materials that should not be repurposed, reclaimed, or reused from re-entering the
              supply chain.

DS-2   PERFORM DISPOSAL
       DS-2.1 Securely deactivate the system or system element to prepare it for secure removal from
              operation.
