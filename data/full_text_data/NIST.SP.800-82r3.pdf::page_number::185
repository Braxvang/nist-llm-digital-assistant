NIST SP 800-82r3                                                       Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security

threat source
The intent and method targeted at the intentional exploitation of a vulnerability or a situation and method that may
accidentally trigger a vulnerability. Synonymous with threat agent. [FIPS200]

Transmission Control Protocol
TCP is one of the main protocols in TCP/IP networks. Whereas the IP protocol deals only with packets, TCP enables
two hosts to establish a connection and exchange streams of data. TCP guarantees the delivery of data and also
guarantees that packets will be delivered in the same order in which they were sent.

Trojan horse
A computer program that appears to have a useful function, but also has a hidden and potentially malicious function
that evades security mechanisms, sometimes by exploiting legitimate authorizations of a system entity that invokes
the program. [RFC4949]

unauthorized access
A person gains logical or physical access without permission to a network, system, application, data, or other
resource. [SP800-61]

unidirectional gateway
Unidirectional gateways are a combination of hardware and software. The hardware permits data to flow from one
network to another but is physically unable to send any information at all back to the source network. The software
replicates databases and emulates protocol servers and devices.

valve
An in-line device in a fluid-flow system that can interrupt flow, regulate the rate of flow, or divert flow to another
branch of the system. [ISADICT]

virtual private network
A restricted-use, logical (i.e., artificial or simulated) computer network that is constructed from the system resources
of a relatively public, physical (i.e., real) network (such as the Internet), often by using encryption (located at hosts
or gateways), and often by tunneling links of the virtual network across the real network. [RFC4949] (adapted)

virus
A hidden, self-replicating section of computer software, usually malicious logic, that propagates by infecting (i.e.,
inserting a copy of itself into and becoming part of) another program. A virus cannot run by itself; it requires that its
host program be run to make the virus active. [RFC4949] (adapted)

vulnerability
Weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be
exploited or triggered by a threat source. [FIPS200]

wide area network
A physical or logical network that provides data communications to a larger number of independent users than are
typically served by a local area network (LAN) and that is usually spread over a larger geographic area than that of a
LAN.

wireless device
Any device that can connect to an OT network via radio or infrared waves, usually to collect or monitor data but
also to modify control set points in some cases.

workstation
A computer used for tasks such as programming, engineering, and design. [IR6859]

worm
A computer program that can run independently, can propagate a complete working version of itself onto other hosts
on a network, and may consume computer resources destructively. [RFC4949] (adapted)
