Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
research and development information is moderate.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to research and development information.
Most research and innovation processes are tolerant of delay. In most cases, disruption of access
to research and innovation information will have only a limited adverse effect on government
operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
research and development information is low.

D.20.2 General Purpose Data and Statistics Information Type

General purpose data and statistics includes activities performed in providing empirical,
numerical, and related data and information pertaining to the current state of the nation in areas
such as the economy, labor, weather, international trade, etc. The recommended provisional
categorization of the General Purpose Data and Statistics information type follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of general purpose data
and statistics information on the ability of responsible agencies to provide empirical, numerical,
and related data and information pertaining to the current state of the nation in areas such as the
economy, labor, weather, international trade, etc. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure
of most general-purpose data and statistics information would have only a limited adverse effect
on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized premature disclosure
of much economic (e.g., agricultural commodity, economic indicators) data and statistics
information can result in major financial consequences. In some cases, premature disclosure of
this information can impact major financial markets and damage national banking and finance
infrastructures. Unauthorized and premature disclosure to a single institution (e.g., a major
commodity brokerage house), could damage faith in general-purpose data and statistics gathering
and development institutions, result in even more market disruption, and have a severe or
catastrophic adverse effect on public confidence in the agency. Even when the consequences are
limited to giving an unfair market advantage to a single financial or commercial institution,
unauthorized disclosure can have a serious adverse effect on public confidence in the agency and
its staff. This can result in assignment of a moderate impact level to such information.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for most general-purpose data and statistics information is low.
