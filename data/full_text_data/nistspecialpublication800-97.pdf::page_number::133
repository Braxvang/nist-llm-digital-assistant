                                       ESTABLISHING WIRELESS ROBUST SECURITY NETWORKS: A GUIDE TO IEEE 802.11I

  SSID
             -   No security                 -   Configure APs and STAs to    -   Replace AP11 and AP12 with
             -   APs can support TKIP,           use TKIP with PSKs               new WPA2-Enterprise APs
                 but not IEEE 802.1X or      -   Familiarize users with new   -   Disallow TKIP
                 CCMP                            technology
 PROJECT     -   Users unfamiliar with
                 PSKs but are receptive to
                 security enhancements,
                 especially since their
                 ESS was the source of
                 the major breach
             -   WEP provides                -   Upgrade software to code     -   Replace WPA2-Personal AP
                 inadequate security             that supports WPA Personal       with new WPA2-Enterprise
             -   AP13 could support TKIP                                          AP
                 with a firmware flash                                        -   Disallow TKIP
                 upgrade

             -   Users already
                 comfortable with use of
                 PSKs because they are
                 deployed in existing WEP
                 configuration
             -   ESS is already an RSN       -   Keep as is                   -   Replace WPA2-Personal AP
                 using CCMP with PSK                                              with new WPA2-Enterprise
    LAB                                                                           AP
             -   AP cannot support IEEE
                 802.1X                                                       -   Disallow TKIP


In conjunction with the changes, the upgraded BSSs were consolidated into a new ESS with the SSID
INTERIM, which used TKIP with PSKs. Since the WLAN1 ESS could not be upgraded immediately, it
was migrated outside of the internal network. The BAR and LAB WLANs remained “as is” because they
both already met interim security requirements.

The interim solution allowed the project team to quickly implement reasonable security measures without
interrupting service or purchasing new equipment or software, while moving towards the long-term high
assurance solution. Once they implemented the interim changes, the WLAN infrastructure appeared as
depicted in Figure 9-3. The specifications of each AP in the interim infrastructure are listed in Table 9-3.
