      NIST SP 800-63-4 ipd                                               Digital Identity Guidelines
      December 2022


427   organization-specific instructions, extend these guidelines for the federal enterprise,
428   providing additional technical controls and processes for issuing and managing Personal
429   Identity Verification (PIV) cards, binding additional authenticators as derived PIV
430   credentials, and using federation architectures and protocols with PIV systems.
431   Transactions not covered by this guidance include those associated with national security
432   systems as defined in 44 U.S.C. § 3542(b)(2). Private sector organizations and state, local,
433   and tribal governments whose digital processes require varying levels of digital identity
434   assurance may consider the use of these standards where appropriate.
435   Additionally, these technical guidelines do not address the identity of subjects for physical
436   access (e.g., to buildings), though some identities used for online transactions may also be
437   used for physical access. Additionally, this revision of these guidelines does not explicitly
438   address device identity, often referred to as machine-to-machine (such as router-to-router)
439   authentication or interconnected devices, commonly referred to as the internet of things
440   (IoT), although these guidelines are written to refer to generic subjects wherever possible
441   to leave open the possibility for applicability to devices. Furthermore, these guidelines
442   do not address authorization of access to Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) on
443   behalf of subjects.

444   2.2. How to Use this Suite of SPs
445   These guidelines support the mitigation of the negative impacts induced by a digital
446   identity error by separating the individual elements of digital identity into discrete,
447   component parts. For non-federated systems, agencies will select two components,
448   referred to as Identity Assurance Level (IAL) and Authentication Assurance Level (AAL).
449   For federated systems, a third component, Federation Assurance Level (FAL), is included.
450   Sec. 5, Digital Identity Risk Management provides details on the risk assessment process
451   and how the results of the risk assessment, with additional context, inform organizational
452   selection of IAL, AAL, and FAL combinations based on risk and mission.
453   By conducting appropriate risk management for business, security, and privacy, side-by-
454   side with mission needs, organizations will select IAL, AAL, and FAL as distinct options.
455   Specifically, organizations are required to individually select levels corresponding to each
456   function being performed. While many systems could have the same numerical level for
457   each IAL, AAL, and FAL, this is not a requirement and organizations should not assume
458   they will be the same in any given system or application.
459   The components of identity assurance detailed in these guidelines are as follows:
460       • IAL refers to the identity proofing process.
461       • AAL refers to the authentication process.
462       • FAL refers to the federation process, when the RP is connected through a federated
463         protocol.
