for the variety of potential interruptions. The contingency plan should be reviewed with
managers to ensure that the cost to meet the contingency plan is approved. For many smaller-
scale interruptions, a critical spares inventory will likely prove adequate to meet the recovery
objectives. For larger-scale recovery, vendor relationships will likely be leveraged. For all types
of recovery, backups are critical.

A disaster recovery plan (DRP) is a documented process or set of procedures that comprise a
comprehensive statement of recovery actions to be taken before, during, and after a disaster. The
DRP is ordinarily documented in both electronic and paper form to ensure that it is readily
available during any type of disaster (e.g., natural, environmental, or caused by humans, whether
intentionally or unintentionally). Organizations should develop, maintain, and validate disaster
recovery plans for their environments to help minimize an event impact by reducing the time
required to restore capabilities.
Organizations may already have some emergency response plans in place and should consider
leveraging existing plans when developing a response plan for cybersecurity events.

            Incident response planning may include the following elements:
                   •   Identification and classification of incidents. The various types
                       of OT incidents should be identified and classified based on
                       potential impact so that a proper response can be formulated for
                       each potential incident.
                   •   Response actions. Incident response can range from doing
                       nothing to performing a full system shutdown, which could result
                       in a shutdown of the physical process. The response taken will
                       depend on the type of incident and its effect on the OT system
                       and the physical process being controlled. A written plan that
                       documents the response to each type of incident should be
                       prepared. This will provide guidance during times when there
                       might be confusion or stress due to the incident. This plan should
                       include step-by-step actions to be taken by various stakeholders.
