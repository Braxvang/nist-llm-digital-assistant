709   3.3.6. Audit Record Reduction and Report Generation
710           REQUIREMENT: 03.03.06
711           a. Implement an audit record reduction and report generation capability that supports audit
712              record review, analysis, reporting requirements, and after-the-fact investigations of incidents.
713           b. Preserve the original content and time ordering of audit records.

714           DISCUSSION
715           Audit records are generated in 03.03.03. Audit record reduction and report generation occur after
716           audit record generation. Audit record reduction is a process that manipulates collected audit
717           information and organizes it in a summary format that is more meaningful to analysts. Audit
718           record reduction and report generation capabilities do not always come from the same system or
719           organizational entities that conduct auditing activities. An audit record reduction capability can
720           include, for example, modern data mining techniques with advanced data filters to identify
721           anomalous behavior in audit records. The report generation capability provided by the system can
722           help generate customizable reports. The time ordering of audit records can be a significant issue if
723           the granularity of the time stamp in the record is insufficient.

727   3.3.7. Time Stamps
728           REQUIREMENT: 03.03.07
729           a. Use internal system clocks to generate time stamps for audit records.
730           b. Record time stamps for audit records that meet [Assignment: organization-defined granularity
731              of time measurement] and that:
732               1. Use Coordinated Universal Time (UTC);
733               2. Have a fixed local time offset from UTC; or
734               3. Include the local time offset as part of the time stamp.

735           DISCUSSION
736           Time stamps generated by the system include the date and time. Time is commonly expressed in
737           Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) – a modern continuation of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) –
738           or local time with an offset from UTC. The granularity of time measurements refers to the degree
739           of synchronization between system clocks and reference clocks (e.g., clocks synchronizing within
740           hundreds or tens of milliseconds). Organizations may define different time granularities for
741           system components. Time service can be critical to other security capabilities, such as access
742           control, and identification and authentication, depending on the nature of the mechanisms used to
743           support those capabilities.
