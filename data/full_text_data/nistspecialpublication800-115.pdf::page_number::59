                                                      TECHNICAL GUIDE TO INFORMATION SECURITY TESTING AND ASSESSMENT



7.4.1    Data Collection

Relevant information should be collected by the team throughout the assessment. This includes
information related to the architecture and configuration of the networks being assessed, as well as
information on assessor activities. Because this data is sensitive, it is important to handle it appropriately.
Types of information the assessors might collect include:

      Architecture and Configuration Data. Assessment type and desired outcome will drive the
       data collected by the team, which may include but not be limited to system names, IP addresses,
       OS, physical and logical network positions, security configurations, and vulnerabilities.
      Assessor Activities. Assessors should keep a log that includes assessment system information
       and a step-by-step record of their activities. This provides an audit trail, and allows the
       organization to distinguish between the actions of assessors and true adversaries. The activity log
       can also be useful in developing the assessment results report.
Use of a keystroke logger on an assessor’s system can create a step-by-step log of many tester actions,
although it will not capture mouse clicks and certain other actions. 31 For automated tools, assessors can
maintain the audit logs from each tool that is used. While assessors may choose to dump the output of
the keystroke logger or tool audit log onto a separate system to create a centralized storage and auditing
capability, an alternate manual approach is an activities log that tracks each command executed by
assessors on the network. This approach is time-consuming for the assessors, and leaves room for error.
If an activities log is used, it should include at a minimum the following information—date and time,
assessor’s name, assessment system identifier (i.e., IP or MAC), target system identifier (i.e., IP or
MAC), tool used, command executed, and comments.

7.4.2    Data Storage

Secure storage of data collected during the assessment, including vulnerabilities, analysis results, and
mitigation recommendations, is the assessors’ responsibility. Inappropriate release of this information
can damage the organization’s reputation and increase the likelihood of exploitation. At a minimum,
assessors should store the following information to be used for identifying, analyzing, and reporting on
the security posture of the organization, and provide an audit trail of testing activities:

      Assessment plans and ROEs
      Documentation on system security configuration and network architecture
      Results from automated tools and other findings
      Assessment results report
      Corrective action plan or Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M).
Many options exist for storing information on discovered vulnerabilities, such as keeping the findings in
the format output by the tool that was used, or importing the findings into a database. 32 Most vulnerability
scanning tools have report formats that list the system, vulnerabilities, and recommended mitigation

31
     A keystroke logger records every keystroke made by the user of the system, and places it into a log. This level of recording
     provides assessors with a method to track each action on the network—and allows the organization being assessed to see
     exactly what the assessors executed on the network, when it occurred, and which system conducted the test. In addition, this
     type of recording provides assessors with documentation that they were not the cause of malfunctioning or compromise of a
     network system.
32
     Storing vulnerability information can also be helpful for performing historical comparisons.
