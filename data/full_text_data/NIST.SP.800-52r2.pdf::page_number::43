The client certificate profile is listed in Table 4-1. In the absence of an agency-specific client
certificate profile, this profile should be used for client certificates.

31 The recommended elliptic curves now listed in FIPS 186-4 [45] will be moved to SP 800-186. Until SP 800-186 is published,

    the recommended elliptic curves should be taken from FIPS 186-4.
