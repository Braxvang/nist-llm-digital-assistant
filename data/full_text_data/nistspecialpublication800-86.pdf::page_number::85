                                                        GUIDE TO INTEGRATING FORENSIC TECHNIQUES INTO INCIDENT RESPONSE



Applications that are designed to split their code among multiple hosts typically use application protocols
for communications between hosts.116 Ubiquitous types of applications, such as e-mail and Web, use
well-known, standardized application protocols to facilitate interoperability among different components.
For example, nearly every e-mail client program is compatible with nearly every e-mail server program
because they are based on the same application protocol standards. However, a program based on a
standard might add proprietary features or violate the standard in some way, especially if the standard is
not exhaustively detailed. If interoperability with other applications is not a concern (or not desirable)
and the same party is creating all application components, non-standard protocols are often used.

As described throughout Section 7.1, applications may have many different components that operate
together. In addition, an application may be dependent on one or more other applications. For example,
many e-commerce application clients run within Web browsers. Many applications also rely on OS
services, such as printing and DNS lookups (to find the IP addresses of application servers and other
devices). Applications vary widely in complexity, from a simple utility program such as a calculator to a
large e-commerce application that may involve many thousands of components and have millions of
users.

7.2      Types of Applications

Applications exist for nearly every purpose imaginable. Although forensic techniques can be applied to
any application, certain types of applications are more likely to be the focus of forensic analysis,
including e-mail, Web usage, interactive messaging, file sharing, document usage, security applications,
and data concealment tools. Nearly every computer has at least a few applications installed from these
categories. The following sections describe each of these types of applications in more detail.

7.2.1      E-mail

E-mail has become the predominant means for people to communicate electronically. Each e-mail
message consists of a header and a body. The body of the e-mail contains the actual content of the
message, such as a memorandum or a personal letter. The header of the e-mail includes various pieces of
information regarding the e-mail. By default, most e-mail client applications display only a few header
fields for each message: the sender’s and recipients’ e-mail addresses, the date and time the message was
sent, and the subject of the message. However, the header typically includes several other fields,
including the following:117

      ! Message ID
      ! Type of e-mail client used to create the message
      ! Importance of the message, as indicated by the sender (e.g., low, normal, high)
      ! Routing information—which e-mail servers the message passed through in transit and when each
        server received it
      ! Message content type, which indicates whether the e-mail content simply consists of a text body
        or also has file attachments, embedded graphics, etc.
E-mail client applications are used to receive, store, read, compose, and send e-mails. Most e-mail clients
also provide an address book that can hold contact information, such as e-mail addresses, names, and

      Applications that are designed to keep all code on a single host typically do not need to use any application protocols.
117
      Most e-mail clients have a configuration setting that specifies whether full or partial e-mail headers should be displayed.
