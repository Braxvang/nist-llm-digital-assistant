Information Technology Security Training Requirements




        INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SECURITY TRAINING MATRIX                            — Cell 3.5B
 Training Area: System Life Cycle Security                — Operations
 Functional Specialty: Acquire

 Definition    —       The system life cycle is a model for building and operating an FT system
                       from its initial inception to its termination and disposal of assets. The
                       model includes six phases: Initiation, Development, Test and Evaluation,
                       Implementation, Operations, and Termination. Life cycle security is the
                       ensemble of processes and procedures which ensures data confidentiality, as
                       needed, as well as data and system integrity, and availability.


                       The operations phase includes the ongoing day-to-day use (production) and
                       maintenance or enhancement of the system without compromising the
                       integrity and effectiveness of the installed safeguards.


 Behavioral Outcome          —   Individuals with acquisition responsibilities are able to understand
                                 the IT security concerns associated with system operations and to
