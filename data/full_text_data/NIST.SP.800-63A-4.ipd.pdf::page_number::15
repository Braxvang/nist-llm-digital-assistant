353   This section is informative.
354   This publication and its companion volumes, [SP800-63], [SP800-63B], and
355   [SP800-63C], provide technical guidelines to organizations for the implementation of
356   digital identity services.
357   This document provides requirements for the identity proofing of individuals at each
358   Identity Assurance Level (IAL) for the purposes of enrolling them into an identity
359   service or providing them access to online resources. It applies to the identity proofing of
360   individuals over a network or in person. Verifying the identities of people calling into a
361   customer support service or a call center is out of scope for this document.
