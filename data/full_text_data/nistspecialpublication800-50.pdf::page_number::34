                                                                                                NIST Special Publication 800-50



4.       Developing Awareness and Training Material

Once the awareness and training program has been designed, supporting material can be developed.
Material should be developed15 with the following in mind:

     “What behavior do we want to reinforce?” (awareness); and
     “What skill or skills do we want the audience to learn and apply?” (training).
In both cases, the focus should be on specific material that the participants should integrate into their jobs.
Attendees will pay attention and incorporate what they see or hear in a session if they feel that the
material was developed specifically for them. Any presentation that “feels” canned – impersonal and so
general as to apply to any audience – will be filed away as just another of the annual “we’re here because
we have to be here” sessions. An awareness and training program can be effective, however, if the
material is interesting and current.16

At some point the question will be asked, “Am I developing awareness or training material?” Generally,
since the goal of awareness material is simply to focus attention on good security practices, the message
that the awareness effort sends should be short and simple. The message can address one topic, or it can
address a number of topics about which the audience should be aware.

The awareness audience must include all users in an organization. The message to be spread through an
awareness program, or campaign,17 should make all individuals aware of their commonly shared IT
security responsibilities. On the other hand, the message in a training class is directed at a specific
audience. The message in training material should include everything related to security that attendees
need to know in order to do their jobs. Training material is usually far more in-depth than material used
in an awareness session or campaign.

4.1      Developing Awareness Material

The question to be answered when beginning to develop material for an organization wide awareness
program or campaign is, “What do we want all agency personnel to be aware of regarding IT security?”
The awareness and training plan should contain a list of topics. E-mail advisories, online IT security
daily news websites, and periodicals are good sources of ideas and material. Agency policy, program
reviews, internal audits, internal controls program reviews, self-assessments, and spot-checks can also
identify additional topics to address.


15
      Awareness and training material can be developed in-house, adapted from other agencies’ or professional organizations’
      work, or purchased from a contractor/vendor. For information about contracting for services and products, see draft NIST
      Special Publication 800-35, Guide to Information Technology Security Services, and draft NIST Special Publication 800-36,
      Guide to Selecting Information Technology Security Products. For more extensive guidelines on contracting issues see draft
      NIST Special Publication 800-4A, Security Considerations in Federal Information Technology Procurements – A Guide for
      Procurement Initiators, Contracting Officers, and IT Security Officials.
16
      Changing peoples’ attitudes and behavior in terms of IT security can be a challenging task. New security policies are often
      seen as conflicting with the way users have done their job for years. For example, departments and agencies that once
      operated with the full and open sharing of information are now being required to control access to, and dissemination of, that
      information. A technique that has been successfully used to acclimate users to these necessary changes is to begin an
      awareness module or session by discussing IT security issues in the context of personal life experiences (e.g., identify theft,
      inappropriate access to personal health or financial data, hacking incidents).
17
      An organization may decide to mount a security awareness campaign to focus on a particular issue. For example, if users
      are becoming targets of social engineering attacks or a particular virus, an awareness campaign can be quickly implemented
      that uses various awareness techniques to “get the word out.” Such a campaign differs from the normal implementation of
      an awareness program by the need for a timely dissemination of information on a particular topic or group of topics.
