SP 800-152                                  A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


             If lost keys are recovered, they shall be recovered from
PR:10.27
             reliable storage and used only for processing already-
             protected information if the risk of such use is acceptable.

             A Federal CKMS should evaluate the potential consequences
PA:10.7
             of having used a lost or corrupted key and/or metadata.
             A Federal CKMS should revoke corrupted keys as soon as
PA:10.8
             detected.
             If corrupted keys are required for continued operation, they
PA:10.9
             should be recovered from reliable storage or replaced.


             A Federal CKMS could automatically report corrupted keys
PF:10.8
             and metadata to all potentially affected entities, and initiate
             recovery and replacement procedures.
