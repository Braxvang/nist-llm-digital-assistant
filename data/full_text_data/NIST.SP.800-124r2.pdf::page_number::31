NIST SP 800-124r2                                                  Guidelines for Managing the Security

   •   Distribute apps from a dedicated enterprise mobile app store provided through the EMM
       technology.
   •   Distribute the organization’s apps from a dedicated mobile app store.
MAM solutions allow enterprises to control access to enterprise-specific apps and often enable
an enterprise to integrate an in-house enterprise app catalog with a mobile device vendor’s app
store (e.g., Apple’s App store, Google Play) to allow mobile users to easily install an enterprise
app. Enterprise system administrators may be able to deploy apps or push out over-the-air
updates to mobile users. They may also be able to restrict app functionalities without affecting
the entire device, an approach that is preferred by BYOD users. Specifying and enforcing
security and privacy policies is a key function of MAM systems, often including user- or role-
based policies for access to specific apps and integration with remote wipe for employees who
depart the organization or change roles. Encryption or containerization may be used to separate
the execution environments of apps or their communication with enterprise services. Finally,
MAM systems may enable enterprise system administrators to monitor app behavior,
configuration compliance, or the presence of unauthorized apps on a user device.

4.2.3. Mobile Threat Defense
MTD systems are designed to detect the presence of malicious apps, network-based attacks,
phishing attacks, improper configurations, and known vulnerabilities in mobile apps or the
mobile OS itself. Although MTD is becoming the preferred term, the terms mobile threat
protection (MTP) and endpoint protection are also colloquially used. These systems often run an
agent on the device – typically a mobile app – and may initiate analysis and learning on external
cloud-based platforms. MTD systems provide real-time, continuous monitoring for assessing
apps after deployment to a mobile device and during runtime. MTD systems reside on the mobile
device and do not rely on network connectivity. This enables detection and protection from
mobile threats even if the device’s network connectivity is blocked or compromised. In an
enterprise context, an MTD system may be integrated with an EMM to enable user or
administrator notification or automated response to remediate detected vulnerabilities or
quarantine apps or devices. Some mobile platforms include built-in capabilities similar to MTD
system capabilities that are not manageable by a user or administrator.
An MTD can detect and protect the mobile device, apps, and end user against attacks via the
wireless network. This defense covers MitM attacks that could intercept or eavesdrop on
communications or phishing attacks that could steal user credentials. MTD systems may also
detect attacks against an app or OS software. For example, MTD systems may observe
sideloaded apps – apps loaded from sources other than the standard mobile device vendor’s app
store (e.g., Apple’s App store, Google Play). Sideloaded apps may be special-purpose,
enterprise-loaded, or allowlisted apps specified by the enterprise. MTD systems monitor the on-
the-fly behavior of mobile apps within the current mobile environment, such as when the app
navigates to known malicious URLs or phishing sites. For example, MTD systems may detect
communication with a blocklisted service or an app’s failure to encrypt communication with an
enterprise’s backend service. Unexpected interactions among apps or the use of data on the user
device (e.g., the app accesses a device owner’s contacts or location) may also alert an MTD
system to potentially malicious or risky behavior. (An EMM device agent may provide a similar
