needed to fully characterize the system. At a minimum, the system characterization
describes the following individual system components:
   • Hardware (e.g., IBM mainframe running the z/OS operating system, Dell server
     running Windows 2003);
   • Software (e.g., Oracle, Apache web server, Microsoft Internet Information
     Server [IIS]);
   • External interfaces to other systems;
   • Data; and
   • People.
   In addition to the component descriptions, the system characterization describes
other factors with the potential to affect the security of the system, such as:
   • System functional requirements;
   • Organizational security policy and architecture;
   • System network topology;
   • Information flows throughout the system;
   • Management, operational, and technical security controls implemented or
     planned to be implemented for the system; and
   • Physical and environmental security mechanisms.
    The accuracy of the results from this step is essential to obtaining the best view
of the risk profile of the system undergoing assessment, since this step provides the
basis for the remaining steps. Inaccuracy at this point will propagate and lead to a
cascade of analytical errors as the process progresses.

10.1.2 Step 2 – Threat Identification
    Threat identification consists of identifying threat sources with the potential to
exploit weaknesses in the system. This step should culminate in the development of
a “threat statement,” or a comprehensive listing of potential threat sources. The
threat statement must be tailored to the individual organization and its processing
environment (e.g., end-user computing habits), which is accomplished by performing
a threat evaluation, using the system characterization as the basis, for the potential
to cause harm to the system.
    There are common threat sources that typically apply, regardless of the system,
that should be evaluated. These common threats can be categorized into three
areas: (1) natural threats (e.g., floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, landslides,
avalanches, electrical storms), (2) human threats (intentional or unintentional), and
(3) environmental threats (e.g., power failure). In general, information on natural
threats (e.g., floods, earthquakes, storms) should be readily available, as known
threats have been identified by many government and private sector organizations.
Intrusion detection tools also are becoming more prevalent, and government and
industry organizations continually collect data on security events, thereby improving
the ability to realistically assess threats. Sources of information include, but are not
limited to, the following:
   • Intelligence agencies (for example, the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s
     National Infrastructure Protection Center);
   • United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) found at
     www.us-cert.gov); and
   • Mass media, including Web-based resources.
