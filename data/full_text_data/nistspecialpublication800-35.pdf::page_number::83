11. How does an organization know which phase of the life cycle its service(s) are in?

   The IT security services life cycle is an iterative process in which the IT security services are
   continually assessed and evaluated. If an organization has not yet implemented IT security services,
   but needs them, it will be at the initiation phase. All others are likely to be in the operations phase
   and will be assessing service provider and organizational performance.

12. What triggers the life cycle?

   Any number of things can trigger the life cycle, from top-level management choosing to assess the
   current IT security functions to a new IT security service requirement. The trigger will likely fall into
   one of the issue categories mentioned in question 10 (see section 4.1 for specific sample triggers from
   each category), but all triggers have one characteristic in common: it will be an event sufficient to
   warrant assessing the current IT security environment and identifying viable service solutions.

13. How does an organization know if its current service(s) are adequate?

   The second phase of the IT security service life cycle is the assessment phase. During this phase, the
   IT security managers will assess the existing IT security environment through the use of metrics and
   the principle of total cost of ownership (TCO). Together they will allow managers to assess the
   current service level and cost. However, whether this service level and cost is acceptable is beyond
   the scope of the document. IT security managers will need to determine this for themselves based on
   their unique IT security and business requirements.

14. How does an organization choose an IT security solution?

   An organization chooses an IT security solution based on their assessment of the current environment
   and business case development of the viable alternatives as compared to their current service.
   Although the business case may not make the decision-making easy or obvious, it should provide the
   necessary data for the decision maker to weigh, consider, and select the service arrangement that best
   suits the organization’s needs. There will likely be some discussion and disagreement among the
   decision makers, but ultimately the selection must be a consensus. A service can succeed only if all
   business and IT security managers sufficiently buy-in to the implementing solution.

15. How does an organization choose a service provider?

   How an organization chooses the service provider may vary depending on the service, service
   arrangement, and type of organization. If the service arrangement is an internal one, there may be
   only one internal group who can provide the service. If the service is in a new field or requires highly
   specialized experience, there may only be a few service providers to choose. Large government
   agencies may release a formal RFP. Regardless, the organization should identify the service provider
   evaluation criteria, solicit proposals, and assess potential providers against the criteria.
