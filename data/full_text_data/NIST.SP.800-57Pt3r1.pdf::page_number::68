                       - If the files or token are lost,

9.2 Security and Compliance Issues
1. Any encrypted file system shall employ approved cryptography if it is to be used for
   the protection of Federal Government information.
2. Keys derived from passwords shall use strong passwords to maximize the difficulty
   of an off-line exhaustion attack [SP 800-118].

9.3 Recommendations for Procurement Officials
The following recommendations are for any individual(s) that makes a purchasing
decision for acquiring an EFS component.

1. Ensure that an encrypted file system includes a data-recovery capability (e.g., master
   administrator password) so that the data is not lost in the event that a user forgets his
   password or the user is unavailable. Data recovery is vital in this type of system.
