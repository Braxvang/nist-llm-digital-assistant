8.3   “X.509 Certificate for PIV Authentication” Data Object
Purpose                   Confirms that the X.509 Certificate for PIV Authentication of the PIV
                          card Application conforms to the PIV data model requirements as
                          per Appendix A of SP80073
Reference(s)              1. SP80073, Appendix A
                          2. TE04.01.01.01
Precondition(s)           1. A valid PIV card is inserted into the contact reader.
                          2. A valid PC/SC connection exists between the test application and the
                              contact reader.
                          3. The test application is currently connected to the card application
                              which is accessible through card handle.
                          4. A valid X.509 certificate for PIV authentication object is present on the
                              PIV card.
Test Scenario             1. Set cardHandle := <<valid card handle>>
                          2. Set OID := <<PIV Authentication Certificate
                              (2.16.840.1.101.3.7.2.1.1)>>
                          3. Call pivGetData w/
                              • (IN) cardHandle
                              • (IN) OID
                              • (OUT) data
                          4. Read and parse the byte array in accordance with BER-TLV
                             format.
Expected Result(s)        1. The size of the byte array does not exceed 1905 bytes.
                          2. All mandatory tags in “X.509 Certificate for PIV Authentication”
                             table are present.


8.4   “Card Holder Fingerprints” Data Object
Purpose                   Confirms that the “Card Holder Fingerprints” data object of the PIV
                          card Application conforms to the PIV data model requirements as
                          per Appendix A of SP80073
Reference(s)              1. SP80073, Appendix A

Precondition(s)           1. A valid PIV card is inserted into the contact reader.
                          2. A valid PC/SC connection exists between the test application and the
                              contact reader.
                          3. The test application is currently connected to the card application
                              which is accessible through card handle.
                          4. A valid card holder fingerprints object is present on the PIV card.
