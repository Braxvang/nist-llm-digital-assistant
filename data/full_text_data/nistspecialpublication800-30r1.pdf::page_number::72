 Exploit vulnerabilities on internal organizational            Adversary searches for known vulnerabilities in organizational internal information
 information systems.                                          systems and exploits those vulnerabilities.
 Exploit vulnerabilities using zero-day attacks.               Adversary employs attacks that exploit as yet unpublicized vulnerabilities. Zero-day
                                                               attacks are based on adversary insight into the information systems and applications

                                                               organizations when reconnected.
 Compromise software of organizational critical                Adversary inserts malware or otherwise corrupts critical internal organizational
 information systems.                                          information systems.
 Compromise organizational information systems to              Adversary implants malware into internal organizational information systems, where
 facilitate exfiltration of data/information.                  the malware over time can identify and then exfiltrate valuable information.
 Compromise mission-critical information.                      Adversary compromises the integrity of mission-critical information, thus preventing
                                                               or impeding ability of organizations to which information is supplied, from carrying

 Compromise design, manufacture, and/or distribution of        Adversary compromises the design, manufacture, and/or distribution of critical
 information system components (including hardware,            information system components at selected suppliers.
 software, and firmware).
                                        Conduct an attack (i.e., direct/coordinate attack tools or activities).
 Conduct communications interception attacks.                  Adversary takes advantage of communications that are either unencrypted or use
                                                               weak encryption (e.g., encryption containing publically known flaws), targets those
                                                               communications, and gains access to transmitted information and channels.
 Conduct wireless jamming attacks.                             Adversary takes measures to interfere with wireless communications so as to
                                                               impede or prevent communications from reaching intended recipients.

 allowed across perimeter.                                     removable storage) to compromise internal information systems, which allows
                                                               adversary to obtain and exfiltrate sensitive information through perimeters.
 Conduct simple Denial of Service (DoS) attack.                Adversary attempts to make an Internet-accessible resource unavailable to intended

                                                               indefinitely.
 Conduct Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.         Adversary uses multiple compromised information systems to attack a single target,
                                                               thereby causing denial of service for users of the targeted information systems.
 Conduct targeted Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.             Adversary targets DoS attacks to critical information systems, components, or
                                                               supporting infrastructures, based on adversary knowledge of dependencies.

 Conduct physical attacks on infrastructures supporting        Adversary conducts a physical attack on one or more infrastructures supporting
 organizational facilities.                                    organizational facilities (e.g., breaks a water main, cuts a power line).
