     5.3.4   Status of IPsec and On-Going Work

The third version of IPsec was published in December 2005. This section summarizes the capabilities in
these specifications; so that users can identify features they need and check that vendors supply them.
Not all implementations are complete. ICSA Labs (www.icsalabs.com) holds periodic IPsec
interoperability tests broken down by features, and their Web site can be consulted along with vendors’
documentation.

 RFC 4301, Security Architecture for the Internet Protocol. This specifies general requirements for
  IPsec. It contains a new processing model that eliminates SA bundles and instead processes SAs
  iteratively. One important IPv6 feature is support for selectors for the different types of ICMPv6
  messages. It also adds support for combined integrity and confidentiality algorithms and a Peer
  Authorization Database (PAD) to specify acceptable authentication credentials. Finally, it
  downgrades the requirement for implementing AH from MUST to MAY.
 RFC 4302, IP Authentication Header. This defines AH. The main new feature is extended, 64-bit
  replay detection counters.
 RFC 4303, IP Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP). This defines ESP. It allows longer padding to
  inhibit traffic analysis, combined mode algorithms, and also the extended sequence numbers used in
  AH.
 RFC 4835, Cryptographic Algorithm Implementation Requirements for Encapsulating Security
  Payload (ESP) and Authentication Header (AH). This specifies the cryptographic algorithms to be
  used with ESP and AH, shown in Figure 5-4. The encryption algorithms are only applicable to ESP.
  MUST- means an algorithm may be downgraded and SHOULD+ means potentially upgraded in the
  future.

       RFC 4306, Internet Key Exchange (IKEv2) Protocol. This is the replacement for IKEv1. It
        removes many of the less used features and contains many simplifications and improvements. It
        does away with phases and modes and takes four messages to set up SAs initially. It has
