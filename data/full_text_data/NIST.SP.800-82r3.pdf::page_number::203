D.1.   Consortiums and Standards

D.1.1. Critical Infrastructure Partnership Advisory Council (CIPAC)
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security established the Critical Infrastructure Partnership
Advisory Council (CIPAC) to facilitate interaction between governmental entities and critical
infrastructure owners and operators. CIPAC is aligned with and supports the implementation of
the National Infrastructure Protection Plan 2013: Partnering for Critical Infrastructure Security
and Resilience and Presidential Policy Directive 21, Critical Infrastructure Security and
Resilience to provide a forum in which the government and private-sector entities, organized as
coordinating councils, can jointly engage in a broad spectrum of activities to support and
collaborate on critical infrastructure security and resilience efforts.

D.1.2. Institute for Information Infrastructure Protection (I3P)
The Institute for Information Infrastructure Protection (I3P) is a consortium of leading national
cybersecurity institutions, including academic research centers, government laboratories, and
non-profit organizations. It was founded in September 2001 to help meet a well-documented
need for improved research and development (R&D) to protect the Nation’s information
infrastructure against catastrophic failures. The institute’s main role is to coordinate a national
cybersecurity R&D program and help build bridges between academia, industry, and
government. The I3P works toward identifying and addressing critical research problems in
information infrastructure protection and opening information channels between researchers,
policymakers, and infrastructure operators.

D.1.3. International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)
IEC is a standards organization that prepares and publishes international standards for all
electrical, electronic, and related technologies. These standards serve as a basis for creating
national standards and as references for drafting international tenders and contracts. IEC’s
members include manufacturers, providers, distributors, vendors, consumers, users, and all levels
of governmental agencies, professional societies, trade associations, and standards developers
from over 60 countries. Below are relevant IEC Technical Committees (TC) that contribute to
the field of OT security.
