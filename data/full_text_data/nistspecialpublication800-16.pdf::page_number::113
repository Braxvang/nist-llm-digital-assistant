Information Technology Security Training Requirements



        INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SECURITY TRAINING MATRIX                               — Cell 3.1 E
 Training Area: System Life Cycle Security                   —   Initiation
 Functional Specialty: Review & Evaluate

 Definition    —         The system life cycle is a model for building and operating an IT system
                         from its initial inception to its termination and disposal of assets. The
                         model includes six phases: Initiation, Development, Test and Evaluation,
                         Implementation, Operations, and Termination. Life cycle security is the
                         ensemble of processes and procedures which ensures data confidentiality, as
                         needed, as well as data and system integrity, cind availability.


                         The initiation phase is the series of steps followed to ensure that security
                         requirements are considered and resolved as new information systems and
                         technologies cire planned.

 Beiiavioral Outcome         —     Individuals are able to evaluate planning documents associated with
                                   a particular system to ensure that appropriate IT security
                                   requirements have been considered and incorporated.
