and transactions implemented, and the response times for the types of functions and
transactions under those respective workloads.

FR:3.15 The CKMS design shall specify the techniques that are supported and can be
used to scale the system to increased workload demands.

FR:3.16 The CKMS design shall specify the extent to which the CKMS can be scaled to
meet increased workload demands. This shall be expressed in terms of additional
workload, response times for the workload, and cost.

4. Security Policies
A CKMS must be designed in a manner that supports the goals of each organization
using the CKMS. Several types of policies will influence the design and use of a CKMS.

An organization may have different policies covering different applications or categories
of information. For example, a military-related organization may have one set of policies
covering classified information and a totally different set of policies covering personnel
information.

An organization often creates and relies on layered policies, with high-level policies
addressing issues at the information-management level and lower-level policies
addressing specific rules for data-protection. A physical security policy may be specified
in one document, and a communication security policy may be specified in another
document. Computer systems are often built in accordance with their own computer
security policy.

Layers of policies (e.g., information management, information security, physical security,
computer security, communications security, and cryptographic key security) interrelate
in many ways. Intermediate and lower layers of a policy hierarchy should provide more
details on implementation and enforcement than the next higher layer. For example, an
organizational Information Management Policy specifying that information must be
protected against unauthorized disclosure should result in an Information Security Policy
specifying the restriction of access to and use of the information only to properly
identified and authorized people.

An organization may use a hierarchy of policies that will determine their requirements for
a CKMS. Figure 7 provides an example of the policies that may be used and their
relationships. Further discussion about these policies is provided in the following
subsections.
