there is still need for a well-defined, established organizational path for selecting one or a
combination of the risk responses of acceptance, avoidance, mitigation, sharing, or transfer.
Organizations are often placed in situations where there is greater risk than the designated senior
leaders/executives desire to accept. Some risk acceptance will likely be necessary. It might be
possible to avoid risk or to share or transfer risk, and some risk mitigation is probably feasible.
Avoiding risk may require selective reengineering of organizational mission/business processes
and forgoing some of the benefits being accrued by the use of information technology
organization-wide, perhaps even what organizations perceive as necessary benefits. Mitigating
risk requires expenditure of limited resources and may quickly become cost-ineffective due to the
pragmatic realities of the degree of mitigation that can actually be achieved. Lastly, risk sharing
and transfer have ramifications as well, some of which if not unacceptable, may be undesirable.
The risk response strategies of organizations empower senior leaders/executives to make risk-
based decisions compliant with the goals, objectives, and broader organizational perspectives.

H.2 RISK ACCEPTANCE STRATEGIES
Organizational risk acceptance strategies are essential companions to organizational statements
of risk tolerance. The objective of establishing an organizational risk tolerance is to state in clear
and unambiguous terms, a limit for risk—that is, how far organizations are willing to go with
regard to accepting risk to organizational operations (including missions, functions, image, and
reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. Real-world
operations, however, are seldom so simple as to make such risk tolerance statements the end-
statement for risk acceptance decisions. Organizational risk acceptance strategies place the
acceptance of risk into a framework of organizational perspectives on dealing with the practical
realities of operating with risk and provide the guidance necessary to ensure that the extent of the
risk being accepted in specific situations is compliant with organizational direction.

H.3 RISK AVOIDANCE STRATEGIES
Of all the risk response strategies, organizational risk avoidance strategies may be the key to
achieving adequate risk response. The pragmatic realities of the trustworthiness of information
technologies available for use within common resource constraints, make wise use of those
technologies arguably a significant, if not the most significant risk response. Wise use of the
information technologies that compose organizational information systems is fundamentally a
form of risk avoidance—that is, organizations modify how information technologies are used to
change the nature of the risk being incurred (i.e., avoid the risk). Yet such approaches can be in
great tension with organizational desires and in some cases, the mandate to fully automate
mission/business processes. Organizations proactively address this dilemma so that: (i) senior
leaders/executives (and other organizational officials making risk-based decisions) are held
accountable for only that which is within their ability to affect; and (ii) decision makers can make
the difficult risk decisions that may, in fact, be in the best interests of organizations.

H.4 RISK SHARING AND TRANSFER STRATEGIES
Organizational risk sharing strategies and risk transfer strategies are key elements in enabling
risk decisions for specific organizational missions/business functions at Tier 2 or organizational
information systems at Tier 3. Risk sharing and transfer strategies both consider and take full
advantage of a lessening of risk by sharing/transferring the potential impact across other internal
organizational elements or with other external organizations—making the case that some other
entities are, in fact, wholly (transfer) or partly (share) responsible and accountable for risk. For
risk sharing or risk transfer to be effective risk responses, the impact on the local environment
(e.g., mission/business processes or information systems) must be addressed by the sharing or
