                            GUIDE TO PROTECTING THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION (PII)



1.    Introduction

1.1   Authority

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed this document in furtherance of its
statutory responsibilities under the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002,
Public Law 107-347.

NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements, for
providing adequate information security for all agency operations and assets, but such standards and
guidelines shall not apply to national security systems. This guideline is consistent with the requirements
of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Section 8b(3), ―Securing Agency
Information Systems,‖ as analyzed in A-130, Appendix IV: Analysis of Key Sections. Supplemental
information is provided in A-130, Appendix III.

This guideline has been prepared for use by Federal agencies, also referred to as organizations in the
guide. It may be used by nongovernmental organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to
copyright, though attribution is desired.

Nothing in this document should be taken to contradict standards and guidelines made mandatory and
binding on Federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory authority, nor should these
guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the Secretary of Commerce,
Director of the OMB, or any other Federal official.

1.2   Purpose and Scope

The purpose of this document is to assist Federal agencies in protecting the confidentiality of personally
identifiable information (PII) in information systems. The document explains the importance of
protecting the confidentiality of PII in the context of information security and explains its relationship to
privacy using the Fair Information Practices, which are the principles underlying most privacy laws and
privacy best practices. PII should be protected from inappropriate access, use, and disclosure. This
document provides practical, context-based guidance for identifying PII and determining what level of
protection is appropriate for each instance of PII. The document also suggests safeguards that may offer
appropriate levels of protection for PII and provides recommendations for developing response plans for
incidents involving PII. Organizations are encouraged to tailor the recommendations to meet their
specific requirements.

1.3   Audience

The primary audience for this document is the individuals who apply policies and procedures for
protecting the confidentiality of PII on Federal information systems, as well as technical and non-
technical personnel involved with implementing system-level changes concerning PII protection methods.
Individuals in many roles should find this document useful, including chief privacy officers and other
privacy officers, privacy advocates, privacy support staff, public affairs staff, compliance officers, human
resources staff, system administrators, chief information security officers, information system security
officers, information security support staff, computer security incident response teams, and chief
information officers.
