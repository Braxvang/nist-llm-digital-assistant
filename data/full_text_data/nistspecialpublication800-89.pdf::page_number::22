         acquisition of time t2. In particular, expected transmission times between various
         parties who must exchange information should be considered when selecting d.
Depending on the trustworthiness of the estimated tA, a relying party may initially have a
HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW level of assurance that the owner of the key pair is in
possession of the private key between times tA − (a−d) and tA + (b−d) (see Sections
6.3.1.3 and 6.3.2.2) If the assurance level is initially determined to be either HIGH or
MEDIUM, assurance that the owner possesses the private key degrades between times tA
+ (b−d) and tA + (b−d) + c to a LOW level. The relying party has only a LOW level of
assurance that the owner possesses the private key after time tA + (b−d) + c.
After degrading in level, the process of explicitly providing/obtaining assurance of
private key possession shall be repeated if a higher level of assurance is required.

6.3      Explicitly Providing/Obtaining Assurance of Private Key Possession
Assurance of an owner’s possession of the private key that corresponds to the public key
may be explicitly provided/obtained in one or more of the following ways:
      1. Generation of a (fresh) digital signature by an entity that purports to be the owner
         (i.e., the claimed signatory), followed by a verification of the resulting signature
         using the owner’s public key;
      2. Regeneration of the entire key pair, followed by a successful comparison of the
         newly-generated key pair with the key pair currently held by the owner;
      3. Regeneration of one key of the key pair from the currently-held value of the other
         key of that pair, followed by a successful comparison of the newly-generated key
         value with the value currently held by the owner.
Note that the regeneration methods are only applicable to the key pair owner or an entity
that is trusted by the owner with knowledge of the private key. Regeneration might, for
example, be used to provide assurance that a key pair generated by a TTP is correct, or
might be performed much later than the original generation to obtain assurance that the
private key is still correct.
An owner shall obtain assurance of possession either through independent action or by
interacting with a trusted party (see Section 6.5.1). An entity who will act as a TTP shall
obtain such assurance by interacting with the owner (see Section 6.5.2). Other relying
parties shall obtain assurance of the owner’s possession of the correct private key either
from a TTP or by interacting with the owner (see Section 6.5.3).
The time at which assurance of private key possession was explicitly provided shall be
recorded (as accurately as possible). This (approximate) assurance_time may be used to
assess the degree of confidence a relying party may have that the owner (or claimed
signatory of a message) was/is in possession of the private key at some other point in
time.
The time may be obtained from any number of sources, some more trustworthy than
others. For example, the following time sources are listed in decreasing order of
trustworthiness: 1) a (signed) timestamp obtained from an authority that is trusted by the
