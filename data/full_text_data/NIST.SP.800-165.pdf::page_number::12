     Overview:
                                                                (301) 975-8077
     Federal agencies, industry, and the public rely on
    cryptography for the protection of information and
    communications used in electronic commerce, critical
    infrastructure, and other application areas. At the
    core of all products offering cryptographic services
    is the cryptographic module. Cryptographic modules,
    which contain cryptographic algorithms, are used in
    products and systems to provide security services
    such as confidentiality, integrity, and authentication.
    Although cryptography is used to provide security,
    weaknesses such as poor design or weak algorithms can
    render a product insecure and place highly sensitive
    information at risk. When protecting their sensitive
    data, federal government agencies require a minimum
    level of assurance that cryptographic products meet
    their security requirements. Also, federal agencies are
    required to use only tested and validated cryptographic
    modules. Adequate testing and validation of the
    cryptographic module and its underlying cryptographic
    algorithms against established standards is essential to
    provide security assurance.

     The group’s testing-focused activities include
    validating cryptographic algorithm implementations,
    cryptographic modules, and Security Content
    Automation Protocol (SCAP)-compliant products;
    developing test suites and test methods; providing
    implementation guidance and technical support to
    industry forums; and conducting education, training,
    and outreach programs.

     All of the Security Testing, Validation, and
    Measurement Group’s validation programs work
    together with independent Cryptographic and Security
    Testing laboratories that are accredited by the NIST
    National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program
    (NVLAP). Based on the independent laboratory test
