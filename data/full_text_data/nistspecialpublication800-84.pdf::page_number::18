GUIDE TO TEST, TRAINING, AND EXERCISE PROGRAMS FOR IT PLANS AND CAPABILITIES



outline all elements of the program and ensure that information surrounding the program is documented.
In addition to creating the TT&E plan, other major steps in creating a TT&E program are as follows:

     Develop comprehensive TT&E policy. The policy should outline the organization’s internal
      and external requirements associated with training personnel, exercising plans, and testing
      components and systems.
     Identify TT&E roles and responsibilities. The TT&E program should be managed by a person
      or team with direct responsibility for the organization’s IT planning capability. The program
      should have a plan coordinator who is responsible for all aspects of IT planning, including the
      TT&E element of maintaining the IT plans. The plan coordinator has overall responsibility for
      the TT&E plan, including development, implementation, and maintenance. The plan coordinator
      should identify a TT&E program coordinator, who is responsible for developing a TT&E plan
      and coordinating events. Depending on the type of event conducted, the TT&E program
      coordinator works with one or more design teams.
     Establish overall TT&E schedule. The TT&E plan should document the projected schedule of
      activities to be performed within the TT&E program. Although events should be conducted as
      needed, organizations should evaluate the required frequency of its events and document the
      frequency of each event in a TT&E schedule.
     Document the TT&E event methodology. As part of creating a TT&E program, an
      organization should select and document a high-level methodology for planning and performing
      TT&E events. Although the details of each phase typically vary based on the type of event
      conducted, the same phases should be used for each event. One commonly used methodology
      has the following phases:

        –   Design. The TT&E program coordinator works with the plan coordinator to determine the
            TT&E event topic and scope based on the current needs of the organization. Next, the TT&E
            program coordinator identifies the objectives based on the topic and scope, and the personnel
            that should participate in the event. The TT&E program coordinator identifies an event
            design team, which may consist of one person or a group of people, depending on the
            requirements of the event. The TT&E program coordinator also oversees the event logistics.

        –   Development. The TT&E program coordinator works with the design team on the
            development of the documentation to be used before, during, and after the event. Examples
            include briefing materials, participant manuals, and evaluation criteria.

        –   Conduct. In this phase, the event is conducted—the personnel are trained, the IT plans
            exercised, or the systems or system components tested. The details of the conduct phase vary
            greatly by event type.

        –   Evaluation. This phase involves analyzing the event and identifying lessons learned, both to
            improve the IT plans and their execution, and to improve the TT&E process.
