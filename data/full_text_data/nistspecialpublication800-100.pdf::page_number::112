Chapter 11                Certification, Accreditation, and Security Assessments


   • Supporting rationale for the decision – justification for the authorizing official’s
     decision; and
   • Terms and conditions for the authorization – limitations or restrictions placed
     on the operation of the system to which the system owner is bound.
    The contents of security certification and accreditation-related documentation,
especially information dealing with information system vulnerabilities, should be
marked and protected appropriately in accordance with agency policy, and retained
in accordance with the agency’s record retention policy.

11.6 Continuous Monitoring
   The Continuous Monitoring phase is an essential component in any security
program. During this phase, the status of the security controls in the information
system are checked on an ongoing basis. An effective continuous monitoring
program can be used to support the annual FISMA requirement for assessing the
security controls in information systems. At a minimum, an effective monitoring
program requires the following:
   • Configuration management and configuration control processes for the
     information system;
   • Security impact analyses on changes to the information system; and
   • Assessment of selected security controls in the information system and
     reporting of information system security status to appropriate agency officials.
    To determine which security controls to select for review, agencies should first
prioritize testing on POA&M items that become closed. These newly implemented
controls should be validated. Agencies should test against system-related security
control changes that occurred but did not constitute a major change necessitating a
new C&A. Agencies should identify all security controls that are continuously
monitored as annual testing and evaluation activities. Examples of this include (but
are not limited to) ongoing security training, Denial of Service and Malicious Code
protection activities, Intrusion Detection monitoring, Log File reviews, etc. Once this
is completed, agencies should look at the remaining controls that have not been
tested for that year and make a decision on further annual testing based on risk,
importance of control, and date of last test.
   The results of continuous monitoring should be reported to the authorizing official
and senior agency information security officer on a regular basis and any necessary
updates made to the system security plan. A continuous monitoring reporting form is
provided in NIST SP 800-53A.

11.7 Program Assessments
    FISMA requires each agency to develop, document, and implement an agency-
wide information security program to provide information security for the information
and information systems that support the operations and assets of the agency,
including those provided or managed by another agency, contractor, or other source.
   To ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of information security controls, FISMA
requires agency program officials and CIOs to conduct annual reviews of the
agency’s information security program and report the results to OMB. OMB uses this
data to assist in its oversight responsibilities and to prepare an annual report to
Congress on agency compliance with FISMA.
