These elements are explained in detail in the subsequent sections. The VDPO should consider
basing its specific policies and processes on guidelines and procedures used by the FCB and
similar VDPOs. It does not have to develop or implement these policies and processes in
isolation.
In performing these duties, a VDPO will implement the vulnerability disclosure standard
[ISOIEC_29147]. It will also provide oversight and support for system owners who perform the
vulnerability handling duties described in [ISOIEC_30111]. This document augments rather than
replaces the requirements and recommendations provided in these standards to address systems
and software development utilized by the U.S. Government. 10

3.2.1. Development of Source Vulnerability Report Acceptance Policies
Each VDPO is urged to adopt the generic policy of their associated FCB member, with
modifications as appropriate. 11 Existing agency policies can be found in Appendix C. A publicly
available external policy as well as an internal policy should be developed. In alignment with
[BOD20-01], the external policy should detail the methods by which to report a vulnerability to
the affected systemâ€™s ITSO, as well as expectations for the acknowledgement and resolution of
vulnerability disclosure reports. It should also describe the rules of engagement to be followed
when probing agency systems for vulnerabilities and how deeply to probe upon the discovery of
a vulnerability. This is particularly relevant to security researchers, whether or not it is tied to
bug bounty programs. The policy should include a commitment to not recommend or pursue
legal action against the reporter if the rules are followed, as well as information on eligibility for
public recognition and/or a potential bounty (i.e., financial payout), if available.
The internal policy governs the rules and procedures for handling, coordinating, and resolving
received vulnerability reports; the mechanisms used to track the reports; and the expectations for
communication with reporters and other stakeholders. Expected response and remediation
timelines for handling vulnerability reports should be specified, as well as a procedure to follow
when working with the FCB to publish advisories and distribute remediations (e.g., patches) to
users of vulnerable agency software. The policy may also specify the levels of testing required
for the remediation of agency systems and any remediation hurdles that may exist (e.g., for
legacy systems).

3.2.2. Monitoring of Source Vulnerability Reports
VDPOs should monitor their reporting mechanisms for new reports and communications related
to existing reports. VDPOs should also monitor public sources for vulnerability reports and the
organizational communications channels that are likely to receive them, such as customer service
and support.
