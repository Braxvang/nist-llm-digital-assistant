3.1           Definition and Purpose


The Security Basics and Literacy level on the learning continuum is the transition between
awareness and training. To draw an analogy with reading literacy, "awareness" is equivalent to
reading readiness, whereby the child learns to recognize and memorize the letters of the alphabet.
Then, at the transitional level, the child learns to use the alphabet and principles of grammar and
sentence structure to read and become literate. The ability to read is the foundation for further,
specific learning. So, too, are Security Basics and Literacy the foundation for further specific
learning related to one's role(s) with respect to IT systems.


rr Security literacy must not be confused with the term "computer literacy," which refers to an
individual's familiarity with a basic set of knowledge needed to use a computer.                       IT Security
literacy refers to an individual' s familiarity with           —and ability to apply—          a core knowledge set
( i.e.,       "IT security basics ") needed to protect electronic information and systems. Just as
computer literacy is a generic foundation, i.e., is not geared to specific technology or
application(s), so, too, is security literacy a one-size-fits-all foundation for further learning; it is
not geared to any specific system. All individuals who use computer technology or its output
products, regardless of their specific job responsibilities, must know IT security basics and be
able to apply them.


The next step beyond IT Security Basics and Literacy is to focus individuals' ongoing learning on
their respective job functions and the system(s) they are involved with.                       That focusing step or
stage constitutes the beginning level of specific, role-based IT security training, and is covered in
Chapter 4, Training Development Methodology: Role-Based Training. In Chapter 4,
"beginning" refers to the beginning of FT security skills training, a logical segue from the
knowledge base established here.

The Security Basics and Literacy level has the following learning objectives:

      •         To ensure that the student knows the "alphabet," i.e., a core set of key terms and essential
                concepts which comprises IT security and is essential for the protection of information
                and systems. (Many of the terms and concepts should have been previously introduced to
                the learner in an agency's awareness briefings or activities. In that case. Security Basics
                and Literacy properly provides reinforcement and structure.)

      •         To establish the principles for "reading" or "using the alphabet."

          •     To promote personal responsibility and positive behavioral change.
