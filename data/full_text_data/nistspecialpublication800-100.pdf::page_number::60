CHAPTER 6                                                   Interconnecting Systems


   • Describe the information systems that will be connected;
   • Identify the sensitivity or classification level of data that will be made available,
     exchanged, or passed one way across the interconnection;
   • Identify personnel who will establish and maintain the interconnection and
     specify their responsibilities;
   • Identify implementation tasks and procedures;
   • Identify and describe security controls that will be used to protect the
     confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the connected systems and data;
   • Provide test procedures and measurement criteria to ensure that the
     interconnection operates properly and securely;
   • Specify training requirements for users, including a training schedule; and
   • Cite or include all relevant documentation, such as system security plans,
     design specifications, and standard operating procedures (SOPs).

Step 2: Execute the Implementation Plan
   After the implementation plan is developed, it should be reviewed and approved
by senior members of the planning team and then executed. A list of recommended
tasks for establishing an interconnection includes:
   • Implement or configure security controls;
   • Install or configure hardware and software;
   • Integrate applications;
   • Conduct operational and security assessments;
   • Conduct security training and awareness;
   • Update system security plans; and
   • Perform recertification and reaccreditation.
   Procedures associated with each task should be described in the implementation
plan.

Step 3: Activate the Interconnection
   Both parties should activate the interconnection following the implementation
plan execution. Each agency should closely and frequently examine the system’s
audit logs and the types of assistance requested by the system’s users during this
time to ensure that it operates properly and securely. Lastly, the appropriate agency
should promptly document and address any security weaknesses or problems.

6.2.3 Phase 3: Maintaining the Interconnection
    After the interconnection is established, the participating organizations must
actively maintain it to ensure that it operates properly and securely. The following
activities are recommended for maintaining the interconnection:
   • Maintain the equipment;
   • Manage user profiles;
   • Conduct security reviews;
   • Analyze audit logs;
   • Report and respond to security incidents;
   • Coordinate contingency planning activities;
   • Perform change management; and
   • Maintain system security plans.
