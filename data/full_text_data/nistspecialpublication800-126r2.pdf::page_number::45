                   The Technical Specification for the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.2



set to “true”, then the result of each evaluated OVAL Definition SHALL be recorded as a separate
<xccdf:rule-result> element. In this case the <xccdf:rule-result/xccdf:check-
content-ref> element SHALL identify the specific check result of each evaluated OVAL Definition
using the @href and @name attributes as described in Section 4.5, item 8.

4.6     OVAL Results
The following requirements and recommendations pertain to content consumers generating OVAL result
data stream components.
Each OVAL result data stream component SHALL validate against version 5.10 of the OVAL Results
schema19 regardless of the version of the OVAL Definitions document that was evaluated.
An SCAP OVAL result data stream component SHALL include the results of every OVAL Definition
used to generate the reported results.
In order to be SCAP conformant, an SCAP content consumer SHALL be able to produce all the types of
OVAL Results output described below. The specific result output SHALL be configurable within the
SCAP content consumer.
In order to support SCAP instances where OVAL thin content (only the ID of the definition and the
results) is preferred, SCAP content consumers SHALL support all valid values for the <oval-
res:directives> controlling the expected content of the results file.
To support the ability for results to be consumed by the appropriate product(s), data results SHALL be
expressed as Single Machine Without System Characteristics, Single Machine With System
Characteristics, or Single Machine With Thin Results as follows:

      1. Single Machine Without System Characteristics – A single result file that includes the results of
         all OVAL Definitions evaluated and “full” results types as described in the <oval-
         res:ContentEnumeration> element, without system characteristics.
          For this format, the values for the <oval-res:directives> element SHALL be:
          <oval-res:directives include_source_definitions="false">
             <oval-res:definition_true content="full" reported="true"/>
             <oval-res:definition_false content="full" reported="true"/>
             <oval-res:definition_unknown content="full" reported="true"/>
             <oval-res:definition_error content="full" reported="true"/>
             <oval-res:definition_not_evaluated content="full" reported="true"/>
             <oval-res:definition_not_applicable content="full" reported="true"/>
          </oval-res:directives>

          When creating the OVAL System Characteristics as defined by the <oval-
          sc:oval_system_characteristics> element, the <oval-sc:collected_objects> and
          <oval-sc:system_data> elements SHALL NOT be provided.

      2. Single Machine With System Characteristics – A single result file that includes the results of all
         OVAL Definitions evaluated and “full” results types as described in the <oval-
         res:ContentEnumeration> element and the System Characteristics of the target evaluated.
          For this format, the values for the <oval-res:directives> element SHALL be:
          <oval-res:directives include_source_definitions="false">
