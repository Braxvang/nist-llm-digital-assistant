                                                                                               In Figure 1, 15 sensors are shown – the blue sensors indicate that these 2 sensors are ‘somehow’
                                                                                               failing and at specific times, that is, they are not satisfying their purpose and expectations. As

                                                                                               related to data quality. Further the temporal failure modes for sensors may be actually a result of
                                                                                               the transport of that data failing, and not the sensors themselves. Consider also that the two

                                                                                               15 sensors clustered into 3 clusters with 5 unique sensors assigned to each. Figure 1 shows the
                                                                                               data coming out from each of the three clusters as being inputted to 3 corresponding aggregators.
                                                                                               It is now the responsibility of the 3 aggregators to turn those 15 sensor inputs into 3 intermediate

                                                                                               aggregator A 1 might be determining how busy restaurant X is. Five independent sensors in C 1
                                                                                               could be taking pictures from inside and outside (parking lot) of X, room temperature
                                                                                               measurement in the kitchen, motion detectors from the dining area, sound and volume sensors,
                                                                                               light detectors, etc. So while the sensors are certainly not homogeneous, their data is processed to
                                                                                               make a new piece of data to address one question with possible results such as is the restaurant
