1358   6.1.2.2. RP-Managed Bound Authenticators
1359   When the bound authenticator is managed by the RP as in Fig. 10, the IdP SHALL
1360   include an indicator in the assertion that the assertion is to be used with a bound
1361   authenticator at FAL3. The unique identifier for the authenticator (such as its public key)
1362    SHALL be stored in the RP subscriber account.

1363   Before an RP can successfully accept an FAL3 assertion, the RP subscriber account must
1364   include a bound authenticator. These authenticators can be provided by either the RP or
1365   the subscriber, with slightly different requirements applying to the initial binding of the
1366   authenticator to the RP subscriber account in each case.
1367   For RP-provided authenticators, the administrator of the RP SHALL issue the
