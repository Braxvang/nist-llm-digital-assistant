NIST SP 800-207A                                          ZTA Model for Access Control in Cloud-Native
September 2023                                              Applications in Multi-Location Environments


NIST’s guidance on zero trust also contains an abstract definition of zero trust architecture and
gives general deployment models and use cases with which zero trust could improve an
enterprise’s overall information technology security posture.

       Relationship to Other NIST Guidance Documents
Since the current document provides guidance for the realization of ZTA for cloud-native
applications hosted in multiple locations (on-premises and multiple clouds) and the enforcement
of ZT principles requires policies that are associated with various security services, it will be
useful to refer to the following documents. These documents provide background information for
the architecture of a microservices-based application with service mesh as well as guidance for
configuring specific security services. The current document expands the reference environment
to one in which the Information Technology (IT) application infrastructure of an enterprise spans
multiple premises and multiple cloud provider locations as well as addresses the range of policies
that is required for comprehensive security assurance.
   •   SP 800-204A, Building Secure Microservices-Based Applications Using Service Mesh
       Architecture [2], provides deployment guidance for various security services (e.g.,
       establishment of secure sessions, security monitoring) for a microservices-based
       application using a dedicated infrastructure (i.e., a service mesh) based on service proxies
       that operate independently of the application code.
   •   SP 800-204B, Attribute-Based Access Control for Microservices-Based Applications
       Using a Service Mesh [3], provides deployment guidance for building an authentication
       and authorization framework within the service mesh that meets the security
       requirements. This may include establishing (1) zero trust by enabling mutual
       authentication in communication between any pair of services and (2) a robust access
       control mechanism based on an access control model (e.g., the attribute-based access
       control [ABAC] model) that can be used to express a wide set of policies and is scalable
       in terms of user base, objects (resources), and deployment environment.

       Scope
The scope of this document includes:
   •   Identifying the requirements for realizing a ZTA for granular access control in
       microservices-based application platforms that include a service mesh infrastructure.
   •   Identifying the infrastructural elements that should be part of the platform in order to
       configure and implement ZT principles.
   •   Guidance for deploying a ZTA in the above platform and outlining the security
       assurances that the deployment can provide.
   •   Recommend multi-tier policies that combine network-level (both coarse-grained and
       fine-grained) and identity-tier policies for enforcing ZT principles.
