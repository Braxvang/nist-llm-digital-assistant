                                                       GUIDE TO SECURITY FOR FULL VIRTUALIZATION TECHNOLOGIES



4.    Security Recommendations for Virtualization Components

The security of a full virtualization solution is heavily dependent on the individual security of each of its
components, including the hypervisor, host computer, and host OS (if applicable), guest OSs,
applications, and storage. Organizations should secure all of these elements and maintain their security
based on sound security practices, such as restricting access to administrative interfaces, keeping software
up-to-date with security patches, using secure configuration baselines, performing monitoring and
analysis of logs at all layers of the solution, and using host-based firewalls, antivirus software, or other
appropriate mechanisms to detect and stop attacks.

Following these recommendations alone is not sufficient to secure a virtualization solution. Virtualization
can be used in many ways, so the appropriate security controls for each situation vary. This section
discusses common threats against virtualization solutions and provides recommendations for countering
these threats. With this information, organizations will be able to apply the risk management framework
outlined in NIST SP 800-37 Revision 1, Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal
Information Systems: A Security Life Cycle Approach to more accurately assess the risks associated with
virtualization.

In general, organizations should have the same security controls in place for the virtualized operating
systems as they have for the same operating systems running directly on hardware. The same is true for
applications running on guest OSs: if the organization has a security policy for an application, it should
apply the same regardless of whether the application is running on an OS within a hypervisor or on an OS
running on hardware.

4.1   Hypervisor Security

The programs that control the hypervisor should be secured using methods similar to those used to protect
other software running on desktops and servers. The security of the entire virtual infrastructure relies on
the security of the virtualization management system that controls the hypervisor and allows the operator
to start guest OSs, create new guest OS images, and perform other actions. Because of the security
implications of these actions, access to the virtualization management system should be restricted to
authorized administrators only. Some virtualization management systems allow different level of access
to different users, such as giving some users read-only access to the administrative interface of a guest
OS, other users control over particular guest OSs, and yet other users complete administrative control.
Most hypervisor software currently only uses passwords for access control; this may be too weak for
some organizationsâ€™ security policies and may require the use of compensating controls, such as a
separate authentication system used for restricting access to the host on which the virtualization
management system is installed.

Hypervisors can be managed in different ways, with some hypervisors allowing management through
multiple methods. It is important to secure each hypervisor management interface, both locally and
remotely accessible. The capability for remote administration can usually be enabled or disabled in the
virtualization management system. If remote administration is enabled in a hypervisor, access to all
remote administration interfaces should be restricted by a firewall. Also, hypervisor management
communications should be protected. One option is to have a dedicated management network that is
separate from all other networks and that can only be accessed by authorized administrators. Management
communications carried on untrusted networks must be encrypted using FIPS-approved methods,
provided by either the virtualization solution or a third-party solution, such as a virtual private network
(VPN) that encapsulates the management traffic.
