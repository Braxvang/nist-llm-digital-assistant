3.2.1    Identity Management Architectures

There are three major identity architectures 29 available for use in Web services:

 Isolated identity management. Isolated identity management is the architecture used by most Web
  applications on the Internet. In isolated identity management, service providers act both as a
  credential provider and identity provider. This simplifies management for a single service and
  negates the need for a TTP to handle either the credentials or providers. The drawback for an isolated
  identity management system is that every service must know the credentials and identifiers for all
  authorized requesters. In a large SOA, administering each provider may become unmanageable.
 Federated identity management. In identity federation, a group of providers agrees to recognize
  user identifiers from one another. Each service provider acts as a credential and identity provider for
  a subset of requesters. By issuing assertions (e.g., SAML authentication and attribute assertions), a
  service provider can supply other providers with the necessary information about the requester
  without requiring the requester to authenticate a second time. This simplifies identity and credential
  management for the SOA as a whole, but requires individual services to be aware of and trust
  assertions from one another. In a single enterprise-wide SOA, it may not be difficult for providers to
  trust one another, but they may be less willing to trust assertions when the SOA includes providers
  from different organizations. A requester in the SOA may make a request to a provider and supply an
  arbitrary assertion to gain access. In identity federation, it is important to develop organizational
  policies appropriate for the types of data that traverse the SOA.
 Centralized identity management. In centralized identity management, providers rely on a single
  TTP to provide credentials and identifiers to requesters. Centralized identity management is similar
  to federated identity management in that the identity and credential providers supply assertions
  directly to service providers, allowing requesters access without authenticating a second time. In this
  architecture, individual service providers need only be aware of the identity provider. In a cross-
  organizational SOA, organizations may be willing to trust another organization's identity providers
  more than individual services. A major drawback of the centralized identity management architecture
  is that the identity providers may act as a single point of failure. Should all of an organization's
  identity providers suffer a DoS, it will not be possible for providers to accept any requests.
When developing a new SOA or updating an existing SOA, it is important to consider the size of the SOA
and the organization's priorities. One or more of these architectures may not be suitable for SOAs of a
certain size or may violate organizational policies.

3.2.2    Laws of Identity

In May 2005, Kim Cameron, Identity and Access Architect at Microsoft, authored The Laws of Identity 30
based on his research into the requirements for a unified identity metasystem, a system of identity systems
that exposes a unified interface for disparate underlying identity technologies. Organizations that follow
these laws when developing or deploying an identity management architecture will be able to better
support cross-organizational collaboration. The seven laws are as follows:

 User Control and Consent. Identity systems must not reveal identifying information without the
  user's consent.

     The concept of isolated, federated and centralized identity management architectures is drawn from “Trust requirements in
     identity management,” available at http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1082290.1082305.
