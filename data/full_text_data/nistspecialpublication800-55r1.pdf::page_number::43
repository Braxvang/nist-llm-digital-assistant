continuous implementation of applicable security controls. Once effectiveness/efficiency
measures are implemented, they will facilitate an understanding of whether the security control
performance goals, identified in the information security policies and procedures, are realistic
and appropriate.

For example, if an information security policy defines a specific password configuration,
compliance with this policy could be determined by measuring the percentage of passwords that
are configured according to the policy. This measure addresses the level of security control
implementation. It is assumed that configuring all passwords according to the policy will
significantly reduce, if not eliminate, information system compromises through broken
passwords. To measure effectiveness of the existing password policy implementation, the
percentage of passwords crackable by common password-breaking tools could be identified.
This measure addresses the effectiveness of the security control as implemented. If a significant
percentage of crackable passwords remains after the required password policy has been
implemented, the logical conclusion is that the underlying policy may be ineffective in thwarting
password compromises. If this is the case, an organization will need to consider strengthening
the policy or implementing other mitigating measures. Costs and benefits of keeping the
password policy as is, tightening it, or replacing password authentication with other techniques
must also be determined. Conducting cost-benefit analyses will generate business impact
measures to address the issue of redefining information system identification and authentication
objectives and appropriately realign these objectives with the information system mission.
