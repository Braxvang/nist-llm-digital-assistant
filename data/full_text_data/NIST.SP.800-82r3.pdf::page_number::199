NIST SP 800-82r3                                                                   Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security

     •    [M][D] Ukrainian power grid, BlackEnergy3. 18 On December 23, 2015, Ukrainian
          power companies experienced a cyberattack that caused power outages and impacted
          over 225,000 customers in Ukraine. Over 50 regional substations experienced malicious
          remote operation of their breakers. KillDisk malware was used to erase files on targeted
          systems, including at least one Windows-based HMI. The actors also corrupted the
          firmware of serial-to-Ethernet devices at the substations. This was the first known cyber
          attack on a power grid.
     •    [M][D] Ukrainian power grid, Industroyer. 19 On December 17, 2016, a cyber attack
          occurred at a substation outside of Kyiv, Ukraine, and resulted in an outage for customers
          of one substation for approximately one hour. This attack was the first known malware
          specifically designed to attack the power grid.
     •    [M][I] Maersk, NotPetya. In 2017, the NotPetya malware encrypted computers globally
          with no method for decryption. Although the malware initially targeted Ukrainian
          companies, it spread throughout the world with significant impacts to Maersk, FedEx,
          Merck, and Saint-Gobain. The malware destroyed data and disrupted shipping operations
          for Maersk, costing the company over $300 million in repairs and recovery efforts.
     •    [M][D] Saudi Petrochem, TRITON.20 A petrochemical facility in Saudi Arabia was
          attacked using malicious software that targeted the industrial SIS. The SIS initiated a safe
          shutdown of the petrochemical process in 2017 when the triple-redundant processors
          identified mismatched code amongst the processors.
     •    [M][I] Norsk Hydro, LockerGoga. 21 In March 2019, Norsk Hydro experienced a
          cyberattack that used LockerGoga ransomware to encrypt its computer files. The
          aluminum and renewable energy company transitioned to manual operations and was
          transparent with the public on its progress to recovery. Norsk Hydro’s transparency
          throughout the discovery and recovery process is well regarded by the security industry.
     •    [M][I] Colonial Pipeline. 22 In May 2021, over 5,500 miles of pipeline transporting more
          than 100 million gallons per day of refined products to the East Coast of the U.S.
          shutdown operations because of a ransomware attack. Colonial Pipeline was a victim of a
          ransomware cyber attack that encrypted their IT systems by exploiting a legacy VPN
          profile. The investigation is ongoing, but at the time of this writing, there is no evidence
          that the ransomware had any direct impact on the OT environment. Colonial made the
          decision to shut down the physical operations on the pipeline to contain any potential
          damage. Colonial Pipeline also decided to pay the ransom to cybercriminal group
          Darkside in order to have all possible tools, including the decryption tools, available to
