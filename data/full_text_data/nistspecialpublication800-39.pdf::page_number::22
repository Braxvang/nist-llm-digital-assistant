•      Develop and implement an organization-wide risk management strategy that guides and
       informs organizational risk decisions (including how risk is framed, assessed, responded to,
       and monitored over time); 26
•      Manage threat and vulnerability information with regard to organizational information
       systems and the environments in which the systems operate;
•      Establish organization-wide forums to consider all types and sources of risk (including
       aggregated risk);
•      Determine organizational risk based on the aggregated risk from the operation and use of
       information systems and the respective environments of operation;
•      Provide oversight for the risk management activities carried out by organizations to ensure
       consistent and effective risk-based decisions;
•      Develop a greater understanding of risk with regard to the strategic view of organizations and
       their integrated operations;
•      Establish effective vehicles and serve as a focal point for communicating and sharing risk-
       related information among key stakeholders internally and externally to organizations;
•      Specify the degree of autonomy for subordinate organizations permitted by parent
       organizations with regard to framing, assessing, responding to, and monitoring risk;27
•      Promote cooperation and collaboration among authorizing officials to include security
       authorization actions requiring shared responsibility (e.g., joint/leveraged authorizations);28
•      Ensure that security authorization decisions consider all factors necessary for mission and
       business success; and
•      Ensure shared responsibility for supporting organizational missions and business functions
       using external providers receives the needed visibility and is elevated to appropriate decision-
       making authorities.

The risk executive (function) presumes neither a specific organizational structure nor formal
responsibility assigned to any one individual or group within the organization. Heads of agencies
or organizations may choose to retain the risk executive (function) or to delegate the function.
The risk executive (function) requires a mix of skills, expertise, and perspectives to understand
the strategic goals and objectives of organizations, organizational missions/business functions,
technical possibilities and constraints, and key mandates and guidance that shape organizational
operations. To provide this needed mixture, the risk executive (function) can be filled by a single
individual or office (supported by an expert staff) or by a designated group (e.g., a risk board,

   Organizational risk decisions include investment decisions (see Section 2.3.4). Organizational risk tolerance is
determined as part of the risk framing component (see Section 2.3.3) and defined in the risk management strategy.
27
   Because subordinate organizations responsible for carrying out derivative or related missions may have already
invested in their own methods of framing, assessing, responding to, and monitoring risk, parent organizations may
allow a greater degree of autonomy within parts of the organization or across the entire organization in order to
minimize costs. When a diversity of risk management activities is allowed, organizations may choose to employ, when
feasible, some means of translation and/or synthesis of the risk-related information produced from those activities to
ensure that the output of the different activities can be correlated in a meaningful manner.
