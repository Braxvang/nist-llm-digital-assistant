                                  GUIDE TO PROTECTING THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION (PII)



2.       Introduction to PII

One of the most widely used terms to describe personal information is PII. Examples of PII range from
an individual‘s name or email address to an individual‘s financial and medical records or criminal history.
Unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of PII can seriously harm both individuals, by contributing to
identity theft, blackmail, or embarrassment, and the organization, by reducing public trust in the
organization or creating legal liability. This section explains how to identify and locate PII 14 maintained
within an organization‘s environment and/or under its control, and it provides an introduction to the Fair
Information Practices. Sections 3 and 4 discuss factors for assigning PII impact levels and selecting
safeguards, respectively. Section 5 discusses incident response for breaches involving PII.

2.1      Identifying PII

PII is ―any information about an individual maintained by an agency, including (1) any information that
can be used to distinguish or trace an individual‘s identity, such as name, social security number, date and
place of birth, mother‘s maiden name, or biometric records; and (2) any other information that is linked or
linkable to an individual, such as medical, educational, financial, and employment information.‖ 15

To distinguish an individual16 is to identify an individual. Some examples of information that could
identify an individual include, but are not limited to, name, passport number, social security number, or
biometric data.17 In contrast, a list containing only credit scores without any additional information
concerning the individuals to whom they relate does not provide sufficient information to distinguish a
specific individual.18

To trace an individual is to process sufficient information to make a determination about a specific aspect
of an individual‘s activities or status. For example, an audit log containing records of user actions could
be used to trace an individual‘s activities.

Linked information is information about or related to an individual that is logically associated with other
information about the individual. In contrast, linkable information is information about or related to an
individual for which there is a possibility of logical association with other information about the
individual. For example, if two databases contain different PII elements, then someone with access to
both databases may be able to link the information from the two databases and identify individuals, as
well as access additional information about or relating to the individuals. If the secondary information
source is present on the same system or a closely-related system and does not have security controls that
effectively segregate the information sources, then the data is considered linked. If the secondary
information source is maintained more remotely, such as in an unrelated system within the organization,
available in public records, or otherwise readily obtainable (e.g., internet search engine), then the data is
considered linkable.

      Even if an organization determines that information is not PII, the organization should still consider whether the information
      is sensitive or has organizational or individual risks associated with it and determine the appropriate protections.

      The terms ―individual‖ and ―individual‘s identity‖ are used interchangeably throughout this document. For additional
      information about the term individual, see Appendix B.

      These data elements are included in a list of identifying information from the Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act
      of 1998, Public Law 105-318, 112 Stat. 3007 (Oct. 30, 1998).
18
      Information elements that are not sufficient to identify an individual when considered separately might nevertheless render
      the individual identifiable when combined with additional information. For instance, if the list of credit scores were to be
      supplemented with information, such as age, address, and gender, it is probable that this additional information would render
      the individuals identifiable.
