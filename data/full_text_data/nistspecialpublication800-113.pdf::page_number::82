                                                                                             GUIDE TO SSL VPNS



 The cryptographic protocol being used must be one that complies with FIPS 140-2.
After creating this policy, the administrator creates similar policies for everyone in the
NormalPartialAccess and HRAccess groups.

The last steps are to configure the management of the SSL VPN itself. In the Administrators command in
the System menu, the administrator changes the default password that came with the system and sets the
range of IP addresses that can be used to administer the system. In the same dialog box, the administrator
also creates additional administrative accounts with limited rights, such as for viewing particular logs.
Under the Backup command in the System menu, the administrator sets up automatic weekly backups to
be sent to an FTP server on the internal network. The SNMP command in the System menu is used to
allow monitoring of the device.

The Replication command in the System menu allows configuration of the high availability feature
described earlier. The administrator enters the address of the other server in the high availability group
and specifies that this server is the “master” of the group.

7.4   Deploying and Managing the Solution

The organization employs a pilot program to deploy the solution. It solicits volunteers who can
contribute their user experience and help to troubleshoot any problems with connectivity or
interoperability. The SSL VPN development staff also produces documentation to help in establishing
VPN connectivity. The documentation assists users in enabling the host integrity checks to be executed
on their hosts, and it addresses frequently asked questions.

7.5   Summary

Section 7 covered a case study for planning and implementing an SSL VPN system for an organization.
The steps described in this section follow the recommendations and guidelines given throughout this
document for choosing and setting up an SSL VPN. It should be emphasized that the scenario described
in this section is for a fictitious organization and that the steps taken by a real organization would likely
be different from those given here.

The portrayed organization first identified its needs based on its current operations and its stated future
goals for secure remote access. In designing the proposed solution, the organization followed the typical
steps of creating both an access control and an endpoint security policy: laying out its methods for
authentication of users, designing an overall architecture for the expected remote access solution,
selecting the hardware needed to meet its goals, specifying where in its current network the hardware will
go, determining whether or not it needs a high availability solution, creating a management policy for the
system and users, selecting the client software, designing the portal that the users will see when they
connect to the system, and developing an encryption policy.

After this design was completed, the organization implemented a prototype of the system before
deploying it fully. The test plan for this prototype involved creating a sample configuration for the
network access, the list of users for the system, definitions of the types of access that will be given to the
users, and a specific policy plan linking the users to the types of access as well as other policy restrictions
on the users.
