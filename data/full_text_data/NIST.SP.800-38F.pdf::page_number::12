                                NIST Special Publication 800-38F



block size                 For a given block cipher and key, the fixed length of the input
                           (or output) bit strings.

ciphertext                 The confidential form of the plaintext that is the output of the
                           authenticated-encryption function.

collision                  In a given context, the equality of two values, usually out of a
                           large number of possible values.

designated cipher          As part of the choice of the underlying block cipher with a
function                   KEK, either the forward transformation or the inverse
                           transformation.

exclusive-OR               The bitwise addition, modulo 2, of two bit strings of equal
                           length.

forward transformation     The permutation of blocks that is determined by the choice of a
                           block cipher and a key.

integrity check value      A fixed string that is prepended to the plaintext within the
                           authenticated-encryption function of a key-wrap algorithm, in
                           order to enable the verification of the integrity of the plaintext
                           within the authenticated-decryption function.

inverse transformation     The inverse of the permutation of blocks that is determined by
                           the choice of a block cipher and a key.

key-encryption key         The key for the underlying block cipher of KW, KWP, or
                           TKW. May be called a key-wrapping key in other documents.

key-wrap algorithm         A deterministic, symmetric-key authenticated-encryption
                           algorithm that is intended for the protection of cryptographic
                           keys. Consists of two functions: authenticated encryption and
                           authenticated decryption.

least significant bit(s)   The right-most bit(s) of a bit string.

most significant bit(s)    The left-most bit(s) of a bit string.

mode                       See “block cipher mode of operation.”

octet                      A string of eight bits. Often referred to as a byte.

plaintext                  The input to the authenticated-encryption function.
