Throughout FY 2021, NIST has made significant progress in advancing methods and guidelines
for managing enterprise risk related to cybersecurity, systems engineering, and privacy. NIST is
leading a multi-year effort to produce a cohesive portfolio of complementary risk management
resources that can be used individually or together to help public and private organizations better
manage technology and data risk under the established umbrella of enterprise risk management
(ERM).
Risk management has been a fundamental driver for organizations for as long as there have
been information and operations to protect. Todayâ€™s proliferation of risk management resources,
combined with advances in technology, increasingly calls for a collaborative approach to managing
discipline-specific risks within the enterprise. This includes the need to ensure that executives,
fiduciaries, managers, risk professionals, developers, and designers work together to manage risk
through established methods of risk management.
Risk Management Framework Updates
NIST continues to update guidance and develop new resources to support the implementation of
the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF) as described in SP 800-37, Revision 2. In FY 2021,
NIST published Managing the Security of Information Exchanges (SP 800-47, Revision 1). This
publication provides guidance on identifying information exchanges, considerations for protecting
exchanged information, and the agreement(s) needed to help manage the protection of the
exchanged information. The latest update of SP 800-47 focuses on managing the risk associated
with the information being exchanged or accessed before, during, and after the exchange rather
than on any type of technology-based connection or information access/exchange method.
NIST also published ISCMA: An Information Security Continuous Monitoring (ISCM) Program
Assessment (NISTIR 8212). NISTIR 8212 provides an example operational approach to the
ISCM program assessment described in Assessing Information Security Continuous Monitoring
