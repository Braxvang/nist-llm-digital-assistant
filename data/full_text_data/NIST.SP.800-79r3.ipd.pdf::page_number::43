       NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                    Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
       December 2023                                                           and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

1284                    Responsibility: EIMO
1285                    Guidance: The operations plan includes, at a minimum, the sections defined in the
1286                    operations plan template in Appendices D.1 or D.2, depending on whether the
1287                    issuer is issuing PIV Cards or derived PIV credentials. An issuer of both PIV
1288                    Cards and derived PIV credentials could develop a single operations plan that
1289                    addresses both without repeating common elements. It is the EIMO’s
1290                    responsibility to ensure that the operations plan incorporates a complete and
1291                    accurate description of the issuer’s operations. If a process or function is provided
1292                    by an external service provider, their operating procedures need to be documented
1293                    and incorporated by reference in the issuer’s operations plan. In such cases, the
1294                    operations plan could point readers to additional documentation and information.
1295                    Subtask 1.2: Confirm that the processes performed are conducted in accordance
1296                    with the policies and procedures specified in the issuer’s operations plan and are
1297                    documented in standard operating procedures.
1298                    Responsibility: EIMO, Issuing Facility Manager
1299                    Guidance: Even though an issuer follows the requirements of [FIPS201], its
1300                    processes need to be consistent within the operations plan and documented in
1301                    standard operating procedures.
1302           Task 2: Resource Identification
1303           The objectives of the resource identification task are to (i) identify and document the
1304           resources required for assisting with the assessment, (ii) identify the scope of the
1305           assessment and authorization boundary, and (iii) prepare a plan of assessment activities
1306           that indicate the proposed schedule and key milestones.
1307                    Subtask 2.1: Identify the SAO, DAO, PO, issuing facility managers, assessor, and
1308                    other key personnel at the facility level who are performing functions, such as
1309                    identity proofing/registration, card/token production, and activation/issuance (of
1310                    the PIV Card or derived PIV credential). Maintenance personnel also need to be
1311                    contacted to provide requested assessment information to the assessor.
1312                    Responsibility: EIMO
1313                    Guidance: Notify these individuals of the upcoming assessment, and inform them
1314                    of the need for their participation during the process.
1315                    Subtask 2.2: Determine the authorization boundary for the issuer.
1316                    Responsibility: EIMO, DAO
1317                    Guidance: The authorization boundary determines the target of the assessment. In
1318                    preparation for the issuer assessment, the EIMO and DAO need to identify which
1319                    issuing facilities and external service providers are to be included. This ensures
1320                    that the functions performed and processes managed by the external service
1321                    provider are considered during the authorization process. An organization could
1322                    consider including only those issuing facilities that are ready to operate within the
1323                    scope of the issuer assessment; other facilities can be assessed at a later date.
