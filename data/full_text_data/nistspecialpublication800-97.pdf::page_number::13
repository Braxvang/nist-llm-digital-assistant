                                    ESTABLISHING WIRELESS ROBUST SECURITY NETWORKS: A GUIDE TO IEEE 802.11I



Organizations should integrate their existing authentication technology with their IEEE 802.11
RSN WLAN to the extent feasible.

Although the RSN framework supports the use of pre-shared keys (PSK), organizations should choose to
implement the IEEE 802.1X standard and EAP for authentication instead of using PSKs because of the
resources needed for proper PSK administration and the security risks involved. IEEE 802.1X and EAP
authentication requires an organization to use an AS, which may necessitate the use of a PKI. An
organization that already has ASs for Web, e-mail, file and print services, and other authentication needs,
should consider integrating this technology into its RSN solution. Most leading network operating
systems and directory solutions offer the support needed for RSN integration.

Organizations should ensure that the confidentiality and integrity of communications between
access points and authentication servers are protected sufficiently.

The data confidentiality and integrity protocol (such as CCMP) used by an IEEE 802.11 RSN protects
communications between STAs and APs. However, IEEE 802.11 and its related standards explicitly state
that protection of the communications between the AP and AS is out of their scope. Therefore,
organizations deploying RSNs should ensure that communications between each AP and its
corresponding ASs are protected sufficiently through cryptography. Also, because of the importance of
the ASs, organizations should pay particular attention to establishing and maintaining their security
through operating system configuration, firewall rules, and other security controls.

Organizations establishing IEEE 802.11 RSNs should use technologies that have the appropriate
security certification from NIST and interoperability certification from the Wi-Fi Alliance.

To implement IEEE 802.11 RSNs, organizations may need to update or replace existing IEEE 802.11
equipment and software that cannot support RSNAs, as well as purchase additional equipment. The
Wi-Fi Alliance, a non-profit industry consortium of WLAN equipment and software vendors, has
established the Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 (WPA2) certification program to give consumers of WLAN
products assurance that their IEEE 802.11i systems can interoperate with similar equipment from other
vendors. Federal agencies should procure WPA2 products that use FIPS-approved encryption algorithms
and have been FIPS-validated. Organizations that plan to use authentication servers as part of their IEEE
802.11 RSN implementations should procure products with the WPA2 Enterprise level certification.
Also, because the WPA2 certification is expanded periodically to test for interoperability with additional
EAP methods, organizations should obtain the latest WPA2 information before making procurement
decisions.

Organizations should ensure that WLAN security considerations are incorporated into each phase
of the WLAN life cycle when establishing and maintaining IEEE 802.11 RSNs.

This guide presents extensive guidance on IEEE 802.11 RSN planning and implementation. It describes a
life cycle model for WLANs and presents best practice recommendations related to WLAN security for
each phase in the life cycle. WLAN security considerations for each phase include the following:

     Phase 1: Initiation. This phase includes the tasks that an organization should perform before it
      starts to design its WLAN solution. These include developing a WLAN use policy, performing a
      WLAN risk assessment, and specifying business and functional requirements for the solution,
      such as mandating RSNAs for all WLAN connections.
     Phase 2: Acquisition/Development. For the purposes of this guide, the
      Acquisition/Development phase is split into the following two phases:



                                                   ES-3
