Table 2-1 does not include all current and pending 802.11 amendments. For example, in November 2005,
IEEE ratified IEEE 802.11e, which provides quality of service enhancements to IEEE 802.11 that
improve the delivery of multimedia content. The IEEE 802.11n project is specifying IEEE 802.11
enhancements that will enable data throughput of at least 100 Mbps. Final working group approval is
expected in January 2008, with an interim Wi-Fi certification sometime in 2007; products based on the
802.11n draft are currently available.

The IEEE 802.11 variants 4 listed in Table 2-1 all include security features known collectively as Wired
Equivalent Privacy (WEP) that are supposed to provide a level of security comparable to that of wired
LANs. As described in Section 3, IEEE 802.11 configurations that rely on WEP have several well-
documented security problems. The IEEE acknowledged the scope of the problems and developed short-
term and long-term strategies for rectifying the situation. In June 2004, the IEEE finalized the 802.11i
amendment, which is designed to overcome the shortcomings of WEP. IEEE 802.11i specifies security
components that work in conjunction with all the IEEE 802.11 radio standards, such as IEEE 802.11a,
802.11b, and 802.11g; any future 802.11 physical layer will also be compatible with 802.11i. Section 3
presents additional information on the IEEE 802.11i amendment.

2.1.2        Wi-Fi Alliance Certification

While IEEE was examining the shortcomings of IEEE 802.11 security and starting to develop the 802.11i
amendment, a non-profit industry consortium of WLAN equipment and software vendors called the Wi-Fi
Alliance developed an interoperability certification program for WLAN products. 5 The Wi-Fi Alliance
felt it was necessary to create an interim solution that could be deployed using existing IEEE 802.11
hardware while IEEE worked on finalizing the 802.11i amendment. Accordingly, the Alliance created
Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA), which was published in October 2002; it is essentially a subset of the
draft IEEE 802.11i requirements available at that time. The most significant difference between WPA
and the IEEE 802.11i drafts is that WPA does not require support for Advanced Encryption Standard
(AES), a strong encryption algorithm, because many existing IEEE 802.11 hardware components cannot
support computationally intensive encryption without additional hardware components. 6

      approved. FIPS 140-2, Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules, is available at
