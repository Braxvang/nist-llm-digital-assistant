               The Technical Specification for the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.2



CPE entry is that a “pass” result indicates software was installed, the second policy recommendation’s
rule would violate this. This can be corrected by using the @con:negate attribute, a Boolean attribute
that inverts the rule result. The second rule could check for the software being installed and then negate
that result, thus giving a result consistent in meaning with the first rule. For rules that cannot have their
interpretations preserved through the use of the @con:negate attribute, an alternative is to have a CCE
entry corresponding to the recommendation. Rules that do not use <xccdf:ident> elements have no
such restrictions.

4.5.2   Mapping OVAL Results to XCCDF Results
When evaluating an <xccdf:Rule> element that references an OVAL Definition, the
<xccdf:rule-result> element SHALL be used to capture the result of this evaluation. This result
SHALL be determined by evaluating the referenced OVAL Definition on a target host. The result value
of an individual <xccdf:check> SHALL be mapped from the OVAL Definition result produced
during evaluation. The corresponding <xccdf:rule-result/xccdf:result> value is then
computed based on the result values of all relevant <xccdf:check> elements. (Normally only a single
<xccdf:check> element is needed, but where an <xccdf:complex-check> element is used,
there may be multiple results that must be combined, as outlined in the XCCDF specification.) While the
OVAL specification permits limiting result status reporting, SCAP-conformant content SHALL include
full status reporting, including Error, Unknown, Not Applicable, Not Evaluated, True, and False.
Content consumers SHALL apply the mapping illustrated in Table 21 when deriving <xccdf:check>
results from OVAL Definition processing. The corresponding result value SHALL be recorded based on
the @class attribute of the OVAL Definition where applicable.
                   Table 21 - Deriving XCCDF Check Results from OVAL Definition Results

                       OVAL Definition Result                     XCCDF Check Result
                       error                                      error
                       unknown                                    unknown
                       not applicable                             notapplicable
                       not evaluated                              notchecked
                        Definition Class  Definition Result
                        compliance         true
                        vulnerability      false                  Pass
                        inventory          true
                        patch              false
                        Definition Class   Definition Result
                        compliance           false
                        vulnerability        true                 Fail
                        inventory            false
                        patch                true

The mappings in Table 21 are specific to each OVAL Definition class. For example, if an OVAL
compliance class definition is processed and OVAL returns a result of “true”, the content consumer is
conveying the fact that the system was found to be compliant with that check and therefore returns a
“pass” result for that check. A similar definition for a vulnerable condition will return results of “false” if
that vulnerability was not found on the examined devices, resulting in a “pass” from the XCCDF check.
Negations of check results or their combination in complex-checks may result in additional modification
before the final corresponding <xccdf:rule-result/xccdf:result> value is known.
If the <xccdf:Rule> element under evaluation has an <xccdf:check-content-ref> element
with the @name attribute omitted and an <xccdf:check> element with its @multi-check attribute
