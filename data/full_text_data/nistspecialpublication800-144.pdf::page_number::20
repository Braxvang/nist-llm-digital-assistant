             maintained within a cloud can be more available, faster to restore, and more reliable in
             many circumstances than that maintained in a traditional data center, and also meet
             offsite backup storage and geographical compliance requirements. Under such
             conditions, cloud services could also serve as an offsite repository for an organization’s
             data center, in lieu of more traditional tape-based offsite storage [Kum08]. However,
             network performance over the Internet and the amount of data involved are limiting
             factors that can affect restoration.

            Mobile Endpoints. The architecture of a cloud solution extends to the client at the
             service endpoint that is used to access hosted applications. Cloud clients can be general-
             purpose Web browsers or more special-purpose applications.               Since the main
             computational resources needed by cloud-based applications are typically held by the
             cloud provider, clients can generally be lightweight computationally and easily supported
             on laptops, notebooks, and netbooks, as well as embedded devices such as smart phones
             and tablets, benefiting the productivity of an increasingly mobile workforce.3 One caveat
             to this point is that mobile devices, particularly embedded devices, require proper set up
             and protection to be of benefit overall, which include restrictions on the type of data
             maintained on the device [Jan08].

            Data Concentration. Data maintained and processed in a public cloud may present less
             of a risk to an organization with a mobile workforce than having that data dispersed on
             portable computers, embedded devices, or removable media out in the field, where theft
             and loss routinely occur. That is not to say, however, that no risk exists when data is
             concentrated.4 Many organizations have made the transition to support access to
             organizational data from mobile devices to improve workflow management and gain
             other operational efficiencies and productivity benefits.            Carefully constructed
             applications can restrict access and services to only the data and tasks that correspond
             strictly with the responsibilities a user needs to accomplish, limiting data exposure in the
             event of a device compromise.

3.3        The Security and Privacy Downside
Besides its many potential benefits for security and privacy, public cloud computing also brings
with it potential areas of concern, when compared with computing environments found in
traditional data centers. Some of the more fundamental concerns include the following:

            System Complexity. A public cloud computing environment is extremely complex
             compared with that of a traditional data center. Many components make up a public
             cloud, resulting in a large attack surface. Besides components for general computing,
             such as deployed applications, virtual machine monitors, guest virtual machines, data
             storage, and supporting middleware, there are also components that the management
