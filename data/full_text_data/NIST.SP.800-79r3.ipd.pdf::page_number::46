       NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                    Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
       December 2023                                                           and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

1405                    Guidance: The EIMO assists the assessor in gathering all relevant documents and
1406                    supporting materials from the organization that are required during the assessment
1407                    of the issuer. The operations plan is central to this effort. The issuer’s operations
1408                    are completely described in the operations plan. The operations plan also includes
1409                    or points to the supporting materials. In this case, the EIMO needs to gather the
1410                    supporting material for the assessor. Examples of other documentation include (i)
1411                    letters of appointment; (ii) privacy-related documentation; (iii) information forms
1412                    utilized by the issuer; (iv) documentation from each outsourced service provider,
1413                    including control implementation specifics, support and service-level agreements,
1414                    and contracts; (v) standard operating procedures for the issuing facilities within
1415                    the authorization boundary; and (vi) signed authorization letters under [SP800-37]
1416                    for all information systems.
1417                    The assessor is strongly encouraged to review the results of any previous
1418                    assessments, including the one on which the current ATO is based. The assessor
1419                    might satisfy some of the issuer control assessment requirements by reviewing
1420                    and referencing previous assessment reports. Although previous assessments
1421                    cannot be used as a substitute for the current assessment, they provide insight on
1422                    problems that could have existed in the past.
1423                    Subtask 4.3: Assess the required issuer controls using the prescribed assessment
1424                    procedures found in Appendices G.1 and G.2 based on the scope of the issuance
1425                    functions.
1426                    Responsibility: Assessor
1427                    Guidance: The assessor performs the assessment procedures selected for each
1428                    issuer control to determine whether they have been implemented correctly, are
1429                    operating as intended, and producing the desired outcomes. The assessor uses the
1430                    assessment methods specified in Sec. 4.1. The documentation collected in the
1431                    previous task is reviewed, and any deficiencies are identified. Interviews can be
1432                    used as an opportunity to clarify issues encountered during a review of the
1433                    issuer’s documentation and to determine the expertise of the personnel performing
1434                    key PIV functions. Processes need to be observed to ensure that PIV components
1435                    have been configured and are operating in a PIV-compliant manner.
1436                    As part of an assessment, all applicable issuer controls need to be assessed. If PIV
1437                    or derived PIV services have been outsourced to an external provider, the assessor
1438                    verifies that the issuer controls that apply to those services are assessed, and the
1439                    reliability of the service provider is found to be satisfactory. If an issuer and its
1440                    facilities have already been assessed and are operating under a current ATO and
1441                    the purpose of the assessment is to add a facility to the authorization letter, the
1442                    assessor can reuse the results of a previous assessment for the organization-level
1443                    issuer controls and assess a random sample of the new issuing facilities.
1444                    Subtask 4.4: Prepare the assessment report.
1445                    Responsibility: Assessor
1446                    Guidance: The assessment report contains (i) the results of the assessment, (ii)
1447                    recommendations for correcting deficiencies, and (iii) the residual risk to the
