SP 800-152                                                    A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


   g) The modification protections (e.g., a MAC or a digital signature).
   h) The applications that may use the key (e.g., TLS, EFS, S/MIME, IPSec, PKINIT,
      SSH, etc.).
   i) The applications that are not permitted to use the key.
   j) The key assurances:
         i. Symmetric-key assurances (e.g., format checks):
             Who obtains the assurance,
             The circumstances under which it is obtained, and
             How the assurance is obtained.
       ii. Asymmetric-key assurances (e.g., assurance of possession and validity):
             Who obtains the assurances,
             The circumstances under which the assurance is obtained, and
             How the assurance is obtained.
      iii. Domain parameter validity checks:
             Who performs the validity check,
             The circumstances under which the checking is performed, and
             How the assurance of domain parameter validity was obtained.

FR:6.14 The CKMS design shall specify all syntax, semantics, and formats of all key types
and their metadata that will be created, stored, transmitted, processed, and otherwise
managed by the CKMS.

6.3    Key Lifecycle States and Transitions

A key may pass through several states between its generation and its destruction. For a
discussion of key states, see Section 7 of [SP 800-57 Part 1]. A CKMS designer will select
and define the key states and transitions that will be supported by the FCKMS.

FR:6.15 The CKMS design shall specify all the states that the CKMS keys can attain.

FR:6.16 The CKMS design shall specify all transitions between the CKMS key states and
the data (inputs and outputs) involved in making the transitions.

                           A Federal CKMS shall support at least the following key
PR:6.18
                           lifecycle states and protect transitions among them: active,
                           deactivated, and compromised.

                           A Federal CKMS should support the destroyed state.
PA:6.6


                           A Federal CKMS could support the following key lifecycle
PF:6.1
                           states and verify the integrity and acceptability of transitions
                           among them: pre-activation and suspended.
