Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized disclosure of some
policies governing knowledge dissemination missions can be harmful to the agency mission
(e.g., some internal Voice of America editorial policies). This can result in assignment of a
moderate impact level to such information.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for knowledge dissemination information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of knowledge dissemination
information may depend on whether the information is time-critical. Unauthorized modification
or destruction of information affecting external communications (e.g., web pages, electronic
mail) may adversely affect operations and/or public confidence in the agency, but the damage to
the mission would usually be limited. In most cases, the consequences of unauthorized
modification or destruction of knowledge dissemination information would have a limited
adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: In cases of dissemination of
erroneous/defamatory information, an agency mission can be seriously harmed and the impact
level will be moderate.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
knowledge dissemination information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to knowledge dissemination information.
The effects of disruption of access to most knowledge dissemination information or information
systems would have a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: An exception is the extended disruption
of broadcast capabilities (e.g., Voice of America). Here, the agency mission is seriously harmed
and the impact of the consequences will be moderate.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
most knowledge dissemination information is low.

D.21 Regulatory Compliance and Enforcement
Regulatory Compliance and Enforcement involves the direct monitoring and oversight of a
specific individual, group, industry, or community participating in a regulated activity via market
mechanisms, command and control features, or other means to control or govern conduct or
behavior.
