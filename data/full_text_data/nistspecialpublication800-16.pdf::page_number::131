Information Technology Security Training Requirements




       INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SECURITY TRAINING MATRIX                             — Cell 3.3D
 Training Area: System Life Cycle Security                — Test & Evaluate
 Functional Specialty: Implement & Operate

 Definition   —        The system life cycle is a model for building and operating an IT system
                       from its initial inception to its termination and disposal of assets. The
                       model includes six phases: Initiation, Development, Test and Evaluation,
                       Implementation, Operations, and Termination. Life cycle security is the
                       ensemble of processes and procedures which ensures data confidentiality, as
                       needed, as well as data and system integrity, and availability.


                       The test and evaluation phase is the series of steps followed to ensure that
                       the design and construction of a new or modified information system or
                       technology has successfully incorporated appropriate security safeguards.

 Beliavioral Outcome       —   Individuals responsible for system implementation or operation are
                               able to conduct tests of the effectiveness of security safeguards in
                               the integrated system.

 Sample Learning Objectives —

 At the conclusion of this module, individuals will be able to:

 1.    Beginning   — Conduct     tests of security safeguards in accordance with the established test

       plan and procedures.

 2.    Intermediate   — Assess   the performance of security controls (to include hardware,
       software, firmware, and telecommunications as appropriate) to ensure that the residual risk
       is within an acceptable range.


 3.    Advanced    — Evaluate    functional operation and performance in light of test results and
       make recommendations regarding certification and accreditation.
