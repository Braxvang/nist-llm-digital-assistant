NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1                                                             Guidelines for Media Sanitization


   Destroy:      Destroy in order of recommendations:

                        1.   Removing the information-bearing layers of CD media using a commercial optical
                             disk grinding device. Note that this applies only to CD and not to DVD or BD
                             media
                        2.   Incinerate optical disk media (reduce to ash) using a licensed facility.
                        3.   Use optical disk media shredders or disintegrator devices to reduce to particles
                                                                                                            2
                             that have a nominal edge dimensions of 0.5 mm and surface area of 0.25 mm or
                             smaller.



                        Table A-8: Flash Memory-Based Storage Device Sanitization


   Flash Memory-Based Storage Devices

   ATA Solid State Drives (SSDs) This includes PATA, SATA, eSATA, etc.

   Clear:               1.   Overwrite media by using organizationally approved and tested overwriting
                             technologies/methods/tools. The Clear procedure should consist of at least one pass
                             of writes with a fixed data value, such as all zeros. Multiple passes or more complex
                             values may alternatively be used.
                             Note: It is important to note that overwrite on flash-based media may significantly
                             reduce the effective lifetime of the media and it may not sanitize the data in unmapped
                             physical media (i.e., the old data may still remain on the media).
                        2.   Use the ATA Security feature setâ€™s SECURITY ERASE UNIT command, if supported.

   Purge:        Three options are available:
                     1. Apply the ATA sanitize command, if supported. One or both of the following options
                          may be available:
                               a. The block erase command.
                                    Optionally: After the block erase command is successfully applied to a
                                    device, write binary 1s across the user addressable area of the storage media
                                    and then perform a second block erase.
                               b. If the device supports encryption, the Cryptographic Erase (also known as
                                    sanitize crypto scramble) command.
                                    Optionally: After Cryptographic Erase is successfully applied to a device, use
                                    the block erase command (if supported) to block erase the media. If the block
                                    erase command is not supported, Secure Erase or the Clear procedure could
                                    alternatively be applied.
                     2. Cryptographic Erase through the TCG Opal SSC or Enterprise SSC interface by
                          issuing commands as necessary to cause all MEKs to be changed. Refer to the TCG
                          and vendors shipping TCG Opal or Enterprise storage devices for more information.
                          Optionally: After Cryptographic Erase is successfully applied to a device, use the block
                          erase command (if supported) to block erase the media. If the block erase command is
                          not supported, Secure Erase or the Clear procedure could alternatively be applied.

   Destroy:      Shred, Disintegrate, Pulverize, or Incinerate by burning the device in a licensed incinerator.


   Notes:        Verification must be performed for each technique within Clear and Purge as described in the
                 Verify Methods subsection.
                 When Cryptographic Erase is applied, verification must be performed prior to additional
                 sanitization techniques (if applicable), such as a Clear or Purge technique applied following
                 Cryptographic Erase, to ensure that the cryptographic operation completed successfully. A quick
                 sampling verification as described in the Verify Methods subsection should also be performed
                 after any additional techniques are applied following Cryptographic Erase.
