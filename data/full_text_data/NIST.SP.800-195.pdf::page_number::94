               CSD has been promoting the broad international adoption                   This specification seeks to address the security automation
          of SCAP by encouraging the integration of SCAP into other                      information discovery and dissemination use cases by
          standards, and by adapting SCAP to address specific gaps                       defining how tools are expected to communicate with security
          and challenges. CSD has continued its collaboration with                       automation information repositories. ROLIE allows for the
