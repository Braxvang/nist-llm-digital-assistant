       NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                   Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
       December 2023                                                          and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

1115       Issuer Controls Assessment and the Authorization Decision Process
1116   An assessment is a set of activities performed by the assessor to gain assurance that the
1117   applicable issuer controls for a PCI or DPCI have been implemented properly and meet their
1118   required function or purpose. Understanding the overall effectiveness of the issuer controls
1119   implemented by the issuer and its facilities is essential for determining the risk to the
1120   organization’s overall mission and forms the basis for the authorization decision by the DAO.
1121   An assessor SHALL (i) compile evidence that the issuer controls are implemented correctly,
1122   operating as intended, and producing the desired results and (ii) present this evidence in a
1123   manner such that the DAO can make a credible, risk-based decision about the operation of the
1124   issuer.
1125   The focus of an assessment is the issuer controls, each of which is designed to satisfy one or
1126   more specific requirements from [FIPS201] and related documents. The objective for the
1127   assessor is to use the assessment procedures associated with each issuer control (described in
1128   Appendix G) to measure conformance to the requirements. The assessment procedures are
1129   designed to facilitate the gathering of evidence that issuer controls are implemented correctly,
1130   operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome.
1131   In preparation for an assessment, the assessor performs the following two preparatory steps:
1132       1. Determine the authorization boundary to understand the target of the assessment. The
1133          authorization boundary dictates which issuing facilities and outsourced services are to be
1134          included in the assessment.
1135       2. Review the operations plan to determine which issuer controls are implemented at the
1136          organizational level and facility level. This analysis should provide the assessor with an
1137          understanding of where different responsibilities lie within the issuer organization and
1138          how to address them during the assessment.
1139   If PIV functions have been outsourced, the issuer is responsible for ensuring that the external
1140   service provider has implemented the control. During the assessment, it is the responsibility of
1141   the EIMO to collect any service provider’s documentation and make it available to the assessor.
1142   It is recommended that organizations include appropriate language in contractual agreements
1143   with external service providers to ensure that the relevant documentation and necessary evidence
1144   is furnished by the provider in a timely manner for a successful authorization. If results from a
1145   previous assessment of the service provider (provided that the current assessment is part of
1146   reauthorization after substantial changes) can be referenced, the assessor may elect to incorporate
1147   these results (not exceeding one year) or redo part or all of the assessment. Reusing the results of
1148   the previous assessment is entirely at the discretion of the assessor.
1149   Issuer controls implemented at the organizational level generally need to be assessed only once
1150   since they span the entire issuer and its issuing facilities. In other words, these controls MAY
1151   NOT need to be reassessed when the authorization boundary changes (e.g., due to the addition of
1152   facilities). Examples of organizational-level controls include the set of controls under the
1153   authorization focus areas Preparation and Maintenance of Documentation (DO) and Assignment
1154   of Roles and Responsibilities (RR).
1155   There are certain controls that need to be reviewed at the issuing facility level even if they are
1156   put in place at the organizational level. An example of such a control artifact is
