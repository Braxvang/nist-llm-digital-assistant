Advancing Authentication Technology for Public Safety

The embrace of Long Term Evolution (LTE) mobile communications technology has led to critical
cybersecurity challenges for public safety, including authentication and identity management.
The mechanisms used in consumer devices do not sufficiently meet the public’s safety needs.

To stimulate innovation in authentication technology, researchers implemented an Open
Innovation Challenge: Expanding SIM Card Use for Public Safety. With the introduction of the
Nation’s first public safety-focused LTE network, this challenge asked the question, "Can public
safety leverage the universal integrated circuit card (UICC), a technology that is already integrated
into the LTE technology stack, to implement multi-factor authentication?" NIST awarded cash
prizes to three finalists who each demonstrated proof-of-concept solutions to this question.

PSCR, in partnership with NCCoE, identified critical technology areas that will likely influence
the public safety technology field in the near future. Over the past year, the team has worked
to produce several informative and guiding resources for stakeholders that describe technology
impacts, considerations, and best practices. These publications will lay a common groundwork
for the field before individual public safety agencies begin to implement security solutions in
identity federation, Identity as a Service (IDaaS), and biometric authentication. The PSCR/NCCoE
partnership has also awarded a grant to the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI) to further
support their Trustmarks project, which seeks to build a system to support identity federation
and information sharing by establishing requirements and capabilities for identity providers.
