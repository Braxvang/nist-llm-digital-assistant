                                                                                 Guidelines on PDA Forensics



2. Background

       The digital forensic community faces a constant challenge to stay on top of the latest
       technologies that may be used to reveal relevant clues in an investigation. Personal Digital
       Assistants (PDAs) are commonplace in today’s society, used by many individuals for both
       personal and professional purposes. PDAs vary in design and are continually undergoing
       change as existing technologies improve and new technologies are introduced. When a PDA
       is encountered during an investigation, many questions arise: What should be done about
       maintaining power? How should the PDA be handled? How should valuable or potentially
       relevant data contained on the device be examined? The key to answering these questions is
       an understanding of the hardware and software characteristics of PDAs.

       This section gives an overview of the hardware and software capabilities of Palm OS, Pocket
       PC, and Linux-based PDAs. The overview provides a summary of general characteristics and,
       where useful, focuses on a particular model or software version that best illustrates key
       features of such products. Developing an understanding of the components and inner
       workings of these devices (e.g., memory organization and use) is a prerequisite to
       understanding the criticalities involved when dealing with them forensically. For example,
       PDA memory used to store user data is usually volatile (i.e., RAM) and requires continuous
       power to maintain content, unlike data residing on a personal computer’s hard disk. Handheld
       device technologies are changing rapidly, with new products and features being introduced
       regularly. Because of the fast pace with which handheld device technologies are evolving, this
       discussion represents a snapshot of the handheld area at the present time.

2.1   Device Characteristics

       Most types of PDAs have comparable features and capabilities. They house a microprocessor,
       read only memory (ROM), random access memory (RAM), a variety of hardware keys and
       interfaces, and a touch sensitive, liquid crystal display. The operating system (OS) of the
       device is held in ROM. Several varieties of ROM are used, including Flash ROM, which can
       be erased and reprogrammed electronically with OS updates or an entirely different OS.
       RAM, which normally contains user data, is kept active by batteries whose failure or
       exhaustion causes all information to be lost.

       The latest PDAs come equipped with system-level microprocessors that reduce the number of
       supporting chips required and include considerable memory capacity. Built-in Compact Flash
       (CF) and combination Secure Digital (SD) 1/MultiMedia Card (MMC) 2 slots support memory
       cards and peripherals, such as a digital camera or wireless communications card. Wireless
       communications such as infrared (i.e., IrDA), Bluetooth, and WiFi may also be built in. Figure
       1 illustrates a system-level processor chip and the generic core components of most PDAs.
