2.      Components: Awareness, Training, Education

A successful IT security program consists of: 1) developing IT security policy that reflects business needs
tempered by known risks; 2) informing users of their IT security responsibilities, as documented in
agency security policy and procedures; and 3) establishing processes for monitoring and reviewing the
program.6

Security awareness and training should be focused on the organization’s entire user population.
Management should set the example for proper IT security behavior within an organization. An
awareness program should begin with an effort that can be deployed and implemented in various ways
and is aimed at all levels of the organization including senior and executive managers. The effectiveness
of this effort will usually determine the effectiveness of the awareness and training program. This is also
true for a successful IT security program.

An awareness and training program is crucial in that it is the vehicle for disseminating information that
users, including managers, need in order to do their jobs. In the case of an IT security program, it is the
vehicle to be used to communicate security requirements across the enterprise.

An effective IT security awareness and training program explains proper rules of behavior for the use of
agency IT systems and information. The program communicates IT security policies and procedures that
need to be followed. This must precede and lay the basis for any sanctions imposed due to
noncompliance. Users first should be informed of the expectations. Accountability must be derived from
a fully informed, well-trained, and aware workforce.

This section describes the relationship between awareness, training, and education – the awareness-
training-education continuum.

2.1     The Continuum

Learning is a continuum; it starts with awareness, builds to training, and evolves into education. The
continuum is illustrated in Figure 2-1. The continuum is further described in Chapter 2 of NIST Special
Publication 800-16, Information Technology Security Training Requirements: A Role- and Performance-
Based Model, available at http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/index.html.7

      An effective IT security awareness and training program can succeed only if the material used in the program is firmly based
      on agency IT security program policy and IT issue-specific policies. If policies are written clearly and concisely, then the
      awareness and training material – based on the policies – will be built on a firm foundation.

      The continuum is mentioned here and shown in Figure 2-1 to show the conceptual relationship between awareness, training,
      and education as described in NIST Special Publication 800-16. For the purposes of this guideline, clear boundaries are
      established between the three methods of learning.
