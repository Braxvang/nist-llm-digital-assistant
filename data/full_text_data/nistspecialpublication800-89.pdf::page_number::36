  Appendix A: The Assurance Message Instantiated via an RFC
               4211 Certificate Request Message


From Section 6.3.1.1 about the The Private-Key-Possession Assurance Message:

When a digital signature is used to provide assurance of private key possession, the
verifying entity (who must be trusted by all relying parties) is sent a signed private-key-
possession assurance message (simply called the assurance message herein); the digital
signature on the assurance message is called the assurance signature.
The assurance message shall include the following:

   1. The signatory’s identity;
       Note: This should either be in the certReq item, e.g., in the subject field of the
       certTemplate, or might be handled by the authInfo field (e.g., in the form of the
       password and identity string used in the publicKeyMAC computation) of
       poposkInput in the popo item.
   2. The intended verifier’s identity;
       Note: This should either be in the certReq item, e.g., in the issuer field of the
       certTemplate, or might be handled by the authInfo field (e.g., in the form of the
       password and identity string used in the publicKeyMAC computation) of
       poposkInput in the popo item.
   3. A timestamp token (TST) created by a Trusted Timestamp Authority (TTA) that
      is trusted by all relying parties. This TST could be obtained from the TTA by the
      signatory or by the intended verifier (who then provides it to the signatory).
      Relying parties must be aware of the security strength provided by the TTA’s
      digital signature. The security strength provided by the TTA’s digital signature
      shall meet or exceed the security requirements of the requesting entity and relying
      party (see SP 800-57);
       Note: This could be included in the certReq item, as one of the controls.
       AND/OR
       A nonce supplied by the intended verifier. If this option is used, the nonce shall
       contain a random component with entropy equal to or greater than the security
       strength associated with the private key for which assurance of possession is
       sought. If the assurance message will not include a TST, and the relying parties
       require that an assurance_time be recorded upon successful verification of the
       assurance signature, then the nonce should also contain a verifier-supplied
       timestamp component that unambiguously represents the time that the nonce was
       made available for inclusion in the assurance message.
