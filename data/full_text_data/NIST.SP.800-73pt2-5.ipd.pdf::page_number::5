     NIST SP 800-73pt2-5 ipd (Initial Public Draft)         Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification: Part 2
     September 2023                                            PIV Card Application Card Command Interface



54   Abstract
55   FIPS 201 defines the requirements and characteristics of government-wide interoperable identity
56   credentials. It specifies that these identity credentials must be stored on a smart card and that
57   additional common identity credentials, known as derived PIV credentials, may be issued by a
58   federal department or agency and used when a PIV Card is not practical. This document contains
59   the technical specifications to interface with the smart card to retrieve and use the PIV identity
60   credentials. The specifications reflect the design goals of interoperability and PIV Card
61   functions. The goals are addressed by specifying a PIV data model, card edge interface, and
62   application programming interface. Moreover, this document enumerates requirements for the
63   options and branches in international integrated circuit card standards. The specifications go
64   further by constraining interpretations of the normative standards to ease implementation,
65   facilitate interoperability, and ensure performance in a manner tailored for PIV applications.

70   Reports on Computer Systems Technology
71   The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and
72   Technology (NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical
73   leadership for the Nation’s measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops tests, test
74   methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance
75   the development and productive use of information technology. ITL’s responsibilities include the
76   development of management, administrative, technical, and physical standards and guidelines for
77   the cost-effective security and privacy of other than national security-related information in
78   Federal information systems. The Special Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research,
79   guidelines, and outreach efforts in information system security, and its collaborative activities
80   with industry, government, and academic organizations.
