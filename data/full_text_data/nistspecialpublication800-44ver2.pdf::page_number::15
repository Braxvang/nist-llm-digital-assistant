1.3     Audience and Assumptions

This document, while technical in nature, provides the background information to help readers understand
the topics that are discussed. The intended audience for this document includes the following:

 System engineers and architects, when designing and implementing Web servers

 Web and system administrators, when administering, patching, securing, or upgrading Web servers

 Webmasters, when creating and managing Web content

 Security consultants, when performing security audits to determine information system (IS) security
  postures

 Program managers and information technology (IT) security officers, to ensure that adequate security
  measures have been considered for all phases of the systemâ€™s life cycle.

This document assumes that readers have some minimal operating system, networking, and Web server
expertise. Because of the constantly changing nature of Web server threats and vulnerabilities, readers
are expected to take advantage of other resources (including those listed in this document) for more
current and detailed information.

The practices recommended in this document are designed to help mitigate the risks associated with Web
servers. They build on and assume the implementation of practices described in other NIST guidelines
listed in Appendix E.

1.4     Document Structure

The remainder of this document is organized into the following eight major sections:

 Section 2 discusses Web server security problems and presents an overview.

 Section 3 discusses the planning and management of Web servers.

 Section 4 presents an overview of securing the underlying operating system for a Web server.

 Section 5 discusses securely installing and configuring a Web server.

 Section 6 examines the security of Web content.

 Section 7 examines popular Web authentication and encryption technologies.
