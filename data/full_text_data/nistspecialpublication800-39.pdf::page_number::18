be flexible and respond to the dynamic nature of the risk management process. For example, new
legislation, directives, or policies may require that organizations implement additional risk
response measures immediately. This information is communicated directly from the risk framing
component to the risk response component where specific activities are carried out to achieve
compliance with the new legislation, directives, or policies, illustrating the very dynamic and
flexible nature of information as it moves through the risk management process. Chapter Three
provides a complete description of the organization-wide risk management process including
specifications for inputs/preconditions, activities, and outputs/post conditions.

2.2 MULTITIERED RISK MANAGEMENT
To integrate the risk management process throughout the organization, a three-tiered approach is
employed that addresses risk at the: (i) organization level; (ii) mission/business process level; and
(iii) information system level. The risk management process is carried out seamlessly across the
three tiers with the overall objective of continuous improvement in the organizationâ€™s risk-related
activities and effective inter-tier and intra-tier communication among all stakeholders having a
shared interest in the mission/business success of the organization. Figure 2 illustrates the three-
tiered approach to risk management along with some of its key characteristics.

Tier 1 addresses risk from an organizational perspective. Tier 1 implements the first component
of risk management (i.e., risk framing), providing the context for all risk management activities
carried out by organizations. Tier 1 risk management activities directly affect the activities carried
out at Tiers 2 and 3. For example, the missions and business functions defined at Tier 1 influence
the design and development of the mission/business processes created at Tier 2 to carry out those
missions/business functions. Tier 1 provides a prioritization of missions/business functions which
in turn drives investment strategies and funding decisions, thus, affecting the development of
enterprise architecture (including embedded information security architecture) at Tier 2 and the
allocations and deployment of management, operational, and technical security controls at Tier 3.
