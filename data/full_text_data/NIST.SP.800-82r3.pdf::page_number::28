2.3.1. OT System Design Considerations
The design of an OT system depends on many factors, including whether a SCADA, DCS, or
PLC-based topology is used. This section identifies key factors that drive design decisions
regarding the control, communication, reliability, and redundancy properties of the OT system.
Because these factors heavily influence the design of the OT system, they also help determine
the system’s security needs.
   •   Safety. Systems must be able to detect unsafe conditions and trigger actions to reduce
       unsafe conditions to safe ones. In most safety-critical operations, human oversight and
       control of a potentially dangerous process are essential.
   •   Control timing requirements. System processes have a wide range of time-related
       requirements, including very high speed, consistency, regularity, and synchronization.
       Humans may be unable to reliably and consistently meet these requirements, so
       automated controllers may be necessary. Some systems may require computation to be
       performed as close to sensors and actuators as possible to reduce communication latency
       and perform necessary control actions on time.
   •   Geographic distribution. Systems have varying degrees of distribution, ranging from a
       small system (e.g., local PLC-controlled process) to large, distributed systems (e.g., oil
       pipelines, electric power grids). Greater distribution typically implies a need for wide
       area networking (e.g., leased lines, circuit switching, packet switching) and mobile
       communication.
