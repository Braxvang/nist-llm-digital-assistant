       NIST SP 800-63A-4 ipd                                              Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022                                                Enrollment and Identity Proofing


1029       • An in-person, physical interaction with the applicant process; and
1030       • An IAL3 Supervised Remote Identity Proofing process.
1031   Identity proofing at IAL1 and IAL2 allow for any of the these processes to be used, while
1032   IAL3 requires in-person, physical interaction with the applicant or IAL3 Supervised
1033   Remote Identity Proofing.
1034   The following sections provide requirements for identity proofing at each IAL.

1035   5.3. Identity Assurance Level 1
1036   IAL1 permits both remote and in-person identity proofing. Identity proofing processes
1037   at IAL1 allow for a range of acceptable techniques in order to detect the presentation of
1038   fraudulent identities by a malicious actor while facilitating user adoption and minimizing
1039   false negatives and application departures (legitimate applicants who do not successfully
1040   complete identity proofing). Notably, the use of biometric matching, such as the
1041   automated comparison of a facial portrait to supplied evidence, at IAL1 is optional,
1042   providing pathways to proofing and enrollment where such collection may not be viable
1043   or where privacy and equity risks outweigh security considerations.
1044   The following requirements apply to all CSPs providing identity proofing and enrollment
1045   services at IAL1.

1046   5.3.1. Automated Attack Prevention
1047   The CSP SHALL implement a means to prevent automated attacks on the identity
1048   proofing process. Acceptable means include, but are not limited to: bot detection,
1049   mitigation, and management solutions; behavioral analytics; web application firewall
1050   settings; and traffic analysis.

1051   5.3.2. Evidence and Core Attributes Collection Requirements
1052   5.3.2.1. Evidence Collection
1053   For remote or in-person identity proofing, the CSP SHALL collect one of the following
1054   from the applicant:
1055      1. One piece of SUPERIOR evidence, or
1056      2. One piece of STRONG evidence and one piece of FAIR evidence

1057   5.3.2.2. Collection of Additional Attributes
1058   Validated evidence is the preferred source of identity attributes. If the presented identity
1059   evidence does not provide all the attributes the CSP considers core attributes, it MAY
1060   collect attributes that are self-asserted by the applicant.
