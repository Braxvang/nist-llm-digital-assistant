NIST SP 800-82r3                                                  Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security

Appendix C. Threat Sources, Vulnerabilities, and Incidents
Several terms are used to describe the interrelated concepts of threat, threat source, threat event,
and incident. A threat is any circumstance or event with the potential to adversely impact
organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), organizational
assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation through an information system via
unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure, modification of information, and/or denial of
service. Threats have some intent or method that may exploit a vulnerability through either
intentional or unintentional means. This intent or method is referred to as the threat source. A
vulnerability is a weakness in an information system (including an OT), system security
procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited or triggered by a threat
source. A threat event is an event or situation that has the potential to cause undesirable
consequences or impacts. When a threat event occurs, it becomes an incident that actually or
potentially jeopardizes the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an information system or
the information the system processes, stores, or transmits or that constitutes a violation or
imminent threat of violation of security policies, security procedures, or acceptable use policies.
This appendix explores OT-specific threat sources, vulnerabilities, and incidents. It also cites
examples of OT-specific incidents to illustrate their potential impacts. Each organization
calculates risk based on the specific threats, vulnerabilities, impacts, and likelihood of incidents
within their environment.

C.1.    Threat Sources
Threats to OT can come from numerous sources that can be classified as adversarial, accidental,
structural, or environmental. Table 13 lists and defines known threat sources to OT. These threat
sources should be considered part of the risk management strategy. The threat source must be
well understood in order to define and implement adequate protection. For example,
environmental events (e.g., floods, earthquakes) are well understood but may vary in their
magnitude, frequency, and ability to compound other interconnected events. However,
adversarial threats depend on the resources available to the adversary and the emergence of
previously unknown vulnerabilities or attacks.
