                                                                                   FOR VM PROTECTION


6.    Summary

With the increasing percentage of virtualized infrastructure in enterprise data centers, the VMs hosting
mission-critical applications become a critical resource to be protected. VMs, just like their physical
counterparts (i.e., physical servers), can be protected through host-level and network-level security
measures. In the case of VMs, since they are end nodes of a virtual network, the virtual network
configuration is a critical element in their protection. Four virtual network configuration areas are
considered in this publication: network segmentation, network path redundancy, traffic control using
firewalls, and VM traffic monitoring. Each area has been analyzed and corresponding security
recommendations have been provided.
