May 2023                                                                                                               Disclosure Guidelines

levels of technical severity. For the purposes of prioritization, the highest calculated severity 6
should be used.

           Determine the Reported Vulnerable System
Through collaboration with the VDPOs, the FCB member should identify the owners of the
system in which the reported potential vulnerability may exist. If the report does not apply to a
government system (i.e., the report pertains to non-government authored software not used by
the Government), it should be forwarded to an appropriate EC. This could be an industry-focused
vulnerability handling organization or the responsible vendor. Further FCB involvement may not
be necessary after notifying the reporter of the resolution.

           Identify the Reported Vulnerable Software
If the reported vulnerability does pertain to the system of a VDPO, the FCB should support the
VDPO in identifying any affected government IT systems and the potentially vulnerable
software within that system. The source vulnerability report may identify a vulnerable service
(e.g., a government web server) without specifying what underlying software is vulnerable.
Many products are complex systems that include or are dependent on other products or
components. Therefore, the initial analysis may not result in a clear understanding of which
products are affected by the vulnerability. It may take multiple iterations of discovery and
research before a determination can be made that the vulnerability exists within government-
produced software or commercial or open-source software used by the Government.
If the potentially vulnerable software is commercial or open source (i.e., non-government
developed software that appears to affect government systems), the FCB member or VDPO
should identify the software owner and forward the report to that EC. If that is not possible, the
report should be sent to an industry-focused vulnerability handling organization. Credit should
be given to the original reporter if requested. The FCB should monitor the progress of the
vulnerability verification and remediation and update both the reporter and the affected VDPOs
regarding the resolution status of the vulnerability.

           Verify and Remediate Vulnerability
If the potentially vulnerable software is in government-developed or supported software, the
FCB will transfer control of the received source vulnerability report, augmented with the
additional findings to date (e.g., specific vulnerable system), to the VDPO closest to the affected
system. The VDPO will then lead the vulnerability handling resolution in compliance with their
internal vulnerability disclosure policy (verifying and mitigating the vulnerability), as described
in Section 3.2.1. The VDPO should inform the FCB member of their status in resolving the
vulnerability, and the FCB member should record this in their vulnerability reporting database.
The FCB may offer technical assistance based on prioritization of the vulnerability and the
availability of resources.

  Note that this deviates from the [ISOIEC_30111] standard, which recommends using the severity of the most common configuration used. This
does not imply that the standard is incorrect but that it reflects a different focus. This guidance pertains to deployed government systems, while
the ISO standard is designed for software products that may be deployed widely in many different configurations.
