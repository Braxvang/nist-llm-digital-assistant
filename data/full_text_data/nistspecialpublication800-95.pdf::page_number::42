 Minimal Disclosure for a Constrained Use. Identity systems must disclose the least amount of
  identifying information while simultaneously limiting its use as much as possible.
 Justifiable Parties. Identity systems must disclose identifying information only to parties having a
  justifiable need to know it.
 Directed Identity. An identity system must support both omni-directional and uni-directional
  identifiers. An omni-directional identifier can be shared with any third party while a uni-directional
  identifier can only be used between two parties.
 Pluralism of Operators and Technologies. An identity system must support multiple identity
  technologies and multiple identity providers.
 Human Integration. The identity system must define the human user as a component of the
  distributed system.
 Consistent Experience Across Contexts. The identity system must provide users with a consistent
  experience while enabling support for different technologies and providers.
Each of the major identity architectures discussed in Section 3.2.1 can be configured to follow these laws.
By harnessing these laws, identity architectures can securely and adequately share identifying information
amongst themselves so that large organizations or multiple organizations with differing policies and
identity management architectures can better support a SOA.

3.2.3    Identity Management and Web Services

Web services provide a standardized mechanism for communicating and sharing information across
organizational boundaries. To maintain accountability and ensure that only authorized users gain access
to restricted operations or information, Web services must be able to communicate identifying
information across these organizational boundaries. According to Axel Buecker and Heather Hinton 31,
successful cross-organizational Web services require a way for providers to securely identify and provide
services to authorized requesters and a way for requesters to securely invoke Web services with the
necessary credentials.

Without an identity management framework, it becomes difficult for Web services to securely identify
one another or provide recognizable credentials. For example, organization A may use X.509 certificates
to identify Web services and individual users, while organization B may use Kerberos tickets for
identification. If a requester from B sends a SOAP message with a Kerberos ticket to a provider from A,
the provider will not be able to authorize the requester and will deny access. Identity management
frameworks for Web services abstract this information and allow Web servers to securely identify one
another regardless of the underlying identification technology. According to Buecker and Hinton,
organizations need only develop a single set of Web services to facilitate Web service identity
management across organizational boundaries:

 Trust services. These services issue and validate authentication tokens for use across boundaries.
  Trust services can also exchange these tokens with a local identity provider.
 Authentication and validation services. These services are provided by the local identity providers,
  granting tokens to authenticated users and validating tokens presented by a trust service.
