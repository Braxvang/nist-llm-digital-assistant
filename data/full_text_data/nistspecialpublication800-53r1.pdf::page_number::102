MA-4      REMOTE MAINTENANCE

          Control: The organization authorizes, monitors, and controls any remotely executed maintenance
          and diagnostic activities, if employed.
          Supplemental Guidance: Remote maintenance and diagnostic activities are conducted by individuals
          communicating through an external, non-organization-controlled network (e.g., the Internet). The
          use of remote maintenance and diagnostic tools is consistent with organizational policy and
          documented in the security plan for the information system. The organization maintains records
          for all remote maintenance and diagnostic activities. Other techniques and/or controls to consider
          for improving the security of remote maintenance include: (i) encryption and decryption of
          communications; (ii) strong identification and authentication techniques, such as Level 3 or 4
          tokens as described in NIST Special Publication 800-63; and (iii) remote disconnect verification.
          When remote maintenance is completed, the organization (or information system in certain cases)
          terminates all sessions and remote connections invoked in the performance of that activity. If
          password-based authentication is used to accomplish remote maintenance, the organization
          changes the passwords following each remote maintenance service. NIST Special Publication
          800-88 provides guidance on media sanitization. The National Security Agency provides a listing
          of approved media sanitization products at http://www.nsa.gov/ia/government/mdg.cfm. Related
          security controls: IA-2, MP-6.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization audits all remote maintenance and diagnostic sessions and appropriate
                organizational personnel review the maintenance records of the remote sessions.
          (2)   The organization addresses the installation and use of remote maintenance and diagnostic links in
                the security plan for the information system.
          (3)   The organization does not allow remote maintenance or diagnostic services to be performed by a
                provider that does not implement for its own information system, a level of security at least as high
                as that implemented on the system being serviced, unless the component being serviced is
                removed from the information system and sanitized (with regard to organizational information)
                before the service begins and also sanitized (with regard to potentially malicious software) after
                the service is performed and before being reconnected to the information system.


           LOW MA-4                      MOD MA-4 (1) (2)             HIGH MA-4 (1) (2) (3)



MA-5      MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL

          Control: The organization allows only authorized personnel to perform maintenance on the
          information system.
          Supplemental Guidance: Maintenance personnel (whether performing maintenance locally or
          remotely) have appropriate access authorizations to the information system when maintenance
          activities allow access to organizational information or could result in a future compromise of
          confidentiality, integrity, or availability. When maintenance personnel do not have needed access
          authorizations, organizational personnel with appropriate access authorizations supervise
          maintenance personnel during the performance of maintenance activities on the information
          system.
          Control Enhancements: None.


           LOW MA-5                      MOD MA-5                     HIGH MA-5
