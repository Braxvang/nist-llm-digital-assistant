SP 800-152                                                     A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


This Profile uses the term “impact-level” to refer to the information-system impact-levels
identified in [FIPS 200]. [FIPS 200] uses the security categories in [FIPS 199] to specify and
define three information-system impact-levels: Low, Moderate and High. The security
categories are based on the potential impact on an organization if certain events occur that
jeopardize the information and information systems needed by the organization to
accomplish its assigned mission, protect its assets, fulfill its legal responsibilities, maintain
its day-to-day functions, and protect individuals.

The Profile uses the term “security control” to refer to the security controls provided in [SP
800-53] that support the executive agencies of the Federal government to meet the
requirements of [FIPS 200]. [SP 800-53], and [SP 800-53A] apply to all components of an
information system that process, store, or transmit Federal information.

The term “FIPS-140 security level” refers to the security levels defined for cryptographic
modules in [FIPS 140]. Four levels are defined, where a level 1 cryptographic module
provides the least amount of protection, and a level 4 module provides the greatest amount of
protection. The cryptographic modules and their implemented FIPS-140 security levels are
validated by NIST’s Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP).

The term “security strength” is used to measure the amount of cryptographic protection that
can be provided by a combination of a cryptographic algorithm and a key. Further discussion
of key strengths is provided in [SP 800-57 Part 1].

In CKMS and FCKMS topic discussions, statements of fact are indicated by “is” or “are”;
statements of permission or of possibility are indicated by “may”; statements of capability
are indicated by “can”. Statements including “could” are used in discussing possible optional
or alternative actions. These terms do not indicate requirements or recommendations of this
publication.

1.2    Scope of this Profile

An FCKMS is intended for use by Federal agencies and contractors (who use cryptography
to protect U.S. government information) to manage all the cryptographic keys and associated
metadata.

While individual people are outside the scope of an FCKMS, the roles assumed by these
people (e.g., administrators, managers, operators, auditors, and users) are within the scope of
an FCKMS. Physical and logical interfaces between an FCKMS and any or all these roles are
also within an FCKMS’s scope.

Federal agencies and their contractors are required to select appropriate [FIPS 199] impact
levels for their information and to select security controls from those identified in [SP 800-
53] to use in procurements, implementations and planning. After selecting the applicable
security control(s), organizations can initiate the tailoring process to appropriately modify
and align the controls more closely with the specific conditions within the organization (i.e.,
conditions related to organizational missions/business functions, information systems, or
environments of operation). This Profile addresses the selection of several of the security
controls specified in [SP 800-53], indicating the minimum requirements for those security
                                               3
