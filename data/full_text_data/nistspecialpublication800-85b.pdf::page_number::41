Special Publication 800-85B                                PIV Data Model Testing Specification


TE07.01.14.01: The tester shall validate that the RSA public key exponent size is greater than or
equal to 65,537.

7.2     Digital Signature Key

7.2.1    Certificate Profile Conformance


AS07.02.01: The signature field in the certificate shall specify an algorithm in the
AlgorithmIdentifier in accordance with Table 3-4 of SP 800-78 and based on the certificate
expiration date in accordance with Table 3-3 of SP 800-78.
VE07.02.01.01: The vendor shall specify in its documentation the algorithms used to sign
certificates issued.
TE07.02.01.01: The tester shall validate that the signature algorithm is based on the expiration
date of the certificate and is in accordance with Table 3-4 of SP80078.

AS07.02.02: If RSA with PSS padding is used, the parameters field of the
AlgorithmIdentifier type shall assert SHA-256 (OID = 2.16.840.1.101.3.4.2.1). For the other
RSA algorithms, the parameters field is populated with NULL. For ECDSA, the
parameters field is absent.
VE07.02.02.01: The vendor shall specify in its documentation the permitted values of the
AlgorithmIdentifier field based on the signature algorithm used to sign certificates issued.
TE07.02.02.01: The tester shall validate that the correctness of the values of the
AlgorithmIdentifier fields.

AS07.02.03: The subjectPublicKeyInfo field shall assert an algorithm in the
AlgorithmIdentifier in accordance with Table 3-5 of SP 800-78.
VE07.02.03.01: The vendor shall specify in its documentation the applicable algorithms that can
be used to generate digital signature keys.
TE07.02.03.01: The tester shall validate that the algorithm used to generate digital signature
keys are in accordance with Table 3-5 of SP80078.

AS07.02.04: If the public key algorithm is Elliptic Curve, then the EcpkParameters field
uses either the namedCurve field populated with the appropriate OID from Table 3-6 of SP
800-78 or the implicitlyCA choice.
VE07.02.04.01: The vendor shall specify in its documentation the allowed values of the
parameters field of the algorithm of the subjectPublicKeyInfo field as part of the digital signature
certificate profile. These values shall be based on the algorithm used to generate the key pair.
TE07.02.04.01: The tester shall validate the correctness of the values of the parameters field of
the algorithm of the subjectPublicKeyInfo field in the digital signature certificate issued by the
vendor.
