ESTABLISHING WIRELESS ROBUST SECURITY NETWORKS: A GUIDE TO IEEE 802.11I



          of the upper layer protocol packets to a STA or AP. RSNA security mechanisms protect these
          frames.
     Management Frame. Management frames carry the information necessary for managing the
      MAC. They provide the ability to perform management functions such as authenticating or
      associating (the wireless equivalent to connecting or registering). These frames can easily be
      forged, since IEEE 802.11i does not protect management frames. IEEE 802.11w is working on a
      standard to protect some management frames.
     Control Frame. Control frames are used for requesting and controlling access to the wireless
      media. An example of a control frame is the acknowledgement frame, which is used after data
      frames to ensure reliability. Its primary purpose is to alert the sender that the last frame was
      received correctly and there is no need to retransmit. This simple positive acknowledgement
      following each frame is expected, or the frame is considered lost. These frames can easily be
      forged, since IEEE 802.11i does not protect control frames.
Table 5-1 lists the 11 subtypes of management frames, most of which are applicable only in IEEE 802.11
infrastructure mode (i.e., when STAs connect to an AP rather than directly to other STAs). A brief
description of each frame is provided in the table. All of these frame subtypes are part of pre-RSN IEEE
802.11; however, some have been modified by the IEEE 802.11i amendment to allow for the
establishment of RSNs. The frames that have been modified are identified by a check ( ).

 Association
                      Used by a STA to request an association. The SSID is provided in this frame.
 Request
 Association
                      Used to indicate the status (success or failure) of the Association Request.
 Response
                      Used by a STA that has been associated with one BSS to request an
 Reassociation        association with another BSS with the same SSID. This frame includes the
 Request              same information as the Association Request, with the addition of the current
                      AP address.
 Reassociation
                      Used to indicate the status (success or failure) of the Reassociation Request.
 Response
                      Used by a STA to locate a WLAN quickly. This frame may be used to locate
 Probe Request
                      any WLAN or one with a particular SSID.
                      Used by an AP to respond to a Probe Request. This frame contains
 Probe Response
                      essentially the same information as a beacon.
 Beacon               Transmitted periodically by an AP to allow STAs to locate and identify a BSS.
 Authentication       Used by an AP or STA to verify the identity of another STA.
 Deauthentication     Used by a STA to indicate termination of an authentication relationship.
 Disassociation       Used by a STA to indicate termination of an association.
 Announcement         Used by a STA in an IBSS to notify other STAs that may have been operating
 Traffic Indication   in low power modes that it has data buffered and waiting to be delivered to the
 Message (ATIM)       STA addressed in the ATIM frame.


Figure 5-2 illustrates the flow of management frames in a frame exchange between three STAs and an AP
in a single infrastructure BSS. The AP periodically sends a Beacon frame, alerting all stations that the
WLAN is operating in the area. After completing an IEEE 802.11 authentication exchange, the STAs are
