NIST SP 800-160v1r1                                                                             Engineering Trustworthy Secure Systems
November 2022

Each of the system life cycle processes contains a set of activities and tasks that produce
security-focused outcomes. 93 These outcomes combine to deliver a system and corresponding
body of evidence 94 that serve as the basis to:
•    Substantiate the security and trustworthiness of the system
•    Identify and assess security-relevant risk across stakeholder concerns with respect to the use
     of the system in support of mission or business objectives
•    Provide inputs to other processes associated with delivering the system
•    Determine operations and sustainment strategies and actions to address the risk delivered
     with the system

Each system life cycle process description has the following sections:
•    Life Cycle Purpose: Describes the objective of performing the process
•    Security Purpose: Establishes what the process achieves from the security perspective
•    Security Outcomes: Expresses the security-relevant observable results expected from the
     successful performance of the process and the data generated by the process
•    Security Activities and Tasks: Provides a set of security-relevant activities and tasks that
     support achieving security outcomes for the process 95

The outcomes described are achieved by personnel, processes, and technology. Personnel
conduct activities and tasks throughout the stages of the system life cycle to produce outcomes
that achieve the defined security objectives. No single personnel role is responsible for producing
all outcomes stated in the system life cycle processes (i.e., the processes are not role-specific).
Thus, multiple roles may contribute to a specific outcome.

Finally, this publication describes systems engineering considerations to produce the specified
outcomes. However, no specific roles or responsibilities are identified. Organizations define and
allocate roles and responsibilities to the personnel who execute the life cycle processes. Figure
18 provides an example of personnel categories, each with a scope of authority, control, roles,
and responsibilities that collectively achieve the outcomes for the category. The outcomes
produced across all personnel categories achieve the defined security objectives.

   Outcomes inform other processes, including those external to the engineering effort (e.g., the organizational life cycle processes of stakeholders
and certification, authorization, or regulatory processes).

   The comprehensiveness, depth, fidelity, credibility, and relevance of the body of evidence are factors in achieving the desired level of
assurance. The objective is a body of evidence sufficient to convince stakeholders that their assurance needs are satisfied.
95
   The activities and tasks are accomplished cooperatively within and across various roles of the organization, inclusive of systems security
engineering. While this publication focuses on systems security engineering, it does not fulfill all aspects of every activity and task.
