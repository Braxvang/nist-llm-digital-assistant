                                                                             GUIDE TO GENERAL SERVER SECURITY



6.5       Remotely Administering a Server

Remote administration of a server should be allowed only after careful consideration of the risks. The
risk of enabling remote administration varies considerably depending on the location of the server on the
network. For a server that is located behind a firewall, remote administration can be implemented
relatively securely from the internal network, but not without added risk. Remote administration should
generally not be allowed from a host located outside the organization’s network unless it is performed
from an organization-controlled computer through the organization’s remote access solution, such as a
VPN.

If an organization determines that it is necessary to remotely administer a server, following these steps
should ensure that remote administration is implemented in as secure a manner as possible:

 Use a strong authentication mechanism (e.g., public/private key pair, two-factor authentication).

 Restrict which hosts can be used to remotely administer the server.

      –    Restrict by authorized users

      –    Restrict by IP address (not hostname)

      –    Restrict to hosts on the internal network or those using the organization’s enterprise remote
           access solution.

 Use secure protocols that can provide encryption of both passwords and data (e.g., SSH, HTTPS); do
  not use less secure protocols (e.g., telnet, FTP, NFS, HTTP) unless absolutely required and tunneled
  over an encrypted protocol, such as SSH, SSL, or IPsec.

 Enforce the concept of least privilege on remote administration (e.g., attempt to minimize the access
  rights for the remote administration accounts).

 Do not allow remote administration from the Internet through the firewall unless accomplished via
  strong mechanisms, such as VPNs.

 Use remote administration protocols that support server authentication to prevent man-in-the-middle
  attacks.

 Change any default accounts or passwords for the remote administration utility or application.
