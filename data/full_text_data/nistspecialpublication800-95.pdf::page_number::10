 Confidentiality of Web service messages using XML Encryption 1. This is a specification from the
  World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and it provides a mechanism to encrypt XML documents.
 Integrity of Web service messages using XML Signature 2. This is a specification produced jointly
  by the W3C and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). The power of XML Signature is to
  selectively sign XML data.
 Web service authentication and authorization using XML Signature, Security Assertion Markup
  Language (SAML) and eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) as proposed by the
  Organization for Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS) group. SAML and
  XACML provide mechanisms for authentication and authorization in a Web services environment.
 Web Services (WS)-Security 3. This specification, produced by OASIS, defines a set of SOAP
  header extensions for end-to-end SOAP messaging security. It supports message integrity and
  confidentiality by allowing communicating partners to exchange signed encrypted messages in a Web
  services environment.
 Security for Universal Description, Discovery and Integration (UDDI) 4. Produced by OASIS,
  UDDI allows Web services to be easily located and subsequently invoked. Security for UDDI
  enables publishers, inquirers and subscribers to authenticate themselves and authorize the information
  published in the directory.
Challenges

While many of the Web services challenges have been met with existing standards, there are a number of
challenges that standards organizations are addressingâ€”particularly in the area of Web services discovery
and reliability. The Web Services Interoperability Organization (WS-I) acknowledges that there are many
challenges that have yet to be addressed. Some examples of these challenges are:

 Repudiation of transactions
 Secure issuance of credentials
 Exploitation of covert channels
 Compromised services
 Spread of malware, such as viruses and Trojan horses via SOAP messages
 Denial of service attacks
 Incorrect service implementations.
The following sections discuss several Web services security challenges in detail, including Web services
discovery, quality of service and quality of protection, and protection from denial of service attacks.

Discovery

In Web services discovery, participants identify and compose Web Services Description Language
(WSDL) specific services based on definitions in a UDDI registry. Due to the potentially large number of
