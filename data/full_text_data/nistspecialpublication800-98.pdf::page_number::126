GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



8.2.2    Phase 2: Acquisition/Development

The acquisition/development phase focused on the planning and design of the RFID system. The nature
of the supply chain was such that tagged items would be located at numerous facilities, including future
facilities not yet known at time the design was created. However, some general parameters were known.
For instance, readers would need to read tags from distances up to 10 meters, and this capability is
typically only found in active tags.

The design team spent a significant amount of time on how to mitigate risks associated with the RF link
between the readers and the tags. It determined that the risk of eavesdropping and rogue RFID
transactions could be within acceptable levels if adversaries were located at least 100 meters from the
storage area. 90 The few facilities that could not maintain a perimeter of that distance would rely on bar
code technology, which RTA understood would significantly increase labor costs at these sites relative to
those using RFID because people would need to be hired to scan items and open containers to inventory
their contents.

To address the requirement of preventing readings during transport, the design team specified
mechanisms for shielding containers and vehicles. The shielding would prevent adversaries from
determining that items inside a vehicle were tagged, thereby reducing the risk of targeting. In the case of
shielded transport vehicles, tags could be read when they were removed from the vehicle at debarkation.
Many vehicles were shielded prior to the RFID program to prevent harmful radiation from escaping the
vehicle. When vehicles were not shielded, tarp-like shielding could be placed around containers within
the vehicle and then easily removed when they leave the vehicle. While some users would benefit from
the convenience of reading tags from outside the vehicle, the risk this introduced outweighed any
potential advantage it offered. Indeed, the primary objectives of the RFID system were to identify the
facility at which a radionuclide sample was located and to quickly find items once stored, neither of
which necessitated readings when the item was in transport.

The tags were also password-protected using a proprietary technology to prevent unauthorized parties
from reading or writing to the tags. Because custody of the tags moved from one organization to another,
the RTA decided to host a central password database that could be remotely accessed by the RFID
middleware of each participating organization. To limit access to the central database to business
partners, it was placed on a VPN called RTAnet to which each of the partner organizations connected.
The VPN isolates the RFID activity from public networks, thereby making it difficult for an outside
adversary to perform a successful attack.

The team also had to tackle the HERF risk. Although the probability was small that readers would cause
combustion of volatile materials stored near radionuclide material, the devastating consequences of its
realization still made it a significant concern. The primary mechanism was to use an HF system because
it would be less likely to cause combustion than higher frequency UHF and microwave technology. New
guidelines also required a separation of five meters between fuel and tagged items unless the volatile
materials were shielded.

8.2.3    Phase 3: Implementation

The implementation phase was straightforward, given the extensive planning in the previous phase. The
first task was to conduct a pilot test of the system to identify potential problems before they adversely
impacted the full supply chain. The test exercise uncovered several interoperability issues with RTAnet

90
     The risk was determined by field tests to be acceptable because the 100 meter distance was shown to prevent eavesdropping
     of tag to reader communications.
