       NIST SP 800-171Ar3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                           Assessing CUI Security Requirements
       November 2023

2459             ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE
2460             Determine if:
2461             A.03.13.08[01]: cryptographic mechanisms are implemented to prevent the unauthorized
2462             disclosure of CUI during transmission.
2463             A.03.13.08[02]: cryptographic mechanisms are implemented to prevent the unauthorized
2464             disclosure of CUI while in storage.

2465             ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS
2466             Examine
2467             [SELECT FROM: system and communications protection policy and procedures; procedures for
2468             transmission confidentiality; procedures for the protection of information at rest; system design
2469             documentation; system configuration settings; cryptographic mechanisms and associated
2470             configuration documentation; information in storage requiring confidentiality protection; system
2471             audit records; system security plan; other relevant documents or records]
2472             Interview
2473             [SELECT FROM: personnel with information security responsibilities; system developers;
2474             system administrators]
2475             Test
2476             [SELECT FROM: mechanisms for supporting and/or implementing transmission confidentiality;
2477             cryptographic mechanisms for supporting and/or implementing transmission confidentiality;
2478             mechanisms for supporting and/or implementing confidentiality protection for information in
2479             storage; cryptographic mechanisms implementing confidentiality protections for information in
2480             storage]

2483   3.13.9. Network Disconnect
2484             REQUIREMENT: 03.13.09

2485             ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE
2486             Determine if:
2487             A.03.13.09: network connections associated with communications sessions are terminated at
2488             the end of the sessions or after periods of inactivity.

2489             ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS
2490             Examine
2491             [SELECT FROM: system and communications protection policy and procedures; procedures for
2492             network disconnect; system design documentation; system configuration settings; system audit
2493             records; system security plan; other relevant documents or records]
2494             Interview
2495             [SELECT FROM: personnel with information security responsibilities; system developers;
