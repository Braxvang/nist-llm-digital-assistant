                                                                                               SECTION 2: RFID TECHNOLOGY



A passive tag uses the electromagnetic energy it receives from a reader’s transmission to reply to the
reader. The reply signal from a passive tag, which is also known as the backscattered signal, 5 has only a
fraction of the power of the reader’s signal. This limited power significantly restricts the operating range
of the tag. It also means that passive tags can only support data processing of limited complexity. On the
other hand, passive tags typically are cheaper, smaller, and lighter than other types of tags, which are
compelling advantages for many RFID applications.

An active tag relies on an internal battery for power. The battery is used to communicate to the reader, to
power on-board circuitry, and to perform other functions. Active tags can communicate over greater
distance than other types of tags, but they have a finite battery life and are generally larger and more
expensive. Since these tags have an internal power supply, they can respond to lower power signals than
passive tags.

A semi-active tag is an active tag that remains dormant until it receives a signal from the reader to wake
up. The tag can then use its battery to communicate with the reader. Like active tags, semi-active tags
can communicate over a longer distance than passive tags. Their main advantage relative to active tags is
that they have a longer battery life. The waking process, however, sometimes causes an unacceptable
time delay when tags pass readers very quickly or when many tags need to be read within a very short
period of time.

A semi-passive tag is a passive tag that uses a battery to power on-board circuitry, but not to produce
return signals. When the battery is used to power a sensor, they are often called sensor tags. They
typically are smaller and cheaper than active tags, but have greater functionality than passive tags because
more power is available for other purposes. Some literature uses the terms “semi-passive” and “semi-
active” interchangeably.

2.3.1.3 Operating Frequencies

The radio frequencies at which a tag transmits and receives signals have implications for:

 Tag performance characteristics, including operating range, speed of tag reads, and RFID data
  transfer rate. In general, as a tag’s operating frequency increases, its signals are able to carry more
  data. 6 As a result, higher frequency readers are also able to read more tags in a given period of time.
  In addition, RFID systems that operate at ultra high frequency (UHF) and microwave frequencies are
  typically designed to have a longer operating range than LF and high frequency (HF) systems. 7 For
  most applications, the increased speed and operating range are considered advantages. One exception
  is applications for which security or privacy is a significant concern, such as those that involve
  financial transactions or personal data. In these cases, the ability of an adversary to read the data
  more quickly and from a longer distance typically is considered a risk that requires mitigation.


5
    Passive tags that transmit ultra high frequency (UHF) or microwave signals typically rely on backscattering to communicate.
    Passive tags that transmit low frequency (LF) or high frequency (HF) signals typically are inductively coupled and do not
    communicate via backscatter.
6
    For example, EPCglobal Class-1 Generation-2 UHF RFID technology can read tags at a speed of up to 640 kilobits per
    second. This data transfer rate can allow up to several hundred tags to be read per second.
7
    UHF and microwave RFID systems are typically designed to operate outside the near field of the electromagnetic signal –
    i.e., beyond a small number of wavelengths. This permits these systems to have a longer operating range than LF and HF
    systems, which generally operate in the near field. For example, EPCglobal UHF RFID systems have an operating range of
    up to 3 meters (m), which is significantly greater than UHF wavelengths of between 0.1 m and 1.0 m. ISO/IEC 14443 HF
    systems have an approximate range of 7 to 15 centimeters (cm), which is significantly less than the HF wavelengths of
    between 10 and 100 meters. Recent advancements in near-field UHF RFID have improved the read rate and performance
    around liquids and metals.
