                                                                                             This section describes mechanisms to recover critical data in platform devices in the event that
                                                                                             the device or administrator has reason to believe it has been corrupted. Because critical data can
                                                                                             be user-configurable, recovery requires the availability of trusted, known-good backup copies of
                                                                                             critical data. These backup copies may be stored on the device itself or by some other host
                                                                                             device. Because these backups may also be vulnerable to attack, these guidelines specify that
                                                                                             devices also provide a means to restore to known-good factory defaults.

                                                                                                1) Mechanisms to recover critical data shall resist attacks which corrupt the active critical
                                                                                                   data or the Primary Firmware Image, or subvert their protection mechanisms.
                                                                                                2) The device should provide a method to backup a known good copy (or copies) of the
                                                                                                   active critical data to another location or locations. The protections on those locations
                                                                                                   shall be at least as good as that for the active critical data. The protections should be
                                                                                                   better than those for the active critical data.
                                                                                                     a) A symbiont device that cannot backup its own critical data should make its critical
                                                                                                        data available to its host device. In this case, the host device shall backup the
                                                                                                        symbiont’s data.
                                                                                                     b) If a symbiont provides its critical data to a host device so the host device may backup
                                                                                                        the data, then the symbiont should be able to consume the recovered critical data.
                                                                                                3) The device may determine that its critical data is “known good” by using that data as part
                                                                                                   of a successful reboot.
                                                                                                4) The device shall backup the critical data either automatically or when instructed by the
                                                                                                   user or when instructed to do so by another trusted device.
                                                                                                5) The RTRec or CTRec shall be capable of recovering critical data to factory defaults.
                                                                                                6) The RTRec or CTRec should be capable of recovering to last known good critical data.
