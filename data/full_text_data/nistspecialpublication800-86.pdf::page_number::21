                                                     GUIDE TO INTEGRATING FORENSIC TECHNIQUES INTO INCIDENT RESPONSE



      ! Establishing data retention policies that support performing historical reviews of system and
        network activity, complying with requests or requirements to preserve data relating to ongoing
        litigation and investigations, and destroying data that is no longer needed.
Most of these considerations are extensions of existing provisions in the organization’s policies and
procedures, so they are typically specified within the relevant individual documents instead of a
centralized forensics policy.

2.5     Guidelines and Procedures

As mentioned in Section 2.4, an organization should create and maintain guidelines and procedures for
performing forensic tasks, based on the organization’s policies, incident response staffing models, and
other teams identified as participants in forensic activities. Even if the activities are performed by
external parties, the organization’s internal staff will still interact with them and participate to some extent
in the activities, such as notifying the external party of a need for assistance, granting physical or logical
access to systems, and securing an incident scene until an investigator arrives. The internal staff should
work closely with the external parties to ensure that the organization’s policies, guidelines, and
procedures are understood and followed.

An organization’s forensic guidelines should include general methodologies for investigating an incident
using forensic techniques, since it is not feasible to develop comprehensive procedures tailored to every
possible situation. However, organizations also should consider developing step-by-step procedures for
performing routine tasks, such as imaging a hard disk, capturing and recording volatile information from
systems, or securing physical evidence (e.g., removable media). The goal for the guidelines and
procedures is to facilitate consistent, effective, and accurate forensic actions, which is particularly
important for incidents that may lead to prosecution or internal disciplinary actions. Because electronic
logs and other records can be altered or otherwise manipulated, organizations should be prepared, through
their policies, guidelines, and procedures, to demonstrate the integrity of such records.6

Information is rapidly migrating to a form in which all the information assets exist in electronic form. In
both the public and private sectors, it is increasingly important to demonstrate conclusively the
authenticity, credibility, and reliability of electronic records, such as the performance of a specific action
or decision, or the existence of a certain item of information. Business records have normally been
treated as equivalent to originals. Increasingly, some in the legal and forensic communities are concerned
with the ease with which electronic records can be created, altered, or otherwise manipulated. In addition,
various compliance initiatives in the public and private sectors are making it increasingly important to
demonstrate the integrity of electronic records. With the explicit caveat that such issues are matters for
discussion with legal counsel and senior IT officials and well beyond the scope of this publication, the use
of sound, documented, and reasonably explicable forensic techniques coupled with other methods (such
as log retention and analysis) is an important resource for decision makers as well as for incident
handlers.

Forensic guidelines and procedures should be consistent with the organization’s policies and all
applicable laws. Organizations should include technical experts and legal advisors in the development of
guidelines and procedures as a quality assurance measure. Management should also be involved in
guideline and procedure development, particularly in ensuring that all major decision-making points are
documented and that the proper course of action is defined so that decisions are made consistently.
