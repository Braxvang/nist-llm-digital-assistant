      August 2023                                                                                                     Privacy Learning Program



197   Executive Summary
198   Ensuring that an organization’s workforce is aware of and prepared to respond appropriately and
199   effectively to cybersecurity and privacy risk is an important effort that requires a strategic
200   approach based on thoughtful planning, resource considerations, and leadership-driven decision
201   making. This long-awaited update to the 2003 NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-50, Building
202   an Information Technology Security Awareness and Training Program, provides guidance that
203   includes awareness, role-based training, and education programs. These programs combine to
204   create an overall Cybersecurity and Privacy Learning Program (CPLP) that supports federal
205   requirements and incorporates industry-recognized best practices for risk management.
206   Legislative authority for the creation and maintenance of this Special Publication is derived from
207   the National Defense Authorization Act of 2021 (NDAA) [2].
208   In addition to the statutory responsibilities under FISMA, this Special Publication supports the
209   National Defense Authorization Act of 2021 (NDAA) [2], Development of Standards and
210   Guidelines for Improving Cybersecurity Workforce of Federal Agencies to “publish standards
211   and guidelines for improving cybersecurity awareness of employees and contractors of Federal
212   agencies” 1 Including privacy as a foundational element in this Program reflects the guidance
213   found in the 2016 update to OMB’s Circular A-130:
214                     …it also emphasizes the role of both privacy and security in the federal
215                     information life cycle. Importantly, the inclusion of privacy represents a
216                     shift from viewing security and privacy requirements as merely
217                     compliance exercises to understanding security and privacy as crucial
218                     and related elements of a comprehensive, strategic, and continuous risk-
219                     based program at federal agencies. [1]
220   Additionally, this update includes elements previously found in NIST SP 800-16, Information
221   Technology Security Training Requirements: A Role- and Performance-Based Model [6].
222   Previously, NIST SP 800-16 [6] identified the federal agency and organizational work roles that
223   required specialized training for cybersecurity tasks and skills. The relevant content from NIST
224   SP 800-16 has been incorporated into this publication or has been included in NIST SP 800-
225   181r1 [3]. As a result, NIST SP 800-16 will be withdrawn upon the release of this publication
226   Everyone in an organization has a role to play in the success of an effective cybersecurity and
227   privacy program. For those whose information technology, cybersecurity, or cybersecurity-
228   related job responsibilities require additional or specific training, the NICE Workforce
229   Framework for Cybersecurity (NICE Framework) 2 [3] identifies the specific knowledge and
230   skills necessary to perform tasks associated with work roles in these areas. 3

        Section 9402 of FY 21 NDAA, Development of Standards and Guidelines for Improving Cybersecurity Workforce of Federal Agencies, amends
      the NIST Act as follows: “(b): PUBLICATION OF STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES ON CYBERSECURITY AWARENESS. Not later than
      three years after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology shall publish standards
      and guidelines for improving cybersecurity awareness of employees and contractors of federal agencies.”

        National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) is led by NIST in the US Department of Commerce.

        As of the time of development of this publication, NIST is in the process of a privacy workforce development effort to create a privacy
      companion to NICE.
