NIST SP 800-215                                                            Guide to a Secure Enterprise
November 2022                                                                      Network Landscape

   •   Connectivity to cloud services provided by a cloud service provider (CSP) through a
       virtual private network (VPN) or subscription to WAN services (premises-based
       equipment licenses or cloud-based)

       Security Implications of Drivers on the Enterprise Network Landscape
Now consider the immediate security implications of these drivers on the enterprise network
landscape.
Subscription to multiple cloud services: Accessing cloud services from multiple cloud providers
has become the norm for many enterprises. This trend is motivated not only by the need to avoid
a cloud-vendor locked-in situation but also by different CSPs offering different value-added
functions for different services (e.g., IaaS, SaaS). The consequence of this trend is that – from an
enterprise point of view – the following networks have become extensions of the enterprise
network and, thus, come under the scope of enterprise network management with attendant
responsibilities for ensuring that security protections become a critical function.
   •   Network used for accessing the cloud services (e.g., VPNs or subscribed WANs)
   •   Intercloud network (since communication between one CSP and another may be
       inevitable)
   •   The network inside the cloud provider that needs to be navigated to access the subscribed
       services (e.g., VPC, VNET).
Geographic spread of IT resources and users: IT resources are now widely distributed not only
due to the geographic spread of enterprise premises (e.g., headquarters and branch offices) but
also for reliability and disaster recovery (DR) considerations. Additionally, the applications
hosted in those resources are now accessed by users from various enterprise premises (through the
enterprise network) as well as from home and public locations (e.g., hotels and cafes) through
multiple devices, such as desktops, laptops, and mobile phones. Ensuring secure access from
these varied locations and devices becomes the responsibility of the enterprise.
Changes in application architecture: Application architectures – especially those of cloud-native
applications – have changed from being monolithic to being microservices-based in order to meet
the deployment agility and modular scalability requirements. This, combined with DevSecOps (a
paradigm covering Development, Security and Operations) primitives such as continuous
integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for the development and deployment of
software, has improved the security profile of the applications but has also introduced new threat
vectors related to the CI/CD workflows themselves.

       The Need for a Security Guide
Based on the security implications discussed in the previous subsection, there is a new security
scenario in the current enterprise network landscape that needs to be addressed through security
guidance. Some of the salient aspects of this scenario are:
   •   Ubiquitous access locations, ubiquitous hosting locations of the application components,
       and multiple WAN transport protocols have caused shifts in security focuses, goals, and
       principles.
