      NIST SP 800-63A-4 ipd                                                        Digital Identity Guidelines
      December 2022                                                          Enrollment and Identity Proofing


689   5.    Identity Assurance Level Requirements
690   This section is normative.
691   This section provides requirements for CSPs that operate identity proofing and enrollment
692   services, including requirements for identity proofing at each of the IALs. This section
693   also includes additional requirements for Federal Agencies regardless of whether they
694   operate their own identity service or use an external CSP.

695   5.1. General Requirements
696   The requirements in this section apply to all CSPs performing identity proofing at any
697   IAL.

698   5.1.1. Identity Service Documentation and Records
699   The CSP SHALL conduct its operations according to a practice statement that details
700   all identity proofing processes as they are implemented to achieve the defined IAL. The
701   practice statement SHALL include, at a minimum:
702        1. A complete service description including the particular steps the CSP follows to
703           identity proof applicants at each offered assurance level;
704        2. Types of identity evidence the CSP accepts to meet the evidence strength
705           requirements;
706        3. If applicable, alternative ways for an individual applicant who does not possess the
707           required identity evidence to complete the identity proofing process1 ;
708        4. The attributes the CSP considers to be core attributes. Core attributes include the
709           minimum set of attributes the CSP needs to perform identity resolution as well as
710           any additional attributes the CSP collects and validates for the purposes of identity
711           proofing, fraud mitigation, complying with laws or legal process, or conveying to
712           relying parties (RPs) through attribute assertions;
713        5. The CSP’s policy and process for dealing with identity proofing errors;
714        6. The CSP’s policy and process for identifying and communicating suspected or
715           confirmed fraudulent accounts to RPs and affected individuals;
716        7. The CSP’s policy for managing and communicating service changes (e.g., change
717           in data sources, integrated vendors, or biometric algorithms) to RPs;
718        8. The CSP’s policy for conducting privacy risk assessments, including the timing of
719           its periodic reviews and specific conditions that will trigger an updated privacy risk
720           assessment (see Section 5.1.2);

      1 Options include using a Trusted Referee, with or without an Applicant Representative; see Sec. 5.1.9 for

       supplemental identity evidence types.
