SP 800-152                                                   A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


higher impact-levels must use cryptographic modules that provide increasingly more
protection than is provided at the Low impact-level, i.e.. the Moderate impact-level requires a
level 3 cryptographic module or higher, and the High impact-level requires level 4 physical
security, with all other areas at security levels 3 or higher.

FR:2.5 The CKMS design shall specify all major devices of the CKMS (e.g., the make,
model, and version).

                           module.
