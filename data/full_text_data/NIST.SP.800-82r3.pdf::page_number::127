            Cryptography
            Critical OT data should be protected while in transit, especially over
            third-party network segments and other untrusted or vulnerable network
            paths (e.g., cellular, wireless, internet, WAN). Identify critical data, and
            implement cryptographic mechanisms (e.g., encryption) to prevent
            unauthorized access or the modification of system data and audit records.
            Encryption provides a mechanism for ensuring confidentiality and
            integrity for data in transit.
            OT applications often focus on the availability of data. Before deploying
            encryption in OT, ensure that confidentiality or integrity is the goal of
            applying the security control. The use of encryption within an OT
            environment could introduce communications latency due to the
            additional time and computing resources required to encrypt, decrypt,
            and authenticate each message. Encryption may also cause performance
            degradation of the end device or system. Before deploying encryption
            within an OT environment, solutions should be tested to determine
            whether latency is acceptable for the application. Encryption at OSI
            Layer 2 rather than Layer 3 may be implemented to help reduce
            encryption latency.
            Additionally, while encryption provides confidentiality between
            encryption and decryption devices, anomaly detection tools that support
            OT environments may be unable to read encrypted data. Encryption
            should, therefore, be carefully planned and implemented to manage
            operational risks.
            Organizations should also consider that cryptography may introduce key
            management issues. Sound security policies require key management
            processes that can become more difficult as the geographic size of the
            OT increases. Because site visits to change or manage keys can be costly
            and slow, organizations should consider whether cryptographic
            protection with remote key management may be beneficial, such as when
            the protected units become so numerous or geographically dispersed that
            managing keys is difficult or expensive.
            For OT, encryption can be deployed as part of a comprehensive,
            enforced security policy. A cryptographic key should be long enough so
            that guessing it or determining it through analysis takes more effort,
            time, and cost than the value of the protected asset.

6.2.4. Information Protection Processes and Procedures (PR.IP)
Policies, processes, and procedures should be maintained and used to manage the protection of
information systems and assets. Countermeasures and outcomes should be in place to manage
configuration changes throughout the life cycle of the component and system. Backups should be
maintained, and response and recovery plans should be prepared and tested. A plan should be
