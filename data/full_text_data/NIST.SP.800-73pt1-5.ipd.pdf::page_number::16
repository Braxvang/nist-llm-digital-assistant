348       PIV Data Model Elements
349   This section describes the data elements for the personal identity verification data model.
350   A PIV Card Application SHALL contain seven mandatory interoperable data objects, two

354       2. Card Holder Unique Identifier
355       3. X.509 Certificate for PIV Authentication
356       4. X.509 Certificate for Card Authentication
357       5. Cardholder Fingerprints
358       6. Cardholder Facial Image
359       7. Security Object
360   The two data objects that are mandatory if the cardholder has a government-issued email account
361   at the time of credential issuance are:
362       1. X.509 Certificate for Digital Signature
363       2. X.509 Certificate for Key Management

366       •   Discovery Object
367       •   Key History Object
368       •   20 retired X.509 Certificates for Key Management
369       •   Cardholder Iris Images
370       •   Biometric Information Templates Group Template
371       •   Secure Messaging Certificate Signer
372       •   Pairing Code Reference Data Container

373           Mandatory Data Elements
374   This section describes the seven mandatory data objects for interagency interoperable use.

375   3.1.1. Card Capability Container
