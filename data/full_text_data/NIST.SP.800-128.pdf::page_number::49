                                                                                             3.3.2       IMPLEMENT THE CONFIGURATION CHANGE CONTROL PROCESS

                                                                                             A well-defined configuration change control process is fundamental to any SecCM program.
                                                                                             Configuration change control is the process for ensuring that configuration changes to a system
                                                                                             are formally requested, evaluated for their security impact, tested for effectiveness, and approved
                                                                                             before the changes are implemented. Although the process may have different steps and levels of
                                                                                             rigor depending on organizational risk tolerance and/or system-impact level, configuration
                                                                                             change control generally consists of the following steps:

                                                                                                 i.   Request the change. A request for change may originate from any number of sources
                                                                                                      including the end user of the system, a help desk, or from management. Proposed
                                                                                                      changes may also originate from vendor-supplied patches, application updates, security
                                                                                                      alerts, system scans, etc. See Appendix E for a Sample Change Request Template.

                                                                                                     the configuration change control process when it is recorded in accordance with
                                                                                                     organizational procedures. Organizations may use paper-based requests, emails, a help
                                                                                                     desk, and/or automated tools to track change requests, route them based on workflow
                                                                                                     processes, and allow for electronic acknowledgements/approvals.

                                                                                                 iii. Determine if the proposed change requires configuration control. Some types of changes
                                                                                                      may be exempt from configuration change control or pre-approved as defined in the
                                                                                                      SecCM plan and/or procedures. If the change is exempt or pre-approved, note this on the
                                                                                                      change request and allow the change to be made without further analysis or approval;
                                                                                                      however, system documentation may still require updating (e.g., the System Security
                                                                                                      Plan, the baseline configuration, system component inventory, etc.).

                                                                                                 iv. Analyze the proposed change for its security impact on the system (see Section 3.3.3).

                                                                                                 v. Test the proposed change for security and functional impacts. Testing confirms the
                                                                                                    impacts identified during analysis and/or reveals additional impacts. The impacts of the
                                                                                                    change are presented to the CCB and to the AO.

                                                                                                 vi. Approve the change. This step is usually performed by the CCB. The CCB may require
                                                                                                     the implementation of additional controls if the change is necessary for mission
                                                                                                     accomplishment but has a negative impact on the security of the system and organization.
                                                                                                     Implementation of additional controls is coordinated with the AO and System Owner.

                                                                                                 vii. Implement the approved change. Once approved, authorized staff makes the change.
                                                                                                      Depending upon the scope of the change, it may be helpful to develop an implementation
                                                                                                      plan. Change implementation includes changes to applicable/related configuration
                                                                                                      parameters as well as updating system documentation to reflect the change(s).
                                                                                                      Stakeholders (e.g., users, management, help desk, etc.) are notified about the change,
                                                                                                      especially if the change implementation requires a service interruption or alters the
                                                                                                      functionality of the system. In the case of the latter situation, user and help desk training
                                                                                                      may be required.

                                                                                                 viii. Verify that the change was implemented correctly (e.g., vulnerability scans, post-
