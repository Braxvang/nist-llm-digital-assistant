NIST SP 800-52 REV. 2                                                            GUIDELINES FOR TLS IMPLEMENTATIONS


Clients that support EC cipher suites shall support the processing of at least one 33 of the EC
point formats received in the ServerHello message as described in Section 5.2 of [52].

4.4.2.5 Multiple Certificate Status

Applies to TLS versions: 1.0, 1.1, 1.2

The multiple certificate status extension is described in Section 3.4.2.5. This extension improves
on the Certificate Status Request extension described in Section 3.4.1.5 by allowing the client to
request the status of all certificates provided by the server in the TLS handshake. This extension
is documented in RFC 6961 [54]. Client implementations that have this capability should be
configured to include this extension in the ClientHello message.

4.4.2.6 Trusted CA Indication

Applies to TLS versions: 1.0, 1.1, 1.2

Clients that run on memory-constrained devices where only a small number of CA root keys are
stored should be capable of including the trusted CA indication (trusted_ca_keys) extension in a
ClientHello message as described in [29].

4.4.2.7 Encrypt-then-MAC

Applies to TLS versions: 1.0, 1.1, 1.2

The Encrypt-then-MAC extension described in Section 3.4.2.7 can mitigate or prevent several
known attacks on CBC cipher suites. In order for this modified order of operations to be applied,
both the server and client need to implement the Encrypt-then-MAC extension and negotiate its
use. When CBC mode cipher suites are configured, clients shall support this extension as
described in RFC 7366 [33]. The client shall include this extension in the ClientHello message
whenever the ClientHello message includes CBC cipher suites.

4.4.2.8 Truncated HMAC

Applies to TLS versions: 1.0, 1.1, 1.2

The Truncated HMAC extension is described in Section 3.4.2.8. Clients running on constrained
devices may support this extension. The Truncated HMAC extension shall not be used in
conjunction with variable-length padding due to attacks described by Paterson et al. [53]. This
extension is only applicable when cipher suites that use CBC modes are supported.




33 The uncompressed point format must be supported, and all others are deprecated in TLS as described in Sections 5.1.2 of RFC

    8422 [52].
