GUIDE TO INTEGRATING FORENSIC TECHNIQUES INTO INCIDENT RESPONSE



2.4.2   Providing Guidance for Forensic Tool Use

Incident handlers; IT professionals, such as system and network administrators; and others within an
organization use forensic tools and techniques for a variety of reasons. Although the technologies have
many benefits, they can also be misused accidentally or intentionally to provide unauthorized access to
information, or to alter or destroy information, including evidence of an incident. In addition, the use of
certain forensic tools may not be warranted in some situations (for example, a minor incident probably
does not merit hundreds of hours of data collection and examination efforts).

To ensure that tools are used reasonably and appropriately, the organization’s policies, guidelines, and
procedures should clearly explain what forensic actions should and should not be performed under
various circumstances. For example, a network administrator should be able to monitor network
communications on a regular basis to solve operational problems, but should not read users’ e-mail unless
specifically authorized to do so. A help desk agent might be permitted to monitor network
communications for a particular user’s workstation to troubleshoot an application problem but not be
permitted to perform any other network monitoring. Individual users might be forbidden from
performing any network monitoring under any circumstances. Policies, guidelines, and procedures
should clearly define the specific actions that are permitted and forbidden for each applicable role under
normal circumstances (e.g., typical duties) and special circumstances (e.g., incident handling).

Policies, guidelines, and procedures should also address the use of anti-forensic tools and techniques.
Described in Sections 4 through 7, anti-forensic software is designed to conceal or destroy data so that
others cannot access it. There are many positive uses for anti-forensic software, such as removing data
from computers that are to be donated to charity and removing data cached by Web browsers to preserve
a user’s privacy. However, like forensic tools, anti-forensic tools can also be used for malicious reasons.
Therefore, organizations should specify who is permitted to use such tools and under what circumstances.

Because forensic tools may record sensitive information, policies, guidelines, and procedures should also
describe the necessary safeguards for the information. There should also be requirements for handling
inadvertent exposures of sensitive information, such as an incident handler seeing passwords or patient
medical information.

2.4.3   Supporting Forensics in the Information System Life Cycle

Many incidents can be handled more efficiently and effectively if forensic considerations have been
incorporated into the information system life cycle. Examples of such considerations are as follows:

    ! Performing regular backups of systems and maintaining previous backups for a specific period of
      time
    ! Enabling auditing on workstations, servers, and network devices
    ! Forwarding audit records to secure centralized log servers
    ! Configuring mission-critical applications to perform auditing, including recording all
      authentication attempts
    ! Maintaining a database of file hashes for the files of common OS and application deployments,
      and using file integrity checking software on particularly important assets
    ! Maintaining records (e.g., baselines) of network and system configurations
