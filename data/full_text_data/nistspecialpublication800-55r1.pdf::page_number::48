The following activities are generally performed as a part of business case analysis. They are
pursued within the bounds of agency-specific processes to obtain the resources needed to
implement corrective actions, and include:

       •     Document mission and objectives (identified during Phase 2 of the measures
             development process);

       •     Determine the cost and risks of maintaining status quo to use as a baseline for comparing
             investment alternatives;

       •     Document the information security performance gaps between target performance and
             current performance, as evidenced by the current measures collected during Phase 2 of
             the information security measurement program implementation process;

       •     Estimate the life cycle costs of each corrective action or investment alternative, as
             identified in Phase 3 of the information security measurement program implementation
             process;

       •     Perform sensitivity analysis to determine which variables have the greatest effect on the
             cost; 11

       •     Characterize benefits that are quantifiable and non-quantifiable returns delivered through
             improved performance, based on the prioritization of corrective actions performed in
             Phase 3 of the information security measurement program implementation process;

       •     Perform risk analysis to assess the likelihood of obstacles and programmatic risks
             inherent to a particular alternative; and

       •     Prepare budget submission by summarizing key aspects of the business case to accurately
             illustrate its merits. 12

Each agency should follow its specific business case guidelines during this phase of the process.
Agencies typically have unique business case processes and life cycle spending thresholds that
determine which investments and budget requests require a formal business case. In general, the
level of effort to develop the business case should correspond with the size and scope of the
funding request. For example, the business case to build and maintain a disaster recovery site
would be more thorough than a business case to establish an account review process.

Regardless of the scope and complexity of the business case, its underlying components and
analysis enable easier completion of internal and external budget requests. A thorough

     If a small change in the value of a variable causes a large change in the calculation result, the result is said to be sensitive to
        that parameter or assumption.
