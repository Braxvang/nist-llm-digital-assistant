GUIDE TO TEST, TRAINING, AND EXERCISE PROGRAMS FOR IT PLANS AND CAPABILITIES



Controllers, data collectors, and simulators should be pre-positioned at the location where the exercise
takes place. Controllers form a control cell—a central location for exercise coordination, typically in a
separate area from the exercise participants—from which the controllers introduce the scenario and
message injects to participants. Controllers administer the exercise by referring to the message inject
tracking form and MSEL to ensure the exercise remains on schedule and within scope.

Data collectors directly observe player actions during the exercise. They refer to the evaluation criteria
and any other evaluation forms that the data collection team may create to aid their efforts. Simulators
assume the roles of various internal and external entities that are not participating in the event, such as
other government organizations, private citizens, or law enforcement. Information provided by
simulators should be delivered in accordance with how it would be provided by the organization(s) being
simulated. They coordinate closely with the controllers and exercise director to ensure their responses are
consistent with the MSEL. Simulators may be collocated with controllers or assemble a response cell in a
separate room. During the course of exercise, the exercise director, controllers, data collectors, and
simulators should remain in constant contact with each other to ensure that the exercise remains
coordinated and on schedule.

The exercise director announces when the exercise concludes. Typically, this occurs when the time
allocated for the exercise has ended, or earlier if all objectives have been met or the MSEL and injects
have been fully played out. In cases where a real-world emergency occurs, it is the exercise director’s
responsibility to call an immediate end to the event. Following the conclusion of exercise play, the
exercise director, controllers, and data collectors should conduct an exercise debrief with participants,
often referred to as a hotwash. The exercise director leads the hotwash and requests feedback from
participants, controllers, simulators, and data collectors. Immediately following the exercise, the
controllers, data collectors, simulators, and participants should be asked to provide the exercise director
with their notes or any forms completed during the course of the exercise and the hotwash session.

5.5   Evaluate the Functional Exercise

During the evaluation phase, the exercise director relies on the design team or other specified staff to
develop the after action report that documents findings and recommendations from the functional
exercise. Exercise notes, forms, and other material created during the course of exercise play and during
the hotwash are the basis of the after action report. The introduction to the after action report should
document background information about the exercise such as the scope, objectives, and scenario. The
after action report should also document observations made by the exercise staff and participants during
the exercise and recommendations for enhancing the IT plan that was exercised. The after action report
should also include a list of exercise participants and may provide information from any participant
surveys that were distributed during the hotwash to solicit feedback.

Following the development of the after action report, the plan coordinator might assign action items to
select personnel in an effort to update the IT plan being exercised. The plan coordinator should then
update the plan, if appropriate, by implementing recommendations made in the after action report. It may
also be necessary to brief certain managers on the results of the exercise, update other security-related
documents, and perform other actions based on the exercise.

5.6   Summary

Functional exercises allow personnel with operational responsibilities to validate their IT plans and their
operational readiness for emergencies in a simulated operational environment. Activities for a functional
exercise are scenario-driven, such as a particular building’s IT systems becoming unavailable in the
simulated environment and the participants then learning that the building is on fire. Additional situations
