                                                              Guidelines on Mobile Device Forensics

             Review seized material – Passwords or PINs may be written down on a slip of paper
              and kept with or near the phone, at a desktop computer used to synchronize with the
              mobile device, or with the owner, such as in a wallet, and may be recovered through
              visual inspection. Packaging material for a UICC or a mobile device may disclose a
              PIN Unlocking Key (PUK) that may be used to reset the value of the PIN. Device
              specific vulnerabilities may also be exploited, such as Smudge attacks. Smudge
              attacks involved careful analysis of the surface of a touch screen device to determine
              the most recent gesture lock used [Avi10].

             Ask the service provider – If a GSM mobile device is protected with a PIN-enabled
              UICC, the identifier (i.e., the ICCID) may be obtained from it and used to request the
              PUK from the service provider and reset the PIN. Some service providers offer the
              ability to retrieve the PUK online, by entering the telephone number of the mobile
              device and specific subscriber information into public web pages set up for this
              purpose. Additionally, information may be obtained by contacting the device
              manufacturer (e.g., Apple).

      Mobile device users may choose weak passwords to secure their device such as: 1-1-1-1, 0-0-
      0-0 or 1-2-3-4. Some of these numeric combinations are device default passcodes provided by
      the manufacturer. It is not recommended to attempt to unlock a device using these
      combinations due to several risk factors. They may include permanent wiping of mobile
      device memory, enabling additional security mechanisms (e.g., PIN/PUK) or initializing
      destructive applications. Mobile devices generally have a defined number of attempts before
      enabling further security precautions. Before making any attempts at unlocking a mobile
      device, it is recommended to consider the number of attempts left. There may be an instance
      where an examiner may choose to accept these risks in cases where this is the only option for
      data extraction.

3.4   Forensic Tool Capabilities

      Forensic software tools strive to handle conventional investigative needs by addressing a wide
      range of applicable devices. More difficult situations, such as the recovery of deleted data from
      the memory of a device, may require more specialized tools and expertise and disassembly of
      the device. The range of support provided, including mobile device cables and drivers, product
      documentation, PC/SC readers, and the frequency of updates, may vary significantly among
      products. The features offered such as searching, bookmarking, and reporting capabilities may
      also vary considerably.

      Discrepancies in recovering and reporting the data residing on a device have been noted in
      previous testing of tools. They include the inability to recover resident data, inconsistencies
      between the data displayed on workstation and that generated in output reports, truncated data
      in reported or displayed output, errors in the decoding and translation of recovered data, and
      the inability to recover all relevant data. On occasion, updates or new versions of a tool were
      also found to be less capable in some aspects than a previous version was [Aye11, Jan09].

      Tools should be validated to ensure their acceptability and reapplied when updates or new
      versions of the tool become available. These results play a factor in deciding the
      appropriateness of the tool, how to compensate for any noted shortcomings, and whether to
      consider using a different version or update of the tool. Validating a tool entails defining and
      identifying a comprehensive set of test data, following acquisition procedures to recover the
      test data, and assessing the results [Aye11, Jan09]. Present-day tools seldom provide the means
