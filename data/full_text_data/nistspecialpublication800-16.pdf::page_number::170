5.2       Purposes of Training Effectiveness Evaluation

Meaningfulness, or effectiveness, requires measurement.              Evaluating training effectiveness has
four distinct but interrelated purposes        — measure:
                                                  to


      •     The extent to which conditions were right for learning and the learner's subjective
            satisfaction;


      •     What a given student has learned from a specific course or training event, i.e., learning
            effectiveness;


      •     A pattern of student outcomes following a specific course or training event;      i.e., teaching

            effectiveness; and


      •     The value of the specific class or training event, compared to other options in the context
            of an agency's overall TT security training program; i.e., program effectiveness.


An evaluation process should produce four types of measurement, each related to one of
evaluation's four purposes, as appropriate for three types of users of evaluation data:


      •     First, evaluation should yield information to assist the employees themselves in assessing

            their subsequent on-the-job performance.


  •         Second, evaluation should yield information to assist the employees' supervisors in
            assessing individual students' subsequent on-the-job performance.


      •     Third, it should produce trend data to assist trainers in improving both learning and
            teaching.


      •     Finally,    it   should produce retum-on-investment statistics to enable responsible officials
            to allocate limited resources in a thoughtful, strategic manner among the spectrum of IT
            security awareness, security literacy, training, and education options for optimal results
            among the workforce as a whole.

5.3       Development of an Evaluation Plan

It is difficult to get "good" information for each of evaluation's four purposes (above).         It is

impossible to do so without planning for evaluation.    To evaluate student learning, it is first
necessary to have written learning objectives, stated in an observable, measurable way as
behavioral outcomes: in short, "behavioral objectives." To evaluate teaching, it is necessary to
plan for the collection of trend data, evaluation, and extrapolation. To evaluate return on
investment, mission-related goals must be explicitly identified to which the learning objectives
