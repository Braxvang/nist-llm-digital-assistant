NIST SP 800-160v1r1                                                 Engineering Trustworthy Secure Systems
November 2022

       Note: Deactivation is accomplished to preserve the security posture of the system.
       DS-2.2 Securely remove the system, system element, or waste material from use or production
              for appropriate secure disposition and action.
       DS-2.3 Securely withdraw impacted operating staff from the system or system element, and
              record relevant secure operation knowledge.
       DS-2.4 Securely disassemble the system or system element into manageable elements to
              facilitate its secure removal for reuse, recycling, reconditioning, overhaul, archiving, or
              destruction.
       Note: Secure disassembly preserves the security characteristics of the system elements that are
       not removed.
       DS-2.5 Securely handle system elements and their parts that are not intended for reuse in a
              manner that will help ensure that they do not get back into the supply chain.
       DS-2.6 Conduct secure sanitization and destruction of the system elements and life cycle
              artifacts.
       Note 1: Governing agreements, laws, and regulations determine the appropriate means to
       sanitize and destroy data, information, and system elements that contain data and information,
       as well as retention periods before sanitization and destruction can occur.
       Note 2: Sanitization and destruction techniques include clearing, purging, cryptographic erase,
       physical modification, and physical destruction.
       Note 3: Sanitization and destruction techniques and methods may be specific to data,
       information, and system element type.

DS-3   FINALIZE THE DISPOSAL
       DS-3.1 Confirm that no detrimental security factors exist following disposal.
       DS-3.2 Return the environment to its original secure state or to a secure state specified by
              agreement.
       DS-3.3 Securely archive data and information gathered through the lifetime of the system to
              permit audits and reviews in the event of long-term hazards to health, safety, security,
              and the environment and to permit future system creators and users to securely build a
              knowledge base from past experiences.
       DS-3.4 Provide security-relevant artifacts that have been selected for baselines.
