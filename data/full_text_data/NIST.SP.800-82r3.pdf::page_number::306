OT Discussion: Cryptographic mechanisms are implemented only after careful consideration and
verification that they do not adversely impact the operational performance of the OT. When
cryptographic mechanisms are not feasible on certain OT devices, compensating controls may
include relocating the data to a location that does support cryptographic mechanisms.
Control Enhancement: (1) No OT Discussion for this control.

No OT discussion for this control.
Rationale for adding SC-41 to LOW, MOD, and HIGH baselines: OT functionality is generally
defined in advance and does not change often.
