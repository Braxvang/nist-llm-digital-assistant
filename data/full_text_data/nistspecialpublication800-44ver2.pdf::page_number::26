                                                                  GUIDELINES ON SECURING PUBLIC WEB SERVERS



 Is “hardened” against application-level DoS attacks. Although DoS attacks are most frequently
  targeted at the network and transport layers, the application itself can be a target. If a malicious user
  can monopolize a required application or system resource, legitimate users can be prevented from
  using the system.

3.3   Management Practices

Appropriate management practices are critical to operating and maintaining a secure Web server.
Security practices entail the identification of an organization’s information system assets and the
development, documentation, and implementation of policies, standards, procedures, and guidelines that
ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information system resources.

To ensure the security of a Web server and the supporting network infrastructure, organizations should
implement the following practices:

 Organizational Information System Security Policy—A security policy should specify the basic
  information system security tenets and rules, and their intended internal purpose. The policy should
  also outline who in the organization is responsible for particular areas of information security (e.g.,
  implementation, enforcement, audit, review). The policy must be enforced consistently throughout
  the organization to be effective. Generally, the CIO and senior management are responsible for
  drafting the organization’s security policy.

 Configuration/Change Control and Management—The process of controlling modification to a
  system’s design, hardware, firmware, and software provides sufficient assurance that the system is
  protected against the introduction of an improper modification before, during, and after system
  implementation. Configuration control leads to consistency with the organization’s information
  system security policy. Configuration control is traditionally overseen by a configuration control
  board that is the final authority on all proposed changes to an information system. If resources allow,
  consider the use of development, quality assurance, and/or test environments so that changes can be
  vetted and tested before deployment in production.

 Risk Assessment and Management—Risk assessment is the process of analyzing and interpreting
  risk. It involves determining an assessment’s scope and methodology, collecting and analyzing risk-
  related data, and interpreting the risk analysis results. Collecting and analyzing risk data requires
  identifying assets, threats, vulnerabilities, safeguards, consequences, and the probability of a
  successful attack. Risk management is the process of selecting and implementing controls to reduce
  risk to a level acceptable to the organization.

 Standardized Configurations—Organizations should develop standardized secure configurations
  for widely used OSs and applications. This will provide recommendations to Web server and
  network administrators on how to configure their systems securely and ensure consistency and
  compliance with the organizational security policy. Because it only takes one insecurely configured
  host to compromise a network, organizations with a significant number of hosts are especially
  encouraged to apply this recommendation.

 Secure Programming Practices—Organizations should adopt secure application development
  guidelines to ensure that they develop their Web applications in a sufficiently secure manner.

 Security Awareness and Training—A security training program is critical to the overall security
  posture of an organization. Making users and administrators aware of their security responsibilities
  and teaching the correct practices helps them change their behavior to conform to security best
