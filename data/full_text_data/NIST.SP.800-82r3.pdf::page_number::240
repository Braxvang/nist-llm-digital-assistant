F.4.      Tailoring Considerations
The OT overlay in this publication leverages the NIST SP 800-53B control baselines that
account for the unique characteristics of OT systems, such as an increased need for availability,
safety, and environmental or operating environment considerations. Additionally, OT systems
vary widely in their architecture and technology selection. The NIST SP 800-53B control
baselines were tailored for these general considerations, including the addition of controls
relevant for OT environments. Organizations can use this overlay as a starting point and further
tailor controls to meet specific operational needs to address the variability of OT systems.
As organizations further tailor controls to meet their internal security requirements, limitations
(e.g., technology, operational constraints, environmental considerations) may necessitate the
