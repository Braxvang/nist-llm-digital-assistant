SP 800-130                                                           August 2013



   SP 800-38D specifies the Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) algorithm for authenticated
   encryption with associated data, and its specialization, GMAC, for generating a
   message authentication code (MAC) on data that is not encrypted. GCM and GMAC
   are modes of operation for an underlying, approved symmetric key block cipher
   algorithm. Compliance with this Recommendation is validated under the NIST
   Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP).

    SP 800-38E: DRAFT Recommendation for Block Cipher Modes of Operation: The
    XTS-AES Mode for Confidentiality on Block-Oriented Storage Devices, January 2010,
    http://www.csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html.
    SP 800-38E approves the XTS-AES mode of the AES algorithm by reference to IEEE
    Standard 1619-2007, subject to one additional requirement, as an option for
    protecting the confidentiality of data on block-oriented storage devices. The mode
    does not provide authentication of the data or its source.

    SP 800-38F: Recommendation for Block Cipher Modes of Operation: Methods for
    Key Wrapping, December 2012, http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html.
    SP 800-38F describes cryptographic methods that are approved for “key wrapping,”
    i.e., the protection of the confidentiality and integrity of cryptographic keys.

    SP 800-53: Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems,
    August, 2009, http://www.csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html.
    SP 800-53 provides guidelines for selecting and specifying security controls for
    information systems supporting the executive agencies of the Federal government.
    The guidelines apply to all components of an information system that process, store,
    or transmit Federal information. The guidelines have been developed to help achieve
    more secure information systems within the Federal government by:
       a) Facilitating a more consistent, comparable, and repeatable approach for
          selecting and specifying security controls for information systems;
       b) Providing a recommendation for minimum security controls for information
          systems categorized in accordance with Federal Information Processing
          Standards (FIPS) 199, Standards for Security Categorization of Federal
          Information and Information Systems;
       c) Promoting a dynamic, extensible catalog of security controls for information
          systems to meet the demands of changing requirements and technologies; and
       d) Creating a foundation for the development of assessment methods and
          procedures for determining security control effectiveness.
