5.1.2   Risk Analysis and Management

Security involves continually analyzing and managing risks and, as seen in the previous section, active
content has its share of risks. Any such analysis should identify vulnerabilities and threats, enumerate
potential attacks, assess their likelihood of success, and estimate the potential damage from successful
attacks. Risk management is the process of assessing risk, taking steps to reduce risk to an acceptable
level, and maintaining that level of risk. Ongoing risk analysis and management is an important
organizational activity that is increasingly being mandated by law and regulation.

Security is relative to each organization and needs to be tailored to an organization’s specific
requirements, budget, and culture. Organizations, much like people, have differing comfort levels on the
amount of risk that is reasonable, which may influence this process. Once an assessment is made,
safeguards can be put in place against those attacks deemed significantly high by either reducing the
likelihood of occurrence or minimizing the consequences of the attack. Different safeguards are
employed to meet an organization’s specific needs.

The General Accounting Office (GAO) analyzed and summarized information security weaknesses
identified in audit reports of Federal agencies [GAO07] issued for fiscal years 2004, 2005 and 2006.
They noted that most of the organizations reviewed had not fully implemented agencywide information
security programs.

        “An agencywide security program provides a framework and continuing cycle of activity
        for managing risk, developing security policies, assigning responsibilities, promoting
        awareness, monitoring the adequacy of the entity’s computer-related controls through
        security tests and evaluations, and implementing remedial actions as appropriate.
        Without a well-designed program, security controls may be inadequate; responsibilities
        may be unclear, misunderstood, and improperly implemented; and controls may be
        inconsistently applied. Such conditions may lead to insufficient protection of sensitive or
        critical resources… As a result, agencies do not have reasonable assurance that controls
        are implemented correctly, operating as intended, or producing the desired outcome with
        respect to meeting the security requirements of the agency. Furthermore, agencies may
        not be fully aware of the security control weaknesses in their systems, thereby leaving
        their information and systems vulnerable to attack or compromise. Until agencies
        effectively and fully implement agencywide information security programs, Federal data
        and systems will not be adequately safeguarded to prevent unauthorized use, disclosure,
        and modification.”

NIST has developed a guide on implementing an information security risk assessment process [NIST02].
The risk management methodology provided explains each step of the process and how each step fits into
the system development life cycle (SDLC). The guide divides risk management into two main activities:
risk assessment and risk mitigation. Through the risk management process defined in the guide,
organizations will be able to better accomplish their missions by:

 Securing the IT systems that store, process, or transmit organizational information
 Enabling management to make well-informed risk management decisions to justify the expenditures
  that are part of an IT budget
