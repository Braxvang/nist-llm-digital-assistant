SP 800-132        Recommendation for Password-Based Key Derivation         December 2010



more difficult.

However, the computation required for key derivation by legitimate users also increases
with the number of iterations. The user may perceive this increase, for example, in the
time required for authentication, or in the time to access the protected data on the storage
medium. There is an obvious tradeoff: larger iteration counts make attacks more costly,
but hurt performance for the authorized user. The number of iterations should be set as
high as can be tolerated for the environment, while maintaining acceptable performance.

Acceptable performance is a function of the capabilities of the system doing the key
derivation and the application. For example, consider a “whole disk” drive encryption
application that boots a laptop computer from an encrypted drive, a fairly common
application for password-based key derivation. The overall cold boot process, from the
time the laptop is turned on until the system is loaded and available for use, may require
thirty seconds to two minutes, and involve an operating system-level user authentication,
as well as the entry of the boot password. A cold boot of a system is a relatively
infrequent event. In such an application, it would be reasonable to set an iteration count
that required a second on the target machine, because the delay introduced would be
small compared to the overall boot time.

At the other extreme, assume that a key is to be created as required for specific
transactions, and that a user may do this many times an hour. The time to open the file
independently of the password entry and key derivation is only a second or two. In this
case, a delay of more than a second for the derivation of the key from the password will
be apparent and annoying to the user. This suggests that the iteration count should not
add more than a quarter of a second on the target machine.

If the key derivation is to be performed on a server, then performance may be harder to
gauge, and may depend on the peak load of the server. In many cases, however, even on
servers, key derivation is only done once for a long session, and in these circumstances, a
user-apparent delay of several seconds for key derivation may be tolerable.
