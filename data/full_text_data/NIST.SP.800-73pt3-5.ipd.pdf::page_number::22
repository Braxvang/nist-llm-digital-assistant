      NIST SP 800-73pt3-5 ipd (Initial Public Draft)             Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification: Part 3
      September 2023                                                                                 PIV Client API

542                    KeyLength                       As an input, the length of the buffer allocated for
543                                                    publicKey; as an output, length of the public key-
544                                                    related data retrieved from the PIV Card
545   Return Codes:             PIV_OK
546                             PIV_INVALID_CARD_HANDLE
547                             PIV_SECURITY_CONDITIONS_NOT_SATISFIED
548                             PIV_FUNCTION_NOT_SUPPORTED
549                             PIV_INVALID_KEY_OR_KEYALG_COMBINATION
550                             PIV_UNSUPPORTED_CRYPTOGRAPHIC_MECHANISM
551                             PIV_CARD_READER_ERROR
552                             PIV_INSUFFICIENT_BUFFER

553   If the length of public key-related data retrieved from the PIV Card is longer than the buffer
554   allocated by the client application, then the PIV Middleware SHALL return
555   PIV_INSUFFICIENT_BUFFER but SHALL still set KeyLength to the length of the public key-
556   related data retrieved from the PIV Card.
