                                                               GUIDELINES FOR THE SECURE DEPLOYMENT OF IPV6




This contains useful advice for thinking through how IPsec can be applied, but the current version is not
up to date with the most recent IPsec RFCs.



IP Compression (IPComp)

 RFC 3173 IP Payload Compression (IPComp)
 RFC 2394 IP Payload Compression Using DEFLATE
 RFC 2395 IP Payload Compression Using LZS

IP payload compression is especially useful when IPsec based encryption is applied to IP datagrams.
Encrypting the IP datagram causes the data to be random in nature, rendering compression at lower
protocol layers ineffective. If IKE is used to negotiate compression in conjunction with IPsec,
compression can be performed prior to encryption.

APIs (Application Program Interfaces) for IPsec
 RFC 5660 IPsec Channels: Connection Latching
A number of different API Internet Drafts have been proposed, but have not progressed to standards. One
issue that needs to be resolved is how application program security policy and system security policy
interact and can be aligned with each other.
IPsecME (IPsec Maintenance and Extensions)
As IPsec and IKE have been deployed, operational issues, feature gaps and additional requirements have
surfaced. The IPsecME working group was formed to address several of these issues, including:
        Combining the two IKEv2 RFCs (RFCs 4306 and 4718) into a single RFC, which includes
         other clarifications and corrections, without introducing changes to the underlying protocol.
         RFC 5996 replaces the two older IKEv2 RFCs.
        Extending IKEv2 to allow IPv6 remote clients to negotiate all required parameters needed to
         conduct IPv6-based IPsec communications.
        Adding two new capabilities to IKEv2 that will improve performance for remote clients: allow
         a client to re-authenticate to a gateway in a streamlined manner, and permit a gateway to re-
         direct a remote client to another gateway.
        Enabling IKEv2 peers to quickly detect the loss of IKEv2/IPsec SAs.
        Adding two new IKEv2 authentication methods: mutual EAP-based authentication and mutual
         authentication based on ―weak‖ shared secrets.
        Describing potential issues and requirements to enable gateway clusters to establish and use
         IKEv2 and IPsec SAs
