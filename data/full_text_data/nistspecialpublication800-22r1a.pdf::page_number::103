        assess           The NIST Statistical Test Suite executable file is called assess. This file will be
                         generated upon execution of the included makefile.

        makefile         The NIST Statistical Test Suite makefile. This file is invoked in order to build
                         the entire test suite and produce the executable file assess.

        data/            This subdirectory contains sample data files to be analyzed. These include the
                         binary expansions to well known constants such as e, π,       2 , and 3 .

        experiments/     This subdirectory contains the empirical result subdirectories for each RNG.

                         For each subdirectory there is a set of nested directories, that is,

                         For each nested directory there are two files created upon execution of an
                         individual statistical test. The results file contains a P-value list for each binary
                         sequence, and the stats file contains a list of statistical information for each
                         binary sequence.

        include/         This subdirectory contains all of the header files that prescribe any global
                         variables, constants, and data structures utilized in the reference implementation.
                         In addition, the subdirectory contains all function declarations and prototypes.

        obj/             This subdirectory contains the object files corresponding to the source code files.
                         These files will be generated upon execution of the included makefile.
