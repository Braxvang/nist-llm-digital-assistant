                                  The Computer Security Division uses multiple NIST Technical Series to promulgate security standards,
                                guidelines, recommendations, research, and additional background material. Those series include Federal
                                Information Processing Standards (FIPS), NIST Special Publications (SPs), NIST Interagency or Internal
                                Reports (NISTIRs) and Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) Bulletins. Links to these publications are
                                available at http://csrc.nist.gov/publications.
                                  Additionally, each year CSD staff authors numerous additional publications, including journal articles,
                                conference papers, and other papers that are widely disseminated. They range from basic research to
                                high-level summaries of CSD activities.
