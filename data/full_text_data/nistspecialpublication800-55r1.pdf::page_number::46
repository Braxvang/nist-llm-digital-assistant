       •   Consolidate collected data and store in a format conducive to data analysis and
           reporting—for example, in a database or spreadsheet;

       •   Conduct gap analysis to compare collected measurements with targets (if defined)
           and identify gaps between actual and desired performance;

       •   Identify causes of poor performance; and

       •   Identify areas that require improvement.

Causes of poor performance can often be identified by using the data from more than one
measure. For example, determining that the percentage of approved system security plans is
unacceptably low would not be helpful for determining how to correct the problem. To
determine the cause of low compliance, information will need to be obtained regarding the
reasons for the low percentages (e.g., lack of guidelines, insufficient expertise, or conflicting
priorities). This can be collected as separate measures or as implementation evidence for the
percentage of approved system security plans. Once this information is collected and compiled,
corrective actions could be directed at the cause of the problem.

The following are examples of factors contributing to poor security implementation and
effectiveness:

   •   Resources—Insufficient human, monetary, or other resources;

   •   Training—Lack of appropriate training for personnel installing, administering,
       maintaining, or using the information systems;

   •   Information system upgrades—Information security patches that have been removed but
       not replaced during information system upgrades;

   •   Configuration management practices—New or upgraded information systems that are not
       configured with required information security settings and patches;

   •   Software compatibility—Information security patches or upgrades that are incompatible
       with software applications supported by the information system;

   •   Awareness and commitment—Lack of management awareness and/or commitment to
       information security;

   •   Policies and procedures—Lack of policies and procedures required to ensure existence,
       use, and audit of required information security functions;

   •   Architectures—Poor information system and information security architectures that
       render information systems vulnerable; and
