  Executive Summary to the Federal S/MIME V3 Client Profile

(For Procurement Officials, Implementers, Vendors and Others Interested in Specifying
S/MIME Technology)

S/MIME (Secure / Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) is a set of specifications for securing
electronic mail. S/MIME is based upon the widely used MIME standard [MIME] and describes a
protocol for adding cryptographic security services through MIME encapsulation of digitally
signed and encrypted objects. The basic security services offered by S/MIME are authentication,
non-repudiation of origin, message integrity, and message privacy. Optional security services
include signed receipts, security labels, secure mailing lists, and an extended method of
identifying the signer’s certificate(s).

To understand S/MIME it is useful to understand some of the history of Internet e-mail. In the
past twenty-five years or so, Internet e-mail has evolved from a simple text-based (ASCII)
transfer of messages designed for researchers into a more sophisticated messaging system
capable of communicating a wealth of digital information (e.g., photographic images, computer
files, sound clips, cinema) to many millions of people around the world.

Internet e-mail was designed for a small community of trusted researchers (primarily at
university and government sites) for exchanging text-based messages, and thus security was not
a goal in its design. Over the years many deficiencies in Internet e-mail have been overcome to a
certain extent through the use of a technology called Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions
(MIME). Employing MIME for messaging allows the use of multiple-text effects (e.g., bold,
italic, various font sizes, and colors) as well as the transfer of digital information. MIME by
itself also does not address security issues. However, a set of security features has been
developed and added to MIME to form what is known as S/MIME (Secure MIME).

S/MIME adds features to e-mail messaging including privacy (using encryption), authentication
of sending party (using digital signatures), integrity (non-alteration of messages), etc. S/MIME
V3 is the latest version of S/MIME and is supported in whole or part by several vendors with
“Commercial-Off-The-Shelf” (COTS) products.

Because S/MIME still uses the same extant Internet e-mail technology that has been widely
deployed for many years, it is not necessary to modify or replace e-mail “servers” to
accommodate S/MIME. Rather S/MIME functionality may be added to e-mail “client” software.
By not disturbing the underlying e-mail server/message transfer system, S/MIME allows gradual
migration from non-secure to secure e-mail messaging, rather than requiring a large, possibly
abrupt change in technology.

Like other services and protocols used by the Internet community, S/MIME has been under
development for many years, with the main components specified by the Internet Engineering
Task Force (IETF), a technical body that issues specifications that serve as standards for vendor
