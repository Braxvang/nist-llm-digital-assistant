       NIST SP 800-63B-4 ipd                                              Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022                                       Authentication and Lifecycle Management


1208   Each authentication operation using the authenticator SHOULD require the input of the
1209   activation factor. Input of the activation factor MAY be accomplished via either direct
1210   input on the device or via a hardware connection (e.g., USB, smartcard).
1211   The use of an activation secret by the authenticator SHALL meet the requirements of
1212   Sec. 5.2.11. A biometric activation factor SHALL meet the requirements of Sec. 5.2.3,
1213   including limits on the number of consecutive authentication failures. Submission of the
1214   activation factor SHALL be a separate operation from unlocking of the host device (e.g.,
1215   smartphone), although the same activation factor used to unlock the host device MAY
1216   be used in the authentication operation. The activation secret or biometric sample — and
1217   any biometric data derived from the biometric sample such as a probe produced through
1218   signal processing — SHALL be zeroized immediately after an authentication transaction
1219   has taken place.

1220   5.1.9.2. Multi-Factor Cryptographic Device Veriﬁers
1221   The requirements for a multi-factor cryptographic device verifier are identical to those for
1222   a single-factor cryptographic device verifier, described in Sec. 5.1.7.2. Verification of the
1223   authenticator output from a multi-factor cryptographic device proves use of the activation
1224   factor.

1225   5.2. General Authenticator Requirements
1226   5.2.1. Physical Authenticators
1227   CSPs SHALL provide subscriber instructions on how to appropriately protect the
1228   authenticator against theft or loss. The CSP SHALL provide a mechanism to invalidate
1229   the authenticator immediately upon notification from subscriber that loss or theft of the
1230   authenticator is suspected.

1231   5.2.2. Rate Limiting (Throttling)
1232   When required by the authenticator type descriptions in Sec. 5.1, the verifier SHALL
1233   implement controls to protect against online guessing attacks. Unless otherwise specified
1234   in the description of a given authenticator, the verifier SHALL limit consecutive failed
1235   authentication attempts on a single subscriber account to no more than 100.
1236   Additional techniques MAY be used to reduce the likelihood that an attacker will lock the
1237   legitimate claimant out as a result of rate limiting. These include:
1238       • Requiring the claimant to complete a bot-detection and mitigation challenge before
1239         attempting authentication.
1240       • Requiring the claimant to wait following a failed attempt for a period of time
1241         that increases as the subscriber account approaches its maximum allowance for
1242         consecutive failed attempts (e.g., 30 seconds up to an hour).
