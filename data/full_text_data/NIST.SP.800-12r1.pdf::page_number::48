                                                                                              Information assurance is the degree of confidence one has that security measures protect and

                                                                                              confidentiality, and non-repudiation. These measures include providing for restoration of
                                                                                              systems by incorporating protection, detection, and reaction capabilities.
                                                                                              Assurance is not, however, an absolute guarantee that the measures will work as intended.
                                                                                              Understanding this distinction is crucial as quantifying the security of a system can be daunting.
                                                                                              Nevertheless, it is something individuals expect and obtain, often without realizing it. For
