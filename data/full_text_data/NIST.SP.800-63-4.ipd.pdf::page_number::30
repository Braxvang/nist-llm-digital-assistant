      NIST SP 800-63-4 ipd                                                Digital Identity Guidelines

764   characters and less complexity than cryptographic keys to facilitate memorization and
765   ease of entry. The result is that memorized secrets have increased vulnerabilities that
766   require additional defenses to mitigate.
767   There is another type of memorized secret used as an activation factor for a multi-factor
768   authenticator. These are referred to as activation secrets. An activation secret is used to
769   decrypt a stored key used for authentication or is compared against a locally held stored
770   verifier to provide access to the authentication key. In either of these cases, the activation
771   secret remains within the authenticator and its associated user endpoint. An example of an
772   activation secret would be the PIN used to activate a PIV card.
773   As used in these guidelines, authenticators always contain or comprise a secret; however,
774   some authentication methods used for in-person interactions do not apply directly to
775   digital authentication. For example, a physical driver’s license is something you have
776   and may be useful when authenticating to a human (e.g., a security guard) but it is not an
777   authenticator for online services.
778   Some commonly used authentication methods do not contain or comprise secrets, and are
779   therefore not acceptable for use under these guidelines. For example:
780       • Knowledge-based authentication, where the claimant is prompted to answer
781         questions that are presumably known only by the claimant, does not constitute
782         an acceptable secret for digital authentication.
783       • A biometric also does not constitute a secret and can not be used as a single-factor
784         authenticator.
785   A digital authentication system may incorporate multiple factors in one of two ways:
786      1. The system may be implemented so that multiple factors are presented to the
787         verifier, or
788      2. Some factors may be used to protect a secret that will be presented to the verifier.
789   For example, item 1 can be satisfied by pairing a memorized secret (something you
790   know) with an out-of-band device (something you have). Both authenticator outputs
791   are presented to the verifier to authenticate the claimant. For item 2, the authenticator
792   and authenticator secret could be a piece of hardware that contains a cryptographic key
793   (something you have) that is controlled by the claimant where access is protected with a
794   fingerprint (something you are). When used with the biometric factor, the cryptographic
795   key produces an output that is used to authenticate the claimant.
796   As noted above, biometrics do not constitute acceptable secrets for digital authentication
797   and, therefore, cannot be used for single-factor authentication. However, biometrics
798   authentication can be used as an authentication factor for multi-factor authentication when
799   used in combination with a possession-based authenticator. Biometric characteristics
800   are unique, personal attributes that can be used to verify the identity of a person who is
