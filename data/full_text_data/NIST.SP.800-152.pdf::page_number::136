Backup (key and/or     To copy a key and/or metadata to a medium that is separate
metadata)              from that used for operational storage and from which the key
                       and/or metadata can be recovered if the original values in

Backup (system)        The process of copying information or processing status to a
                       redundant system, service, device or medium that can provide
                       the needed processing capability when needed.
Certification path     A chain of trusted public-key certificates that begins with a
                       certificate whose signature can be verified by a relying party
                       using a trust anchor, and ends with the certificate of the entity
                       whose trust needs to be established.
Ciphertext             Data in its encrypted form.
CKMS                   A Cryptographic Key Management System that conforms to
                       the requirements of [SP 800-130].
CKMS design            The capabilities that were selected and specified by a CKMS
                       designer to be implemented and supported in a CKMS
                       product.
CKMS designer          The entity that selects the capabilities to be included in a
                       CKMS, documents the design in accordance with the
                       requirements specified in [SP 800-130], and specifies a
                       CKMS Security Policy that defines the rules that are to be
                       enforced in the CKMS.
CKMS developer         The entity that assembles a CKMS as designed by the CKMS
                       designer.
CKMS implementer       The entity that installs the CKMS for the FCKMS service
                       provider.
CKMS module            A device that performs a set of key and metadata-management
                       functions for at least one CKMS.
CKMS Security Policy   A security policy specific to a CKMS
CKMS product           An implementation of a CKMS design produced by a vendor
                       that conforms to the requirements of [SP 800-130], provides a
                       set of key-management services and cryptographic functions,
                       and operates in accordance with the CKMS designer’s CKMS
                       Security Policy.
CKMS vendor            The entity that markets the CKMS to CKMS service

Compatible security    Two Security Domains are compatible if they can exchange a
