      NIST SP 800-157r1 ipd                            Derived PIV Credentials (Initial Public Draft)
      January 2023


953   Appendix C.      Example Issuance Processes
954   This appendix is informative.
955   The issuance process for a derived PIV credential varies depending on whether the
956   derived PIV credential is being issued at AAL2 or AAL3. Section 2.2 specifies the
957   requirements for initial issuance. This appendix provides two example issuance processes
958   that satisfy those requirements: one at AAL2 and another at AAL3.

959   C.1. Example Issuance of a Derived PIV Credential at AAL2
960   The following is an example of a PKI-based derived PIV credential.
961   An employee requires a mobile device for work. The mobile device is ordered, and a
962   request for the issuance of a derived PIV credential is submitted to the agency’s approval
963   authority.
964   Following receipt of the device and approval, the employee starts the binding process
965   remotely — such as from their home — by visiting a derived PIV credential website
966   operated by or on behalf of their PIV Card’s home agency. The website requires TLS
967   client authentication using the PIV authentication certificate on the employee’s PIV Card.
968   The employee performs this step from a desktop computer since they cannot use their PIV
969   Card on a mobile device. By requiring and validating a PIV Authentication certificate
970   when connecting to the website, the server authenticates the employee and verifies
971   that the employee is still eligible to possess a PIV Card. If the employee successfully
972   authenticates to the server, the issuer generates and displays a binding secret to the
973   employee.
974   The employee then runs a provisioning application on the mobile device. The application
975   asks the employee to identify themself and enter the binding secret that was previously
976   provided from the desktop website to create an activation secret, which will subsequently
977   be used to authenticate to the cryptographic module. The application generates a key
978   pair within the device’s cryptographic module and submits the binding secret and
979   newly generated public key to the PIV issuer as part of a certificate request. The PIV
980   issuer authenticates the employee by verifying that the binding secret in the certificate
981   request matches the one that it previously issued and forwards the public key to the CA,
982   which signs and issues the derived PIV credential (i.e., the derived PIV authentication
983   certificate). The provisioning application loads the derived PIV authentication certificate
984   on the mobile device. The PIV Card issuer enters information about the new derived PIV
985   credential into the subscriber’s PIV identity account. The cardholder is notified of the
986   binding of the new derived PIV credential.
987   Normative requirements for this process are given in [SP800-63B] Sec. 6.1.2.4 and in
988   Sec. 2.2 of this document.
