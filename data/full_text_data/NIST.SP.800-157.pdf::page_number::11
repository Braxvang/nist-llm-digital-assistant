Special Publication 800-157                                                     Guidelines for Derived PIV Credentials


2.      Lifecycle Activities and Related Requirements

The lifecycle activities (phases) for a Derived PIV Credential are initial issuance and maintenance. This
section describes these lifecycle activities and provides requirements and recommendations as
appropriate.

Issuers of Derived PIV Credentials must document the process for each of the lifecycle activities
described below. In accordance with [HSPD-12], the reliability of the Derived PIV Credential issuer shall
be established through an official accreditation process. The process, as outlined in [SP800-79], shall
include an independent (third-party) assessment.

2.1     Derived PIV Credential Lifecycle Activities

The Derived PIV Credential lifecycle consists of five activities. The activities that take place at the
manufacturer during fabrication and pre-personalization of the cryptographic token are not considered
part of this lifecycle model. Figure 2-1 presents these Derived PIV Credential activities alongside the PIV
Card lifecycle activities.

                              Figure 2-1 Derived PIV Credential Lifecycle Activities

The Derived PIV Credential lifecycle begins with a request for the issuance of a Derived PIV Credential
to the Applicant and validation of the request. This request may be part of the process of provisioning a
PIV cardholder with a government-issued mobile device or of approving the use of a personally-owned
mobile device to access government information systems (see [SP800-96] Draft NIST Special Publication
800-96, PIV Card to Reader Interoperability Guidelines, NIST, September 2006, or as amended.
