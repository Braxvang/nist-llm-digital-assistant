Appendix A: CANDIDATE MEASURES

 Devoting sufficient time to establishing information security performance measures is critical
 to deriving the maximum value from measuring information security performance.

This section offers a sampling of program-level and system-level measures. The sample
measures include information security programmatic measures, and measures that align with the
minimum security requirements in Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 200,
Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems, which
correspond to the 17 security control families in NIST SP 800-53. They are not intended for
adoption as a complete set, but are provided as examples that organizations can tailor and adapt
to measure the performance of their information security programs. Examples of tailoring
include specific time frames, implementation evidence, data sources, formulas, reporting
formats, frequency, responsible parties, or adding further fields to the template.

It should be noted that these measures do not completely address the minimum security
requirements from FIPS 200, but will address one or more important aspects of the requirements.
Organizations should look into developing additional measures to complement or replace those
provided in this section if the samples are not appropriate for their needs.

These candidate measures offer examples of specific security controls implemented at the
program level or at the system level and include all measure typesâ€”implementation,
effectiveness/efficiency, and impact.
