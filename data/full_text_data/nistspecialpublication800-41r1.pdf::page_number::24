Many hardware firewall devices have a feature called DMZ, an acronym related to the demilitarized zones
that are sometimes set up between warring countries. While no single technical definition exists for
firewall DMZs, they are usually interfaces on a routing firewall that are similar to the interfaces found on
the firewall’s protected side. The major difference is that traffic moving between the DMZ and other
interfaces on the protected side of the firewall still goes through the firewall and can have firewall
protection policies applied. DMZs are sometimes useful for organizations that have hosts that need to
have all traffic destined for the host bypass some of the firewall’s policies (for example, because the DMZ
hosts are sufficiently hardened), but traffic coming from the hosts to other systems on the organization’s
network need to go through the firewall. It is common to put public-facing servers, such as web and email
servers, on the DMZ. An example of this is shown in Figure 3-2, a simple network layout of a firewall
with a DMZ. Traffic from the Internet goes into the firewall and is routed to systems on the firewall’s
protected side or to systems on the DMZ. Traffic between systems on the DMZ and systems on the
protected network goes through the firewall, and can have firewall policies applied.
