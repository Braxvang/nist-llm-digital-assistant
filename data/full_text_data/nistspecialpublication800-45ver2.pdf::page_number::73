7.1.4    Management Network

Mail servers, gateways, and other important components can be connected to each other and managed
through an organization’s standard networks or through a separate network known as a management
network. If a management network is used, each host being managed through the network has an
additional network interface known as a management interface that connects to the management network.
Also, each host being managed is unable to pass any traffic between its management interface and any of
its other network interfaces. Consoles and other hosts that are used to manage the mail components are
attached to the management network only. This architecture effectively isolates the management network
from the production networks. The benefits of doing this are to protect the components from some
attacks and to ensure that the components can be managed under adverse conditions (e.g., widespread
email-borne malware infection). Disadvantages of using a management network include the additional
costs in networking equipment and other hardware (e.g., PCs for the consoles) and the inconvenience for
mail component administrators of using separate computers for management and monitoring.

7.2     Network Element Configuration

Once the mail server has been positioned in the network, the network infrastructure elements should be
configured to support and protect it. The elements of a network infrastructure that affect mail server
security are firewalls, routers, intrusion detection and intrusion prevention systems, and switches. Each
has an important role to play and is critical to the overall strategy of protecting the mail server through
layered protection. Unfortunately, when it comes to securing a mail server, there is no single “silver
bullet” solution. A firewall or intrusion prevention system alone cannot adequately protect a mail server
from all threats or attacks.

7.2.1    Router/Firewall Configuration

Several types of firewalls exist. The most basic ones are routers that can provide access control on IP
packets. In the middle are stateful firewalls that can provide access control based on TCP and User
