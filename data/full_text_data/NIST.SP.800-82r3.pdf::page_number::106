NIST SP 800-82r3                                          Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security

   â€¢   Implement a DMZ to separate the control centers from the enterprise network. Any
       communications between the enterprise network and the control centers must go through
       services within the DMZ. Since the DMZ connects to outside environments, the services
       within the DMZ must be monitored and protected to avoid compromises within the DMZ
       that might allow attackers to pivot to the OT environment without detection.

For Layer 4 and Layer 5, organizations should consider applying the principle of least
functionality to all remote station components, control center components, and DMZ devices to
support application and device hardening. Organizations should identify and disable any non-
essential capability, software, or ports on the devices. For example, a webserver or SSH server
may be available in some newer PLCs or HMIs. If these services are not used, they should be
disabled, and the associated TCP/UDP ports should be disabled. Only enable the functionality
when required.
