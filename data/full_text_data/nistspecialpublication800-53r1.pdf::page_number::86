CM-7      LEAST FUNCTIONALITY

          Control: The organization configures the information system to provide only essential capabilities
          and specifically prohibits and/or restricts the use of the following functions, ports, protocols,
          and/or services: [Assignment: organization-defined list of prohibited and/or restricted functions,
          ports, protocols, and/or services].
          Supplemental Guidance: Information systems are capable of providing a wide variety of functions
          and services. Some of the functions and services, provided by default, may not be necessary to
          support essential organizational operations (e.g., key missions, functions). Additionally, it is
          sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from a single component of an information
          system, but doing so increases risk over limiting the services provided by any one component.
          Where feasible, the organization limits component functionality to a single function per device
          (e.g., email server or web server, not both). The functions and services provided by information
          systems, or individual components of information systems, are carefully reviewed to determine
          which functions and services are candidates for elimination (e.g., Voice Over Internet Protocol,
          Instant Messaging, File Transfer Protocol, Hyper Text Transfer Protocol, file sharing).
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization reviews the information system [Assignment: organization-defined frequency], to
                identify and eliminate unnecessary functions, ports, protocols, and/or services.

CM-8      INFORMATION SYSTEM COMPONENT INVENTORY

          Control: The organization develops, documents, and maintains a current inventory of the
          components of the information system and relevant ownership information.
          Supplemental Guidance: The organization determines the appropriate level of granularity for the
          information system components included in the inventory that are subject to management control
          (i.e., tracking, and reporting). The inventory of information system components includes any
          information determined to be necessary by the organization to achieve effective property
          accountability (e.g., manufacturer, model number, serial number, software license information,
          system/component owner). The component inventory is consistent with the accreditation
          boundary of the information system. Related security controls: CM-2, CM-6.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization updates the inventory of information system components as an integral part of
                component installations.
          (2)   The organization employs automated mechanisms to help maintain an up-to-date, complete,
                accurate, and readily available inventory of information system components.
