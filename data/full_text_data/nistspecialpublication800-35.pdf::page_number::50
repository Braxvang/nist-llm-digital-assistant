     Technical assistance (provide detailed analysis of event, such as how it occurred and what failed to
      work properly)
     Eradication (eliminate incident causes and effects)
     Recovery (return systems to normal operations)
     Preventative support
     Operations, maintenance, and monitoring of IDS (incident response tied directly to IDS)
     Training
     Post-incident consulting
     Third-party analysis, validation of eradication and recovery, corrective and mitigation actions, and
      reporting.
5.2.3      Testing

Testing the security posture of information systems and networks is a critical component of securing a
                                                                                                 9
system. A complete and exhaustive discussion of testing is beyond the scope of this document. Testing
is the only way to validate that the security measures and procedures are working as intended. Testing
can also assist in identifying previously unknown weaknesses or vulnerabilities. All test activities,
whether manual or automatic, require human involvement and thus could be provided as a service.

The results of testing can be used in the following ways:

     As a reference point for any corrective action
     As a benchmarking tool to enable the organization to track its progress
     To assess implementation of system security requirements
     For cost-benefit analysis
     As an input into the larger life-cycle activities, such as risk assessments, functional requirements
      analysis, C&A, and performance improvement efforts.
Categories of testing can include the following:

                          Network mapping                                Log review
                          Vulnerability scanning                         Integrity checkers
                          Penetration testing                            Virus detection
                          ST&E                                           War dialing.
                          Password cracking
