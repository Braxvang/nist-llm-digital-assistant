degree of assistance to provide to the reporting organization. A coordinating team may also use this
information to make decisions relative to how a specific incident will affect other organizations in the
community they represent.

Coordinating teams may require member organizations to report on some degree of business impact
information. For example, a coordinating team may require a member organization to report impact
information using the categories defined in Section 3.2.6. In this case, for a hypothetical incident an
organization would report that it has a functional impact of medium, an information impact of none, and
will require extended recoverability time. This high-level information would alert the coordinating team
that the member organization requires some level of additional resources to recover from the incident.
The coordinating team could then pursue additional communication with the member organization to
determine how many resources are required as well as the type of resources based on the technical
information provided about the incident.

Business impact information is only useful for reporting to organizations that have some interest in
ensuring the mission of the organization experiencing the incident. In many cases, incident response
teams should avoid sharing business impact information with outside organizations unless there is a clear
value proposition or formal reporting requirements. When sharing information with peer and partner
organizations, incident response teams should focus on exchanging technical information as outlined in
Section 4.3.2.

4.3.2   Technical Information

There are many different types of technical indicators signifying the occurrence of an incident within an
organization. These indicators originate from the variety of technical information associated with
incidents, such as the hostnames and IP addresses of attacking hosts, samples of malware, precursors and
indicators of similar incidents, and types of vulnerabilities exploited in an incident. Section 3.2.2 provides
an overview of how organizations should collect and utilize these indicators to help identify an incident
that is in progress. In addition, Section 3.2.3 provides a listing of common sources of incident indicator
data.

While organizations gain value from collecting their own internal indicators, they may gain additional
value from analyzing indicators received from partner organizations and sharing internal indicators for
external analysis and use. If the organization receives external indicator data pertaining to an incident they
have not seen, they can use that indicator data to identify the incident as it begins to occur. Similarly, an
organization may use external indicator data to detect an ongoing incident that it was not aware of due to
the lack of internal resources to capture the specific indicator data. Organizations may also benefit from
sharing their internal indicator data with external organizations. For example, if they share technical
information pertaining to an incident they are experiencing, a partner organization may respond with a
suggested remediation strategy for handling that incident.

Organizations should share as much of this information as possible; however, there may be both security
and liability reasons why an organization would not want to reveal the details of an exploited
vulnerability. External indicators, such as the general characteristics of attacks and the identity of
attacking hosts, are usually safe to share with others. Organizations should consider which types of
technical information should or should not be shared with various parties, and then endeavor to share as
much of the appropriate information as possible with other organizations.

Technical indicator data is useful when it allows an organization to identify an actual incident. However,
not all indicator data received from external sources will pertain to the organization receiving it. In some
