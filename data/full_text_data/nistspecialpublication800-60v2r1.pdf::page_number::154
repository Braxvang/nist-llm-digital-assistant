Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: There may be some cases for which
moderate confidentiality impact is associated with unauthorized disclosure of private or
proprietary information associated with use of federally owned/controlled lands for commercial
use (mineral mining, grazing, forestry, fishing, etc.). Additionally, unauthorized disclosure of
details of current agency conservation, marine, and land management activities and plans may
focus opposition and/or give an unfair advantage to competing interests. Consistent premature
disclosure of agency plans may cause significant degradation in mission capability. Also,
conservation, marine, and land management include enforcement functions (e.g., the policing of
marine fisheries). Confidentiality impacts associated with criminal apprehension, criminal
investigation and surveillance, citizen protection, and property protection may cause the
confidentiality impact of enforcement-related information to be moderate or high.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact recommended
for most conservation, marine, and land management information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of conservation, marine, and land
management information depend on whether the information is time-critical.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Unauthorized modification or destruction
of information affecting external communications associated with conservation, marine, and land
management information (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect operations
and/or public confidence in the agency, but the damage to the mission would usually be limited.
Conservation, marine, and land management include enforcement functions (e.g., the policing of
marine fisheries). Integrity impacts associated with criminal apprehension, criminal
investigation and surveillance, citizen protection, and property protection may cause the integrity
impact of enforcement-related information to be moderate. Particularly during fire season, the
integrity of land management information critical to fire-fighting operations can affect the safety
of human life and large-scale property damage. Such information can have a high integrity
impact level.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
most conservation, marine, and land management information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to conservation, marine, and land
management information. Typically, missions supported by conservation, marine, and land
management information are tolerant of delay.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Conservation, marine, and land
management include enforcement functions (e.g., the policing of marine fisheries). Availability
impacts associated with criminal apprehension, criminal investigation and surveillance, citizen
protection, and property protection may cause the availability impact of enforcement-related
