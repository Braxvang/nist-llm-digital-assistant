            As of August 22, 2011, the majority of users had been successfully migrated to the
            replacement system. While the LA police department remained on the legacy system
            because of security concerns, expectations were that all outstanding issues would be
            resolved by the first quarter of 2012 and that the department would complete its migration
            [Cra11]. That timeline would give the City about eight months to decide whether to
            continue the service into the first option year of the contract (i.e., the fourth year), or to
            seek an alternative solution.

            On December 14, 2011, the Los Angeles City Council voted to scale back the SECS
            contract, concluding that the security needs of crucial departments were not able to be
            met by the cloud provider [CLA11a, CLA11b, Gou11, Sar11b]. The police department,
            fire department, and city attorney's office are among the departments excepted. The
            cloud provider also agreed to pay the costs of the legacy system during the term of the
            contract and any extensions of the contract.


5.1       General Concerns
The terms of traditional information technology outsourcing contracts, particularly those
involving sensitive data, can serve as guidelines for cloud computing initiatives. Three main
security and privacy issues in service contracts have been identified previously and are relevant
to outsourcing public cloud computing services [All88, Len03]:

          Inadequate Policies and Practices. The security policies and practices of the cloud
           provider might not be adequate or compatible with those of the organization. The same
           issue applies to privacy as well. This can result in complications such as the following
           [All88]:

                 Undetected intrusions or violations due to insufficient auditing and monitoring
                  policies by the cloud provider
                 Lack of sufficient data and configuration integrity due to a mismatch between
                  the organization’s and the cloud provider’s policies for separation of duty (i.e.,
                  clear assignment of roles and responsibilities) or redundancy (i.e., having
                  sufficient checks and balances to ensure an operation is done consistently and
                  correctly)
                 Loss of privacy due to the cloud provider handling sensitive information less
                  rigorously than the organization’s policy dictates.

          Weak Confidentiality and Integrity Sureties. Insufficient security controls in the cloud
           provider’s platform could affect negatively the confidentiality and privacy, or integrity of
           the system. For example, use of an insecure method of remote access could allow
           intruders to gain unauthorized access, modify, or destroy the organization’s information
           systems and resources; to deliberately introduce security vulnerabilities or malware into
           the system; or to launch attacks on other systems from the organization’s network,
           perhaps making the organization liable for the damages incurred [All88].

          Weak Availability Sureties. Insufficient safeguards in the cloud provider’s platform
           could negatively affect the availability of the system. Besides the applications directly
           affected, a loss of system availability may cause a conflict for key resources that are
