Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for water resource management information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of water resource management
information depends on whether the information is time-critical. Unauthorized modification or
destruction of information affecting external communications associated with water resource
management information (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect operations
and/or public confidence in the agency, but the damage to the mission would usually be limited.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
most water resource management information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to water resource management
information. Generally, missions supported by water resource management information are
tolerant of delay.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
water resource management information is low.

D.6.2 Conservation, Marine and Land Management Information Type

Conservation, Marine and Land Management involves the responsibilities of surveying,
maintaining, and operating public lands and monuments, as well as activities devoted to ensuring
the preservation of land, water, wildlife, and natural resources, both domestically and
internationally. It also includes the sustainable stewardship of natural resources on federally
owned/controlled lands for commercial use (mineral mining, grazing, forestry, fishing, etc.). The
recommended provisional categorization of the conservation, marine, and land management
information type follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of conservation, marine,
and land management information on the ability of responsible agencies to survey, maintain, and
operate public lands and monuments, as well as to ensure the preservation of land, water,
wildlife, and natural resources, both domestically and internationally. The consequences of
unauthorized disclosure of most conservation, marine, and land management information would
have a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.
