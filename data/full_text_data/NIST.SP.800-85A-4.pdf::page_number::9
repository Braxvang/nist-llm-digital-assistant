NIST SP 800-85A-4                                            PIV CARD APPLICATION & MIDDLEWARE
                                                                      INTERFACE TEST GUIDELINES

   +   PIV Data Objects Representation (Section 4, Part 1 of SP 800-73-4) and Data Types
       and Their Representation (Section 5, Part 1 of SP 800-73-4).
   +   PIV Card Application Card Command Interface (Part 2 of SP 800-73-4).
   +   PIV Client Application Programming Interface (Part 3 of SP 800-73-4).
The functions specified in the Client API are to be supported by PIV Middleware. The
commands specified in the PIV Card Application Card Command Interface are to be
supported by PIV Card Applications, with appropriate security conditions for executing each
command and for accessing/storing each of the data objects associated with the application.
The overall design of the commands has to be based on the concepts outlined in NIST SP
800-73-4 Part 2, Section 2 - Concepts and Constructs. The presence of mandatory data
objects on the PIV Card has to be verified. The data objects associated with PIV Card
Application have to be tested for their accessibility and storage using the specified identifiers.
Thus, the three classes of specifications listed above span the following two main PIV
components: PIV Middleware and PIV Card Application. Hence the test suite provided in
this document consists of the following two broad categories of tests:
   +   PIV Middleware tests.
   +   PIV Card Application tests.
The above tests are developed through the following two-step process:
   +   Derived Test Requirements (DTR). These are constructed from the ‘shall’
       statements in SP 800-73-4 specifications.
   +   Test Assertions. These provide the tests that need to be performed to test each of the
       requirements under DTRs as well as tests with appropriate execution conditions for
       each of the commands in the interface to realize the associated return/response status
       codes specified in SP 800-73-4 Part 2.
This document does not provide conformance tests for any other software used in the PIV
system such as the back-end access control software, card issuance software, card
reader/biometric reader drivers, and specialized service provider software such as
cryptographic service provider modules and biometric service provider modules. This
document does not address nor provide conformance tests for SP 800-76-2.
1.3 Target Audience

This document is intended to:
   +   Enable developers of PIV Middleware and PIV Card Applications to develop their
       software modules to be testable for interface requirements specified in SP 800-73-4.
   +   Enable developers of PIV Middleware and PIV Card Applications to develop self-
       tests as part of the development effort.
   +   Enable testing laboratories authorized to perform conformance tests on PIV
       Middleware and PIV Card Applications to develop tests that cover the test suite
       provided in this document.
