                                                              NETWORK (NPSBN)
completed the fourth phase of a multi-year research project   CYBERSECURITY
through a NIST grant awarded in 2013. Previous phases of
the project resulted in the development of a Cyber Risk
Portal where users can conduct ICT supply-chain risk self-
assessments and gain access to a number of resources. This
phase of the project deployed wide-scale testing of the
portal and made improvements to the security infrastructure
and applications.
    NIST awarded the University of Maryland Supply Chain
Management Center an additional grant in 2014 to define an
effective engagement model that will enable representatives
of stakeholder organizations to come together in person
and online to learn how to map and manage their critical
ICT supply-chain risks using the portal-based tool set. The
project will be completed in April 2015.
