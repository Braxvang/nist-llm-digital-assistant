No OT Discussion for this control.
Control Enhancement: (1) No OT Discussion for this control.
Control Enhancement: (3) OT Discussion: The organization may need access to nonlocal
maintenance and diagnostic services in order to restore essential OT operations or services.
Example compensating controls include limiting the extent of the maintenance and diagnostic
services to the minimum essential activities and carefully monitoring and auditing the nonlocal
maintenance and diagnostic activities.
Rationale for adding MA-4 (1) to MOD and HIGH baselines: OT environments are often heavily
dependent on nonlocal maintenance providers, so organizations should have the ability to review
logs about relevant maintenance activities.
