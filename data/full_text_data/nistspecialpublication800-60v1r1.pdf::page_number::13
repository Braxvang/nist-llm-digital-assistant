Therefore, the value of information security categorization is to enable agencies to proactively
implement appropriate information security controls based on the assessed potential impact to
information confidentiality, integrity, and availability and in turn to support their mission in a
cost-effective manner. An incorrect information system impact analysis (i.e., incorrect FIPS 199
security categorization) can result in the agency either over protecting the information system
thus wasting valuable security resources, or under protecting the information system and placing
important operations and assets at risk. The aggregation of such mistakes at the enterprise level
can further compound the problem.
In contrast, conducting FIPS 199 impact analyses as an agency-wide exercise with the
participation of key officials (e.g., Chief Information Officer [CIO], Senior Agency Information
Security Officer [SAISO], Authorizing Officials, Mission/System Owners) at multiple levels can
enable the agency to leverage economies of scale through the effective management and
implementation of security controls at the enterprise level. A resulting value of consistently
implementing this systematic process for determining the security categorization and the
application of appropriate security protection is an improved overall understanding of the
agency’s mission, business processes, and information and system ownership.


                                        Implementation Tip
           To enable an appropriate level of mission support and the diligent
           implementation of current and future information security requirements,
           each agency should establish a formal process to validate system level
           security categorizations in terms of agency priorities. This will not only
           promote comparable evaluation of systems, but also yield added benefits to
           include leveraging common security controls and establishing defense-in-
           depth.

2.3 Role in the System Development Lifecycle
An initial security categorization should occur early in the agency’s system development
lifecycle (SDLC). The resulting security categorization would feed into security requirements
identification (later to evolve into security controls) and other related activities such as privacy
impact analysis or critical infrastructure analysis. Ultimately, the identified security requirements
and selected security controls are introduced to the standard systems engineering process to
effectively integrate the security controls with the information systems functional and
operational requirements, as well as other pertinent system requirements (e.g., reliability,
maintainability, supportability).

2.4 Role in the Certification and Accreditation Process
Security categorization establishes the foundation of the certification and accreditation (C&A)
activity by determining the levels of rigor required for certification and overall assurance testing
of security controls, as well as additional activities that may be needed (i.e., privacy and critical
infrastructure protection (CIP)). Thus, it assists in determining C&A level of effort and
associated activity duration.
