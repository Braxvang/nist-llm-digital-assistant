 Fault Tree Analysis                  A top-down, deductive failure analysis in which an
                                      undesired state of a system (top event) is analyzed using
                                      Boolean logic to combine a series of lower-level events.
                                      An analytical approach whereby an undesired state of a
                                      system is specified and the system is then analyzed in the
                                      context of its environment of operation to find all realistic
                                      ways in which the undesired event (top event) can occur.
 Federal Agency                       See Executive Agency.
 Federal Information                  An information system used or operated by an executive
 System                               agency, by a contractor of an executive agency, or by
 [40 U.S.C., Sec. 11331]              another organization on behalf of an executive agency.
 Hybrid Security Control              A security control that is implemented in an information
 [NIST SP 800-53]                     system in part as a common control and in part as a
                                      system-specific control. See Common Control and
                                      System-Specific Security Control.
 Impact Level                         The magnitude of harm that can be expected to result
 [CNSSI No. 4009]                     from the consequences of unauthorized disclosure of
                                      information, unauthorized modification of information,
                                      unauthorized destruction of information, or loss of
                                      information or information system availability.
 Impact Value                         The assessed potential impact resulting from a
 [CNSSI No. 1253]                     compromise of the confidentiality, integrity, or
                                      availability of an information type, expressed as a value
                                      of low, moderate, or high.

 Industrial Control System            An information system used to control industrial
 [NIST SP 800-39]                     processes such as manufacturing, product handling,
                                      production, and distribution. Industrial control systems
                                      include supervisory control and data acquisition systems
                                      used to control geographically dispersed assets, as well as
                                      distributed control systems and smaller control systems
                                      using programmable logic controllers to control localized
                                      processes.
 Information                          Any communication or representation of knowledge such
 [CNSSI No. 4009]                     as facts, data, or opinions in any medium or form,
                                      including textual, numerical, graphic, cartographic,
                                      narrative, or audiovisual.
 [FIPS 199]                           An instance of an information type.
 Information Owner                    Official with statutory or operational authority for
 [CNSSI No. 4009]                     specified information and responsibility for establishing
                                      the controls for its generation, classification, collection,
                                      processing, dissemination, and disposal. See Information
                                      Steward.
 Information Resources                Information and related resources, such as personnel,
