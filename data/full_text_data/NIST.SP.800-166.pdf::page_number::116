NIST SP 800-166                                                   DERIVED PIV APPLICATION AND
                                                                  DATA MODEL TEST GUIDELINES

9.3.1.10 cRLDistributionPoints Extension

 Test Assertion           TA-09.03.01.10
 Purpose                  Verifies that the cRLDistributionPoints extension in the Derived
                          PIV Authentication certificate contains an HTTP URI.
 DTR(s)                   • DTR-07.03.01.10
 Issuer Documentation     None.

 Precondition(s)          •   A token with the Derived PIV Application is inserted into an
                              appropriate token reader.
                          •   Suitable drivers have been loaded between the test system and
                              an instance of the reader.
                          •   A Derived PIV Authentication certificate is present within the
                              Derived PIV Application.
 Test Scenario            1. Send the SELECT command with
                                • AID == 'A0 00 00 03 08 00 00 20 00 01 00'
                          2. Send the GET DATA command with
                                • Data field of the command containing the tag
                                   ('5FC105') of the X.509 Certificate for
                                   Derived PIV Authentication data object
                          3. Extract the cRLDistributionPoints extension from
                             the certificate.
 Expected Result(s)       1. From Step 1, the command returns the application property
                             template with the status word '90 00'.
                          2. From Step 2, the command returns the requested data object
                             along with the status word '90 00'.
                          3. From Step 3, a URI with the “HTTP” scheme that can be used
                             to access CRL information is present.

9.3.1.11 RSA Exponent

 Test Assertion           TA-09.03.01.11
 Purpose                  Verifies that for RSA keys, the exponent of the asymmetric key for
                          Derived PIV Authentication is equal to 65 537.

 Precondition(s)          •   A token with the Derived PIV Application is inserted into an
                              appropriate token reader.
                          •   Suitable drivers have been loaded between the test system and
                              an instance of the reader.
                          •   A Derived PIV Authentication certificate is present within the
                              Derived PIV Application.
 Test Scenario            1. Send the SELECT command with
