Monitoring Changes
In addition to compliance monitoring and effectiveness monitoring, organizations monitor changes to organizational
information systems and the environments in which those systems operate. Monitoring changes to information systems
and environments of operation is not linked directly to previous risk response measures but it is nonetheless important
to detect changes that may affect the risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and
the Nation. Generally, such monitoring detects changes in conditions that may undermine risk assumptions (articulated
in the risk framing step).
•    Information System: Changes can occur in organizational information systems (including hardware, software, and
     firmware) that can introduce new risk or change existing risk. For example, updates to operating system software
     can eliminate security capabilities that existed in earlier versions, thus introducing new vulnerabilities into
     organizational information systems. Another example is the discovery of new system vulnerabilities that fall
     outside of the scope of the tools and processes available to address such vulnerabilities (e.g., vulnerabilities for
     which there are no established mitigations).
•    Environments of Operation: The environments in which information systems operate can also change in ways that
     introduce new risk or change existing risk. Environmental and operational considerations include, but are not
     limited to, missions/business functions, threats, vulnerabilities, mission/business processes, facilities, policies,
     legislation, and technologies. For example, new legislation or regulations could be passed that impose additional
     requirements on organizations. This change might affect the risk assumptions established by organizations.
     Another example is a change in the threat environment that reports new tactics, techniques, procedures, or
     increases in the technical capabilities of adversaries. Organizations might experience reductions in available
     resources (e.g., personnel or funding), which in turn results in changing priorities. Organizations might also
     experience changes in the ownership of third-party suppliers which could affect supply chain risk. Mission
     changes may require that organizations revisit underlying risk assumptions. For example, an organization whose
     mission is to collect threat information on possible domestic terrorist attacks and share such information with
     appropriate federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies may have its scope changed so that the organization
     is responsible for also sharing some of the information with local first responders. Such a change could affect
     assumptions regarding the security resources such users may have at their disposal. Changes in technology may
     also affect the underlying risk assumptions established by organizations. Unlike other types of change, technology
     changes may be totally independent of organizations, but still affect the risk organizations must address. For
     example, improvements in computing power may undermine assumptions regarding what constitutes sufficiently
     strong means of authentication (e.g., number of authentication factors) or cryptographic mechanism.
Automated Versus Manual Monitoring
Broadly speaking, organizations can conduct monitoring either by automated or manual methods. Where automated
monitoring is feasible, it should be employed because it is generally faster, more efficient, and more cost-effective than
manual monitoring. Automated monitoring is also less prone to human error. However, not all monitoring can take
advantage of automation. Monitoring conducted at Tier 3 generally lends itself to automation where activities being
monitored are information technology-based. Such activities can usually be detected, tracked, and monitored through
the installation of appropriate software, hardware and/or firmware. To ensure that automated processes, procedures,
and/or mechanisms supporting monitoring activities are providing the information needed, such processes, procedures,
and mechanisms should be appropriately validated, updated and monitored. Compliance monitoring can be supported
by automation when the risk mitigation measures being validated are information technology-based (e.g., installation of
firewalls or testing of configuration settings on desktop computers). Such automated validation can often check
whether risk mitigation measures are installed and whether the installations are correct. Similarly, effectiveness
monitoring may also be supported by automation. If the threshold conditions for determining the effectiveness of risk
response measures are predetermined, then automation can support such effectiveness monitoring. While automation
can be a supporting capability for Tiers 1 and 2, generally automation does not provide substantive insight for non-
information technology-based activities which are more prevalent at those higher tiers. Activities that are not as likely
to benefit from automation include, for example, the use of multiple suppliers within the supply chain, evolving
environments of operation, or evaluating the promise of emerging technical capabilities in support of missions/business
functions. Where automated monitoring is not available, organizations employ manual monitoring and/or analysis.
Frequency of Monitoring
The frequency of risk monitoring (whether automated or manual) is driven by organizational missions/business
functions and the ability of organizations to use the monitoring results to facilitate greater situational awareness. An
increased level of situational awareness of the security state of organizational information systems and environments of
operation helps organizations develop a better understanding of risk. Monitoring frequency is also driven by other
factors, for example: (i) the anticipated frequency of changes in organizational information systems and operating
environments; (ii) the potential impact of risk if not properly addressed through appropriate response measures; and
(iii) the degree to which the threat space is changing. The frequency of monitoring can also be affected by the type of
monitoring conducted (i.e., automated versus procedural approaches). Depending on the frequency of monitoring
