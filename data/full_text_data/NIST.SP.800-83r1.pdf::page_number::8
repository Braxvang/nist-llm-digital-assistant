                                 GUIDE TO MALWARE INCIDENT PREVENTION AND HANDLING FOR DESKTOPS AND LAPTOPS


Executive Summary

Malware, also known as malicious code, refers to a program that is covertly inserted into another program
with the intent to destroy data, run destructive or intrusive programs, or otherwise compromise the
confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the victim’s data, applications, or operating system. Malware is
the most common external threat to most hosts, causing widespread damage and disruption and
necessitating extensive recovery efforts within most organizations. Organizations also face similar threats
from a few forms of non-malware threats that are often associated with malware. One of these forms that
has become commonplace is phishing, which is using deceptive computer-based means to trick
individuals into disclosing sensitive information.

This publication provides recommendations for improving an organization’s malware incident prevention
measures. It also gives extensive recommendations for enhancing an organization’s existing incident
response capability so that it is better prepared to handle malware incidents, particularly widespread ones.
This revision of the publication, Revision 1, updates material throughout the publication to reflect the
changes in threats and incidents. Unlike most malware threats several years ago, which tended to be fast-
spreading and easy to notice, many of today’s malware threats are more stealthy, specifically designed to
quietly, slowly spread to other hosts, gathering information over extended periods of time and eventually
leading to exfiltration of sensitive data and other negative impacts.

Implementing the following recommendations should facilitate more efficient and effective malware
incident response activities for Federal departments and agencies.

Organizations should develop and implement an approach to malware incident prevention.

Organizations should plan and implement an approach to malware incident prevention based on the attack
vectors that are most likely to be used currently and in the near future. Because the effectiveness of
prevention techniques may vary depending on the environment (i.e., a technique that works well in a
managed environment might be ineffective in a non-managed environment), organizations should choose
preventive methods that are well-suited to their environment and hosts. An organization’s approach to
malware incident prevention should incorporate policy considerations, awareness programs for users and
information technology (IT) staff, vulnerability and threat mitigation efforts, and defensive architecture
considerations.

Organizations should ensure that their policies address prevention of malware incidents.

An organization’s policy statements should be used as the basis for additional malware prevention efforts,
such as user and IT staff awareness, vulnerability mitigation, threat mitigation, and defensive architecture.
If an organization does not state malware prevention considerations clearly in its policies, it is unlikely to
perform malware prevention activities consistently and effectively throughout the organization. Malware
prevention–related policy should be as general as possible to provide flexibility in policy implementation
and to reduce the need for frequent policy updates, but should also be specific enough to make the intent
and scope of the policy clear. Malware prevention–related policy should include provisions related to
remote workers—both those using hosts controlled by the organization and those using hosts outside of
the organization’s control (e.g., contractor computers, employees’ home computers, business partners’
computers, mobile devices).
