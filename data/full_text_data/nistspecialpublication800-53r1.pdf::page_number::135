SC-13     USE OF CRYPTOGRAPHY

          Control: For information requiring cryptographic protection, the information system implements
          cryptographic mechanisms that comply with applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives,
          policies, regulations, standards, and guidance.
          Supplemental Guidance:    The applicable federal standard for employing cryptography in nonnational
          security information systems is FIPS 140-2 (as amended). Validation certificates issued by the
          NIST Cryptographic Module Validation Program (including FIPS 140-1, FIPS 140-2, and future
          amendments) remain in effect and the modules remain available for continued use and purchase
          until a validation certificate is specifically revoked. NIST Special Publications 800-56 and 800-57
          provide guidance on cryptographic key establishment and cryptographic key management.
          Additional information on the use of validated cryptography is available at
          http://csrc.nist.gov/cryptval.
          Control Enhancements: None.


           LOW SC-13                     MOD SC-13                HIGH SC-13



SC-14     PUBLIC ACCESS PROTECTIONS

          Control: The information system protects the integrity and availability of publicly available
          information and applications.
          Supplemental Guidance:    None.
          Control Enhancements: None.


           LOW SC-14                     MOD SC-14                HIGH SC-14



SC-15     COLLABORATIVE COMPUTING

                 The information system prohibits remote activation of collaborative computing
          Control:
          mechanisms and provides an explicit indication of use to the local users.
          Supplemental Guidance: Collaborative computing mechanisms include, for example, video and
          audio conferencing capabilities. Explicit indication of use includes, for example, signals to local
          users when cameras and/or microphones are activated.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The information system provides physical disconnect of camera and microphone in a manner that
                supports ease of use.


           LOW Not Selected              MOD SC-15                HIGH SC-15
