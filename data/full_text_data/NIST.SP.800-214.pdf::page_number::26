NIST works with industry to develop the measurement science and standards necessary to
ensure the robustness, scalability, and security of important infrastructures, including mobile
telecommunications networks and the global Internet. Research focuses on the measurement
and modeling techniques necessary to understand, predict, and control the behavior of Internet-
scale networked information systems. NIST staff use these insights to guide the design, analysis,
and standardization of new technologies aimed at improving the robustness and reliability of
the global communication infrastructure. Much of the research and industry collaboration occurs
at NIST’s National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE).

NIST’s Trustworthy Networks Program works with industry to resolve systemic vulnerabilities
in existing and emerging critical network infrastructures and to advance the development of
potentially disruptive technologies to improve the trustworthiness of future networks. NIST
collaborates directly with leading industry research (Internet Research Task Force), standards
(Internet Engineering Task Force), and network operations (North American Network Operators
Group) groups to promulgate NIST contributions and foster the design, standardization, and
commercial deployment of trustworthy communication infrastructures.

Major research areas and selected recent contributions within this program included:

• The Robust Interdomain Routing Project that works with Internet industry partners to improve
  the security and resilience of the Internet's global routing infrastructure. NIST SP 800-
  189, Resilient Interdomain Traffic Exchange: BGP Security and DDoS Mitigation, includes
  guidance on securing interdomain routing control traffic, preventing IP address spoofing,
