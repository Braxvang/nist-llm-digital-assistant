NIST SP 800-90A Rev. 1                                               Recommendation for Random Number
                                                                      Generation Using Deterministic RBGs


8. DRBG Mechanism Concepts and General Requirements

8.1 DRBG Mechanism Functions

A DRBG mechanism requires instantiate, uninstantiate, generate, and health testing functions. A
DRBG mechanism includes an optional reseed function. A DRBG shall be instantiated prior to
the generation of output by the DRBG. These functions are specified in Section 9.

8.2 DRBG Instantiations

A DRBG may be used to obtain
pseudorandom bits for different purposes
(e.g., DSA private keys and AES keys)
and may be separately instantiated for
each purpose, thus effectively creating
two DRBGs.
A DRBG is instantiated using a seed and
may be reseeded; when reseeded, the seed
shall be different than the seed used for
instantiation. Each seed defines a seed
period for the DRBG instantiation; an
instantiation consists of one or more seed
periods that begin when a new seed is                  Figure 2: DRBG Instantiation
acquired and end when the next seed is
obtained or the DRBG is no longer used (see Figure 2).

8.3 Internal States

During instantiation, an initial internal state is derived from the seed. The internal state for an
instantiation includes:
   1. The working state:
       a. One or more values that are derived from the seed and become part of the internal
          state; these values shall remain secret, and
       b. A count of the number of requests produced since the instantiation was seeded or
          reseeded.
   2. Administrative information (e.g., security strength and prediction resistance flag).
The internal state shall be protected at least as well as the intended use of the pseudorandom
output bits requested by the consuming application. A DRBG mechanism implementation may
be designed to handle multiple instantiations. Each DRBG instantiation shall have its own
internal state. The internal state for one DRBG instantiation shall not be used as the internal
state for a different instantiation.
