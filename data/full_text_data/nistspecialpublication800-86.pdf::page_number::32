GUIDE TO INTEGRATING FORENSIC TECHNIQUES INTO INCIDENT RESPONSE



        Analysts should be prepared to use alternate data sources if it is not feasible to collect data from a
        primary source.
    ! Organizations should be proactive in collecting useful data. Configuring auditing on OSs,
      implementing centralized logging, performing regular system backups, and using security
      monitoring controls can all generate sources of data for future forensic efforts.
    ! Analysts should perform data collection using a standard process. The recommended steps
      in this process are identifying sources of data, developing a plan to acquire the data, acquiring the
      data, and verifying the integrity of the data. The plan should prioritize the data sources,
      establishing the order in which the data should be acquired based on the likely value of the data,
      the volatility of the data, and the amount of effort required. Before data collection begins, a
      decision should be made by the analyst or management regarding the need to collect and preserve
      evidence in a manner that supports its use in future legal or internal disciplinary proceedings. In
      such situations, a clearly defined chain of custody should be followed to avoid allegations of
      mishandling or tampering of evidence. If it is unclear whether or not evidence needs to be
      preserved, by default it generally should be preserved.
    ! Analysts should use a methodical approach to studying the data. The foundation of forensics
      is using a methodical approach in analyzing the available data so that analysts can either draw
      appropriate conclusions based on the available data or determine that no conclusion can yet be
      drawn. If evidence might be needed for legal or internal disciplinary actions, analysts should
      carefully document the findings and all steps taken.
    ! Analysts should review their processes and practices. Reviews of current and recent forensic
      actions can help identify policy shortcomings, procedural errors, and other issues that might need
      to be remedied, as well as ensuring that the organization stays current with trends in technology
      and changes in law.
