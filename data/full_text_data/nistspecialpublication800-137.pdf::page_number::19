requirements. Sampling of information system security objects, rather than 100 percent
inspection, can also be an efficient and effective means of monitoring, particularly in cases where
monitoring is not automated. Important considerations in determining sample sizes and
monitoring frequencies are discussed in Chapter Three.

Monitoring frequencies (e.g., annually, quarterly, monthly, daily) are not static, and they are not
uniform across all metrics. Security control assessment and monitoring frequencies, for example,
are adjusted to support changes in organizational information systems or their environments of
operation, including emerging information on security threats and vulnerabilities. The priorities
for ISCM vary and are adjusted in response to security incidents, to identify problems with
security control implementations, or to evaluate changes to systems and system components that
are determined to have a significant impact on security. An ISCM strategy can deliver dynamic
updates of security-related data to support system authorizations conducted at any interval.
Section 3.2.2 includes a more complete discussion of factors to consider when determining
monitoring frequencies.

2.3    ROLE OF AUTOMATION IN IS CM
When possible, organizations look for automated solutions to lower costs, enhance efficiency,
and improve the reliability of monitoring security-related information. Security is implemented
through a combination of people, processes, and technology. The automation of information
security deals primarily with automating aspects of security that require little human interaction.
Automated tools are often able to recognize patterns and relationships that may escape the notice
of human analysts, especially when the analysis is performed on large volumes of data. This
includes items such as verifying technical settings on individual network endpoints or ensuring
that the software on a machine is up to date with organizational policy. Automation serves to
augment the security processes conducted by security professionals within an organization and
may reduce the amount of time a security professional must spend on doing redundant tasks,
thereby increasing the amount of time the trained professional may spend on tasks requiring
human cognition.

The ISCM strategy does not focus solely on the security-related information that is easy for an
organization to collect or easy to automate. When an ISCM program is first implemented, there
will likely be several aspects of the organization’s security program that are manually monitored.
Organizations’ monitoring capabilities will expand and mature over time. Metrics will evolve
with lessons learned and with increased insight into organizational security status and risk
tolerance. The focus of an ISCM strategy is to provide adequate information about security
control effectiveness and organizational security status allowing organizational officials to make
informed, timely security risk management decisions. Thus, implementation, effectiveness, and
adequacy of all security controls are monitored along with organizational security status.

When determining the extent to which the organization automates ISCM, organizations consider
potential efficiencies of process standardization that may be gained with automation, and the
potential value (or lack of value) of the automated security-related information from a risk
management perspective. Additionally, organizations consider intangibles such as the potential
value of personnel reassignment and more comprehensive situational awareness.
