responsibilities regarding collection, dissemination or disclosure of information regarding
individuals. 19
The September 26, 2003 OMB Memorandum M-03-22, “OMB Guidance for Implementing the
Privacy Provisions of the E-Government Act of 2002,” puts the privacy provisions of the E-
Government Act of 2002 into effect. The guidance applies to information that identifies
individuals in a recognizable form, including name, address, telephone number, Social Security
Number, and e-mail addresses. OMB instructed agency heads “to describe how the government
handles information that individuals provide electronically, so that the American public has
assurances that personal information is protected.” Under these public laws and executive
policies, it is necessary to broaden the definition of “unauthorized disclosure” to encompass any
access, use, disclosure, or sharing of privacy-protected information among Federal government
agencies when such actions are prohibited by privacy laws and policies. Since most privacy
regulations focus on access, use, disclosure, or sharing of information, privacy considerations are
dealt with in this guideline as special factors affecting the confidentiality impact level. In
establishing confidentiality impact levels for each information type, responsible parties must
consider the consequences of unauthorized disclosure of privacy information (with respect to
violations of Federal policy and/or law).
Agencies are required to conduct Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) before developing IT
systems that contain personally identifiable information or before collecting personally
identifiable information electronically. The impact of privacy violations should consider any
adverse effects experienced by individuals or organizations as a result of the loss of PII
confidentiality. Examples of adverse effects experienced by individuals may include blackmail,
identity theft, discrimination, or emotional distress. Examples of adverse effects experienced by
organizations may include administrative burden, financial losses, loss of public reputation and
confidence, and the penalties associated with violation of the relevant statutes and policies.
Categorizations should be reviewed to ensure that the adverse effects of a loss of PII
confidentiality have been adequately factored into impact determinations. The confidentiality
impact level should generally fall into the moderate range.

Trade Secrets

There are several laws that specifically prohibit unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets (e.g., 7
U.S.C., Chapter 6, Subchapter II, Section 136h and 42 U.S.C., Chapter 6A, Subchapter XII, Part
E, Section 300j-4(d)(1)). Systems that store, communicate, or process trade secrets will
generally be assigned at least a moderate confidentiality impact level.

4.4.3   Overall Information System Impact

Since the impact values (i.e., levels) for confidentiality, integrity, and availability may not
always be the same for a particular information system, the high water mark concept 20 is used to

  The OMB definition of an individual is, “a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully admitted for
permanent residence.” Agencies may choose to extend the protections of the Privacy Act and E-Government
Act to businesses, sole proprietors, aliens, etc.
