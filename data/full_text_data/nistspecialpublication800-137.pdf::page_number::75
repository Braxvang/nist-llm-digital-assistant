security control compliance activities, and security measurement. Goals for the development of
SCAP include standardizing system security management, promoting interoperability of security
products, and fostering the use of standard expressions of security content. SCAP can be used for
maintaining the security of organizational systems, such as automatically verifying the
installation of patches, checking system security configuration settings, and examining systems
for signs of compromise.

What Can Be Automated With SCAP

There are many readily available tools that can be used to automate ISCM activities using SCAP.
The SCAP Product Validation Program51 is designed to test the ability of products to use the
features and functionality available through SCAP and its component standards.

The SCAP validation program validates two types of vulnerability and patch scanners:
authenticated and unauthenticated. Authenticated vulnerability and patch scanners provide the
capability to scan a target system using target system logon privileges, to locate and identify the
presence of known vulnerabilities, and evaluate the software patch status to determine the
ongoing security status of the system based on an organizationâ€™s defined patch policy.
Unauthenticated vulnerability scanners provide the capability to determine the presence of known
vulnerabilities by evaluating the target system over the network without authenticated access.
SCAP-enabled vulnerability scanners can be configured to scan connected systems at regular
intervals, thus providing a quantitative and repeatable measurement and scoring of software flaws
across systems. The use of SCAP-validated vulnerability scanners enables interoperability among
vulnerability scanners and reporting tools to provide consistent detection and reporting of these
flaws and supports comprehensive remediation capabilities.

While patching and vulnerability monitoring and remediation can often appear an overwhelming
task, consistent mitigation of system software vulnerabilities can be achieved through a tested and
integrated patching process. A mature patch and vulnerability management program that
embraces security automation technologies will help the organization to be more proactive than
reactive with regard to maintaining appropriate levels of security for their systems.

Vulnerability assessment and patch management technologies focus primarily on testing for the
presence of known vulnerabilities in common operating systems and applications. For custom
software and applications and in discovering unknown, unreported or unintentional vulnerabilities
in commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) products, vulnerability assessment and analysis may require
the use of additional, more specialized techniques and approaches, such as Web-based application
scanners, source code reviews, and source code analyzers. These tools, coupled with security
control assessment methodologies such as red team exercises and penetration testing, provide
additional means for vulnerability identification.

The SCAP Validation Program evaluates the capabilities of configuration scanners that can audit
and assess a target system to determine its compliance with a defined secure baseline
configuration. Examples of secure baseline configurations include the Federal Desktop Core
