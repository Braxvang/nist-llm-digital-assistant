                                                 GUIDE TO INTRUSION DETECTION AND PREVENTION SYSTEMS (IDPS)



Administrators should test software and signature updates before applying them except for emergency
situations (e.g., a signature identifies a new, active threat that is damaging the organization and cannot
otherwise be detected or blocked). It is beneficial to have at least one sensor or agent host (one for each
type of agent) that is used strictly for testing updates. New detection capabilities can often cause large
numbers of alerts to be triggered, so testing signature updates on a single sensor or agent host, even
briefly (e.g., loading the update and observing how the IDPS functions when monitoring typical activity),
can help to identify signatures that are likely to be problematic and should possibly be disabled. In non-
emergency situations, software and signature updates should be tested and deployed using the same
practices that would be used for updating any other major security controls, such as firewalls and
antivirus software. When updates are deployed into production, administrators should be ready to disable
particular signatures or perform other minor reconfigurations as needed.

3.3.3   Building and Maintaining Skills

Various skills are needed for IDPS implementation, operation, and maintenance, including the following:

 The administrators implementing IDPS components need to understand the basics of system
  administration, network administration, and information security.
 The administrators tuning and customizing the IDPS need reasonably comprehensive knowledge of
  information security and IDPS principles. An understanding of incident response principles and the
  organization’s incident response policies and procedures is also recommended. Administrators
  should also have an understanding of the network protocols, applications, and operating systems to be
  monitored by the IDPS.
 Programming skills might also be needed for extensive code customization, report writing, and other
  tasks.
Skills in IDPS principles can be built and maintained through many methods, including training, technical
conferences, books and other technical references, and mentoring programs. Knowledge of specific IDPS
products can also be gained through several methods, including the following:

 Vendor Training. Many vendors of IDPS products offer one or more training courses for people
  that will be administering or using their products. Training courses are often hands-on, permitting
  attendees to learn how to use the technology in a non-production environment.
 Product Documentation. Most products offer several manuals, such as an installation guide, a
  user’s guide, and an administrator’s guide. Some also offer separate guides or databases that provide
  supplemental information for alerts and signatures.
 Technical Support. Most vendors offer technical support for their customers, either as part of
  purchasing a product or for an additional fee. Support is used primarily to resolve problems and
  clarify the capabilities of the product to its users and administrators.
 Professional Services. Some vendors offer professional services, which is essentially consulting
  services provided by the vendor. For example, an organization could pay a vendor to write custom
  signatures or reports, or to assist administrators in understanding how to tune and customize their
  sensors effectively.
 User Communities. Some products have active user communities, which typically function through
  mailing lists or online forums. Users can exchange information and code with each other, and assist
  each other in troubleshooting problems. Although user communities can be a source of information,
  administrators and users should be cautious when using them, because posting details about an
