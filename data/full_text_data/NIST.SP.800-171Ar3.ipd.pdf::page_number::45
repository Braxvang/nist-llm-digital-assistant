1337           Determine if:
1338           A.03.04.08.a: software programs authorized to execute on the system are identified.
1339           A.03.04.08.b: a deny-all, allow-by-exception policy for the execution of software programs on the
1340           system is implemented.
1341           A.03.04.08.c[01]: the list of authorized software programs is reviewed periodically.
1342           A.03.04.08.c[02]: the list of authorized software programs is updated periodically.
