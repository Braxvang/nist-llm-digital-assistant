                                                                                               conform to the organization’s app security requirements, the app is typically accepted for
                                                                                               deployment on the organization’s devices. An overview of the app vetting process is shown in

                                                                                               Although app vetting processes may vary among organizations, each instance of the process
                                                                                               should be repeatable, efficient and consistent. The process should also limit errors to the extent
                                                                                               possible (e.g., false-positive results). Typically, an app vetting process is performed manually or
                                                                                               by an app vetting system that manages and automates all or part of the app vetting activities [16].
                                                                                               As part of an app vetting system, one or more test tools may be used to analyze an app for the
                                                                                               existence of software vulnerabilities or malicious behavior consistent with malware.

                                                                                               As shown in Figure 1, organizations perform an app vetting process during the app acquisition
                                                                                               phase of a mobile application lifecycle; that is, when the app is received by the organization but
                                                                                               prior to the app’s deployment on the organization’s devices. The rationale for this approach
                                                                                               stems from the fact that while developers may perform their own software assurance processes
                                                                                               on an app, there is no guarantee the app will conform to an organization’s security requirements.
                                                                                               Furthermore, because testing of the app by the developer occurs outside the vetting process, an
                                                                                               organization must trust the work of these previously-performed assurance activities.
                                                                                               Organizations should not assume an app has been fully vetted or conforms to their security
                                                                                               requirements simply because it is available through an official app store.
