                                                                             GUIDE TO GENERAL SERVER SECURITY



Organizations often fail to consider the human resource requirements for both deployment and
operational phases of the server and supporting infrastructure. Organizations should address the
following points in a deployment plan:

 Types of personnel required (e.g., system and server administrators, network administrators,
  information systems security officers [ISSO])
 Skills and training required by assigned personnel
 Individual (i.e., level of effort required of specific personnel types) and collective staffing (i.e.,
  overall level of effort) requirements.

Organizations should implement appropriate security management practices and controls when
maintaining and operating a secure server.

Appropriate management practices are essential to operating and maintaining a secure server. Security
practices entail the identification of an organization’s information system assets and the development,
documentation, and implementation of policies, standards, procedures, and guidelines that help to ensure
the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information system resources. To ensure the security of a
server and the supporting network infrastructure, the following practices should be implemented:

 Organization-wide information system security policy
 Configuration/change control and management
 Risk assessment and management
 Standardized software configurations that satisfy the information system security policy
 Security awareness and training
 Contingency planning, continuity of operations, and disaster recovery planning
 Certification and accreditation.
Organizations should ensure that the server operating system is deployed, configured, and
managed to meet the security requirements of the organization.

The first step in securing a server is securing the underlying operating system. Most commonly available
servers operate on a general-purpose operating system. Many security issues can be avoided if the
operating systems underlying servers are configured appropriately. Default hardware and software
configurations are typically set by manufacturers to emphasize features, functions, and ease of use, at the
expense of security. Because manufacturers are not aware of each organization’s security needs, each
server administrator must configure new servers to reflect their organization’s security requirements and
reconfigure them as those requirements change. Using security configuration guides or checklists can
assist administrators in securing servers consistently and efficiently. Securing an operating system
initially would generally include the following steps:

 Patch and upgrade the operating system
 Remove or disable unnecessary services, applications, and network protocols
 Configure operating system user authentication
