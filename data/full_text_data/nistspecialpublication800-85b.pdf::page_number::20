TE05.01.06.01: The tester shall verify that the BDB Format Owner field contains 0x001B.

AS05.01.07: For the mandatory fingerprint template on the PIV card, the BDB Format
Type value shall be 0x0201. For the optional facial image on the PIV card, the BDB
Format Type value shall be 0x0501.
No requirements for vendor.
TE05.01.07.01: The tester shall verify that the BDB Format Type field is 0x0201 for fingerprint
template and 0x0501 for facial image.

AS05.01.08: The Creation Date in the PIV Patron Format (see Row 7 in Table 8 of SP80076)
shall be the date of acquisition of the parent sample, encoded in eight bytes using a binary
representation of "YYYYMMDDhhmmssZ". Each pair of characters (for example, "DD")
is coded in 8 bits as an unsigned integer where the last byte is the binary representation of
the ASCII character Z which is included to indicate that the time is represented in
Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The field "hh" shall code a 24 hour clock value.
No requirements for vendor.
TE05.01.08.01: The tester shall verify the date field is in compliance with the assertion.

contains two dates.
No requirements for vendor.
TE05.01.09.01: The tester shall verify that the headers contain two dates in compliance with the
assertion.

AS05.01.10: Biometric Type field within the PIV Patron Format shall be 0x000008 for
fingerprint template and shall be 0x000002 for facial images. The value for other biometric
modalities shall be that given in CBEFF, 5.2.1.5. For modalities not listed there the value
shall be 0x00.
No requirements for vendor.
TE05.01.10.01: The tester shall verify that the Biometric Type field contains 0x000008 for
fingerprint images or templates and 0x000002 for facial images.

AS05.01.11: For the mandatory fingerprint template on the PIV card, the CBEFF
Biometric Data Type encoding value shall be b100xxxxx, which corresponds to biometric
data that has been processed. For the optional facial image on the PIV card, the CBEFF
Biometric Data Type encoding value shall be b001xxxxx
No requirements for vendor.
TE05.01.11.01: The tester shall verify that the Biometric Data Type value is b100xxxxx for
processed fingerprint template and b001xxxxx for facial image.
