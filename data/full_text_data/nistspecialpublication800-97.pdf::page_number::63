                       Figure 5-8. Conceptual Example of Security Policy Negotiation



During the discovery phase, a STA may decline to communicate with an AP or another STA that fails to
disclose any of the following:

     Security policy in the Beacon or Probe Response frames
     Authorized SSID
     Authorized encryption and authentication cipher suites.
The IEEE 802.11 standard does not specify the manner in which these conditions are handled. This
remains undefined and is left as a design choice to the RSN technology manufacturer. Manufacturers
typically design their products so that these conditions are configurable via policy.

5.3.3   Distinguishing RSN and Pre-RSN WLANs

The outcome of the discovery phase is very important to the security posture of a WLAN. In an RSN,
APs do not allow associations from pre-RSN STAs—those STAs that do not support data confidentiality
and integrity mechanisms beyond WEP and that cannot create PMK security associations. For example,
an ESS might contain several IEEE 802.11 STAs and three APs. Suppose that all STAs within this ESS
use pre-shared keying (as opposed to the IEEE 802.1X technique) and the CCMP security method for
both unicast and broadcast traffic. These parameters are negotiated through the discovery phase’s
security parameter negotiation. Because the three APs have allowed only RSNAs with the seven STAs,
they provide an RSN.

In contrast, suppose that the STAs in the ESS do not all operate with CCMP; two are using pre-RSN
capabilities. These stations, forming a Transition Security Network, are using WEP and shared key
authentication. As a result, this WLAN is not an RSN, even though five of its STAs are operating with
CCMP. The two STAs using pre-RSN capabilities create significant security holes that can negatively
impact the security of the other components of the WLAN. Not only are the communications between the
STA and AP not protected strongly, but also the AP must be configured to permit the use of pre-RSN
capabilities. This could allow an attacker within range of the AP to establish unauthorized connections to
it, potentially gaining access to other resources.
