strength of the security mechanisms in the future [SP 800-57 Part 1]. In many cases, the
algorithms and key sizes required to provide adequate security are not available within
the current implementations or are unavailable uniformly across the community of users
that need to interoperate. Transitions to new algorithms or key sizes will not necessarily
occur instantaneously, but will require gradual upgrades across a system. For example, a
system owner may have the need to upgrade his system’s e-mail package before
upgrading the cryptographic module. Hence, for a period of time, the system may be
running with an e-mail package capable of TDEA and AES 128 encryption, but a
cryptographic module that can only handle TDEA. There will be a need to upgrade
components of a system with new capabilities, while continuing to support the old
capabilities, until all components have been upgraded.
During this transition period, interaction between components can proceed in one of the
following ways:
       1. Some means is provided to determine when the new security mechanism is
          available to all parties in a given transaction so that it can be used instead of the
          old security mechanism (e.g., using a protocol that negotiates the security
          mechanisms to be used). When the new security mechanism is not available to all
          parties involved in a transaction, the old security mechanism can be used. This
          approach has the advantage that when a set of parties have the newer mechanism,
          their transactions are protected at a higher security level. The disadvantage is that
          those transactions using the old security mechanism are not as well protected; this
          also raises the possibility that the same information could be sent in different
          transactions between two or more sets of parties using security mechanisms of
          different strengths – in effect, nullifying the higher security strength provided by
          the new security mechanism4.
       2. All components use the old security mechanism until all components have been
          updated; at that time, the system immediately transitions to the new capability.
          This approach has the potential problem that all components would not be
          updated by the deadline, thus providing inadequate protections for all information
          during the period following the deadline until such time as all components have
          been upgraded. However, this approach has the advantage that the same data will
          not be sent at two different security levels.5
Most of the applications and protocols discussed in Part 3 require an upgrade of the
available security mechanisms to be compliant with Part 1. The following sections
provide guidance on how the existing mechanisms may best be used until appropriate
upgrades can be made. Organizations and system administrators must determine the
approach for transitioning to stronger security mechanisms within a system.

 This becomes an issue when higher security-level users are unaware that others may be using a lower
security-level mechanism to protect the same information.

    Assuming that data sent before the transition is not also sent after the transition.
