                                         PRIVACY
   Privacy is integral to the trust that supports the growth of the digital economy and
    improves our quality of life. NIST has prioritized Privacy Engineering to support
   measurement science and system engineering principles through frameworks, risk
               models, and guidance that protect privacy and civil liberties.


Major Accomplishments in FY 2022:
• Numerous Privacy Framework resources were released, including Spanish and Portuguese
  translations of the Privacy Framework Quick Start Guide and a webinar on using regulatory
  crosswalks for Framework implementation.
• NIST’s differential privacy blog series was completed, and in-depth differential privacy
  guidelines are in development (a draft for public comment is anticipated in FY 2023).
• The NIST Privacy Workforce Public Working Group (PWWG) was launched, which now has
  800+ members from across the globe. Project teams are currently working on defining tasks,
  knowledge, and skills aligned with the Privacy Framework and the NICE Framework to
  support the growth of a workforce capable of managing privacy risks.​ Two of an anticipated
  ten PWWG project teams have completed their work, and three additional have launched.
• Co-sponsored by NIST, the U.S. partnered with the U.K.’s Center for Data Ethics and
  Innovation to launch a Privacy-Enhancing Technologies Prize Challenge to advance privacy-
  preserving federated learning.
• The Privacy Engineering Program continues to collaborate across NIST programs and
  priority areas. NIST also leads external efforts to advance privacy, including co-chairing
  Privacy Research & Development and Privacy-Preserving Data Sharing and Analytics
  Interagency Working Groups.
