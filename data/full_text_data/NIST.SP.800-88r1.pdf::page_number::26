mostly a business decision, system owners must understand early on that this decision affects the
types of resources needed for sanitization throughout the rest of the system life cycle.

An organization may ask a product vendor for assistance in identifying storage media that may
contain sensitive data. This information is typically documented in a ‘statement of volatility’.
The statement may be used to support decisions about which equipment to purchase, based on
the ease or difficulty of sanitization. While volatility statements are useful, caution should be
applied in comparing statements across vendors because vendors may state volatility details
differently.

Organizations should take care in identifying media for sanitization. Many items used will
contain multiple forms of media that may require different methods of sanitization. For example,
a desktop computer may contain a hard drive, motherboard, RAM, and ROM, and mobile
devices contain on-board volatile memory as well as nonvolatile removable memory.

The increasing availability of rapidly applicable techniques, such as Cryptographic Erase,
provides opportunities for organizations to reduce the risk of inadvertent disclosure by
combining sanitization technologies and techniques. For example, an organization could choose
to apply Cryptographic Erase at a user’s desktop before removing the media to send it to be
‘formally’ sanitized at the sanitization facility, in order to reduce risk and exposure.

 4.2 Determination of Security Categorization

Early in the system life cycle, a system is categorized using the guidance found in FIPS 199,
NIST SP 800-60 Rev. 1, or CNSSI 1253 18, including the security categorization for the system’s
confidentiality. This security categorization is revisited at least every three years (or when
significant change occurs within the system) and revalidated throughout the system’s life, and
any necessary changes to the confidentiality category can be made. Once the security
categorization is completed, the system owner can then design a sanitization process that will
ensure adequate protection of the system’s information.

Much information is not associated with a specific system but is associated with internal business
communications, usually on paper. Organizations should label these media with their internal
operating confidentiality levels and associate a type of sanitization described in this publication.

 4.3 Reuse of Media

A key decision on sanitization is whether the media are planned for reuse or recycle. Some forms
of media are often reused to conserve an organization’s resources.

If media are not intended for reuse either within or outside an organization due to damage or
other reason, the simplest and most cost-effective method of control may be Destroy.
