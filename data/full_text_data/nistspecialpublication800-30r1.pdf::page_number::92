APPENDIX K

RISK ASSESSMENT REPORTS
ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF INFORMATION




T       his appendix provides the essential elements of information that organizations can use to
        communicate the results of risk assessments. 57 Risk assessment results provide decision
        makers with an understanding of the information security risk to organizational operations
and assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation that derive from the operation and use
of organizational information systems and the environments in which those systems operate. The
essential elements of information in a risk assessment can be described in three sections of the
risk assessment report (or whatever vehicle is chosen by organizations to convey the results of the
assessment): (i) an executive summary; (ii) the main body containing detailed risk assessment
results; and (iii) supporting appendices.
Executive Summary
     •   List the date of the risk assessment.
     •   Summarize the purpose of the risk assessment.
     •   Describe the scope of the risk assessment.
         -    For Tier 1 and Tier 2 risk assessments, identify: organizational governance structures
              or processes associated with the assessment (e.g., risk executive [function], budget
              process, acquisition process, systems engineering process, enterprise architecture,
              information security architecture, organizational missions/business functions,
              mission/business processes, information systems supporting the mission/business
              processes).
         -    For Tier 3 risk assessments, identify: the information system name and location(s),
              security categorization, and information system (i.e., authorization) boundary.
     •   State whether this is an initial or subsequent risk assessment. If a subsequent risk
         assessment, state the circumstances that prompted the update and include a reference to
         the previous Risk Assessment Report.
     •   Describe the overall level of risk (e.g., Very Low, Low, Moderate, High, or Very High).
     •   List the number of risks identified for each level of risk (e.g., Very Low, Low, Moderate,
         High, or Very High).

Body of the Report
     •   Describe the purpose of the risk assessment, including questions to be answered by the
         assessment. For example:

   The essential elements of information described in this appendix are informative and exemplary only and are not
intended to require or promote a specific template for documenting risk assessment results. Organizations have
maximum flexibility in determining the type and the level of detail of information included in organizational risk
assessments and the associated reports. For example, Tier 1 and Tier 2 risk assessment results may be conveyed via an
executive briefing or dashboard, whereas Tier 3 risk assessment results may be conveyed via a risk assessment report
(formal or informal depending on organizational preference). The essential elements of information for communicating
risk assessment results can be modified accordingly to meet the needs of organizations conducting the assessments.
