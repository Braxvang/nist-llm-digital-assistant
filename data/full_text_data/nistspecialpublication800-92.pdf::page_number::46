GUIDE TO COMPUTER SECURITY LOG MANAGEMENT



analysis of the log data nearly impossible. Also, the volume of log data being recorded by any source
tends to be very dynamic, changing frequently in the short term, and also changing overall in the long
term. Logging settings that are reasonable at one time might be infeasible at another, particularly during
adverse circumstances.

Recording more data is not necessarily better; generally, organizations should only require logging and
analyzing the data that is of greatest importance, and also have non-mandatory recommendations for
which other types and sources of data should be logged and analyzed if time and resources permit. Some
organizations choose to have all or nearly all log data generated and stored for at least a short period of
time in case it is needed; this approach favors security considerations over usability and resource usage.
When establishing requirements and recommendations, organizations should be flexible since each host is
different and will log different amounts of data than other hosts. Flexibility is also important because the
logging behavior of a host may change rapidly due to an upgrade, patch, or configuration change.
Organizations should also permit administrators to reconfigure logging temporarily during adverse system
or network conditions, such as unsuccessful malware attacks that cause the same type of log entry to be
generated many times. These configuration changes should be performed as a last resort and should be as
precise as possible. System-level administrators should inform the infrastructure administrators of such
configuration changes to ensure that log monitoring and analysis processes are modified if needed.

Organizations should also consider the environments in which systems reside when developing policy.
NIST SP 800-70, Security Configuration Checklists Program for IT Products—Guidance for Checklists
Users and Developers, identifies several common operational environments.51 The following describes
four of these environments and explains how the characteristics of each environment might impact
logging policy. Organizations might consider having separate logging policy provisions for systems in
each environment.

      Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) describes small, informal computer installations that are
       used for home or business purposes. SOHO encompasses a variety of small-scale environments
       and devices, ranging from laptops, mobile devices, or home computers, to telecommuting
       systems, to small businesses and small branch offices of a company. Many SOHO systems have
       intermittent, low-bandwidth connections to organizations’ primary networks, which could
       significantly impact use of and integration with a log management infrastructure. It might be
       necessary to design a log management infrastructure so as to minimize the transmission of data
       from SOHO systems to the infrastructure.
      Enterprise environments typically consist of large organizational systems with defined,
       organized suites of hardware and software configurations, usually consisting of centrally-
       managed workstations and servers protected from the Internet by firewalls and other network
       security devices. Of all the environments, the Enterprise environment is typically the easiest in
       which to perform log management.
      Custom environments contain systems in which the functionality and degree of system do not fit
       the other environments. Two typical Custom environments are Specialized Security-Limited
       Functionality and Legacy:

         –    Specialized Security-Limited Functionality environments contain systems and networks at
              high risk of attack or data exposure, with security taking precedence over functionality. They
              assume that systems have limited or specialized functionality (not general purpose
              workstations or systems) in a highly threatened environment, such as an outward-facing
              firewall or public Web server, or whose data content or mission purpose is of such value that
