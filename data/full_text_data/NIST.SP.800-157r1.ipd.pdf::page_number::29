      NIST SP 800-157r1 ipd                            Derived PIV Credentials (Initial Public Draft)
      January 2023


784   X.509 Certificate for Key Management
785      The read access control rule for the X.509 certificate for key management and the PKI
786      cryptographic function access rule for the corresponding private key are as described
787      in Sec. 3.2.2 of [SP800-73] Part 1.

788   Discovery Object
789      The requirements for the discovery object are as described in Sec. 3.3.2 of [SP800-73]
790      Part 1, except for the following:
791          • References to “PIV card application AID” are replaced by “derived PIV
792            application AID.”
793          • References to “PIV card application PIN” are replaced by “derived PIV
794            activation secret.”
795          • The first byte of the PIN usage policy SHALL be set to 0x40 to indicate that
796            the virtual contact interface (VCI) is not implemented, 0x48 to indicate that a
797            pairing code is required to establish a VCI, or 0x4C to indicate that no pairing
798            code is required to establish a VCI. This also means that neither the global
799            PIN nor the on-card biometric comparison (OCC) satisfies the access control
800            rules for command execution and data object access within the derived PIV
801            application.

802   Key History Object
803      Up to 20 retired key management private keys MAY be stored in the derived
804      PIV application. The Key History Object SHALL be present in the derived PIV
805      application if the derived PIV application contains any retired key management
806      private keys but MAY be present even if no such keys are present in the derived PIV
807      application. The requirements for the key history object are as described in Sec. 3.3.3
808      of [SP800-73] Part 1, except for the following:
809          • References to keysWithOnCardCerts SHOULD be interpreted as keys for which
810            the corresponding certificate is populated within the derived PIV application.
811          • References to keysWithOffCardCerts SHOULD be interpreted as keys for which
812            the corresponding certificate is not populated within the derived PIV application.
813          • References to offCardCertURL SHOULD be interpreted as a URL that points
814            to a file containing the certificates that correspond to all of the retired key
815            management private keys within the derived PIV application, including those for
816            which the corresponding certificate is stored within the derived PIV application.

817   Retired X.509 Certificates for Key Management
818      The read access control rules for the retired X.509 certificates for key management
819      and the PKI cryptographic function access rules for corresponding private keys are as
820      described in Sec. 3.3.4 of [SP800-73] Part 1.
