appendices were added in this second draft. The “FASCSA Appendix” provides agencies with
additional guidance concerning specific requirements outlined in the FASCSA. This appendix
provides guidance on the prioritization of supply chain risk assessments, establishes baseline risk
factors to bring greater consistency and alignment between agency-level and government-wide
C-SCRM risk assessment and response functions, and introduces a supply chain risk severity
schema that can be used to guide referrals of significant risk to the FASC for further review,
decision, and action as needed. The second new appendix provides preliminary guidelines for
enhancing software supply chain security and was developed in response to EO 14028, Enhancing
the Nation’s Cybersecurity. This appendix outlines existing software supply chain security industry
standards, tools, and recommended practices within the context of the draft of SP 800-161,
Revision 1. Final publication is anticipated to be released during the third quarter of FY 2022.
An NCCoE demonstration project identified methods by which organizations can verify that their
purchased computing devices are genuine and have not been altered during the manufacturing
and distribution processes. In addition, the NCCoE released the Preliminary Draft of Validating
the Integrity of Computing Devices (NIST Cybersecurity Practice Guide SP 1800-34, Volumes A,
B, and C).
Cybersecurity for the Internet of Things (IoT) Program
The Cybersecurity for IoT Program’s FY 2021 efforts primarily occurred in three areas: continuing
to build out a suite of guidance for manufacturers of IoT devices; efforts to develop guidance for
consumer IoT cybersecurity, including responding to the requirements of the President’s Executive
Order (EO) 14028; and addressing the requirements of the IoT Cybersecurity Improvement Act of
2020 to provide cybersecurity guidance for federal agencies that are using IoT devices.
The development of guidance for manufacturers expanded upon the previously published IoT
Device Cybersecurity Core Baseline (NISTIR 8259A). Early in FY 2021, NIST published a public
review draft of IoT Non-technical Supporting Capability Core Baseline (draft NISTIR 8259B).
This document complements NISTIR 8259A’s technical requirements with a baseline of non-
technical activities that manufacturers and their supporting third parties should undertake in order
to support their customers in securely deploying and operating their products. The draft of NISTIR
8259B served as the starting point for a series of stakeholder interactions that included meetings
with industry groups and organizations, a workshop in April 2021 and a series of roundtables
in June 2021. These interactions enabled the program to publish the final version of NISTIR
8259B in August 2021 and make substantial progress toward a federal guideline publication that
is anticipated for release in FY 2022. NISTIR 8259B was also added to NIST’s Online Informative
References (OLIR) program database as a focal document.
In parallel with these efforts, the IoT Cybersecurity Program continued refining a detailed catalog
of technical cybersecurity capabilities and non-technical supporting capabilities that expand on
the NISTIR 8259A and 8259B baselines. The online catalog presentation was refactored to be
more usable. The program received considerable feedback that guided catalog improvements.
The capabilities in the catalog were also mapped to NIST SP 800-53, Revision 5 and to the NIST
Cybersecurity Framework to better connect the program’s activities with broader NIST guidance on
risk management. The program supported activities within the NCCoE to document the alignment
of its work with that of NIST.
Efforts related to consumer IoT cybersecurity started with an October 2020 virtual workshop on
Cybersecurity Risks in Consumer Home IoT Products that sought feedback on topics related
