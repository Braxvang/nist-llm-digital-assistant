                  The Technical Specification for the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.1



3.2.2     The <xccdf:platform> Element and CPE Names

For all SCAP content, the applicability of <xccdf:Benchmark>, <xccdf:Profile>,
<xccdf:Group>, and <xccdf:Rule> elements to specific IT platforms MAY be specified using one
or more <xccdf:platform> @idref attributes. Each instance of the @idref attribute SHALL
reference either a CPE Name or the @id attribute of a <cpe-lang:platform-
specification/cpe-lang:platform> element.

If compound CPE Name statements are necessary, a CPE Language <cpe-lang:platform-
specification> element SHALL be defined as a child of the <xccdf:Benchmark> element. The
@id attribute for each <cpe-lang:platform> element declared in this manner MAY be referenced
within an <xccdf:platform> element with a corresponding @idref attribute. Complex platforms
MAY be referenced this way within <xccdf:Benchmark>, <xccdf:Profile>,
<xccdf:Group>, and <xccdf:Rule> elements.

For example:

<cpe-lang:platform-specification>
  <cpe-lang:platform id="xp_and_acrobat_7.0.9">
    <cpe-lang:logical-test operator="AND" negate="false">
      <cpe-lang:fact-ref name="cpe:/o:microsoft:windows_xp"/>
      <cpe-lang:fact-ref name="cpe:/a:adobe:acrobat:7.0.9"/>
    </cpe-lang:logical-test>
  </cpe-lang:platform>
</cpe-lang:platform-specification>
<xccdf:platform idref="xp_and_acrobat_7.0.9"/>

Within a given <xccdf:Benchmark>, <xccdf:Profile>, <xccdf:Group>, or
<xccdf:Rule> context, if no <xccdf:platform> element is defined, the <xccdf:platform>
of its nearest ancestor that has an <xccdf:platform> element defined SHALL be inherited. If none
of its ancestors have an <xccdf:platform> element defined, the <xccdf:Benchmark>,
<xccdf:Profile>, <xccdf:Group>, or <xccdf:Rule> SHALL be considered to apply to any
product.

CPE Names used within an XCCDF document SHALL match the names of existing Official CPE
Dictionary14 entries where names for the desired platform exist. The matching algorithm from [CPE] to be
used SHALL be CPE_Name_Match for a single CPE Name and CPE_Language_Match for a compound
CPE Name. If multiple matches are found within the dictionary (e.g., deprecated and current CPE
Names), the most current CPE Name SHOULD be used.

Each reference to a CPE Name SHALL be declared in the required CPE dictionary data stream
component, and each OVAL inventory class definition referenced from the dictionary data stream
component SHALL be specified in the required CPE inventory data stream component.
