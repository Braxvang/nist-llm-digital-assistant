                                                                                                  BIOS PROTECTION GUIDELINES



In addition, a common configuration baseline for each platform must be created to conform to the
organization’s policy. The baseline should ensure that the integrity protection and non-bypassability
features are enabled (if they are configurable), and organization policies for password policy and device
boot order are enforced. Finally, the BIOS image information and associated baseline of settings for each
platform should be documented in the configuration management plan.2

Platform Deployment Phase: The secure local update process should be used to provision the approved
BIOS for that platform from the golden master image, the corresponding RTU should be installed, and
BIOS-related configuration parameters established before computer systems are deployed. This will help
the organization maintain a consistent, known starting posture. The organization should periodically
perform assessments to confirm that the organization’s BIOS policies, processes, and procedures are
being followed properly.

Specifically, the procedures must ensure that the appropriate system BIOS is installed, the RTU contains
all required keys and no unauthorized keys, and the integrity protection and non-bypassability features are
enabled if they are configurable.

Operation and Maintenance Phase: This phase includes the operations and maintenance activities that
are important for maintaining BIOS security and reliability in the operational environment. System BIOS
updates should be performed using a change management process and the new approved version should
be documented in the configuration plan, noting the previous BIOS image has been superseded.

The BIOS image and configuration baseline should be continuously monitored. If an unapproved
deviation from this baseline is detected, the event should be investigated, documented, and remediated as
part of incident response activities. The incident response plan should document the process and set of
authorized tools that can be used to capture the evidence to help determine the root cause.3 The secure
local update mechanism should be used to recover from a BIOS image compromise.

When a new BIOS image is required to extend system capabilities, improve system reliability, or
remediate software vulnerabilities, BIOS updates should be performed using the authenticated update
process. Where the organization participates actively in the update process, the multi-party control
process must be executed to retrieve the private key from secure storage and generate the digital
signature. The BIOS installation package should also be signed, and the digital signature should be
verified before execution. Once the update has executed successfully, the configuration baseline should
be validated to confirm that the computer system is still in compliance with the organization’s defined
policy.

Recovery Phase: In some circumstances, a BIOS update will be required that cannot be accomplished
using the authenticated update process. For example, a corrupted system BIOS or RTU may be unable to
execute or invoke the authentication procedures. In this case, the appropriate system BIOS and/or RTU
may be able to be installed using the secure local update process. In other cases, a BIOS update may
have unintended consequences, forcing the organization to roll back to an earlier version. Extra steps
may be required for an authenticated update to authorize rollback (if versioning or timestamps are
compared during the standard authentication process), or the secure local update process may be required
to reestablish a secure baseline. As with the Operations and Maintenance phase, it is essential to validate
