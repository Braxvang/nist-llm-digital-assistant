NIST SP 800-90A Rev. 1                                             Recommendation for Random Number
                                                                    Generation Using Deterministic RBGs


11 Assurance
A user of a DRBG employed for cryptographic purposes requires assurance that the generator
actually produces (pseudo) random and unpredictable bits. The user needs assurance that the
design of the generator, its implementation and its use to support cryptographic services are
adequate to protect the user's information. In addition, the user requires assurance that the
generator continues to operate correctly.
The design of each DRBG mechanism in this Recommendation has received an evaluation of its
security properties prior to its selection for inclusion in this Recommendation.
An implementer selects a DRBG mechanism (e.g., HMAC_DRBG), an appropriate
cryptographic primitive (e.g., SHA-256 or SHA-512), the DRBG functions to be used (i.e.,
instantiate, generate and/or reseed), and will determine whether or not the DRBG will be
distributed (see Section 8.5). Each choice of components effectively defines a different DRBG
type. For example, an implementation of HMAC_DRBG using SHA-256 is considered to be a
different DRBG than HMAC_DRBG using SHA-512.
An implementation shall be validated for conformance to this Recommendation by a NVLAP-
accredited laboratory (see Section 11.2). Such validations provide a higher level of assurance
that the DRBG mechanism is correctly implemented.
Health tests on the DRBG mechanism shall be implemented within a DRBG mechanism
boundary or sub-boundary in order to determine that the process continues to operate as designed
and implemented. See Section 11.3 for further information.
A cryptographic module containing a DRBG mechanism shall be validated (see [FIPS 140]).
The consuming application or cryptographic service that uses a DRBG mechanism should also
be validated and periodically tested for continued correct operation. However, this level of
testing is outside the scope of this Recommendation.
Note that any entropy input used for testing (either for validation testing or health testing) may
be publicly known. Therefore, entropy input used for testing shall not be used for normal
operational use.

11.1 Minimal Documentation Requirements

A set of documentation shall be developed that will provide assurance to users and validators
that the DRBG mechanisms in this Recommendation have been implemented properly. Much of
this documentation could be placed in a user manual. This documentation shall consist of the
following as a minimum:
   •   Document the method for obtaining entropy input.
   •   Document how the implementation has been designed to permit implementation
       validation and health testing.
   •   Document the type of DRBG mechanism (e.g., CTR_DRBG), and the cryptographic
       primitives used (e.g., AES-128 or SHA-256).
   •   Document the security strengths supported by the implementation.
