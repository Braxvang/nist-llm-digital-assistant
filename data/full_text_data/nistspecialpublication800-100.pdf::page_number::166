   RTO. The strategy must also address recovering information system critical
   components within a priority, as established by their individual RTOs.

Q. What are the components of the IT contingency plan strategy that must
   be tested?
A. The IT contingency plan strategy testing should include:
       1.   System recovery on an alternate platform from backup media;
       2.   Coordination among recovery teams;
       3.   Internal and external connectivity;
       4.   System performance using alternate equipment;
       5.   Restoration of normal operations; and
       6.   Notification procedures.

Q. Where should backup data be stored?
A. Backed up data should be stored offsite and rotated frequently. Also, stored data
   should be routinely tested to validate backed-up data integrity.

Q. Should I train and educate my personnel on IT contingency planning?
A. Yes. Personnel selected to execute the IT contingency plan must be trained to
   perform the procedures. Personnel training should include:
   • Purpose of the plan;
   • Cross-team coordination and communication;
   • Reporting procedures;
   • Security requirements;
   • Team-specific processes; and
   • Individual responsibilities.
   Plan exercises should be designed to individually and then collectively examine
   various components of the entire plan. Exercises may be conducted in a
   classroom setting: discussing specific components of the plan and/or impact
   issues; or they may be functional exercises: simulating the recovery using actual
   replacement equipment, data, and alternate sites.
