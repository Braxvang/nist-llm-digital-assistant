NIST SP 800-124r2                                                   Guidelines for Managing the Security

Mobile device security policies can define the device configurations required for each mobile
device that accesses enterprise data. For example, a configuration policy may require user
authentication before accessing the mobile device or the organization’s resources. Further, that
policy may define the strength of the authentication mechanism or require multi-factor
authentication. These types of policies can protect against an attacker gaining unauthorized
access to enterprise resources.
In the case of remediation, an organization should define policies to guide the necessary actions
to perform in the case of an error or attack. An organization may develop a policy that requires a
mobile device to be erased/wiped if it is lost or stolen. This policy will help prevent unauthorized
access to sensitive enterprise information on such a mobile device. Additionally, an organization
should have procedures for reviewing and updating policies as needed, especially if there is a
breach due to implementation of a weak or outdated policy.
Threats Addressed: Device loss and theft, credential theft via phishing, accessing enterprise
resources via a misconfigured device, information loss due to insecure lock screen, data loss via
synchronization, shadow IT usage, insider threat

4.3.12.        Notification and Revocation of Enterprise Access
Every enterprise and organization should have security policies and rules that influence
remediation actions when network attacks or breaches occur. These policies and rules also cover
mobile devices. Remediation actions may span a spectrum of possibilities ranging from notifying
affected individual users or groups of users to revoking access to enterprise data and services,
wiping the data of the affected devices, or restoring them to a default pristine state (e.g., factory
reset).
Notifying users of an issue is often the most basic and least aggressive remediation option. This
is typically done via a push notification to the phone’s notification center or potentially an SMS
to follow up. Temporary revocation of access to enterprise resources is often seen as the next
step if the notification does not remediate the issue. This is most easily done via the EMM agent
if one is installed on the employee device. The temporary revocation may last a predefined
period of time (e.g., 24 hours), and access may be automatically restored or manually restored by
the enterprise’s system administrators. Removing applications or wiping the mobile device are
some of the more aggressive remediation options available to the enterprise. These more drastic
actions can be performed because an app on their mobile system was compromised or is
malicious and is the source of attacks or leaks affecting the enterprise. Note: Wiping data not
owned by the enterprise can cause legal issues.
Threats Addressed: Device loss and theft, accessing enterprise resources via a misconfigured
device, use of untrusted mobile devices

4.3.13.        Strong Authentication
System administrators who use the EMM console have access to sensitive information about the
enterprise’s mobile devices. Individuals with EMM credentials can grant and revoke access to
enterprise resources and collect private information about employees, such as device location.
Additionally, they may be able to wipe an entire device, not just the enterprise data. For this
reason, EMM administrator credentials should conform to standard password strength and
