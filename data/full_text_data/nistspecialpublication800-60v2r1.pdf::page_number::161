Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. In most cases,
the adverse effects of unauthorized modification or destruction of energy conservation and
preparedness information on agency mission functions and public confidence in the agency will
be limited

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Unauthorized modification or destruction
of information necessary to mission-critical procedures ensuring the provision of energy in the
event of an emergency can result in extended outages. There is some potential for a consequent
threat to critical energy infrastructure and to human life. In such cases, the integrity impact level
may be high.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
energy conservation and preparedness information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to energy conservation and
preparedness information. Loan assistance processes are generally tolerant of delay. In most
cases disruption of access to energy conservation and preparedness information will have
only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Unavailability of information
necessary to mission-critical procedures ensuring the provision of energy in the event of an
emergency may result in extended outages. There is some potential for a consequent threat
to critical energy infrastructure and to human life. In such cases, the availability impact level
may be high.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
energy conservation and preparedness information is low.

D.7.3 Energy Resource Management Information Type

Energy resource management involves the management of energy producing resources including
facilities, land, and offshore resources. The recommended provisional categorization of the
energy resource management information type follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Moderate), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of energy resource
management information on the activities of responsible agencies with respect to management of
energy producing resources including facilities, land, and offshore resources.
