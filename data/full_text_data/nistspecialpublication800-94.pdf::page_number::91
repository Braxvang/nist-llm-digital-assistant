                                                  GUIDE TO INTRUSION DETECTION AND PREVENTION SYSTEMS (IDPS)



Limitations of firewalls and routers in the context of IDPS include the following:

 Firewalls and routers cannot detect most types of malicious activity.
 Firewalls and routers typically log relatively little information, such as the basic characteristics of
  denied connection attempts only, and they rarely record the content of any packets. NBA
  technologies and some network-based IDPSs can log much more information about network traffic
  than firewalls and routers do.
8.3.4    Honeypots

Some organizations are sufficiently concerned with detecting the earliest signs of widespread incidents,
such as major new worms, that they deploy deceptive measures such as honeypots so that they can collect
better data on these threats. Honeypots are hosts that have no authorized users other than the honeypot
administrators because they serve no business function; all activity directed at them is considered
suspicious. Attackers will scan and attack honeypots, giving administrators data on new trends and attack
tools, particularly malware. However, honeypots are a supplement to, not a replacement for, other
security controls such as intrusion detection and prevention systems. If honeypots are to be used by an
organization, qualified incident handlers and intrusion detection analysts should manage them. The
legality of honeypots has not been clearly established; therefore, organizations should carefully study the
legal ramifications before planning any honeypot deployments.

8.4     Summary

The four primary types of IDPS technologies—network-based, wireless, NBA, and host-based—each
offer fundamentally different information gathering, logging, detection, and prevention capabilities. Each
technology type offers benefits over the other, such as detecting some events that the others cannot and
detecting some events with significantly greater accuracy than the other technologies. Accordingly,
organizations should consider using multiple types of IDPS technologies to achieve more comprehensive
and accurate detection and prevention of malicious activity. In many environments, a robust IDPS
solution cannot be achieved without using multiple types of IDPS technologies. For most environments,
a combination of network-based and host-based IDPSs is needed for an effective IDPS solution. Wireless
IDPSs may also be needed if the organization determines that its wireless networks need additional
monitoring or if the organization wants to ensure that rogue wireless networks are not in use in the
organization’s facilities. NBA technologies can also be deployed if organizations desire additional
detection capabilities for DoS attacks, worms, and other threats that NBAs are particularly good at
detecting.

Organizations that are planning to use multiple types of IDPS technologies, or even multiple products
within a single IDPS technology class, should consider whether or not the IDPS products should be
integrated in some way. Direct IDPS integration is most often performed when an organization uses
multiple IDPS products from a single vendor, by having a single console that can be used to manage and
monitor the multiple products. Some products can also share data, which can speed the analysis process
and help users to better prioritize threats. A more limited form of direct IDPS integration is having one
IDPS product provide data for another IDPS product, such as a network-based IDPS providing network
flow information to an NBA sensor.

Indirect IDPS integration is usually performed with security information and event management (SIEM)
software, which is designed to import information from various security-related logs and correlate events
among them. SIEM software complements IDPSs in several ways, including correlating events logged by
different technologies, displaying data from many event sources, and providing supporting information
from other sources to help users verify the accuracy of IDPS alerts. An alternative to using SIEM
