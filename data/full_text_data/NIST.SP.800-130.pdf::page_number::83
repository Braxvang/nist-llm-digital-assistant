            i. Adaptive Filtering mechanisms,
            ii. Adaptive Detection mechanisms, and
            iii. Adaptive Prevention mechanisms.

Networked CKMS devices should be protected using a combination of firewalls and
intrusion detection and prevention systems. While firewalls provide protection by
filtering out unwanted and potentially dangerous protocols and by examining permitted
protocol data to reduce the chances of a successful attack, intrusion detection and
prevention systems complement firewalls by examining host and network activity to
determine if the systems are being attacked and by preventing the detected attacks. Thus,
both firewall and intrusion detection and prevention systems should be used.

Boundary control devices (such as firewalls, filtering routers, VPNs, IDS, and IPS) could
be hosted on computer systems (see Section 8.2) or could be implemented in dedicated
hardware. These devices should be placed in physically secure locations (see Section 8.1
for physical security controls) and should only be configured with user accounts and
network services that are required for secure operation. In order to provide defense-in-
depth, boundary control functions should also be implemented directly in CKMS devices.
Such controls are termed “host-based” firewalls.

FR:8.15 The CKMS design shall specify the boundary protection mechanisms employed
by the CKMS.

FR:8.16 The CKMS design shall specify:
   a) The types of firewalls used and the protocols permitted through the firewalls,
      including the source and destination for each type of protocol; and
   b) The types of intrusion detection and prevention systems used, including their
      logging and security breach reaction capabilities.

FR:8.17 The CKMS design shall specify the methods used to protect the CKMS devices
against denial of service.

FR:8.18 The CKMS design shall specify how each method used protects against the
denial of service.

8.4 Cryptographic Module Controls
A cryptographic module is a set of hardware, software and/or firmware that implements
cryptographic-based security functions (e.g. cryptographic algorithms and key
establishment schemes). The module encompasses everything within its cryptographic
boundary 22 and includes the boundary itself. Each cryptographic module should be built
in accordance with and to enforce a cryptographic module security policy (e.g. see [FIPS
140]).

22
  A cryptographic boundary is an explicitly defined perimeter that establishes the boundary of all
components of a cryptographic module.
