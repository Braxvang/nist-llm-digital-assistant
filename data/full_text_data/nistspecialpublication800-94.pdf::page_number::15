                                                             GUIDE TO INTRUSION DETECTION AND PREVENTION SYSTEMS (IDPS)



2.       Intrusion Detection and Prevention Principles

Intrusion detection is the process of monitoring the events occurring in a computer system or network and
analyzing them for signs of possible incidents, which are violations or imminent threats of violation of
computer security policies, acceptable use policies, or standard security practices. Incidents have many
causes, such as malware (e.g., worms, spyware), attackers gaining unauthorized access to systems from
the Internet, and authorized users of systems who misuse their privileges or attempt to gain additional
privileges for which they are not authorized. Although many incidents are malicious in nature, many
others are not; for example, a person might mistype the address of a computer and accidentally attempt to
connect to a different system without authorization.

An intrusion detection system (IDS) is software that automates the intrusion detection process. An
intrusion prevention system (IPS) is software that has all the capabilities of an intrusion detection system
and can also attempt to stop possible incidents. This section provides an overview of IDS and IPS
technologies as a foundation for the rest of the publication. It first explains how IDS and IPS
technologies can be used. Next, it describes the key functions that IDS and IPS technologies perform and
the detection methodologies that they use. Finally, it provides an overview of the major classes of IDS
and IPS technologies.

IDS and IPS technologies offer many of the same capabilities, and administrators can usually disable
prevention features in IPS products, causing them to function as IDSs. Accordingly, for brevity the term
intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS) is used throughout the rest of this guide to refer to both
IDS and IPS technologies. 2 Any exceptions are specifically noted.

2.1      Uses of IDPS Technologies

IDPSs are primarily focused on identifying possible incidents. For example, an IDPS could detect when
an attacker has successfully compromised a system by exploiting a vulnerability in the system. The IDPS
could then report the incident to security administrators, who could quickly initiate incident response
actions to minimize the damage caused by the incident. 3 The IDPS could also log information that could
be used by the incident handlers. 4 Many IDPSs can also be configured to recognize violations of security
policies. For example, some IDPSs can be configured with firewall ruleset-like settings, allowing them to
identify network traffic that violates the organization’s security or acceptable use policies. Also, some
IDPSs can monitor file transfers and identify ones that might be suspicious, such as copying a large
database onto a user’s laptop.

Many IDPSs can also identify reconnaissance activity, which may indicate that an attack is imminent.
For example, some attack tools and forms of malware, particularly worms, perform reconnaissance
activities such as host and port scans to identify targets for subsequent attacks. An IDPS might be able to
block reconnaissance and notify security administrators, who can take actions if needed to alter other
security controls to prevent related incidents. Because reconnaissance activity is so frequent on the
Internet, reconnaissance detection is often performed primarily on protected internal networks.

      This term is used for the purposes of this publication. It has not been widely used in the security community, and the reason
      for using it in this publication is strictly brevity, not to replace the well-established “IDS” and “IPS” terms.
3
      If the IDPS had successfully prevented the attack, security administrators still might want to be notified of the attack. This
      is particularly important if the target has a known vulnerability that the attack could have exploited. Attackers could
      potentially use a different attack for the same vulnerability that the IDPS might not recognize.

      A detailed discussion of incident response is outside the scope of this guide. For guidance on establishing an effective
      incident response capability, see NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-61, Computer Security Incident Handling Guide, which
      is available at http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/.
