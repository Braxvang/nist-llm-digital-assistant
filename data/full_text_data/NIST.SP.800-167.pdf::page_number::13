NIST SP 800-167                                                                GUIDE TO APPLICATION W HITELISTING


      o    User prompting asks the user (or, in some cases, the administrator) to accept or reject each
           attempt to execute a file that is not whitelisted or blacklisted; and
      o    Blacklist enforcement blocks execution of blacklisted items but allows everything else to be
           executed.
An application whitelisting technology run in audit mode is strictly informative; it can log the execution
of malware and other unauthorized executables, but it cannot do anything to stop them. Audit mode is
primarily intended for use when first deploying an application whitelisting technology, to help an
organization evaluate and fine-tune the technology before switching it to enforcement mode.

Many application whitelisting technologies have granular options for setting modes. Some features could
be configured to run in enforcement mode while other features run in audit mode. For example, Windows
registry changes might be permitted (audit mode) while operating system file changes would be
prohibited (enforcement mode). Some products also support multiple enforcement modes and allow
granular setting of those for different types of monitored entities.

2.4       Uses of Application Whitelisting Technologies

As stated in the Section 2 introduction, the primary purpose of application whitelisting technologies is to
provide application access control, i.e., to stop the execution of unauthorized software. However, most
application whitelisting technologies can be used for other purposes as well, including the following:

     Software inventory. Application whitelisting technologies can keep an inventory of the applications
      and application versions installed on each host. This allows an organization to identify unauthorized
      applications—unlicensed applications, prohibited applications, etc.—as well as to identify “wrong”
      versions of software (both too old and too new). This software inventory capability is also useful for
      forensic investigations, such as finding modified applications, unauthorized applications, malware,
      unknown applications, etc. on a given host.
     File integrity monitoring. Most application whitelisting technologies can perform frequent or
      continuous monitoring of attempted changes to application files. Some technologies can prevent files
      from being changed, while other technologies cannot prevent changes but can immediately report
      when changes occur.
     Incident response. An organization responding to an incident on a host could capture the
      characteristics of the malicious files on that host (e.g., generate cryptographic file hashes) and use
      application whitelisting technologies to check other hosts for the same files, indicating that they have
      been compromised as well.
Some application whitelisting technologies may have additional capabilities, including the following:

     Access control for portable storage devices, such as restricting file reads, writes, and executes for all
      files on removable media; only permitting the use of encrypted devices; and only permitting the use
      of drives with particular serial numbers.
     Memory protection, primarily involving stopping certain attacks (e.g., buffer overflows) that directly
      affect files in memory, not files in storage. Most application whitelisting technologies only focus on
      the files in storage, but do not ensure that the files in memory are not altered or exploited.
     Software reputation services, such as reviewing what other software a particular application is often
      bundled with, and determining if an application is known to pose a substantial security risk.
