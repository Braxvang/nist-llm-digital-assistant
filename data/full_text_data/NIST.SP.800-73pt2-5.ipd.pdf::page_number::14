      NIST SP 800-73pt2-5 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                   Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification: Part 2
      September 2023                                                                      PIV Card Application Card Command Interface

310   that all unspecified names, BER-TLV tags, OIDs, and values of algorithm identifiers, key
311   references, and cryptographic mechanism identifiers are reserved for future use.

312              Card Applications
313   Each command that appears on the card command interface SHALL be implemented by a card
314   application that is resident on the ICC. The card command enables operations on and with the
315   data objects to which the card application has access.
316   Each card application SHALL have a globally unique name called its Application Identifier
317   (AID) [ISO7816, Part 4]. Except for the default applications, access to the card commands and
318   data objects of a card application SHALL be gained by selecting the card application using its
319   application identifier. 1 The PIX of the AID SHALL contain an encoding of the version of the
320   card application. The AID of the PIV Card Application is defined in Part 1.
321   The card application whose commands are currently being used is called the currently selected
322   application.

323   2.3.1. Default Selected Card Application
324   The card platform SHALL support a default selected card application. In other words, there
325   SHALL be a currently selected application immediately after a cold or warm reset. This card
326   application is the default selected card application. The default card application MAY be the PIV
327   Card Application, or it MAY be another card application.

328              Security Architecture
329   The security architecture of an ICC is the means by which the security policies governing access
330   to each data object stored on the card are represented within the card. These security policy
331   representations are applied to all PIV card commands, thereby ensuring that the prescribed data
332   policies for the card applications are enforced.
333   The following subsections describe the security architecture of the PIV Card Application.

334   2.4.1. Access Control Rule
335   An access control rule SHALL consist of an access mode and a security condition. The access
336   mode is an operation that CAN be performed on a data object. A security condition is a Boolean
337   expression using variables called security statuses (see Section 2.4.2).
338   According to an access control rule, the action described by the access mode CAN be performed
339   on the data object if and only if the security condition evaluates to TRUE for the current values
340   of the security statuses. If there is no access control rule with an access mode that describes a
341   particular action, then that action SHALL never be performed on the data object.


      1
        Access to the default application, its commands, and its objects occurs immediately after a warm or cold card reset without an explicit SELECT
      command.
