       NIST SP 800-90C 3pd (Third Public Draft)                       Recommendation for RBG Constructions
       September 2022

1835   Direct access of the DRBG is accomplished as specified in Section 5.2.2 using the state handle
1836   associated with the instantiation and internal state that was returned for the DRBG (see Section
1837   6.3.1.1).
1838                (status, returned_bits) = Generate_function(RBG3(RS)_state_handle,
1839        requested_number_of_bits, requested_security_strength, prediction_resistance_request,
1840                                           additional_input),
1841   where state_handle (if used) was returned by the Instantiate_function (see Section 6.3.1.1).
1842   When the previous generate request was made to the RBG3(RS) construction rather than directly
1843   to the DRBG, the prediction_resistance_request parameter shall be set to TRUE. Otherwise,
1844   requesting prediction resistance during the Generate_function is optional.

1845   6.3.1.3.        Reseeding
1846   Reseeding is performed during a Generate_function request to a directly accessible DRBG (see
1847   Section 6.3.1.2.2) when prediction resistance is requested or the end of the DRBGâ€™s seedlife is
1848   reached. The Generate_function invokes the Reseed_function specified in [SP800-90A].
1849   Reseeding may also be performed on demand as specified in Section 4.2.3 using the
1850   RBG3(RS)_state_handle if provided during instantiation.

1851   6.3.2. Requirements for a RBG3(RS) Construction
1852   An RBG3(RS) construction has the following requirements in addition to those provided in
1853   Section 6.1:
1854       1. Fresh entropy shall be acquired either directly from all independent validated entropy
1855          sources (see Section 3.2) or (in the case of a CTR_DRBG used as the DRBG when the
1856          entropy sources do not provide full-entropy output) from an external conditioning function
1857          that processes the output of the validated entropy sources as specified in Section 3.3.2.
1858          Method 1 in Section 2.3 shall be used when collecting the required entropy (i.e., only the
1859          entropy provided by validated physical entropy sources shall be counted toward fulfilling
1860          the amount of entropy requested).
1861       2. If the DRBG is directly accessible, a reseed of the DRBG instantiation shall be performed
1862          before generating output in response to a request for output from the directly accessible
1863          DRBG when the previous use of the DRBG was by the RBG3(RS) construction. This could
1864          require an additional internal state value to record the last use of the DRBG for generation
1865          (e.g., used by an RBG3(RS)_Generate function as specified in Section 6.3.1.2.1 or
1866          directly accessed by a (DRBG) Generate_function as discussed in Section 6.3.1.2.2).
