   References in this column are to both DCI Directive 6/3 and to its Manual (Administrative update, December 2003).
Paragraphs cited from the Directive are preceded by “DCID” and where there are also references for the same control
from the Manual, these are preceded by “Manual.” Where only paragraph numbers appear, they are references to the
Manual. References to paragraphs in the Manual should be construed to encompass all subparagraphs related to those
paragraphs. It should also be noted that Special Publication 800-53 contains a set of security controls that cover
personnel, physical, and technical security measures, and therefore, the scope of the publication is broader than DCID
6/3. Some of the controls in Special Publication 800-53 are explicitly not included in DCID 6/3 because they are
addressed in other DCID and Intelligence Community (IC) policy documents. The difference in scope/breadth between
Special Publication 800-53 and DCID 6/3 impacts the degree of correlation between the two documents. Thus, the lack
of a “mapping” for a particular Special Publication 800-53 control to a DCID 6/3 requirement does not mean that there
is no similar IC requirement. The IC Translation Review Board provided information for the DCID 6/3 mapping.
