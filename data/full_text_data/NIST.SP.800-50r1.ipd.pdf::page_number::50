       NIST SP 800-50r1 ipd                                                        Building a Cybersecurity and
       August 2023                                                                   Privacy Learning Program

1463      •   Other organizations: Organizations can explore the use of CPLP material that has been
1464          developed by other organizations and edited to fit their needs rather than developing a
1465          completely new course. Care should be taken that the available material is applicable to
1466          the intended audience and that the material addresses the learning goals of the
1467          organization.
1468      •   Shared events and material: Several federal agencies offer cybersecurity and privacy
1469          learning events that are open to personnel across the government. Learning Program
1470          Managers should join federal working groups to remain informed about events,
1471          workshops, and conferences intended for professional development.
1472   Sources of timely material may include:
1473      •   Email advisories issued by industry-hosted news groups, academic institutions, or the
1474          organization’s cybersecurity or privacy office
1475      •   Cybersecurity or privacy websites
1476      •   Themed events, such as Data Privacy Week, Cybersecurity Awareness Month, or
1477          Cybersecurity Career Week
1478      •   Conferences, seminars, webinars, forums, and courses

1479   3.3.2. Internal Sources of CPLP Material
1480   Within an agency or organization, cybersecurity and privacy Learning Program Managers can
1481   build new partnerships or reinforce existing ones with the organization’s functional managers
1482   who coordinate or conduct their own CPLPs. Functional training developed in-house (e.g.,
1483   financial applications or personnel management) often lacks adequate discussion of related
1484   cybersecurity and privacy issues. Through these cross-departmental partnerships, Learning
1485   Program Managers can review existing references to their topic areas in the material and check
1486   for completeness and accuracy. The Learning Program Manager can also assist the functional
1487   manager by developing a learning module for any material that previously had no cybersecurity
1488   or privacy component.

1489          Identify Learning Objectives: From Analysis to Design
1490   The Learning Program Manager consolidates what they have identified from the review of
1491   available materials in order to identify learning objectives for the CPLP. Whether the Learning
1492   Program Manager is working on the entire Plan, designing a few new elements, or updating
1493   existing elements, this stage can be very useful in ensuring that the effort is closely aligned with
1494   identified organizational needs.

1495   3.4.1. Examples of Identifying Learning Objectives
1496   Consider these examples of identified training gaps and their associated learning objectives:
1497   Scenario 1: A recent analysis indicated that on-site, remote, and teleworking employees –
1498   including employees with privileged accounts – are using single-factor authentication (i.e., a
1499   password). The Chief Information Officer has approved the implementation of a multi-factor
