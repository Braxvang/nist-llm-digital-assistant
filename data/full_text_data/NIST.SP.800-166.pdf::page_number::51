NIST SP 800-166                                                   DERIVED PIV APPLICATION AND
                                                                  DATA MODEL TEST GUIDELINES

                      •   Suitable drivers have been loaded between the test system and an
                          instance of the reader.
 Test Scenario        1. Send the SELECT command with
                            • AID == 'A0 00 00 03 08 00 00 20 00 01 00'
                      2. Send the SELECT command without the version number
                            • AID == 'A0 00 00 03 08 00 00 20 00'
 Expected Result(s)   1. From Step 1, the command returns the application property template
                          with the status word '90 00' at the end. Check that the application
                          property template conforms to Table 3 of [SP800-73], Part 2, with
                          the exception that the returned AID is the AID listed in Section
                          B.1.1 of [SP800-157].
                      2. From Step 2, the command returns the application property template
                          with the status word '90 00' at the end. Check that the application
                          property template conforms to Table 3 of [SP800-73], Part 2, with
                          the exception that the returned AID is the AID listed in Section
                          B.1.1 of [SP800-157].
 Postcondition(s)     The Derived PIV Application is now the currently selected application.
                      The application security status of the Derived PIV Application is
                      established.

8.3.1.2 Default Selected Application

 Test Assertion       TA-08.03.01.02
 Purpose              Confirms that a default selected application exists on the hardware
                      token.

 Vendor               The vendor to provide information in its documentation stating which is
 Documentation        the application selected by default within its implementation.

8.3.1.3 Select when Derived PIV Application is Currently Selected

 Test Assertion       TA-08.03.01.03
 Purpose              Verifies that the Derived PIV Application is not deselected while the
                      currently selected application is the Derived PIV Application and the
                      SELECT command is sent with an AID of the Derived PIV Application.
                      The security status remains unchanged in this case.
