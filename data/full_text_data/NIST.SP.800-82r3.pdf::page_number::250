NIST SP 800-82r3                                               Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

Control Enhancement: (1) OT Discussion: Example compensating controls include employing
nonautomated mechanisms or procedures as compensating controls. Compensating controls
could include limiting remote access to a specified period of time or placing a call from the OT
site to the authenticated remote entity.
Control Enhancement: (2) OT Discussion: Encryption-based technologies should be used to
support the confidentiality and integrity of remote access sessions. While OT devices often lack
the ability to support modern encryption, additional devices (e.g., VPNs) can be added to support
these features. This control should not be confused with SC-8 â€“ Transmission Confidentiality
and Integrity, which discusses confidentiality and integrity requirements for general
communications, including between OT devices.
Control Enhancement: (3) OT Discussion: Example compensating controls include connection-
specific manual authentication of the remote entity.
Control Enhancement: (4) (10) No OT Discussion for this control.
Control Enhancement: (9) OT Discussion: Implementation of the remote access disconnect
should not impact OT operations. OT personnel should be trained on how to use the remote
access disconnect.
Rationale for adding AC-17 (9) to LOW, MOD, and HIGH baselines: As more OT systems
become accessible remotely, the capability to disconnect or disable remote access is critical to
managing risk and may be required to provide stable and safe operations.
Rationale for adding AC-17 (10) to MOD and HIGH baselines: The ability to authenticate
remote commands is important to prevent unauthorized commands that may have immediate or
serious consequences, such as injury, death, property damage, the loss of high-value assets, the
failure of mission or business functions, or compromise of sensitive information.

OT Discussion: When OT cannot implement any or all of the components of this control, the
organization employs other mechanisms or procedures as compensating controls in accordance
with the general tailoring guidance.
Control Enhancement: (1) OT Discussion: The implementation of authentication and encryption
is driven by the OT environment. If devices and users cannot all be authenticated and encrypted
due to operational or technology constraints, compensating controls include providing increased
