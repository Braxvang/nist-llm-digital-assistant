               verification key, and
           •   Verifies SIGA(M, TSP) using entity A’s public signature verification key.
       Note that it is irrelevant which signature verification is performed first; it is only
       important that both verifications are successful.
Because of the verifications performed in step 4, entity B knows (and/or has assurance
of) the following:
   a. M was assembled, and H was generated prior to the time indicated by the
      timestamp in the TSP obtained from the TTA; in particular, H was included in the
      timestamped_data that was signed by the TTA.
   b. M has remained unchanged since the time indicated by the timestamp in the TSP.
   c. SIGA(M, TSP) was generated at some point after the time indicated by the
      timestamp in the TSP.
   d. D was assembled after the time indicated by the timestamp in the TSP.
If a more precise time is required for the generation of SIGA(M, TSP), a second trusted
timestamp may be acquired (as specified in Section 4.4) that will provide assurance that
(M, TSP) had been signed by (at least) the time indicated in the second timestamp.

4.3.3 A Digital Signature on M is Provided to the TTA by Entity A
Entity A may provide the digital signature of M to the TTA when requesting a timestamp
as shown in Figure 3.

   1. Entity A sends SIGA(M) (and possibly other information) to the TTA in a
      timestamp request, i.e., user_supplied_info = SIGA(M), other_info. Note that the
      other_info may be Null.
   2. The TTA returns a TSP to entity A:
