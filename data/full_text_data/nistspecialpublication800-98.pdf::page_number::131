Next, two EPCglobal Class-1 Generation-1 specifications were developed: one for HF operation and one
for UHF operation. The HF specification defines a tag that operates at 13.56 MHz and has three main
features: an EPC, a 16-bit cyclic redundancy check, and a self-destruct feature. Its kill code is 24 bits. 94
There currently are no commercial products based on the EPCglobal Class-1 Generation-1 specification
for 13.56 MHz and nearly all references to EPC Class-1 Generation-1 tags refer to the UHF specification.
This is because 13.56 MHz offers operating ranges of up to one meter, which is not as useful in item
management as UHF, which can offer operating ranges of several meters. The UHF specification defines
a tag that operates at 860 MHz – 960 MHz and has an EPC identifier, an error detection code, and a kill
command. The EPC shall be a valid EPC that contains four subfields: a header, an EPC manager ID, an
object class, and a serial number. The error detection is performed using a 16-bit CRC. The kill
password is 8 bits. 95

The EPCglobal Class-1 Generation-2 standard is the only specification that became a standard ratified by
EPCglobal. 96 The previous Class-0 and Class-1 Generation-1 tags are expected to be phased out and
replaced by Class-1 Generation-2 tags. It describes tags with five major features: an EPC, a tag identifier
(TID), a kill command, an optional password-protected access control, and an optional user memory. The
tag identifier is used to identify the design and features of the individual tag. This is necessary since tags
may have optional or custom commands and features. CRCs are used in some communications and for
the EPC. There is a 32-bit kill password and a 32-bit access password. The standard also implements a
lock command which can temporarily or permanently make an area of memory write-protected or read-
and-write protected. 97 EPCglobal Class-1 Generation-2 tags also use a cover-coding method to obscure
information that is sent from a reader to a tag. Cover-coding is explained in Section 5.3.2.1.
