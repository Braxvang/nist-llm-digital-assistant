       NIST SP 800-63-4 ipd                                               Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022


1720   Authenticator Type
1721   A category of authenticators with common characteristics. Some authenticator types
1722   provide one authentication factor, others provide two.

1723   Authenticity
1724   The property that data originated from its purported source.

1725   Authoritative Source
1726   An entity that has access to, or verified copies of, accurate information from an issuing
1727   source such that a CSP can confirm the validity of the identity evidence supplied by an
1728   applicant during identity proofing. An issuing source may also be an authoritative source.
1729   Often, authoritative sources are determined by a policy decision of the agency or CSP
1730   before they can be used in the identity proofing validation phase.

1731   Authorize
1732   A decision to grant access, typically automated by evaluating a subjectâ€™s attributes.

1733   Authorized Party
1734   In federation, the organization, person, or entity that is responsible for making decisions
1735   regarding the release of information within the federation transaction, most notably
1736   subscriber attributes. This is often the subscriber (when runtime decisions are used) or
1737   the party operating the IdP (when allowlists are used).

1738   Back-Channel Communication
1739   Communication between two systems that relies on a direct connection (allowing for
1740   standard protocol-level proxies), without using redirects through an intermediary such as
1741   a browser. This can be accomplished using HTTP requests and responses.

1742   Bearer Assertion
1743   The assertion a party presents as proof of identity, where possession of the assertion itself
1744   is sufficient proof of identity for the assertion bearer.

1745   Binding
1746   An association between a subscriber identity and an authenticator or given subscriber
1747   session.

1748   Biometric Reference
1749   one or more stored biometric samples, templates, or models attributed to an individual
1750   and used as the object of biometric comparison. For example, a facial image stored
1751   digitally on a passport, fingerprint minutiae template on a National ID card or Gaussian
1752   Mixture Model for speaker recognition, in a database.
