                   digest signed attribute in      MessageDigest attribute in the signed attributes.
                   SignerInfo
TE06.01.12.02      10.1.1.9 Verify message         The tester shall validate the value of the
                   digest signed attribute in      MessageDigest attribute against the hash of the
                   SignerInfo                      concatenated content of the CHUID, excluding the
                                                   asymmetric signature field.
TE06.01.13.01      10.1.1.10 Verify PIV signer     The tester shall validate the presence of a pivSigner-
                   distinguished name              DN attribute in the signed attributes
TE06.01.13.02      10.1.1.10 Verify PIV signer     The tester shall validate the value of the pivSigner-DN
                   distinguished name              attribute is the same as the subject name that appears
                                                   in the certificate that signed the CHUID
TE06.01.14.01      10.1.1.11 Verify signature      The tester shall validate that the signature algorithm is
                   algorithm in SignerInfo         based on the expiration date of the certificate and is in
                                                   accordance with Table 3-4 of SP 800-78.
