Appendix A—Common Attacks Against Web Services

The following are common attacks targeting vulnerabilities often found in Web services. With exceptions
noted in brackets, Web services are subject to these attacks.

A.1       Reconnaissance Attacks

Reconnaissance attacks have the objective of collecting information about an application and its
execution environment to better target other types of attacks at that application. There are no standards
for preventing reconnaissance attacks. UDDI v3.0.2 provides some protection against reconnaissance
attacks by requiring identification, authentication and authorization of entities prior to granting access to
the registry. Other discovery standards, such as WSDL, can be accessed by any entity and the
information may be used in reconnaissance attacks. It is important to ensure that only authorized entities
can gain access to discovery information, to Web service interfaces, and to Web service messages in
transit.

A.1.1     Code Templates

The use of code templates and comments in code can provide information about the backend systems or
the development environment of the Web application. Specifically, the use of template code can prove to
be dangerous. This code can be obtained from many sources and can contain bugs that are easily
identified in the source code. This information can be used to exploit a specific vulnerability or narrow
the focus of vulnerability scans performed on the system.

A.1.2     Forceful Browsing Attack

Forceful browsing attacks attempt to detect Web services that are not explicitly publicized. An example
of forceful browsing is an intruder making repeated requests to the Web service with the URL patterns of
typical Web application components such as common gateway interface (CGI) programs. Depending on
error messages received, this technique can be used to gain information about the unpublicized Web
service.

A.1.3     Directory Traversal Attack

A directory traversal attack is closely related to a forceful browsing attack. Directory traversal occurs
when an attacker tries to access restricted files used by a Web service. Usually, the requested files reside
outside of the Web service host’s normal file system directory, but they can also include resources within
the service’s host server that are restricted from being accessed by the attacker. Directory traversal
attacks against Web services can be used to access the host server’s password files or to access
executables on the server to execute arbitrary commands.

A.1.4     WSDL Scanning

This type of attack is comparable to a directory traversal. Web Services Definition Language (WSDL) is
an advertising mechanism for Web services to dynamically describe the parameters used when connecting
with specific methods. These files are often built automatically using utilities. These utilities, however,
are designed to expose and describe all of the information available in a method. A knowledgeable
attacker may be able to locate Web services that have been removed from the pregenerated WSDL and
subsequently access them.
