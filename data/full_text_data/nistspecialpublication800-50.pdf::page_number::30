                                                                               NIST Special Publication 800-50



that need to be made. The needs assessment can help identify these additional needs – the gap between
what is currently being done and what is required.

Another important aspect of a needs assessment is the related IT security awareness and training program
requirements. For example, if awareness and training material will be presented utilizing computer-based
training (CBT) technology, a technical assessment should be conducted on the organization’s processing
platform (e.g., local area network, workstations, video cards, speakers) to determine if the existing
environment will support the new or expanded awareness and training program. Similarly, if the
organization plans to provide classroom training, the needs assessment should identify if adequate space
exists for an effective learning environment. There may also be Human Resources issues, including
employees with disabilities and special needs. Labor union issues may also arise where they previously
did not.

Once the needs assessment has been completed, information necessary to develop an awareness and
training plan is available. The plan should cover the entire organization and incorporate priorities
identified by the needs assessment.

3.3     Developing an Awareness and Training Strategy and Plan

Completion of the needs assessment allows an agency to develop a strategy for developing,
implementing, and maintaining its IT security awareness and training program. The plan is the working
document containing the elements that make up the strategy. The plan should discuss the following
elements:

     Existing national and local policy that requires the awareness and training to be accomplished;
     Scope of the awareness and training program;
     Roles and responsibilities of agency personnel who should design, develop, implement, and maintain
      the awareness and training material, and who should ensure that the appropriate users attend or view
      the applicable material;
