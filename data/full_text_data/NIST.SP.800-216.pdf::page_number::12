NIST SP 800-216                                                                      Federal Vulnerability

           Fig. 1. High-level federal vulnerability disclosure framework and information flow

These guidelines focus on assessing risk from identified vulnerabilities and encourage all
organizations throughout the Federal Government to collect and evaluate vulnerability
disclosures for maximum communication and accountability. Creating efficient and effective
vulnerability disclosure programs can help minimize the unintended exposure of government and
private information, the corruption of data, and the loss of services.
This document leverages the ISO/IEC standards in defining a framework for vulnerability
disclosure designed specifically for the United States Federal Government. Its implementation
specifies actors working at the federal, agency, and information system levels and how they
should coordinate in performing vulnerability disclosure. This guidance also aligns with and
leverages Binding Operational Directive [BOD20-01], which was released in 2020 and requires
federal agencies to publish vulnerability disclosure policies that enable users to report
vulnerabilities in Federal Government systems.
Figure 1 provides a high-level view of the framework that shows the major actors and
information flows. The two primary government entities are the Federal Coordination Body
(FCB) and the Vulnerability Disclosure Program Offices (VDPOs). Other actors defined in the
framework include the reporter, the public, and the external coordinator, all of whom are
described more thoroughly in later sections of this document.
The FCB is a group of cooperating members that collectively provide flexible, high-level
vulnerability disclosure coordination among government agencies. The group represents the
primary mechanism by which vulnerabilities should be tracked by the Government and for which
vulnerability advisories should be produced. Although some overlap may occur, FCB members
will have distinct areas of responsibility that reflect typical dividing lines in the Government
