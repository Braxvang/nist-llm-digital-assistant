                                                                     SECTION 6: RFID PRIVACY CONSIDERATIONS



While the concepts of privacy and PII are not new, RFID technology is an example of a technology that
introduces new complexity to the landscape of privacy considerations for several reasons. For example,
RFID technology increases the likelihood that someone can create PII through indirect means. RFID
technology creates opportunities to record, store, and process item-specific information related to business
transactions more easily than ever before. In addition, the breadth of items in everyday life that will be
incorporated into RFID systems is expected to increase in the coming years. The increase in the coverage
of information systems in our daily life combined with the increase of the level of detail of information in
those systems will likely create new opportunities for combining data elements to generate PII. Advances
in Internet search and data mining software also will facilitate the ability to capture PII from large
volumes of what previously might have been considered uncorrelated data. All of these trends can occur
even if PII is not recorded on tags themselves.

Several inherent features of RFID tags make enforcement of privacy controls more difficult than
traditional information technology systems. Organizations may face challenges enforcing privacy
policies when they cannot be coupled with effective security controls. RFID uses wireless
communication, which is more vulnerable to eavesdropping and other attacks than the wired systems on
which most traditional IT systems reside. In many applications, RFID tags will travel between
organizations and often will be found in public areas, which means they cannot benefit from physical
security commonly provided to most traditional IT systems. In general, RFID computing resources are
limited and are not capable of implementing sophisticated technical controls. As this document describes,
many techniques exist to mitigate these security and privacy risks, and these are expected to improve over
time. However, the economics of many RFID applications will require low cost tags with limited
functionality, which has significant implications for privacy protections. Finally, in many applications,
especially those involving passive tags, identifiers can live beyond the usefulness of the application for
which they were intended, but still may store PII or be used to generate PII when combined with other
data. While traditional IT systems have well-established policies and procedures for the retention and
destruction of data, destroying or disabling tags may be infeasible once they are outside the control of the
organization managing the RFID system.
RFID technology may introduce new privacy considerations that are not fully understood today. Privacy
regulation and principles evolve to meet the demands of new IT systems. For instance, technical
advances such as the Internet, electronic databases, and analytic system software have made the collection
and sharing of PII easier than it was in a world of paper files. RFID technology further extends the reach
of IT systems and the collection and sharing of information that might be considered personal. While
today RFID readers typically are located in designated locations to support a particular business process,
in the future readers may be ubiquitous and capable of supporting multiple objectives. For example,
today an RFID system might be implemented to provide access control to a facility using RFID-enabled
badges. Badge holders are unlikely to possess other tagged items. In the future, badge holders may
routinely carry a number of tagged items, and the badge reader may be used to scan them and create a
profile as well as authenticate the badge. The data collected might be shared with third parties for
justifiable business needs and with legitimate data sharing agreements. The systems might be
implemented with disclosure and consent, but may not be effective because individuals and organizations
cannot reasonably understand all the potential uses of the data or predict what type of transactions might
create PII through indirect inference. For these reasons, new privacy tools and concepts may need to be
developed to address the complexity introduced by RFID technology.
6.3   Privacy Principles

An organizationâ€™s privacy policy is most effective when it is based on principles that reflect a thorough
understanding of privacy-related risks. Well-formulated principles lead to a baseline set of privacy
requirements that can be further tailored to address organization-specific or application-specific
