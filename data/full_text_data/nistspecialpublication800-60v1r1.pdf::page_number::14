Security categorization is a prerequisite activity for the C&A process. The categorization should
be revisited at least every three years or when significant change occurs to the system or
supporting business lines. Situational changes outside the system or agency may require a
reevaluation of the categorization (i.e., directed mission changes, changes in governance,
elevated or targeted threat activities). For more information, see NIST SP 800-64, Security
Considerations in the Information System Development Life Cycle and NIST SP 800-37, Guide
for the Security Certification and Accreditation of Federal Information Systems.

                                            Implementation Tip
              It is important to routinely revisit the security categorization as the
              mission/ business changes because it is likely the impact levels or even
              information types may change as well.

2.5 Role in the NIST Risk Management Framework
Security Categorization is the key first step in the Risk Management Framework 5 because of its
effect on all other steps in the framework from selection of security controls to level of effort in
assessing security control effectiveness.
Figure 1, NIST Risk Management Framework, depicts the role of NIST security standards and
guidelines for information system security.
