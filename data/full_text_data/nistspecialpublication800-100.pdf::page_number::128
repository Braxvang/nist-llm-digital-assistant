CHAPTER 12                                          Security Services and Products Acquisition


12.3 Selecting Information Security Products
    As with security services, before selecting specific products, organizations should
review the current status of their security programs and the security controls that
are either planned or in place to protect their information and information systems.
Table 12-5 lists the general issues for consideration prior to the selection of
information security products.

             Table 12-5. Information Security Product Selection Considerations
    Consideration
                                                              Considerations
       Type
   Organizational         Identify the user community
                          Define the relationship between the security product and the organization’s mission
                          Identify data sensitivity
                          Identify an organization’s security requirements
                          Review security plan
                          Review policies and procedures
                          Identify operational issues such as daily operation, maintenance, and training
   Product                Determine total LCC (including acquisition and support)
                          Assess ease of use
                          Assess scalability
                          Identify interoperability requirements
                          Identify test requirements
                          Review known vulnerabilities
                          Test and implement relevant patches
                          Review product specifications against existing and planned organizational programs,
                           policies, procedures, and standards
                          Identify security critical dependencies with other products
                          Investigate the new product’s interactions with the existing infrastructure
   Vendor                 Determine whether the selection of a particular product will limit future security choices
                          Assess vendor experience and viability
                          Explore vendor history in responding to security flaws in its products


    To facilitate identification and review of these considerations, security program
managers may use a set of questions when considering security products for their
programs. Table 12-6 lists questions that are product-independent and should be
posed during the product selection phase. These questions are organized into three
categories: those that apply to the organization, those that apply to the product or
its operation, and those that apply to the vendor. It should be noted, however, that
these questions are neither exhaustive nor relevant in all circumstances.
Organizations should use these questions as a guide, and edit and supplement the
questions as required by their unique circumstances in addition to ensuring that their
decisions are consistent with their architecture and a well-established business case.

                 Table 12-6. Information Security Product Selection Questions
 Consideration
                                         Questions                                           Comments
     Type
Organizational       Is the anticipated user community identified?

Organizational       How many and what type of users does the
                      organization anticipate will use the security product?
Organizational       Is the relationship between this security product and
                      the organization’s mission performance understood
                      and documented?
