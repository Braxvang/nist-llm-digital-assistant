NIST SP 800-82r3                                           Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security

systems, transportation systems, physical access control systems, physical environment
monitoring systems, and physical environment measurement systems.
ICS consists of combinations of control components (e.g., electrical, mechanical, hydraulic,
pneumatic) that act together to achieve an objective (e.g., manufacturing, transportation of matter
or energy). The part of the system primarily concerned with producing an output is referred to as
the process. The control part of the system includes the specification of the desired output or
performance. Control can be fully automated or may include a human in the loop.
Section 2 provides an overview of various OT systems, such as SCADA, DCS, PLCs, BASs,
PACSs, and IIoT.

F.2.   Applicability
The purpose of this overlay is to provide guidance for securing OT systems. This overlay has
been prepared for use by federal agencies. It may be used by non-governmental organizations on
a voluntary basis.
Privacy is a risk consideration for OT systems. For additional guidance, refer to the NIST
Privacy Framework [PF]. The application of privacy in OT will depend on sector and
organizational risks, so controls that are exclusively related to privacy have not been included in
this OT overlay. Each organization will need to independently determine applicability. All
controls and control enhancements that only appear in the privacy baseline have been removed
from this OT overlay according to this rationale.

F.3.   Overlay Summary
Table 22 provides a summary of the controls and control enhancements from NIST SP 800-53,
Rev. 5, Appendix F [SP800-53r5] that have been allocated to the initial control baselines (i.e.,
Low, Moderate, and High) along with indications of OT discussion and OT tailoring. The table
uses the following conventions:
   •   Bold indicates controls and control enhancements with OT discussions.
   •   Underline indicates that this overlay has added a control to the baseline that is
       supplemental to the baselines provided in NIST SP 800-53B.
   •   Strikethrough indicates that a control or control enhancement has been removed from this
       baseline compared to the baselines provided in NIST SP 800-53B.
In the following example, OT discussion was added to Control Enhancement 1 of AU-4
(bolded). In addition, Control Enhancement 1 of AU-4 was added to the Low, Moderate (Mod),
and High baselines (underlined), compared with the NIST 800-53B baseline, which did not
include AU-4 Control Enhancement 1.
        AU-4   Audit Storage Capacity                 AU-4 (1)       AU-4 (1)        AU-4 (1)

Some controls and control enhancements are useful to many OT environments but are not
applicable across all OT sectors or architectures. Such controls may have additional OT
discussion. These will appear in the individual control tables. Controls and control enhancements
without baselines are not included in Table 22.
