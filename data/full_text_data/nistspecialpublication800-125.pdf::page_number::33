Appendix A—Glossary

Selected terms used in the publication are defined below.



Application virtusalization: A virtual implementation of the application programming interface (API)
that a running application expects to use.

Bare metal virtualization: A form of full virtualization where the hypervisor runs directly on the
underlying hardware, without a host operating system.

Disk image: A virtual representation of a real disk drive.

Escape: The act of breaking out of a guest OS to gain access to the hypervisor, other guest OSs, or the
underlying host OS.

Full virtualization: A form of virtualization where one or more operating systems and the applications
they contain are run on top of virtualized hardware.

Guest operating system: A virtual machine that runs an instance of an OS and its applications.

Guest tools: Mechanisms within hosted virtualization solutions that allow a guest OS to access files,
directories, the copy/paste buffer, and other resources on the host OS or another guest OS.

Host operating system: In a hosted virtualization solution, the OS that the hypervisor runs on top of.

Hosted virtualization: A form of full virtualization where the hypervisor runs on top of a host OS.

Hypervisor: The virtualization component that manages the guest OSs on a host and controls the flow of
instructions between the guest OSs and the physical hardware.

Image: A file or directory that contains, at a minimum, the encapsulated components of a guest OS.

Logical partitioning: The hypervisor allowing multiple guest OSs to share the same physical resources.

Native virtualization: See “bare metal virtualization”.

Operating system virtualization: A virtual implementation of the OS interface that can be used to run
applications written for the same OS.

Paravirtualization: A method for a hypervisor to offer interfaces to a guest OS that the guest OS can use
instead of the normal hardware interfaces.

Partitioning: Managing guest operating system access to hardware so that each guest OS can access its
own resources but cannot encroach on the other guest OSs’ resources or any resources not allocated for
virtualization use.

Physical partitioning: The hypervisor assigning separate physical resources to each guest OS.

Sandboxing: Isolating each guest OS from the others and restricting what resources they can access and
what privileges they have.
