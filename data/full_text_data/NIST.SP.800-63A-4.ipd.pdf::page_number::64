1703   10.   Equity Considerations
1704   This section is informative.
1705   This section is intended to provide guidance to CSPs for assessing the risks associated
1706   with inequitable access, treatment, or outcomes for individuals using its identity services,
1707   as required in Sec. 5.1.3. It provides a non-exhaustive list of potential areas in the identity
1708   proofing process that may be subject to inequities, as well as possible mitigations that can
1709   be applied. CSPs can use this section as a starting point for considering where the risks
1710   for inequitable access, treatment, or outcomes exist within its identity service. It is not
1711   intended that the below guidance be considered a definitive, all-inclusive list of associated
1712   equity risks to identity services.
1713   In assessing equity risks, a CSP starts by considering the overall user population served
1714   by its identity proofing and enrollment service. Additionally, the CSP further identifies
1715   groups of users within the population whose shared characteristic(s) can cause them to
1716   be subject to inequitable access, treatment, or outcomes when using that service. CSPs
1717   are encouraged to assess the effectiveness of any mitigations by evaluating their impacts
1718   on the affected user group(s). The usability considerations provided in Sec. 9 should also
1719   be considered when applying equity risk mitigations to help improve the overall usability
1720   and equity for all persons using an identity service.

1721   10.1. Equity and Identity Resolution
1722   Identity resolution involves collecting the minimum set of attributes to be able to
1723   distinguish the claimed identity as a single, unique individual within the population
1724   served by the identity service. Attributes are obtained from presented identity evidence,
1725   applicant self-assertion, and/or back-end attribute providers.
1726   This section provides a set of possible problems and mitigations with the inequitable
1727   access, treatment, or outcomes associated with the identity resolution process:
1728   Description: The identity service design requires an applicant to enter their name
1729   using a Western name format (e.g., first name, last name, optional middle name).
1730   Possible mitigations include:
1731      1. Analyzing possible name configurations and determine how all names can be
1732         accurately accommodated using the name fields
1733      2. Providing easy-to-find and use guidance to users on how to enter all names using
1734         the name fields
1735   Description: The identity service cannot accommodate applicants whose name,
1736   gender, or other attributes have changed and are not consistently reflected on the
1737   presented identity evidence or match what is in the attribute verifierâ€™s records.
1738   Possible mitigations include:

                                                     51
