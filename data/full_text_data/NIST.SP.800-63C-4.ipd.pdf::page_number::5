97    Reports on Computer Systems Technology

98    The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and
99    Technology (NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical
100   leadership for the Nation’s measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops
101   tests, test methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations, and technical
102   analyses to advance the development and productive use of information technology. ITL’s
103   responsibilities include the development of management, administrative, technical, and
104   physical standards and guidelines for the cost-effective security and privacy of other
105   than national security-related information in federal information systems. The Special
106   Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research, guidelines, and outreach efforts in
107   information system security, and its collaborative activities with industry, government,
108   and academic organizations.

109   Abstract

110   These guidelines provide technical requirements for federal agencies implementing digital
111   identity services and are not intended to constrain the development or use of standards
112   outside of this purpose. This guideline focuses on the use of federated identity and the
113   use of assertions to implement identity federations. Federation allows a given credential
114   service provider to provide authentication attributes and (optionally) subscriber attributes
115   to a number of separately-administered relying parties. Similarly, relying parties may use
116   more than one credential service provider. This publication will supersede NIST Special
117   Publication (SP) 800-63C.

118   Keywords

119   assertions; authentication; credential service provider; digital authentication; electronic
120   authentication; electronic credentials; federations.

121   Note to Reviewers

122   The rapid proliferation of online services over the past few years has heightened the need
123   for reliable, equitable, secure, and privacy-protective digital identity solutions.
124   Revision 4 of NIST Special Publication 800-63, Digital Identity Guidelines, intends to
125   respond to the changing digital landscape that has emerged since the last major revision
126   of this suite was published in 2017 — including the real-world implications of online
127   risks. The guidelines present the process and technical requirements for meeting digital
128   identity management assurance levels for identity proofing, authentication, and federation,
129   including requirements for security and privacy as well as considerations for fostering
130   equity and the usability of digital identity solutions and technology.
