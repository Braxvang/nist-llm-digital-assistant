      NIST SP 800-63-4 ipd                                             Digital Identity Guidelines
      December 2022


175           – What technologies or methods can be applied to develop a remote, unattended
176             IAL2 identity proofing process that demonstrably mitigates the same risks as
177             the current IAL2 process?
178           – Are these technologies supported by existing or emerging technical standards?
179           – Do these technologies have established metrics and testing methodologies to
180             allow for assessment of performance and understanding of impacts across user
181             populations (e.g., bias in artificial intelligence)?
182      • What methods exist for integrating digital evidence (e.g., Mobile Driver’s Licenses,
183        Verifiable Credentials) into identity proofing at various identity assurance levels?
184      • What are the impacts, benefits, and risks of specifying a set of requirements
185        for CSPs to establish and maintain fraud detection, response, and notification
186        capabilities?
187           – Are there existing fraud checks (e.g., date of death) or fraud prevention
188             techniques (e.g., device fingerprinting) that should be incorporated as baseline
189             normative requirements? If so, at what assurance levels could these be
190             applied?
191           – How might emerging methods such as fraud analytics and risk scoring be
192             further researched, standardized, measured, and integrated into the guidance in
193             the future?
194           – What accompanying privacy and equity considerations should be addressed
195             alongside these methods?
196      • Are current testing programs for liveness detection and presentation attack
197        detection sufficient for evaluating the performance of implementations and
198        technologies?
199      • What impacts would the proposed biometric performance requirements for identity
200        proofing have on real-world implementations of biometric technologies?
201   Risk Management
202      • What additional guidance or direction can be provided to integrate digital identity
203        risk with enterprise risk management?
204      • How might equity, privacy, and usability impacts be integrated into the assurance
205        level selection process and digital identity risk management model?
206      • How might risk analytics and fraud mitigation techniques be integrated into the
207        selection of different identity assurance levels? How can we qualify or quantify
208        their ability to mitigate overall identity risk?
209   Authentication and Lifecycle Management
