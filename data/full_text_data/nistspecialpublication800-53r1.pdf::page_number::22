CHAPTER THREE

THE PROCESS
SELECTION AND SPECIFICATION OF SECURITY CONTROLS




T
        his chapter describes the process of selecting and specifying security controls for an
        information system including: (i) defining the organization’s overall approach to managing
        risk; (ii) categorizing the system in accordance with FIPS 199; (iii) selecting and tailoring
the initial set of minimum (baseline) security controls; 31 (iv) supplementing the tailored security
control baseline as necessary based upon an organizational assessment of risk; and (v) updating
the controls as part of a comprehensive continuous monitoring process.

3.1 MANAGING RISK
The selection and specification of security controls for an information system is accomplished as
part of an organization-wide information security program that involves the management of
risk—that is, the risk to the organization or to individuals associated with the operation of an
information system. The management of risk is a key element in the organization’s information
security program and provides an effective framework for selecting the appropriate security
controls for an information system—the security controls necessary to protect individuals and the
operations and assets of the organization. The risk-based approach to security control selection
and specification considers effectiveness, efficiency, and constraints due to applicable laws,
Executive Orders, directives, policies, standards, or regulations. The following activities related
to managing risk (also known as the NIST Risk Management Framework) are paramount to an
effective information security program and can be applied to both new and legacy information
systems within the context of the system development life cycle and the Federal Enterprise
Architecture—
•    Categorize the information system and the information resident within that system based on a
     FIPS 199 impact analysis.
•    Select an initial set of security controls (i.e., security control baseline from Appendix D) for
     the information system based on the FIPS 199 security categorization and the minimum
     security requirements defined in FIPS 200; apply tailoring guidance from Section 3.3 as
     appropriate, to obtain the control set used as the starting point for the assessment of risk
     associated with the use of the system.
•    Supplement the initial set of tailored security controls based on an assessment of risk and
     local conditions including organization-specific security requirements, specific threat
     information, cost-benefit analyses, or special circumstances. 32
•    Document the agreed-upon set of security controls in the system security plan including the
     organization’s rationale for any refinements or adjustments to the initial set of controls. 33



31
  Tailoring guidance provides organizations with specific considerations on the applicability and implementation of
individual security controls in the control baselines (see Section 3.3).
32
  NIST Special Publication 800-30, Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems, provides guidance
on the assessment and mitigation of risk.
33
  NIST Special Publication 800-18, Guide for Developing Security Plans for Federal Information Systems, provides
guidance on documenting information system security controls.
