C.3.1.5 Workplace Policy Development and Management Information Type (Intra-Agency
Only)

Workplace policy development and management includes all activities required to develop and
disseminate workplace policies such as dress codes, time reporting requirements, telecommuting,
etc. The following security categorization is recommended for the workplace policy development
and management information type:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of workplace policy
development and management information on the abilities of responsible agencies to develop
and disseminate workplace policies such as dress codes, time reporting requirements, and
telecommuting. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of the majority of workplace
policy development and management information will result in a limited adverse effect on
agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for workplace policy development and management information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification to or destruction of workplace policy development
and management information depends primarily on the criticality of the information with respect
to agency mission capability, protection of agency assets, and safety of individuals. Typically,
the effects of modification or deletion of this information are generally limited.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
workplace policy development and management information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the workplace policy development and
management information. Generally, workplace policy development and management processes
are tolerant of reasonable delays.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
workplace policy development and management information is low.

C.3.2 Financial Management

Financial management involves the aggregate set of accounting practices and procedures that
allow for the accurate and effective handling of all government revenues, funding, and
expenditures. Confidentiality impacts associated with financial management information are
generally associated with the sensitivity of the existence of specific projects, programs,
and/or technologies that might be revealed by unauthorized disclosure of information. For
integrity, temporary successful frauds can affect agency image, and corrective actions are
