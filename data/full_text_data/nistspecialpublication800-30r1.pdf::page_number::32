CHAPTER THREE

THE PROCESS
CONDUCTING RISK ASSESSMENTS WITHIN ORGANIZATIONS




T       his chapter describes the process of assessing information security risk including: (i) a
        high-level overview of the risk assessment process; (ii) the activities necessary to prepare
        for risk assessments; (iii) the activities necessary to conduct effective risk assessments;
(iv) the activities necessary to communicate the assessment results and share risk-related
information; and (v) the activities necessary to maintain the results of risk assessments on an
ongoing basis. The risk assessment process 43 is composed of four steps: (i) prepare for the
assessment; (ii) conduct the assessment; (iii) communicate assessment results; and (iv) maintain
the assessment. 44 Each step is divided into a set of tasks. For each task, supplemental guidance
provides additional information for organizations conducting risk assessments. Risk tables and
exemplary assessment scales are listed in appropriate tasks and cross-referenced to additional,
more detailed information in the supporting appendices. Figure 5 illustrates the basic steps in the
risk assessment process and highlights the specific tasks for conducting the assessment.

                                                       Identify Threat Sources and Events


                                                           Identify Vulnerabilities and
                                                            Predisposing Conditions


                                                       Determine Likelihood of Occurrence


                                                         Determine Magnitude of Impact


                                                                 Determine Risk

   The intent of the process description in Chapter Three is to provide a common expression of the essential elements of
an effective risk assessment. It is not intended to limit organizational flexibility in conducting those assessments. Other
procedures can be implemented if organizations choose to do so, consistent with the intent of the process description.
44
  The four-step risk assessment process described in this publication is consistent with the general risk assessment
process described in NIST Special Publication 800-39. The additional steps and tasks result from the need to provide
more detailed guidance to effectively carry out the specific activities associated with risk assessments.
