       NIST SP 800-63B-4 ipd                                              Digital Identity Guidelines

1698   with the new authenticator and sent to that CSP. Alternatively, the endpoint associated
1699   with the new authenticator MAY obtain a binding code from the CSP, which is input to an
1700   authenticated endpoint and sent to the CSP.
1701   In addition to the requirements given in Sec. 6.1.2.1, Sec. 6.1.2.2, and Sec. 6.1.2.3 above
1702   as applicable, the following requirements SHALL apply when binding an external
1703   authenticator:
1704       • An authenticated protected session SHALL be established by the endpoint
1705         associated with the new authenticator and the CSP.
1706       • The subscriber MAY be prompted to enter an identifier by which they are known
1707         by the CSP on the endpoint associated with the new authenticator.
1708       • The CSP SHALL generate a binding code using an approved random number
1709         generator and send it to either the new authenticator endpoint or the authenticated
1710         endpoint approving the binding. The binding code SHALL have at least 40 bits
1711         of entropy if used in conjunction with an identifier entered on the previous step;
1712         otherwise a binding code with at least 112 bits of entropy SHALL be required.
1713       • The subscriber SHALL transfer the binding code to the other endpoint. This
1714         transfer SHALL be either manual or via a local out-of-band method such as a QR
1715         code. The binding code SHALL NOT be communicated over any insecure channel
1716         such as email or PSTN (SMS or voice).
1717       • The binding code SHALL be usable only once and SHALL be valid for a
1718         maximum of 10 minutes.
1719       • Following the binding of the new authenticator (or issuance of a certificate, in the
1720         case of PKI-based authenticators), the CSP SHOULD encourage the subscriber to
1721         authenticate with the new authenticator to confirm that the process has completed
1722         successfully.
1723       • The CSP SHALL provide clear instruction on what the subscriber should do in the
1724         event of an authenticator binding mishap, such as a button or contact address to
1725         allow a mis-bound authenticator to be quickly invalidated as appropriate. This
1726          MAY be provided in the authenticated session or in the binding notification
1727         described in Sec. 6.1.2.1, Sec. 6.1.2.2, and Sec. 6.1.2.3 above.
1728   Binding an external authenticator is a potentially risky operation because of the potential
1729   for the subscriber to be tricked into using a binding code by an attacker or supplying a
1730   binding code to an attacker. In some cases, QR codes obtained from a trusted source (such
1731   as from an authenticated session, especially when that authentication is phishing resistant)
1732   are considered to be more robust against such attacks, because they typically contain the
1733   URL of the CSP as well as the binding code. There is less potential for the subscriber to
1734   be fooled into entering a binding code at a phishing site as a result.
