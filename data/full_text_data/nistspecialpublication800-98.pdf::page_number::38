GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



 The Local ONS is a software component maintained and operated locally by EPCglobal Network
  members. The Local ONS provides the authoritative database in which all EPCs issued by a specific
  EPC Manager are indexed with the addresses of their EPCIS location.
When a member of the EPCglobal Network queries the network for information about an EPC, the Root
ONS utilizes the EPC Manager Number segment to direct the EPC query to the EPC’s data owner (i.e. the
EPC Manager). From there, the EPC Manager’s Local ONS utilizes the object class segment to direct the
query to the EPCIS that stores information for that EPC.

The ONS extends the Internet’s Domain Name System (DNS) to support resolution of an EPC with its
corresponding EPCIS. ONS EPC resolution works similarly to the name resolution that Internet users
employ whenever visiting Web sites or sending e-mail messages, but with some significant differences,
which are presented in Table 2-3.
