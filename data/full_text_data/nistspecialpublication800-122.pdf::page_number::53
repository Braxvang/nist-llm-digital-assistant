Appendix E—Glossary

Selected terms used in the publication are defined below.

Aggregated Information: Information elements collated on a number of individuals, typically used for
the purposes of making comparisons or identifying patterns.

Anonymized Information: Previously identifiable information that has been de-identified and for which
a code or other association for re-identification no longer exists.

Confidentiality: “Preserving authorized restrictions on information access and disclosure, including
means for protecting personal privacy and proprietary information.‖99

Context of Use: The purpose for which PII is collected, stored, used, processed, disclosed, or
disseminated.

De-identified Information: Records that have had enough PII removed or obscured such that the
remaining information does not identify an individual and there is no reasonable basis to believe that the
information can be used to identify an individual.

Distinguishable Information: Information that can be used to identify an individual.

Harm: Any adverse effects that would be experienced by an individual (i.e., that may be socially,
physically, or financially damaging) or an organization if the confidentiality of PII were breached.

Linkable Information: Information about or related to an individual for which there is a possibility of
logical association with other information about the individual.

Linked Information: Information about or related to an individual that is logically associated with other
information about the individual.

Obscured Data: Data that has been distorted by cryptographic or other means to hide information. It is
also referred to as being masked or obfuscated.

Personally Identifiable Information (PII): ―Any information about an individual maintained by an
agency, including (1) any information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual‘s identity,
such as name, social security number, date and place of birth, mother‘s maiden name, or biometric
records; and (2) any other information that is linked or linkable to an individual, such as medical,
educational, financial, and employment information.‖ 100

PII Confidentiality Impact Level: The PII confidentiality impact level—low, moderate, or high—
indicates the potential harm that could result to the subject individuals and/or the organization if PII were
inappropriately accessed, used, or disclosed.

Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA): “An analysis of how information is handled that ensures handling
conforms to applicable legal, regulatory, and policy requirements regarding privacy; determines the risks
and effects of collecting, maintaining and disseminating information in identifiable form in an electronic
