      NIST SP 800-92r1 ipd                                                 Cybersecurity Log Management
      October 2023                                                                        Planning Guide

508   Examples of possible changes include:
509      1. TS-1.1 examples: Adding a new type of computing device or application to the
510         organization; upgrading an application to a version with much more detailed log
511         generation capabilities
512      2. TS-1.2 examples: Migrating log storage from on-premises to cloud-based; adding a new
513         log analysis technology; improving logging infrastructure resilience
514      3. TS-1.3 example: Identifying and implementing a new use case; a passive DNS logging
515         system
516      4. TS-1.4 example: Complying with a new law going into effect next year that requires a
517         longer data retention period
518      5. TS-1.5 example: Transitioning some logging responsibilities to a parent organization or
519         a managed security service provider (MSSP)

520             TS-2, Define Target State for Log Generation
521   [Tasks]                                                              [Previous Play] [Next Play]
522   Summary: Define the log generation-related requirements and goals for each of your
523   organization’s cybersecurity log source types. The desired outcome is a comprehensive set of
524   prioritized requirements and goals for cybersecurity log generation that help define your
525   organization’s target state.
526   Tasks to perform include the following (not necessarily in order):
527      1. TS-2.1: For each type of log source, determine whether it should be required,
528         recommended, not recommended, or prohibited.
529      2. TS-2.2: Determine which types of events each log source should or must log and which
530         types of events each log source should not or must not log.
531      3. TS-2.3: Determine which data characteristics should or must be logged for each type of
532         event, including the log source identity and other metadata, and which types of data
533         characteristics should not or must not be logged.
534      4. TS-2.4: Determine whether the log source might intentionally or inadvertently capture
535         sensitive data, including personal information, passwords, private keys, and access
536         tokens.
537      5. TS-2.5: Determine how frequently each type of event should or must be logged.
538      6. TS-2.6: Determine how to handle log generation errors.
539      7. TS-2.7: Determine when logs should or must record cleartext data instead of or in
540         addition to encrypted data.
541      8. TS-2.8: Determine how clock synchronization should or must be performed for all log
542         sources.
543      9. TS-2.9: Determine what timestamp formats should or must be used for all log sources, as
544         well as supporting information to be captured (e.g., time zones).
