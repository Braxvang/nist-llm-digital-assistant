3.2   UICC Tools

      A few mobile forensics tools deal exclusively with UICCs. These tools perform a direct read
      of a UICC’s contents via a Personal Computer/Smart Card (PC/SC) reader, as opposed to an
      indirect read via the mobile device. The richness and scope of data acquired varies with the
      capabilities and features of the tool. The majority of UICC exclusive tools acquire the
      following data: International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI), Integrated Circuit Card ID
      (ICCID), Abbreviated Dialing Numbers (ADN), Last Numbers Dialed (LND), SMS messages,
      and Location Information (LOCI) [Aye12].

      Most tools provide additional information such as deleted SMS messages, properly rendered
      foreign language SMS and EMS messages. They also attempt to translate certain data such as
      country and network operator codes into meaningful names, and provide other facilities such
      as PIN administration.

      CSIM partitions on UICCs are being used with increasing frequency for LTE enabled mobile
      devices. At this time, few tools support the extraction of CSIM partition data as most only
