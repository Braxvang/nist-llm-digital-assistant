9.1 Step 1: Develop Contingency Planning Policy Statement
    When developing an IT contingency plan, the first step is to establish a
contingency planning policy within the organization. This policy may exist at the
department, agency, and/or program level of the organization. The statement should
define the organization’s overall contingency objectives; identify leadership, roles
and responsibilities, resource requirements, test, training, and exercise schedules;
and develop maintenance schedules and determine the minimum required backup
frequency.

9.2 Step 2: Conduct Business Impact Analysis

before an unacceptable impact is experienced.
    The impact may be something that materializes over time or may be tracked
across related resources and dependent systems (e.g., cascading domino effect).
The time identified is called a maximum allowable outage (MAO). Based on the
potential impacts, the amount
