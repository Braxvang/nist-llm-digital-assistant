Information Technology Security Training Requirements

        INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SECURITY TRAINING MATRIX                               — Cell 3.1 F
 Training Area: System Life Cycle Security               — Initiation
 Functional Specialty: Use

 Definition    —        The system life cycle is a model for building and operating an FT system
                        from its initial inception to its termination and disposal of assets. The
                        model includes six phases: Initiation, Development, Test and Evaluation,
                        Implementation, Operations, and Termination. Life cycle security is the
                        ensemble of processes and procedures which ensures data confidentiality, as
                        needed, as well as data and system integrity, and availability.


                        The initiation phase is the series of steps followed to ensure that security
                        requirements are considered and resolved as new information systems and
                        technologies are planned.

 Behavioral Outcome          —   Potential users are able to participate in needs analyses and
                                 understand the various points of view involved in setting the balance
                                 between IT security controls and system efficiency.
