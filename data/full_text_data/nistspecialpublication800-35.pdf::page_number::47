                                                                                               NIST Special Publication 800-35



Certification and Accreditation Services

The complexity and rigor of specific certification activities will vary depending on the system criticality,
information sensitivity, system exposure, and level of concern. C&A service providers can manage or
conduct a complete certification or prepare and assess individual documents in the final certification
package that is ultimately presented to the accreditor for approval.

C&A service activities can include any of the following:

     Developing a security test and evaluation (ST&E) plan and test procedures
     Conducting an ST&E
     Analyzing and reporting test results
     Developing and/or conducting a vulnerability assessment
     Developing a final vulnerability assessment report
     Technical support to the certifier or accreditor.
5.1.6      IT Security Product Evaluation

Two prominent security testing and evaluation programs are now in place to assess the security features
and assurances of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) products: National Information Assurance
Partnership 6 (NIAP) Common Criteria 7 (CC) Evaluation and Validation Scheme (CCEVS) and NIST
Cryptographic Module Validation Program 8 (CMVP). In both programs, a government body validates the
results of the testing and evaluation processes conducted by private sector laboratories to ensure that the
security standards are being applied correctly and consistently. When products cannot be found on
existing validated product lists, it may be possible that other parties have evaluated a particular product.
In many cases, it is not cost effective to conduct comprehensive security evaluations for the one-time use
of an IT security product unless that product will be used extensively throughout an organization and
therefore, products on the validated product list should be considered as an alternative. Additional
information regarding security assurance can be obtained from NIST SP 800-23, Guidelines to Federal
Organizations on Security Assurance and Acquisition/Use of Tested/Evaluated Products.

IT Security Product Evaluation Services

The NIAP CCEVS employs a network of private sector, accredited testing laboratories to independently
evaluate commercial security products in a variety of key technology areas against a set of security
requirements and specifications from the international standard, International Organization for
Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) 15408, Common Criteria for IT
Security Evaluation. The CMVP, also using independent, accredited, private-sector laboratories, focuses
on security conformance testing of cryptographic modules against FIPS 140-2, Security Requirements for
Cryptographic Modules, and related federal cryptographic algorithm standards.
