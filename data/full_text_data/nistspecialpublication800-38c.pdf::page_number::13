functions of the block cipher algorithm is designated as the forward cipher function. ∗ The
inverse of this process is called the inverse cipher function; however, the CCM mode does not
require the inverse cipher function.

The forward cipher function is a function on bit strings of a fixed bit length; the strings are called
blocks, and their length is called the block size. For CCM, the block size of the block cipher
algorithm shall be 128 bits; currently, the AES algorithm is the only approved block cipher
algorithm with this block size.

The CCM key, denoted K, is the block cipher key; the forward cipher function of the block
cipher with this key is denoted CIPHK. The bit length of K is denoted Klen.

5.2   Cryptographic Primitives

The CCM specification essentially combines two cryptographic mechanisms that are based on
the forward cipher function. One mechanism is the Counter (CTR) mode for confidentiality,
which is specified for general use in the first Part of this Recommendation [6]. The CTR mode
requires the generation of a sufficiently long sequence of blocks called the counter blocks. The
counter blocks must be distinct within a single invocation and across all other invocations of the
CTR mode under any given key, but they need not be secret. This requirement on the counter
blocks extends to the CCM mode. See [6] for further discussion of the generation of counter
blocks; see Section 5.4 below for an additional requirement on the counter blocks in CCM.

The other cryptographic mechanism within CCM is an adaptation of the cipher block chaining
(CBC) technique from [6] to provide assurance of authenticity. Specifically, the CBC technique
with an initialization vector of zero is applied to the data to be authenticated; the final block of
the resulting CBC output, possibly truncated, serves as a message authentication code (MAC) of
the data. The algorithm for generating a MAC in this fashion is commonly called CBC-MAC.
This Recommendation does not approve CBC-MAC as an authentication mode outside of the
context of the CCM specification; however, a variation of CBC-MAC is proposed for general
use in the second Part of this Recommendation [7].

The same key, K, is used for both the CTR and CBC-MAC mechanisms within CCM.

5.3   Data Elements

The data that CCM protects consists of a message, i.e., a bit string, called the payload, denoted P,
of bit length denoted Plen, and a bit string, called the associated data, denoted A. The associated
data is optional, i.e., A may be the empty string. ** CCM provides assurance of the
confidentiality of P and assurance of the authenticity of the origin of both A and P;
confidentiality is not provided for A.

A bit string called the nonce, denoted N, is assigned to the data pair to be protected, i.e., the

 For the AES algorithm, the forward cipher is explicitly identified in [2].

  The payload may also be empty, in which case the specification degenerates to an authentication mode on the
associated data.
