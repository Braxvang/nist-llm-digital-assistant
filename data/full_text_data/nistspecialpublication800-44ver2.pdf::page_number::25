                                                                 GUIDELINES ON SECURING PUBLIC WEB SERVERS



 Maintaining operational integrity of systems by conducting security tests and ensuring that designated
  IT professionals are conducting scheduled testing on critical systems.

3.2.4   Web Server and Network Administrators

Web server administrators are system architects responsible for the overall design, implementation, and
maintenance of a Web server. Network administrators are responsible for the overall design,
implementation, and maintenance of a network. On a daily basis, Web server and network administrators
contend with the security requirements of the specific system(s) for which they are responsible. Security
issues and solutions can originate from either outside (e.g., security patches and fixes from the
manufacturer or computer security incident response teams) or within the organization (e.g., the security
office). The administrators are responsible for the following activities associated with Web servers:

 Installing and configuring systems in compliance with the organizational security policies and
  standard system and network configurations

 Maintaining systems in a secure manner, including frequent backups and timely application of
  patches

 Monitoring system integrity, protection levels, and security-related events

 Following up on detected security anomalies associated with their information system resources

 Conducting security tests as required.

3.2.5   Web Application Developers

Web application developers are responsible for the look, functionality, performance, and security of the
Web content and Web-based applications they create. As mentioned in Section 2, threats are increasingly
directed at applications instead of the underlying Web server software and OSs. Unless Web application
developers ensure that their code takes security into consideration, the Web server’s security will be weak
no matter how well the server itself and the supporting infrastructure are secured. Web application
developers should ensure the applications they implement have the following characteristics:

 Supports a secure authentication, authorization, and access control mechanism as required.

 Performs input validation so that the application’s security mechanisms cannot be bypassed when a
  malicious user tampers with data he or she sends to the application, including HTTP requests,
  headers, query strings, cookies, form fields, and hidden fields.

 Processes errors in a secure manner so as not to lead to exposure of sensitive implementation
  information.

 Protects sensitive information processed and/or stored by the application. Inadequate protection can
  allow data tampering and access to confidential information such as usernames, passwords, and credit
  card numbers.

 Maintains its own application-specific logs. In many instances, Web server logging is not sufficient
  to track what a user does at the application level, requiring the application to maintain its own logs.
  Insufficient logging details can lead to a lack of knowledge about possible intrusions and an inability
  to verify a user’s actions (both legitimate and malicious).
