Agencies should decide whether the DRB charter will include any kind of performance
timetables or be bound by a service-level agreement (SLA) that defnes a level of service
to which the DRB commits.
The key elements of a Disclosure Review Board include:
    • A written mission statement and charter
    • Members who represent different groups within the organization, including leader-
      ship
    • The Board receives written applications to release de-identifed data
    • The Board reviews both the proposed methodology and the results of applying the
      methodology
    • Applications should identify the risks associated with data release, including re-
      identifcation probability, potentially adverse events that would result if individuals
      are re-identifed, and a mitigation strategy if re-identifcation takes place
    • Approvals may be valid for multiple releases but should not be valid indefnitely
    • Reliable records management for applications, approvals, and released data
    • Mechanisms for dispute resolution
    • Timetable or service-level agreement (SLA)
    • Legal and technical understanding of privacy
Example outputs of a DRB include specifying access methods for different kinds of data
releases, establishing acceptable levels of re-identifcation risk, and maintaining detailed
records of previous data releases that ideally include the dataset that was released and the
privacy-preserving methodology that was employed.
There is some similarity between DRBs as envisioned here and the Institutional Review
Board (IRBs) system created by the Common Rule26 for regulating human subject research
in the United States. For example, both IRB and DRB members require an understanding
of ethical principles, public policy and an understanding of how the collection and release
of data can cause harms to individuals. However, there are also important differences:
    • While the purpose of IRBs is to protect human subjects involved in human subject
      research, DRBs are charged with protecting data subjects, institutions, and – poten-
      tially – society as a whole.


26 The Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects or the “Common Rule” was published in 1991

 and codifed in separate regulations by 15 federal departments and agencies. The Revised Common Rule
 was published in the Federal Register (FR) on January 19, 2017, and was amended to delay the effective
 and compliance dates on January 22, 2018, and June 19, 2018 [165].
