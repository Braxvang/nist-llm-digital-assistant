Given a bit string X, the bit length of X is denoted len(X). For example, len(00010) = 5.

Given a bit string X and a non-negative integer s such that len(X) ≥ s, the functions LSBs(X) and
MSBs(X) return the s least significant (right-most) bits and the s most significant (left-most) bits,
respectively, of X. For example, LSB3(111011010) = 010, and MSB4(111011010) = 1110.

Given a positive integer s and a non-negative integer x that is less than 2s, the integer-to-string
function, denoted [x]s, is the binary representation of x as a string of bit length s with the least
significant bit on the right. For example, for the (base 10) integer 39, the binary representation
(base 2) is 100111, so [39] 8 = 00100111.

Given a (non-empty) bit string X, the string-to-integer function, denoted int(X), is the integer x
such that [x]len(X) = X. In other words, int(X) is the non-negative integer less than 2len(X) whose
binary representation is X. For example, int(00011010) = 26.

5.1   The Underlying Block Cipher and Key
The transformations of the variants of KW feature a block cipher as the main component; thus,
each variant is a mode of operation (mode, for short) of the block cipher. The key for the
underlying block cipher is called the key encryption key (KEK), denoted K.

For any given KEK, the underlying block cipher of the mode is a permutation, i.e., an invertible
transformation on bit strings of a fixed length. In this publication, the transformation is called the
forward transformation, and its inverse is called the inverse transformation. The strings are called
blocks, and the length of a block is called the block size. As part of the choice of the underlying
block cipher with the KEK, either the forward transformation or the inverse transformation is
specified as the designated cipher function, denoted CIPHK. The inverse of CIPHK is denoted
CIPH-1K.

For example, the forward and inverse transformations for the AES block cipher—called “cipher”
and “inverse cipher” in [3]—are informally known as the AES encryption and AES decryption
functions, respectively. If the designated cipher function for a key-wrap algorithm is chosen to be
the AES decryption function, then CIPH-1K will be the AES encryption function.

For KW and KWP, the underlying block cipher shall be approved, and the block size shall be
128 bits. Currently, the AES block cipher, with key lengths of 128, 192, or 256 bits, is the only
block cipher that fits this profile. For TKW, the underlying block cipher is specified to be TDEA,
and the block size is therefore 64 bits; the KEK for TKW may have any length for which TDEA
is approved; see [8].

The length of the KEK affects the security of the algorithms against brute force search, but this
length will not be explicitly indicated in the specifications. Methods for generating cryptographic
keys are discussed in [9]; the goal is to select the keys uniformly at random, i.e., for each
possible key to occur with equal probability.
