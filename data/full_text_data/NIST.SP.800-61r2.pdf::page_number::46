3.3.3   Identifying the Attacking Hosts

During incident handling, system owners and others sometimes want to or need to identify the attacking
host or hosts. Although this information can be important, incident handlers should generally stay focused
on containment, eradication, and recovery. Identifying an attacking host can be a time-consuming and
futile process that can prevent a team from achieving its primary goal—minimizing the business impact.
The following items describe the most commonly performed activities for attacking host identification:

 Validating the Attacking Host’s IP Address. New incident handlers often focus on the attacking
  host’s IP address. The handler may attempt to validate that the address was not spoofed by verifying
  connectivity to it; however, this simply indicates that a host at that address does or does not respond
  to the requests. A failure to respond does not mean the address is not real—for example, a host may
  be configured to ignore pings and traceroutes. Also, the attacker may have received a dynamic
  address that has already been reassigned to someone else.
 Researching the Attacking Host through Search Engines. Performing an Internet search using the
  apparent source IP address of an attack may lead to more information on the attack—for example, a
  mailing list message regarding a similar attack.
 Using Incident Databases. Several groups collect and consolidate incident data from various
  organizations into incident databases. This information sharing may take place in many forms, such
  as trackers and real-time blacklists. The organization can also check its own knowledge base or issue
  tracking system for related activity.
 Monitoring Possible Attacker Communication Channels. Incident handlers can monitor
  communication channels that may be used by an attacking host. For example, many bots use IRC as
  their primary means of communication. Also, attackers may congregate on certain IRC channels to
  brag about their compromises and share information. However, incident handlers should treat any
  such information that they acquire only as a potential lead, not as fact.
3.3.4   Eradication and Recovery

After an incident has been contained, eradication may be necessary to eliminate components of the
incident, such as deleting malware and disabling breached user accounts, as well as identifying and
mitigating all vulnerabilities that were exploited. During eradication, it is important to identify all affected
hosts within the organization so that they can be remediated. For some incidents, eradication is either not
necessary or is performed during recovery.

In recovery, administrators restore systems to normal operation, confirm that the systems are functioning
normally, and (if applicable) remediate vulnerabilities to prevent similar incidents. Recovery may involve
such actions as restoring systems from clean backups, rebuilding systems from scratch, replacing
compromised files with clean versions, installing patches, changing passwords, and tightening network
perimeter security (e.g., firewall rulesets, boundary router access control lists). Higher levels of system
logging or network monitoring are often part of the recovery process. Once a resource is successfully
attacked, it is often attacked again, or other resources within the organization are attacked in a similar
manner.

Eradication and recovery should be done in a phased approach so that remediation steps are prioritized.
For large-scale incidents, recovery may take months; the intent of the early phases should be to increase
the overall security with relatively quick (days to weeks) high value changes to prevent future incidents.
The later phases should focus on longer-term changes (e.g., infrastructure changes) and ongoing work to
keep the enterprise as secure as possible.
