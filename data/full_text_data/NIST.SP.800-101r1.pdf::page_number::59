Even esoteric network information found on a UICC may prove useful in an investigation. For
example, if a network rejects a location update from a phone attempting to register itself, the
list of forbidden network entries in the Forbidden PLMNs (Public Land Mobile Networks)
elementary file is updated with the code of the country and network involved [3GP07]. This
list is maintained on the UICC and is due to service being declined by a foreign provider. The
mobile device of an individual suspected of traveling to a neighboring country might be
checked for this information.

The items present on a device are dependent not only on the features and capabilities of the
mobile device, but also on the voice and data services subscribed to by the user. For example,
prepaid phone service may rule out the possibility for multi-media messaging, electronic mail,
and web browsing. Similarly, a contract subscription may selectively exclude certain types of
service, though the phone itself may support them.

Two types of computer forensic investigations generally take place. The first type is where an
incident has occurred but the identity of the offender is unknown (e.g., a hacking incident). The
second is where the suspect and the incident are both known (e.g., a child-porn investigation).
Prepared with the background of the incident, the forensic examiner and analyst may proceed
toward accomplishing the following objectives:

       Gather information about the individual(s) involved {who}.

       Determine the exact nature of the events that occurred {what}.

       Construct a timeline of events {when}.

       Uncover information that explains the motivation for the offense {why}.

       Discover what tools or exploits were used {how}.

In many instances the data is peripheral to an investigation or useful in substantiating or
refuting the claims of an individual about some incident. On occasion, direct knowledge,
