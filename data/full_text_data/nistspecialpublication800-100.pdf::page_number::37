CHAPTER 4                                                               Awareness and Training


mandate for formal education (provided by colleges or universities) and certification
of information security professionals, they are mentioned in this section since some
agencies include them as part of a comprehensive training solution for federal
employees.

4.2 Components: Awareness, Training, Education, and Certification
    An agency’s information security program policy should contain a clear and
distinct section devoted to agency-wide requirements for the awareness and training
program. Although security awareness and training is generally referred to as “a”
program, many organizations consider awareness and training to be two distinct
functions, each with separate purposes, goals, and approaches. Proper
implementation of these components (with consideration of options like education
and professional certification) promotes professional development, which leads to a
high-performance workforce.
   Requirements for the security awareness and training program should be
documented in the enterprise-level policy and should include:
       • Definition of security roles and responsibilities;
       • Development of program strategy and a program plan;
       • Implementation of the program plan; and
       • Maintenance of the security awareness and training program. 32

4.2.1 Awareness
   Security awareness is a blended solution of activities that promote security,
establish accountability, and inform the workforce of security news. Awareness
seeks to focus an individual’s attention on an issue or a set of issues. Awareness is a
program that continually pushes the security message to users in a variety of
formats.
   An awareness program includes a variety of tools, communication, outreach, and
metrics development.
       • Tools. Awareness tools are used to promote information security and inform
         users of threats and vulnerabilities that impact their agency and “personal”
         work environment by explaining the “what” but not the “how” of security, and
         communicating what is and what is not allowed. Awareness not only
         communicates information security policies and procedures that need to be
         followed, but also provides the foundation for any sanctions and disciplinary
         actions imposed for noncompliance. Awareness is used to explain the rules of
         behavior for using an agency’s information systems and information and
         establishes a level of expectation on the acceptable use of the information and
         information systems. Types of tools include:
         – Events, such as a security awareness day;
         – Promotional materials;
         – Briefings (program- or system-specific- or issue-specific); and
         – Rules of behavior.
       • Communication. A large part of an awareness effort is communication with
         users, managers, executives, system owners, and others. A communications
