1118   The CertInfo byte in the certificate data objects identified in this appendix SHALL be encoded as
1119   follows:
1120
         b8           b7          b6           b5           b4            b3                   b2                                b1
        RFU8         RFU7        RFU6         RFU5         RFU4         IsX509         CompressionTypeLsb                CompressionTypeMsb
1121
1122   CompressionTypeMsb SHALL be 0 if the certificate is encoded in uncompressed form and 1 if
1123   the certificate is encoded using GZIP compression. 29 CompressionTypeLsb and IsX509 SHALL
1124   be set to 0 for PIV Card Applications. Thus, for a certificate encoded in uncompressed form,
1125   CertInfo SHALL be 0x00. For a certificate encoded using GZIP compression, CertInfo SHALL
1126   be 0x01.

       29
         GZIP formats are specified in RFC 1951 and RFC 1952.
       30
         This is the recommended length. The certificate that signed the Images for Iris data element (tag 0xBC) can be stored in the CHUID or in the
       Images for Iris data element itself. For the latter, the “Max. Bytes” value quoted is a recommendation, and the signer certificate in
       CBEFF_SIGNATURE_BLOCK can exceed the “Max. Bytes.” Note that the use of separate content signing keys for biometric data and CHUID
       has been deprecated in FIPS 201-3. In future revisions, the CHUID and biometric elements will be signed with the same key. The content signing
       certificate will not be found in this data element but instead will be contained in the CHUID data element. Hence, the size will be as indicated in
       the table
