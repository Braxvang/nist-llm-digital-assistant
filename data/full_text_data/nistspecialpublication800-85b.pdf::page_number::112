Special Publication 800-85B                                     PIV Data Model Testing Specification


Test Steps            1. Set cardHandle := <<valid card handle>>
                      2. Set OID := <<CHUID (2.16.840.1.101.3.7.2.48.0)>>
                      3. Call pivGetData w/
                         • (IN) cardHandle
                              • (IN) OID
                              • (OUT) data
                      4. Extract the expiration date value from the CHUID (i.e.
                         Tag 0x35)
                      5. Set OID := <<Card Holder Facial Image
                         (2.16.840.1.101.3.7.2.96.48)>>
                      6. Call pivGetData w/
                         • (IN) cardHandle
                              • (IN) OID
                              • (OUT) data
                      7. Extract the SignerInfo->signatureAlgorithm field
                         contents.
Expected              1.      From Step 7: The signatureAlgorithm value is in accordance with
Result(s)                     Table 3-4 of SP80078
                      2.      From Step 4: The expiration date value is earlier than or equal to the
                              sunset date specified in Table 3-3 of SP80078 for the algorithm from
                              Step 7.


10.3.1.13 Verify digital signature

Purpose               Confirms that the signature in the SignerInfo corresponds to the signed
                      biometric
Reference(s)          1.      FIPS201, Section 4.2.2
                      2.      AS06.03.07
                      3.      AS06.03.16
Precondition          1.      A valid PIV card is inserted into the contact reader.
                      2.      A valid PC/SC connection exists between the test application and the
                              contact reader.
                      3.      The test application is currently connected to the card application
                              which is accessible through card handle.
                      4.      A valid card holder facial image is present on the PIV card.
                      5.      A valid CHUID is present on the PIV card.
