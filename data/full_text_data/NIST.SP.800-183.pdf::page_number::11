                                                                                               Weight is the degree to which a particular sensor’s data will impact an aggregator’s computation.
                                                                                               Basic properties, assumptions, recommendations, and general statements about weight include:

                                                                                                  2. A weight may be based on a sensor’s perceived trustworthiness, e.g., based on who is the

                                                                                                  4. It is not implied that an aggregator is necessarily a functionally linear combination of
