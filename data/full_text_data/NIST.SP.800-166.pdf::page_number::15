NIST SP 800-166                                                           DERIVED PIV APPLICATION AND
                                                                          DATA MODEL TEST GUIDELINES

3.      Test Guidelines Structure

3.1     Derived Test Requirements

Derived test requirements (DTRs) identify conformity conditions based on the normative
specifications in [SP800-157] and any other referenced supporting publications (e.g., [FIPS201],
[SP800-73], [SP800-78]).

In general, each DTR consists of the following elements:

      1. An Identifier, which is a code starting with ‘DTR’ (Identifiers follow a running sequence
         based on a logical grouping of requirements);

      2. A DTR Description, which is a statement taken/derived from the specification. These
         DTR descriptions include explicit statements using the words "shall," "must," and other
         terms used to signify the importance of the requirement; and

      3. For traceability, each DTR includes a reference to the section of [SP800-157], any other
         applicable specification such as [FIPS201], [SP800-73], [SP800-78] or [PROF] from
         which the DTR has been taken.

3.2     Test Assertions

A test assertion is an action or a set of actions that is performed to measure conformity to one or
more DTRs. Test assertions provide procedures to guide the tester in executing and managing the
test.

In general, each test assertion consists of the following elements:

      1. An Identifier, which is a code starting with ‘TA’ (Identifiers follow a running sequence
         based on categories of tests);

      2. The Purpose of the test;

      3. For the purpose of traceability, each test assertion makes specific references to the related
         DTR(s). Overall there is a many-to-many relationship between test assertions and DTRs
         (i.e., one test assertion can map to many DTRs and one DTR can be mapped to many test
         assertions);

      4. Vendor/Issuer Documentation, which specifies the information that is needed in order to
         be able to execute the test. In general, vendors submit documentation for testing the
         Derived PIV Application while issuers submit documentation for testing the Data Model
         of the Derived PIV Application;

      5. Precondition(s), which describe starting conditions and any prerequisites;

      6. Test Scenario, which explains the test procedure in steps;
