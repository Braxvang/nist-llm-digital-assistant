control plane instance is untenable in most enterprise environments and impossible in many
government ones (e.g., air-gapped systems).

       Enterprise Infrastructure Layer
The global control plane forms an integral part of the enterprise infrastructure layer. The
management plane that contains the various interfaces is hosted within the global control plane.
The roles of the global control plane and the management plane are as follows:
   •   The global control plane can be leveraged to perform the functions of individual control
       planes at the enterprise level rather than at the cluster level (e.g., issuing identities to all
       services in the enterprise by leveraging the enterprise Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
       system).
   •   The global control plane can also be used to shut down a specific control plane if all
       cluster nodes under the jurisdiction of that control plane have been compromised.
   •   The management plane provides the human-computer interfaces (e.g., user interfaces,
       such as command line interfaces and APIs) that enable enterprise-level systems to work
       by encoding organizational processes related to the usage of various tools (e.g., policy
       definition and evaluation tools, telemetry tools) at the lower layer.
In short, the management plane enables the definition and deployment of consistent and uniform
policies for all services throughout the enterprise. In addition to the global control plane and
management plane, the enterprise infrastructure for a ZTA consists of local control planes
(associated with service mesh instances) and a set of various types of proxies that form part of
their respective data planes. The proxies act as the policy enforcement points (PEPs) and have
three types:
   1. Ingress proxies enforce policies for entering user or service requests from client
      applications that originate outside of the cluster into any service within the cluster.
   2. Side-car proxies enforce policies between intra-cluster services.
   3. Egress proxies enforce policies for requests that emanate from any service within the
      cluster to an external application that is outside of the cluster.
Figure 1 shows a schematic diagram of the entire infrastructure layer for uniform (enterprise-
wide) policy deployment for realizing a ZTA.
