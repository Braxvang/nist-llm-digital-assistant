SECURE DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM (DNS) DEPLOYMENT GUIDE



Organizations that register and obtain an enterprise-level domain name often have to create child domains
to properly identify Internet resources associated with various functional units. For example, the owner of
the domain name example.com might create the subdomain shipping to create and identify resources
associated with the shipping department of the organization. Similarly, many other subdomains (in this
context, third-level domains) may be created to properly identify all of the Internet resources of the
organization. Often, however, in any one organization (that is, the owner of a second-level domain) there
will be many third-level domains but few Internet resources (Web servers, application servers, etc.) in
each of these domains. Hence, it is not economical to assign a unique name server for each of these third-
level and lower-level domains. Furthermore, it is administratively convenient to group all information
pertaining to an organization’s primary domain (i.e., a second-level or enterprise-level domain) and all its
subdomains into a single resource and manage it as a unit.

To facilitate this grouping, the DNS defines the concept of a zone. A zone may be either an entire domain
or a domain with one or more subdomains. A zone is a configurable entity within a name server under
which information on all Internet resources pertaining to a domain and a selected set of subdomains is
described. Thus, zones are administrative building blocks of the DNS name space just as domains are the
structural building blocks. As a result, the term zone commonly is used even to refer to a domain that is
managed as a standalone administrative entity (e.g., the root zone, the .com zone). This document uses the
term zone to refer to a resource entity that contains domain name information about one or more domains
and is managed as a single administrative entity. In other words, the zone is the configurable resource
inside a deployed name server installation that contains the domain name information.

With this overall knowledge of DNS infrastructure (name servers and resolvers), domain names, zones,
name servers of various levels (i.e., root servers and TLD servers) and resolvers, the name resolution
function can now be defined in more detail. When a user types the URL www.example.com into a Web
browser, the browser program contacts a type of resolver called a stub resolver that then contacts a local
name server (called a recursive name server or resolving name server). The resolving name server will
check its cache to determine whether it has valid information (the information is determined to be valid
on the basis of criteria described later in this document) to provide IP address for the accessed Internet
resource (i.e., www.marketing.example.com). If not, the resolving name server checks the cache to
determine whether it has the information regarding the name server for the zone marketing.example.com
(since this is the zone that is expected to contain the resource www.marketing.example.com). If the name
server’s IP address is in the cache, the resolver’s next query will be directed against that name server. If
the IP address of the name server of marketing.example.com is not available in the cache, the resolver
determines whether it has the name server information for a zone that is one level higher than
marketing.example.com (i.e., example.com). If the name server information for example.com is not
available, the next search will be for the name server of the .com zone in the cache.

If the complete search of the cache (as described above) does not yield the required information, the
resolving name server has no alternative but to start its search by querying the name server in the topmost
zone in the DNS name space hierarchy (i.e., the root server). If the cache search is successful, the
resolving name server has to query the name servers in one of the levels below the root zone (in this
context, either marketing.example.com, example.com, or .com). Because the set of iterative queries
starting from the root server subsumes the set starting from any of the lower-level servers, this section
describes the name resolution process starting from the query sent to the root server by the resolving
name server at the enterprise-level.

Contact with the root servers is enabled by a file called the “root hints” file that is usually present in every
name server in DNS. The root hints file contains the IP address of one or more of the 13 root servers. The
root server will contain information about the name servers for its child zones (i.e., TLDs). A TLD (e.g.,
.com) will contain name server information about its child zones (e.g., example.com). The name server
