Description:

A sequence {xi} of 512-bit pseudo-random numbers can be generated as follows:
Choose a 512-bit prime p, and a base g, as in the Digital Signature Standard (DSS). Choose an arbitrary
160-bit seed y. Let x1 = gseed mod p and xi+1 = g yi mod p, for i â‰¥ 1 where yi is the lowest-order 160 bits
of xi. Splicing together the {xi} will generate an n-bit sequence.

D.7            Secure Hash Generator (G-SHA1)

The input parameters to the G-SHA1 are fixed in code, but may be user modified. The length of the key,
keylen should be chosen in the interval [160, 512].

Input Parameters:

seedlen = 160
Xseed = 237c5f791c2cfe47bfb16d2d54a0d60665b20904

keylen = 160
Xkey = ec822a619d6ed5d9492218a7a4c5b15d57c61601

D.8            Blum-Blum-Shub (BBSG)

The input parameters to the BBSG are not fixed in code. They are variable parameters, which are time
dependent. The three required parameters are two primes, p and q, and a random integer s.

Input Parameters:

Two primes p and q such that each is congruent to 3 modulo 4. A random integer s (the seed), selected in
the interval [1, pq-1] such that gcd(s,pq) = 1. The parameters p, q and s are not fixed in code; thus, the
user will not be able to reconstruct the original sequence because these values will vary (i.e., they are
dependent on the system time). The input parameters have been fixed so the code will reproduce the same
results.
