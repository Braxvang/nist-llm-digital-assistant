language, and it is widely used with the mySQL database [NIST01]. The following are some important
points to consider when contemplating the deployment of PHP:

 The latest version of PHP available should be used because older versions have numerous security
  vulnerabilities.

 PHP provides a number of options that simplify development; some of these options (e.g., the
  register_globals option, which converts all input parameters into PHP variables and may override
  values in the PHP script) can make it more difficult for novices to develop secure programs.

 Much of the freely available third-party code for PHP is poorly written from a security perspective. 43

6.4.3    Server-Side Content Generator Security Considerations

When examining or writing an active content executable or script, consider the following:

 The executable code should be as simple as possible. The longer or more complex it is, the more
  likely it will have problems.

 The executable code’s ability to read and write programs should be limited. Code that reads files may
  inadvertently violate access restrictions or pass sensitive system information. Code that writes files
  may modify or damage documents or introduce Trojan horses.

 The code’s interaction with other programs or applications should be analyzed to identify security
  vulnerabilities. For example, many CGI scripts send e-mails in response to form input by opening up
  a connection with the sendmail program. Ensure this interaction is performed in a secure manner.

 On Linux/Unix hosts, the code should not run with suid (set-user-id).

 The code should use explicit path names when invoking external programs. Relying on the PATH
  environment variable to resolve partial path names is not recommended.

 Web servers should be scanned periodically for vulnerabilities, even if they do not employ active
  content (see Section 9.4.1). Network security scanners may detect vulnerabilities in the Web server,
  OS, or other services running on the Web server. Web application vulnerability scanners specifically
  scan for content generator vulnerabilities (see Appendix C for more information).

 Web content generation code should be scanned and/or audited (depending on the sensitivity of the
  Web server and its content). Commercially available tools can scan .NET or Java code. A number of
  commercial entities offer code review services.

 Web content generation code should be developed following current recommended practices. 44

 For data entry forms, determine a list of expected characters and filter out unexpected characters from
  input data entered by a user before processing a form. For example, on most forms, expected data

     There are a number of reasons for the poor security of many PHP scripts. The most obvious is that many scripts are written
     without concern for security. In addition, because of the relative ease of coding PHP scripts, many novices who have little
     knowledge of secure programming create and often freely distribute poorly written scripts.
