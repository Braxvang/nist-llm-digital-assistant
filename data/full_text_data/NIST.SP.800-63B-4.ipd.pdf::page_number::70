1962   8.3. Authenticator Recovery
1963   The weak point in many authentication mechanisms is the process followed when a
1964   subscriber loses control of one or more authenticators and needs to replace them. In many
1965   cases, the options remaining available to authenticate the subscriber are limited, and
1966   economic concerns (e.g., cost of maintaining call centers) motivate the use of inexpensive,
1967   and often less secure, backup authentication methods. To the extent that authenticator
1968   recovery is human-assisted, there is also the risk of social engineering attacks.
1969   To maintain the integrity of the authentication factors, it is essential that it not be possible
1970   to leverage an authentication involving one factor to obtain an authenticator of a different
1971   factor. For example, a memorized secret must not be usable to obtain a new list of look-up
1972   secrets.

1973   8.4. Session Attacks
1974   The above discussion focuses on threats to the authentication event itself, but hijacking
1975   attacks on the session following an authentication event can have similar security impacts.
1976   The session management guidelines in Sec. 7 are essential to maintain session integrity
1977   against attacks, such as XSS. In addition, it is important to sanitize all information to be
1978   displayed [OWASP-XSS-prevention] to ensure that it does not contain executable content.
1979   These guidelines also recommend that session secrets be made inaccessible to mobile
1980   code in order to provide extra protection against exfiltration of session secrets.
1981   Another post-authentication threat, cross-site request forgery (CSRF), takes advantage of
1982   usersâ€™ tendency to have multiple sessions active at the same time. It is important to embed
1983   and verify a session identifier into web requests to prevent the ability for a valid URL or
1984   request to be unintentionally or maliciously activated.
