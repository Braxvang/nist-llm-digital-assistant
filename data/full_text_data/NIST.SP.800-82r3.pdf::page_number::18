NIST SP 800-82r3                                                              Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023



Executive Summary
This document provides guidance for establishing secure operational technology (OT) 1 while
addressing OT’s unique performance, reliability, and safety requirements. OT encompasses a
broad range of programmable systems and devices that interact with the physical environment
(or manage devices that interact with the physical environment). These systems and devices
detect or cause a direct change through the monitoring and/or control of devices, processes, and
events. Examples include industrial control systems (ICS), building automation systems,
transportation systems, physical access control systems, physical environment monitoring
systems, and physical environment measurement systems. This document provides an overview
of OT and typical system topologies, identifies common threats and vulnerabilities to these
systems, and recommends security countermeasures to mitigate the associated risks.
OT is vital to the operation of U.S. critical infrastructures, which are often highly interconnected,
mutually dependent systems. It is important to note that while federal agencies operate many of
the Nation’s critical infrastructures, many others are privately owned and operated. Additionally,
critical infrastructures are often referred to as a “system of systems” because of the
interdependencies that exist between various industrial sectors and interconnections between
business partners.
Initially, OT had little resemblance to traditional information technology (IT) systems because
OT systems were isolated, ran proprietary control protocols, and used specialized hardware and
software. As OT systems adopt IT solutions to enable corporate business systems connectivity
and remote access capabilities and are designed and implemented using industry-standard
computers, operating systems (OSs), and network protocols, they have begun to resemble IT
systems. This integration supports new IT capabilities, but it provides significantly less isolation
for OT from the outside world than predecessor systems, creating a greater need to secure OT
systems. The increasing use of wireless networking places OT implementations at greater risk
from adversaries who are in relatively close physical proximity but do not have direct physical
access to the equipment. While security solutions have been designed to deal with these issues in
typical IT systems, special precautions must be taken when introducing these same solutions to
OT environments. In some cases, new security solutions that are tailored to the OT environment
are needed.
Although some characteristics are similar, OT also has characteristics that differ from traditional
information processing systems. Many of these differences stem from the fact that logic
executing in OT has a direct effect on the physical world. Some of these characteristics include
significant risk to the health and safety of human lives, serious damage to the environment, and
severe financial issues, such as production losses, negative impacts to the Nation’s economy, and
the compromise of proprietary information. OT has unique performance and reliability
requirements and often uses OSs and applications that may be considered unconventional to
typical IT personnel. Furthermore, the goals of safety and efficiency sometimes conflict with
security in the design and operation of OT systems.
