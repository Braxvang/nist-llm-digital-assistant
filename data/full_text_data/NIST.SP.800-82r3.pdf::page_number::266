OT Discussion: Many site-wide supervisory or optimization servers (i.e., Level 3 and above of
the Purdue model) can be supported from an alternate processing site. It is likely not feasible for
control systems or field devices, such as sensors or final elements (i.e., Level 1 and 0 of the
Purdue model), to be made available from an alternate processing site.
Control Enhancement: (1) (2) (3) (4) No OT Discussion for this control.
