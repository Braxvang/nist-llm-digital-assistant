GUIDE TO COMPUTER SECURITY LOG MANAGEMENT



       The characteristics of common attack techniques, especially how the use of these techniques
        might be recorded on each system
       The software needed to perform analysis, such as log viewers, log reduction scripts, and database
        query tools.
Organizations often require system-level administrators to report the results of their analysis to
infrastructure administrators. This helps to ensure that the system-level administrators are performing log
analysis on a regular basis. The information in the reports is also of value to the infrastructure
administrators because they can review it and identify patterns of activity that cannot be seen at the
individual system level. For example, infrastructure administrators could see that the same attack was
attempted on several systems. Infrastructure administrators can also disseminate information learned
from analysis reports to the system-level administrators so that they can more easily recognize similar
activity on their own systems. Infrastructure administrators should also create reports that summarize the
results of their own analysis activity, and possibly also summarize the reports from system-level
administrators. Regularly sharing the highlights of reports with management, particularly the problems
that were identified and corrected as a result of analysis efforts, demonstrates the benefits of log
management to the organization’s management.

5.3     Respond to Identified Events

During their log analysis, infrastructure and system-level administrators may identify events of
significance, such as incidents and operational problems, that necessitate some type of response. When
an administrator identifies a likely computer security incident, as defined by the organization’s incident
response policies, the administrator should follow the organization’s incident response procedures to
ensure that it is addressed appropriately. Examples of computer security incidents include a host being
infected by malware and a person gaining unauthorized access to a host. Administrators should perform
their own responses to non-incident events, such as minor operational problems (e.g., misconfiguration of
host security software). Some organizations require system-level administrators to report incidents and
logging-related operational problems to infrastructure administrators so that the infrastructure
administrators can better identify additional instances of the same activities and patterns that cannot be
seen at the individual system level.

Infrastructure and system-level administrators should also be prepared to assist incident response teams
with their efforts. For example, when an incident occurs, affected system-level administrators may be
asked to review their systems’ logs for particular signs of malicious activity or to provide copies of their
logs to incident handlers for further analysis. Administrators should also be prepared to alter their
logging configurations as part of a response. Adverse events such as worms often cause unusually large
numbers of events to be logged. This can cause various negative impacts, such as slowing system
performance, overwhelming logging processes, and overwriting recent log entries. Analysts may not be
able to see other events of significance because their records are hidden among all of the other log entries.
Accordingly, administrators may need to reconfigure logging for the short term, long term, or
permanently, depending on the source of the log data, to prevent it from overwhelming the system and the
logs. Administrators may also need to adjust logging to capture more data as part of a response effort,
such as collecting additional information on a particular type of activity. To identify similar incidents,
especially in the short term, administrators may need to perform additional log monitoring and analysis,
such as more closely examining the types of logging sources that recorded pertinent information on the
initial incident.
