                 Measure 7: Configuration Management (CM) (program-level)
         Field                                                  Data
Measure ID          Configuration Changes Measure 1 (or a unique identifier to be filled out by the
                    organization)
Goal                •   Strategic Goal: Accelerate the development and use of an electronic information
                        infrastructure.
                    •   Information Security Goal: Establish and maintain baseline configurations and
                        inventories of organizational information systems (including hardware, software,
                        firmware, and documentation) throughout the respective system development life
                        cycles.
Measure             Percentage (%) approved and implemented configuration changes identified in the latest
                    automated baseline configuration
                    NIST SP 800-53 Controls – CM-2: Baseline Configuration and CM-3: Configuration
                    Change Control
Measure Type        Implementation
Formula             (Number of approved and implemented configuration changes identified in the latest
                    automated baseline configuration/total number of configuration changes identified
                    through automated scans) *100
Target              This should be a high percentage defined by the organization.
Implementation      1. Does the organization manage configuration changes to information systems using an
Evidence            organizationally approved process (CM-3)?

                          Yes                     No

                    2. Does the organization use automated scanning to identify configuration changes that
                    were implemented on its systems and networks (CM-2, Enhancement 2)?

                          Yes                     No

                    3. If yes, how many configuration changes were identified through automated scanning
                    over the last reporting period (CM-3)? _____
                    4. How many change control requests were approved and implemented over the last
                    reporting period (CM 3)? _____
Frequency           Collection Frequency: Organization-defined (example: quarterly)
                    Reporting Frequency: Organization-defined (example: annually)
Responsible         •   Information Owner: Organization-defined (example: Configuration Manager)
Parties
                    •   Information Collector: Organization-defined (example: Information System Security
                        Officer (ISSO), System Owner, System Administrator)
                    •   Information Customer: Chief Information Officer (CIO), Information System
                        Security Officer (ISSO), Senior Agency Information Security Officer (SAISO) (e.g.,
                        Chief Information Security Officer [CISO]), Authorizing Official [AO],
                        Configuration Control Board)
Data Source         System security plans, configuration management database, security tool logs
Reporting           Pie chart comparing the percentage of approved and implemented changes documented in
Format              the latest baseline configuration versus the percentage of changes not documented in the
                    latest baseline configuration
