channels using FIPS-compliant encryption (e.g., VPNs, Secure Sockets Layer [SSL] protocol), and
providing information through delivered or mailed hard or soft copies.

7.4.4    Data Destruction

When assessment data is no longer needed, the assessment systems, hard copy documentation, and media
should be appropriately sanitized. NIST SP 800-88, Guidelines for Media Sanitization 35 divides media
sanitization into four categories:

      Disposal: the act of discarding media with no other sanitization considerations. This is most
       often done by recycling paper that contains nonconfidential information, but may also include
       other media.
      Clearing: a level of media sanitization that would protect information confidentiality against a
       robust keyboard attack. Simple deletion of items does not suffice for clearing. Clearing must
       keep information from being retrieved by data, disk, or file recovery utilities, and must be
       resistant to keystroke recovery attempts executed from standard input devices and data
       scavenging tools. Overwriting is an example of an acceptable method for clearing media.
      Purging: a media sanitization process that protects information confidentiality against a
       laboratory attack. 36 For some media, clearing media does not suffice for purging. Examples of
       alternatives to clearing media are executing the firmware Secure Erase command (for Advanced
       Technology Attachment [ATA] drives only) and degaussing 37 .
      Destruction: physical obliteration of media to render it no longer usable for its intended purpose
       and making the data it contains no longer retrievable. Physical destruction is possible through a
       variety of methods, including disintegration, incineration, pulverizing, shredding, and melting.
Organizations should maintain a policy on their sanitization requirements for assessment systems. NIST
SP 800-88 presents a decision-flow diagram to assist organizations in determining which sanitization
method is most applicable for their circumstances. An assessment plan or ROE may also specify
destruction requirements for particular tests.

Third-party assessors should ensure that they understand the organizationâ€™s requirements for sanitization,
as policy may differ between organizations and possibly among divisions within the same organization.
For example, some organizations prohibit third-party assessors from having any access to assessment data
once their final reports have been submitted. In such cases, a qualified individual from the organization
being assessed should verify that appropriate sanitization measures have been carried out.

     A laboratory attack would involve an attacker with the resources and knowledge to use nonstandard systems to conduct data
     recovery attempts on media outside the normal operating environment. This type of attack involves using signal processing
     equipment and specially trained personnel.

     Degaussing is exposing the magnetic media to a strong magnetic field to disrupt the recorded magnetic domains.
