SP 800-152                                                   A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


5 Roles and Responsibilities
An FCKMS could interface with humans who are performing specific management, user,
and/or operator roles. Each role should have specific requirements for a person that will be
authorized to perform it. Each person that is authorized to perform a role should be provided
access to a set of key and metadata management functions that will assist in carrying out the
responsibilities of the role. In order to be authorized to perform a role and its associated
functions, each entity must be authenticated; note that this is a requirement for all FCKMS
impact-levels. This requirement may be satisfied by identity-based authentication at all
impact-levels or role-based authentication at the Low impact-level. Also, note that role-based
authentication is a less restrictive requirement than personal accountability, which is
addressed in Section 4.8.

Examples of FCKMS roles include, but are not limited to, the following. A description of
each role is provided in the Framework.

   a) System Authority,
   b) System Administrator,
   c) Cryptographic Officer,
   d) Domain Authority,
   e) Key Custodian,
   f) Key Owner,
   g) CKMS User,
   h) Audit Administrator,
   i) Registration Agent,
   j) Key-Recovery Agent, and
   k) CKMS Operator.
Multiple individuals could be assigned to perform a role, and/or one person could be
authorized to perform multiple roles. The same individual should not perform certain roles
indefinitely. It is prudent to periodically (and perhaps randomly) rotate individuals among
different roles to minimize the likelihood of long-term abuses. All persons should be properly
trained for the roles that they are assigned to perform. Highly sensitive roles may require
multiple individuals to perform the role (e.g., multiparty control).

FR:5.1 The CKMS design shall specify each role employed by the CKMS, the
responsibilities of each role, and how entities are assigned to each role.

FR:5.2 The CKMS design shall specify the key and metadata management functions (see
Section 6.4) that can be used by entities fulfilling each role employed by the CKMS.

FR:5.3 The CKMS design shall specify which roles require role separation.
