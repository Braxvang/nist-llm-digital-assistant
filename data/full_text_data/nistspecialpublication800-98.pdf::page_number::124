GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



the spread of disease. Tags on patients were embedded in hospital admission wrist bracelets. Tags for
staff and hospital personnel were embedded in their hospital identification cards, which are typically worn
around the neck on a lanyard or on a retractable leash attached to the belt.

8.1.4   Phase 4: Operations/Maintenance

The operation of the new systems proceeded as expected. CRC experienced a reduction in asset losses
resulting from better tracking and some personnel mentioned that the system significantly reduced
paperwork. The system also provided benefits to CRC research. In one case, patients in separate rooms
under the supervision of different medical teams contracted a particular illness. These facts initially led
the CRC epidemiologists to believe that an airborne pathogen caused the disease. Subsequent analysis of
the RFID data showed that a medicine cart handled by several nurses’ aides was the likely infection
vector by transferring the disease from patient to patient through dermal contact.

The operations phase also included the management of the RFID system. Hospital IT personnel received
pages when systems were malfunctioning and took corrective actions as necessary. Recently, audit
records showing excessive numbers of malformed read transactions led to the detection of an
unauthorized radio in the proximity of one of the readers.

8.1.5   Phase 5: Disposition

The new RFID system has not been in operation long enough to encounter significant disposition issues,
but the CRC has instituted procedures for the disposal of RFID tags. The passive tags on disposable
items are discarded along with the item. In the case of tags on blood, urine, and stool samples, the tags
are disposed as hazardous medical waste. Semi-active tags on patients are disposed of as medical waste
upon death or discharge. Data did not need to be removed from the tags prior to disposal because the tags
only stored an identifier. Semi-active tags on physical assets are reassigned when the asset is retired. If a
tag is malfunctioning, it is physically disabled to ensure inoperability and discarded with office waste.

8.1.6   Summary and Evaluation

The system involving read-only passive and semi-active tags is helping reduce costs and improve
research. Security risks were identified early, and risks were managed to an acceptable level. Table 8-1
presents a summary of how each risk identified in the risk assessment was subsequently addressed.
