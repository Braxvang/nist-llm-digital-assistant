    SP 800-57-part 1: Recommendation for Key Management – Part 1: General (Revised,
    July 2012,
     http://www.csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html
    SP 800-57 – Part 1 focuses on issues involving the management of cryptographic
    keys: their generation, use, and eventual destruction. Related topics, such as
    algorithm selection and appropriate key size, cryptographic policy, and cryptographic
    module selection, are also included.

37. [SP 800-57-part3]
    SP 800-57-part 3: Recommendation for Key Management – Part 3: Application
    Specific Key Management Guidance, December 2009,
     http://www.csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html
    SP 800-57-part 3 is intended primarily to help system administrators and system
    installers adequately secure applications in common use. The guide also provides
    information for end users regarding application options left under their control in
    normal use of the application. Recommendations are given for a selected set of
    applications.

38. [SP 800-67]
    SP 800-67: Recommendation for the Triple Data Encryption Algorithm (TDEA) Block
    Cipher, January 2012, http://www.csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html.
    SP 800-67 specifies the Triple Data Encryption Algorithm (TDEA), including its
    primary component cryptographic engine, the Data Encryption Algorithm (DEA).
    Compliance with this Recommendation is validated under the NIST Cryptographic
    Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP).

39. [SP 800-89]
    SP 800-89: Recommendation for Obtaining Assurances for Digital Signature
    Applications, November 2006,
    http://www.csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html.
    SP 800-89 specifies methods for obtaining the assurances necessary for valid digital
    signatures: assurance of domain parameter validity, assurance of public key validity,
    assurance that the key pair owner actually possesses the private key, and assurance of
    the identity of the key pair owner.

40. [SP 800-90A]
    SP 800-90A: Recommendation for Random Number Generation Using Deterministic
    Random Bit Generators (Revised), January 2012,
    http://www.csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html.
    SP 800-90A specifies mechanisms for the generation of random bits using
    deterministic methods. The random bits may then be used directly or converted to
