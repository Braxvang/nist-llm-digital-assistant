NIST SP 800-156                                                  REPRESENTATION OF PIV CHAIN-OF-TRUST
                                                                               FOR IMPORT AND EXPORT


    <FingerprintsOffCardComparisonRepresentation>:
          This element is mandatory and occurs only once. The
          <FingerprintsOffCardComparisonRepresentation> element contains the
          fingerprint data collected during the enrollment process and is used for off-
          card comparison, as documented in [SP800-76]. The
          <FingerprintsOffCardComparisonRepresentation> element includes the
          CBEFF Header, the INCITS 378 Minutiae, and the CBEFF signature. The
          data is provided in an xs:base64Binary format.

    <FingerprintsOnCardComparisonRepresentation>:
          This element is optional and if used occurs once.
          <FingerprintsOnCardComparisonRepresentation> element is only used if the
          <FingerprintsOnCardComparisonRepresentation> element uses different
          fingers representation than in
          <FingerprintsOffCardComparisonRepresentation> element. If the fingers for
          on-card and off-card comparison representation are identical, on-card
          comparison minutia templates representation can be created using the data
          stored in the <FingerprintsOffCardComparsionRepresentation> element. If
          used, the <FingerprintsOnCardComparisonRepresentation> includes the
          CBEFF Header, the ISO/IEC 19794-2:2011 minutiae, and the CBEFF
          signature, as documented in [SP800-76]. The data is provided in an
          xs:base64Binary format.

    <IrisRepresentation>:
           This element is optional and if used occurs once. The <IrisRepresentation>
           element contains the iris image representation collected during the enrollment
           process, as documented in [SP800-76]. The <IrisRepresentation> element
           includes the CBEFF Header, ISO 19794-6 iris, and the CBEFF signature. The
           data is provided in an xs:base64Binary format.
