                                                                       GUIDELINES FOR THE SECURE DEPLOYMENT OF IPV6


The sending BGP router always uses a TTL=255, and the receiving BGP router checks that the TTL has
the expected value of 255. Any packets from a remote attacker would have to travel via intervening
routers, would have a smaller-than-maximum TTL, and would be dropped on receipt. Note however that
a router operating as the endpoint of a tunneling protocol may not decrement the hop count upon
receiving packets through the tunnel, so these could conceivably come from anywhere with TTL=255.
The third mechanism to mitigate threats to BGP is IPsec. IPsec key management can use shared secrets
or public key certificates, which allow IPsec to offer scalability. GTSM has the lowest overhead of the
three mechanisms, and is the easiest to configure. It also offers the least effective protection. The MD5
signature mechanism offers low overhead and effective protection, but it forces administrators to disrupt
their BGP sessions at each key update, and it does not scale well. IPsec offers the most effective
protection, least disruption, and best scalability. It also imposes the highest overhead (although the
overhead is still small), and it is the most complex mechanism to configure. In summary, using an MD5
checksum is certainly better than nothing, but MD5 itself can be attacked successfully, and most of these
methods have no easy ways to change hash functions or even change keys. IPsec is preferable for routing
protocols that support its use. All of the above security mechanisms protect against unauthorized
insertion or manipulation of routing protocol messages.22 They do not protect against a corrupted or
malfunctioning router that may construct and pass along incorrect routing information. Many approaches
to providing better end-to-end security for BGP have been proposed, but consensus on a single solution
has not yet been achieved.

     3.6.3    Unknown Aspects

As IPv6 deployment grows globally so will the Internet’s IPv6 global routing tables. It is very well
possible that this expanded growth can impact service providers that already are faced with large IPv4-
only routing tables. By assigning IPv6 addresses through service providers, in a hierarchical fashion,
there is a greater possibility that efficient aggregation for IPv6 addressing will occur. If more
organizations succeed in obtaining PI addressing, then there is a higher risk that global routing tables
could explode in size, and hence cause possibly costly hardware upgrades to deal with extremely large
routing tables. To assist with developing a scalable Internet architecture, use of techniques that separate
end-systems’ addressing space and routing locators’ space (locator-ID split) are also being investigated.

3.7          IPv6 and the Domain Name System (DNS)

The Domain Name System (DNS) is essential for almost all use of the Internet. It must be available, and
it must provide accurate information. Threats such as denial of service against the top-level servers are
taken extremely seriously. Perhaps the biggest network security story of 2008 was the demonstration of a
new attack that can insert false information into a DNS server’s cache. Upgrading DNS security is one of
the major current challenges for ISPs23.

The Secure Domain Name System (DNS) Deployment Guide24 contains background information on DNS
as it is used with IPv4, the possible attacks against DNS, and appropriate security measures. The Domain
Name System – Security Technical Implementation Guide version 4r125 covers similar topics for
Department of Defense (DoD) networks and also has advice on using DNS on particular computing
platforms and operating systems. Both of these documents emphasize extensive experience with IPv4.
Architecting and structuring DNS services is a complex topic that is outside the scope of this publication;
extensive guidance about secure DNS services can be found in NIST SP (Special Publication) 800-81.
