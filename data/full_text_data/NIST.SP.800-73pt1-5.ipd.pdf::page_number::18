      NIST SP 800-73pt1-5 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification: Part 1
      September 2023                                 PIV Card Application Namespace, Data Model, and Representation

418           requirements in the tenth paragraph of [TIG SCEPACS, Section 2.1]: “For full
419           interoperability of a PACS, it must at a minimum be able to distinguish fourteen digits
420           (i.e., a combination of an Agency Code, System Code, and Credential Number) when
421           matching FASC-N based credentials to enrolled card holders.”
422       •   The Global Unique Identification number (GUID) field must be present and SHALL
423           include a Card Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) (see Section 3.4.1). The Card
424           UUID SHALL NOT be modified post-issuance.
425       •   The Expiration Date is mapped to the reserved for future use (RFU) tag 0x35, keeping
426           that within the existing scope of the TIG SCEPACS specification. This field SHALL be 8
427           bytes in length and SHALL be encoded in ASCII as YYYYMMDD. The expiration date
428           SHALL be the same as printed on the card. The expiration date SHALL NOT be
429           modified post-issuance.
430       •   The optional Cardholder UUID field is mapped to RFU tag 0x36. If present, it SHALL
431           include a Cardholder UUID as described in Section 3.4.2. The Cardholder UUID SHALL
432           NOT be modified post-issuance.
433       •   The CHUID SHALL be signed in accordance with Section 3.1.2.1. The card issuer’s
434           digital signature key SHALL be used to sign the CHUID, and the associated certificate
435           SHALL be placed in the signature field of the CHUID.

436   3.1.2.1.         Asymmetric Signature Field in CHUID
437   FIPS 201 requires inclusion of the asymmetric signature field in the CHUID data object. The
438   asymmetric signature data element of the CHUID SHALL be encoded as a Cryptographic
439   Message Syntax (CMS) external digital signature, as defined in RFC 5652 [RFC5652].
440   The issuer asymmetric signature field is implemented as a SignedData type, as specified in
441   [RFC5652], and SHALL include the following information:
442
443       •   The message SHALL include a version field specifying version v3.
444       •   The digestAlgorithms field SHALL be as specified in [SP800-78].
445       •   The encapContentInfo SHALL:
446                o Specify an eContentType of id-PIV-CHUIDSecurityObject
447                o Omit the eContent field
448       •   The certificates field SHALL include only a single X.509 certificate, which CAN be used
449           to verify the signature in the SignerInfo field.
450       •   The crls field SHALL be omitted.
451       •   signerInfos SHALL be present and include only a single SignerInfo.
452       •   The SignerInfo SHALL:
453                o Use the issuerAndSerialNumber choice for SignerIdentifier
