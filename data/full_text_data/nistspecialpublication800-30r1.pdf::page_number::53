 Common Control Provider              An organizational official responsible for the
 [CNSSI No. 4009]                     development, implementation, assessment, and
                                      monitoring of common controls (i.e., security controls
                                      inherited by information systems).
 Compensating Security Control        A management, operational, and/or technical control (i.e.,
 [CNSSI No. 4009]                     safeguard or countermeasure) employed by an

                                      the low, moderate, or high baselines that provides
                                      equivalent or comparable protection for an information
                                      system.

 Critical Infrastructure              System and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to
                                      the United States that the incapacity or destruction of
                                      such systems and assets would have a debilitating impact
                                      on security, national economic security, national public
                                      health or safety, or any combination of those matters.
 Critical Infrastructure Sectors      Information technology; telecommunications; chemical;
 [HSPD-7]                             transportation systems, including mass transit, aviation,
                                      maritime, ground/surface, and rail and pipeline systems;
                                      emergency services; and postal and shipping.
 Criticality                          A measure of the degree to which an organization
 [NIST SP 800-60]                     depends on the information or information system for the
                                      success of a mission or of a business function.
 Cyber Attack                         An attack, via cyberspace, targeting an enterpriseâ€™s use of

                                      destroying, or maliciously controlling a computing
                                      environment/infrastructure; or destroying the integrity of
                                      the data or stealing controlled information.
 Cyber Security                       The ability to protect or defend the use of cyberspace
 [CNSSI No. 4009]                     from cyber attacks.

 Cyberspace                           A global domain within the information environment
 [CNSSI No. 4009]                     consisting of the interdependent network of information
                                      systems infrastructures including the Internet,
                                      telecommunications networks, computer systems, and
                                      embedded processors and controllers.
