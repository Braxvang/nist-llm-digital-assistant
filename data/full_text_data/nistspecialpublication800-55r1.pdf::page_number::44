6.          INFORMATION SECURITY MEASUREMENT IMPLEMENTATION

Information security measurement implementation involves applying measures for monitoring
information security control performance and using the results to initiate performance
improvement actions. The information security measurement program implementation process
consists of six phases, which, when fully executed, will ensure continuous use of these measures
for security control performance monitoring and improvement. The process is shown in Figure
6-1.

6.1         Prepare for Data Collection

Phase 1 of the information security measurement program implementation process, Prepare for
Data Collection, involves activities that are essential for establishing a comprehensive
information security measurement program—including information security measures
identification, definition, development, and selection. The next step is to develop an information
security measurement program implementation plan. 10

Specific implementation steps should be defined based on how data for the measures should be
collected, analyzed, and reported. These steps should be documented in the measurement
program implementation plan. The following items may be included in the plan:

     The information security measurement program implementation plan can be formal or informal, depending upon the
       organization’s needs.
