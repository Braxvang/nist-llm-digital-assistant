NIST SP 800-207A                                          ZTA Model for Access Control in Cloud-Native

   •   The enforcement infrastructure that implements the security controls (mainly consisting
       of PEPs) should satisfy the properties of a security kernel: always invoked (non-by-
       passable), verifiable, and independent of the application code.
   •   The core tenant or primary function of ZTA at runtime is implementing an identity-based
       segmentation of applications that leverages the enforcement infrastructure.

       Requirements for Identity-Based Segmentation Policies for ZTA
The following policy checks should be implemented at runtime through the deployment of
identity-tier policies in order to realize identity-based segmentation:
   •   ID-SEG-REC-1: Encrypted connection between service endpoints — Service endpoints
       can be located in different subnets, different availability zones or regions in a cloud
       provider environment, in different clouds, or on-premises. Wherever they are located,
       communication between any two should be encrypted to ensure eavesdropping protection
       and message authenticity.
   •   ID-SEG-REC-2: Service authentication — Each service should present a short-lived
       cryptographically verifiable identity credential to other services that is authenticated per
       connection and reauthenticated regularly.
       Note on the above recommendation: In an ideal situation, services would be authenticated
       for each service request. Since this is highly disruptive from the point of view of
       application transaction response, this authentication is accomplished at the connection
       level via mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) when a service makes an initial
       connection establishment as part of its inter-service call. This authentication is not
       performed again in subsequent calls. However, the security of this operation is ensured
       by not allowing the connections to be very long (usually as long as the time to live [TTL]
       of the service’s identity certificate or as short as 15-30 minutes, depending on the
       configuration).
   •   ID-SEG-REC-3: Service to service authorization — Services should leverage runtime
       service identity (ID-SEG-REC-2) to enforce granular policies and have the capability to
       call external authorization services if the mesh-level proxies are insufficient to enforce
       dynamic authorization policies.
   •   ID-SEG-REC-4: End user authentication — Since all application requests are triggered
       by user actions, a robust identity management system is required to assign and maintain
       user identities and enforce robust protocols with phishing-resistant multi-factor
       authentication (MFA). This system should be used to issue a cryptographically verifiable
       runtime token that represents the user principal to the rest of the infrastructure (e.g., a
       JSON Web Token [JWT]), and services should authenticate the credential at each hop.
       Note on the above recommendation: Authenticating the user in session at every hop is
       impractical at scale. Therefore, NIST recommends using short-lived end user credentials
       (e.g., OAuth 2.0 tokens) for external users and exchanging them for a locally
       authenticatable token, like a JWT, that is authenticated at each hop.
