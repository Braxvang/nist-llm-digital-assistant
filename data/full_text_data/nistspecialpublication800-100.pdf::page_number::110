Chapter 11                      Certification, Accreditation, and Security Assessments


   The Initiation phase consists of three tasks: (1) preparation, (2) notification
and resource identification, and (3) system security plan review, analysis, and
acceptance. This phase will ensure that the authorizing official and the SAISO agree
with the contents of the system security plan before the certification agent begins
assessing the security controls in the information system.
    The Security Certification phase consists of two tasks: (1) security control
assessment, and (2) security certification documentation. An information system
must meet the minimum security requirements in FIPS 200, Minimum Security
Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems, by implementing
the appropriate security controls and assurance requirements as described in NIST
SP 800-53, Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems.
System assessments are conducted by examining, reviewing, and testing the
implementation of the appropriate security control baseline contained in NIST SP
800-53. The procedures for assessing and reporting the assessment results are
contained in NIST SP 800-53A, Guide for Assessing the Security Controls in Federal
Information Systems. 72
    The security certification phase determines the extent to which the security
controls in the information system are implemented correctly, operating as intended,
and producing the desired system security posture. This phase also identifies specific
actions taken or planned to correct security control deficiencies and to reduce or
eliminate known system vulnerabilities. At the conclusion of this phase, the
authorizing official should have sufficient data to assess the level of risk the system
poses to the agency, and render a security accreditation decision.
    The Security Accreditation phase consists of two tasks: (1) security
accreditation decision and (2) security accreditation documentation. This phase is
intended to help the accreditation authority determine whether the remaining known
vulnerabilities in the system (after implementing an agreed-upon set of security
controls) pose an acceptable level of risk to the agency. After successfully completing
this phase, the information system owner will be facing one of three scenarios:
      • Formal authorization to operate the information system is granted;
      • An interim authorization to operate the information system under specific terms
        and conditions is granted; or
      • Authorization to operate the information system                      Accreditation Package
        is denied.                                          Typically, the information system owner is responsible for
                                                                        compiling C&A documentation. However, the system

11.4 Security Certification Documentation
    The security certification and accreditation process, in its entirety, culminates in a
risk management decision by an agency official. The security accreditation package
documents the results of the security certification and provides the authorizing
official with the essential information needed to make a credible, risk-based decision
on whether to authorize operation of the information system. The security
accreditation package contains the following documents:
                                                                              Security Plan Contents
    • Approved system security plan,
                                                                 Documents typically attached or referenced in a security
    • Security assessment report, and                            plan include: risk assessment, privacy impact
    • Plan of Action and Milestones.                             assessment, contingency plan, incident response plan,
