NIST SP 800-82r3                                           Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

5.3.3. Geographically Distributed Systems
Many critical infrastructure industries have sites that are geographically distributed.
Organizations should consider whether differences in physical security at remote locations create
risks to the OT operational capabilities or safety. The necessary cybersecurity and
communication infrastructure should be provided at the remote sites to protect them from cyber
threats and to communicate cybersecurity monitoring information.
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            The communication between sites should be encrypted and authenticated
            end to end, whether the connection is via point-to-point link, satellite, or
            internet. Organizations should also ensure that adequate bandwidth is
            provisioned for collecting cyber monitoring data in addition to the
            operational data from remote locations.
            If the organization has several geographically dispersed sites, it should
            consider whether security operation will be managed from a central
            security operations center (SOC) or regionally distributed SOCs. The
            availability of qualified personnel can impact these decisions.

5.3.4. Regulatory Requirements
Regulated industries must consider cyber-related regulatory requirements when designing their
cybersecurity architecture. For example, NERC Standard CIP-005 (see Appendix D.1.9)
provides cybersecurity architecture requirements for bulk electric systems. Similar requirements
and guidance exist for other regulated industries.

5.3.5. Environmental Considerations
Organizations should conduct a hazard analysis to determine whether any of their processes or
equipment pose environmental hazards. If potential environmental hazards due to cybersecurity
failure have been identified, organizations should consider architectural measures to prevent
them.

5.3.6. Field I/O (Purdue Level 0) Security Considerations
Many of the devices and the communication protocols at the Field I/O level (Purdue Level 0)
(e.g., sensors, actuators) cannot be authenticated. Without authentication, there is the potential to
replay, modify, or spoof data. Organizations should make a risk-based decision to decide where
within the OT system (e.g., the most critical process) the use of mitigating security controls (e.g.,
digital twins, separate Field I/O monitoring network) should be implemented to detect incorrect
data.
