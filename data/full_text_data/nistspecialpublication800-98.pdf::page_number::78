GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



4. The reader sends the ciphertext to the tag.
5. The tag applies the XOR operation using the ciphertext and the key it generated to recover the plain

Cover coding is an example of minimalist cryptography because it operates within the challenging power
and memory constraints of passive RFID tags. 58 By itself, the XOR operation would be considered a
trivial encryption algorithm in traditional cryptography, but it nonetheless mitigates risk to an acceptable
level in many RFID environments.

Figure 5-2 illustrates how cover-coding works. As shown in the figure, the passive tag’s back channel
signal is weaker than the reader’s forward channel signal. This will always be the case for a passive tag,
which must use the forward channel to power both its computations and the backscattered signal. In the
figure, the adversary is able to eavesdrop on the forward channel but not the back channel. So long as this
condition holds, the adversary will not be able to learn the random number sent from the tag and therefore
will be unable to decipher cover coded information.

     on. To work properly, the inputs to the XOR operation must be of equivalent length, and the output is also of the same
     length.

     The XOR operation is symmetric. For instance, given key K, plaintext P, and ciphertext C, if P ⊕ K = C, then C ⊕ K = P.
