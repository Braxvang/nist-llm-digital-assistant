NIST SP 800-90A Rev. 1                     HASH_DRBG              Recommendation for Random Number
                                                                   Generation Using Deterministic RBGs


        1. status: The status returned from the function. The status will indicate SUCCESS, or
           indicate that a reseed is required before the requested pseudorandom bits can be
           generated.
        2. returned_bits: The pseudorandom bits to be returned to the generate function.
        3. new_working_state: The new values for V, C, and reseed_counter.
     Hash_DRBG_Generate Process:
        1. If reseed_counter > reseed_interval, then return an indication that a reseed is
           required.
        2. If (additional_input ≠ Null), then do
              2.1 w = Hash (0x02 || V || additional_input).
              2.2 V = (V + w) mod 2seedlen.
        3. (returned_bits) = Hashgen (requested_number_of_bits, V).
        4. H = Hash (0x03 || V).
        5. V = (V + H + C + reseed_counter) mod 2seedlen.
        6. reseed_counter = reseed_counter + 1.
        7. Return (SUCCESS, returned_bits, V, C, reseed_counter).
     Hashgen (requested_number_of_bits, V):
     Input:
        1. requested_no_of_bits: The number of bits to be returned.
        2.    V: The current value of V.
     Output:
        1. returned_bits: The generated bits to be returned to the generate function.
     Hashgen Process:
                requested _ no _ of _ bits
        1. m =                             .
                        outlen
        2. data = V.
        3. W = the Null string.

        4. For i = 1 to m
              4.1 w = Hash (data).
              4.2 W = W || w.
              4.3 data = (data + 1) mod 2seedlen.
        5. returned_bits = leftmost (W, requested_no_of_bits).
        6. Return (returned_bits).
