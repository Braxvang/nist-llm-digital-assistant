Chapter 11               Certification, Accreditation, and Security Assessments


     In addition, FISMA requires each agency to conduct an independent evaluation of
its information security program each year. For agencies with an inspector general
(IG), that evaluation is to be done by the agency IG. For agencies without an IG, the
evaluation is to be done by an external auditor. In either case, the agency annual
report to OMB must include the independent evaluation.
    Each quarter, agencies prepare and submit plan of action and milestone (POA&M)
reports to OMB for all programs and systems where an information system security
weakness has been found. In addition, program officials shall regularly (at the
direction of the CIO) update the agency CIO on their program to enable the CIO to
monitor agency-wide remediation efforts and provide the quarterly update of the
POA&M to OMB.
    To assist agencies in meeting their annual FISMA reporting requirements, the
Information Security Program Assessment Questionnaire contained in Annex 11.A
Agency Information Security Program Assessment Questionnaire, provides questions
on many of the areas typically required for inclusion in agency reports. The
questionnaire contains agency-wide, program-level questions that are not found in
NIST SP 800-53. The questionnaire can be customized with agency-specific,
program-related questions and can be completed by the CIO, the senior agency
information security officer (SAISO), or an independent assessor who is evaluating
the agency information security program.
    The questionnaire consists of a cover sheet and a series of questions which are
answered for the Agency Information Security Program. The cover sheet requires
descriptive information such as the name of the agency, bureau, or agency-operating
unit, and the name, title, and organization of the individual completing the
questionnaire. The date and time period covered in the report should be listed along
with describing the purpose of the assessment. For example, the annual assessment
of the agency information security program is required by FISMA; an assessment
was performed because of repeated virus infections. The final information listed on
the cover sheet is the number of agency systems in the low, moderate, and high
FIPS 199 impact categories.
    The series of questions are related to the management of an agency-wide
information security program. Each of these questions addresses information
security program elements critical to the success of an agency information security
program. This section is flexible and extensible. The agency may add as many
questions as desired to more fully assess the status and/or effectiveness of the
agency information security program or to address questions or concerns that are
raised by other interested parties.
    Each question should be answered for each level of IT Security maturity. For the
“Policy” maturity level, to answer “Yes,” the topic should be documented in agency
policy. For the “Procedures” maturity level, to answer “Yes,” the topic should be
documented in detailed procedures. For the “Implemented” maturity level, to answer
“Yes,” the implementation is verified by examining the procedures and program area
documentation, and interviewing key personnel to determine that the procedures are
implemented. For the “Tested” maturity level, to answer “Yes,” documents should
be examined and interviews should be conducted to verify that the policies and
procedures for the question are implemented and operating as intended and provide
the desired level of security. For the “Integrated” maturity level, to answer “Yes,”
the policies, procedures, implementation, and testing are continually monitored and
improvements are made as a normal business process of the agency.
