A preset number of attempts (usually three) are allowed for providing the correct PIN code to
the UICC before further attempts are blocked completely, rendering communications
inoperative. Only by providing a correct PIN Unblocking Key (PUK) may the value of a PIN
and its counter be reset on the UICC. If the number of attempts to enter the correct PUK value
exceeds a set limit, normally ten, the card becomes blocked permanently. The PUK for a
UICC may be obtained from the service provider or network operator by providing the
identifier of the UICC (i.e., Integrated Circuit Chip Identifier or ICCID). The ICCID is
normally imprinted on the front of UICC, but may also be read from an element of the file
system.

UICCs are available in three different size formats. They are: Mini SIM (2FF), Micro SIM
(3FF), and Nano SIM (4FF). The Mini SIM with a width of 25 mm, a height of 15 mm, and a
thickness of .76 mm, is roughly the footprint of a postage stamp and is currently the most
common format used worldwide. Micro (12mm x 15mm x .76mm) and Nano (8.8mm x
12.3mm x .67mm) SIMs are found in newer mobile devices (e.g., iPhone 5 uses the 4FF).

Though similar in dimension to a miniSD removable memory card, UICCs follow a different
set of specifications with vastly different characteristics. For example, their pin connectors are
not aligned along the bottom edge as with removable media cards, but instead form a contact
pad integral to the smart card chip, which is embedded in a plastic frame, as shown in Figure 2.
UICCs also employ a broad range of tamper resistance techniques to protect the information
they contain.

The slot for the UICC card is normally not accessible from the exterior of the mobile device to
protect insertion and removal as with a memory card. Instead, it typically is found beneath the
battery compartment. When a UICC is inserted into a mobile device handset and pin contact is
made, a serial interface is used for communicating between them.

In most cases, the UICC should be removed from the handset first and read using a Personal
Computer/Smart Card (PC/SC) reader. Removal of the UICC provides the examiner with
ability to read additional data that may be recovered (e.g., deleted text messages).

Authenticating a device to a network securely is a vital function performed via the UICC.
Cryptographic key information and algorithms within the tamper resistant module provide the
means for the device to participate in a challenge-response dialogue with the network and
respond correctly, without exposing key material and other information that could be used to
clone the UICC and gain access to a subscriberâ€™s services. Cryptographic key information in
the UICC also supports stream cipher encryption to protect against eavesdropping on the air
interface.

A UICC is similar to a mobile device as it has both volatile and non-volatile memory that may
contain the same general categories of data as found in a mobile device. It can be thought of as
a trusted sub-processor that interfaces to a device and draws power from it. The file system
resides in the non-volatile memory of a UICC and is organized as a hierarchical tree structure.
