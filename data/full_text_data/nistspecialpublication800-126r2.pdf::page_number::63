E4. Clarify Guidance on Patches Up-To-Date Rule

Date: February 13, 2012                  Type: Technical                   Location: Section 3.2.4.3

Description:
The current guidance on performing patches up-to-date checks assumes that patches are checked via
numerous OVAL patch class definitions. If a single OVAL definition is leveraged to do patches up-to-
date checking, then the following correction SHALL apply:
        For list item #3, the <xccdf:check-content-ref> SHALL refer to the single OVAL definition
        performing the patches up-to-date check.
        For list item #4, the @multi-check attribute of the <xccdf:check> element SHOULD be set to
        “false”.

The most common use case for this update is when Windows Update Agent (WUA) is used to perform
patches up-to-date using only a single OVAL definition.
