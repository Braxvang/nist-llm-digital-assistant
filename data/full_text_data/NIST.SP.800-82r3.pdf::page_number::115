6.2.1.1.       Logical Access Controls (PR.AC)
Logical access controls restrict logical access to an organization’s systems, data, and networks.
ACLs are sometimes used to support logical access controls. An ACL is a list of one or more
rules for determining whether an access request should be granted or denied, and it is used to
support the principle of least functionality and control access to restricted areas. ACLs are
commonly used with isolation technologies, such as firewalls, where an ACL might specify the
source, destination, and protocol allowed through the isolation device to or from the protected
network segment. ACLs may also be used for physical or logical access to areas or information,
such as network file shares, databases, or other data repositories and applications.
Role-based access control (RBAC) also supports logical access controls. RBAC is a technology
that has the potential to reduce the complexity and cost of security administration in networks
with large numbers of intelligent devices. RBAC is built on the principle that employees change
roles and responsibilities more frequently than the duties within those roles and responsibilities.
Under RBAC, security administration is simplified using roles, hierarchies, and constraints to
organize user access levels.
Additionally, attribute-based access control (ABAC) is an access control approach in which
access is determined based on the attributes associated with subjects (requesters) and the objects
being accessed. Each object and subject has a set of associated attributes, such as location, time
of creation, and access rights. Access to an object is authorized or denied depending on whether
the required (e.g., policy-defined) correlation can be made between the attributes of that object
and the requesting subject.
For federal employees and contractors, Personal Identity Verification (PIV), used in accordance
with FIPS 201, may be required to achieve access control. Organizations may also consider one
or more of these techniques when determining how to support local access controls within their
environments. Supplemental guidance for access controls can be found in the following
