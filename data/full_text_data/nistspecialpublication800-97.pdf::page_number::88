vendor support they receive. EAP-TTLS and PEAP are emerging as the industry-preferred EAP methods
for WLANs. EAP-FAST is currently a Cisco-proprietary approach but could gain a wider following if its
Internet Draft progresses to RFC status.

6.2     Developing an EAP Method Strategy

None of the EAP methods offers the best solution for all environments; the selection of an EAP method
depends on several factors, including whether an organization intends to leverage existing enterprise
authentication infrastructure for its WLAN authentication transactions. If an existing user database is to
be used, the EAP method must be compatible with the format in which user credentials are stored.
Nothing in the standards that define RSNs—including IEEE 802.11i, IEEE 802.1X, and EAP—requires
that STAs and ASs support more than one EAP method. 87 However, the Wi-Fi Alliance requires EAP-
TLS for certification. Some products support more options than others. Accordingly, organizations
should thoroughly understand their authentication requirements before designing RSNs and procuring
WLAN equipment. They should also be aware of any security policy or infrastructure limitations
inherent in the existing authentication infrastructure that they might want to leverage for RSN
authentication. For example, if they currently maintain a AAA server that by policy is configured to
support either tokens or certificates, but not passwords, then they might seek STAs that can work within
those constraints. If a password-based system over EAP is selected, the cryptographic protection of the
outer TLS tunnel should be extended as far as possible, preferably all the way to the authentication server,
but at least to a trusted secure network. This applies to both TTLS and PEAP. Finally, they may want to
conduct a risk assessment of various options of EAP methods before selecting one. Some questions that
organizations should address before choosing an EAP method are discussed in Table 6-4.

6.3     EAP Security Considerations

The RSN framework specifies the use of IEEE 802.1X authentication and EAP, but leaves a number of
critical security implementation details to the discretion of the organization implementing the framework.
Potential problems include an adversary impersonating an AP, capturing wireless authentication traffic as
it travels over the network between the AP and AS, and exploiting AS security vulnerabilities. This
section discusses some of the risks associated with improper implementations and how to mitigate those
risks.
