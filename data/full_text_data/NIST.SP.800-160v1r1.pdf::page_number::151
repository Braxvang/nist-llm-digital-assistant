VE-3     MANAGE RESULTS OF VERIFICATION
         VE-3.1 Record the security aspects of verification results and any anomalies encountered.
         VE-3.2 Obtain agreement from the approval authority that the system, system element, or
                artifact meets the specified system security requirements.
         Note: There may be multiple approval authorities with security-relevant responsibilities.
         VE-3.3 Maintain traceability of the security aspects of verification.
         Note: Bidirectional traceability is maintained between the verified security aspects of system
         elements and the system security requirements, architecture, design, and interface
         requirements. This traceability includes verification results or evidence, such as security-relevant
         anomalies, deviations, or requirement satisfaction.
         VE-3.4 Provide the security-relevant artifacts that have been selected for baselines.

H.10. Transition
The purpose of the Transition process is to establish a capability for a system to provide services
specified by stakeholder requirements in the operational environment.

H.10.1.            Security Purpose
-   Preserve the system’s verified security characteristics during the orderly and planned
    transition of the system to be operable in the intended environment, which may be a new or
    changed environment.

H.10.2.            Security Outcomes
-   Security-relevant transition constraints that influence system requirements, architecture, or
    design are identified.
-   Enabling systems or services for the security aspects of transition are available.
-   The prepared site satisfies security criteria.
-   The system is installed in its operational environment and can deliver its specified functions
    in a trustworthy secure manner.
-   Operators, users, and other stakeholders necessary to the system utilization and support are
    trained in the system’s security capabilities, mechanisms, and features.
-   Security-relevant transition results and anomalies are identified.
-   The installed system is activated and ready for trustworthy secure operation.
-   Traceability of the security aspects of the transitioned elements is established.
