device may not properly boot or may function in a completely unacceptable manner (e.g., a
Trojan horse). Many modern mobile devices contain an isolated execution environment that is
used specifically for security-critical functions [6]. For example, these environments may be
used for sensitive cryptographic operations (e.g., to verify integrity) or to support digital rights
management (DRM). These environments typically have access to some amount of secure
storage that is only accessible within that environment.
The mobile OS enables a rich set of functionalities by supporting the use of mobile apps written
by third-party developers. All mobile apps are sandboxed (or securely separated) in some manner
to prevent unexpected and unwanted interactions between the system, its apps, and those appsâ€™
respective data. This includes preventing user data stored by different apps from interacting with
each other. Mobile apps may be written in a native language running close to the hardware, in
interpreted languages, or in high-level web languages. The degree of functionality of mobile
applications is highly dependent on the APIs exposed by the mobile OS and the frameworks used
by the developer. Functionality is also dependent on the level of permissions granted to allow the
mobile app to leverage mobile device features, such as the camera or microphone.
This section has described the various technologies that work together to make a mobile device
function. Fig. 2 illustrates a visual model of the previously discussed layers of a mobile device.

    Mobile Communication Mechanisms and Other Common Mobile
Components
Mobile devices support a variety of wireless communication protocols, such as cellular, WiFi,
Bluetooth, Global Positioning System (GPS), and NFC. Wired physical connections are also
commonplace via a power and synchronization cable using Micro-USB, USB-C, and others. Fig.
3 depicts some of the communication mechanisms offered and additional common components
found in mobile devices.
