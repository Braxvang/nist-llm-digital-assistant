                                                                    GUIDELINES ON SECURING PUBLIC WEB SERVERS



       Acquire Additional Staff—If there are not enough staff members available or they do not have
         the requisite skills, it may be necessary to hire additional personnel or use external resources.

Once the organization has staffed the project and the Web server is active, it will be necessary to ensure
the number and skills of the personnel are still adequate. The threat and vulnerability levels of IT
systems, including Web servers, are constantly changing, as is the technology. This means that what is
adequate today may not be tomorrow.

3.6     Alternative Web Server Platforms

Although many organizations manage Web servers that operate over general-purpose OSs, there are
instances in which an organization may wish to use one of the alternatives discussed below. Although
these technologies are relatively new to the area of Web servers, they are based on sound technologies
and have started to see broader use in the Web server environment.

3.6.1    Trusted Operating Systems

Trusted operating systems (TOS) are security-modified or -enhanced OSs that include additional security
mechanisms not found in most general-purpose OSs. They were originally created to meet the need of the
Federal government for high security mandatory access control (MAC) systems. TOSs provide a very
secure system-wide control policy, a finely defined set of access privileges, and extensive logging and
auditing capabilities. Many TOSs are independently verified to ensure that they meet the requirements set
forth in their design documentation.

TOSs are generally used in applications for which security is paramount. TOSs can securely control all
aspects of a computing environment, including networking resources, users, processes, and memory.
Specifically, TOSs can limit access to system resources in a manner that is not likely to be interfered with
or compromised.

Using a TOS will generally produce a very secure Web server; however, some difficulties exist in using
TOSs. A major drawback is that configuring and administering a TOS requires knowledge of each
protected subsystem and its access needs. It may also require significant planning and administrative
overhead to design and support a complex Web site on a TOS. However, even with these limitations,
organizations that have very high security requirements should consider using a TOS on their Web
servers.

Some manufacturers have begun bundling their OS offerings with most or all of the functionality of
traditional TOSs for use in server or workstation environments. Organizations may benefit from such
systems because much of the overhead in designing and configuring the Web server to run in a TOS
environment has been performed by the manufacturer. Web servers benefit from the TOS’ MAC in that
the system can explicitly deny the Web server process access to sensitive portions of the system even if an
attacker has managed to take control of the process.

The following are some issues to keep in mind when considering a Web platform:

 What is the underlying OS and how has it fared in security testing?

 Does the organization have the necessary expertise in administering a TOS?

 Are the additional costs of purchasing and supporting a TOS outweighed by the benefits?
