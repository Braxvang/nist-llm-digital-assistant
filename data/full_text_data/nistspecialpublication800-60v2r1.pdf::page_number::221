Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Where unauthorized disclosure of
information might have a serious adverse effect on legal prosecution/ litigation, there is a
presumption of a miscarriage of justice. If an unauthorized disclosure is discovered, the legal
proceeding is jeopardized (e.g., a mistrial may be declared). The cost to the government and
others in terms of finance, time, and disruption to normal operations can be severe. If suspicion
is raised concerning government complicity or negligence, serious loss of public confidence in
government agencies or the legal process may result. In this case, the confidentiality impact of
unauthorized disclosure will be moderate.

Where the life of a complainant, victim, witness, or informant may be endangered by disclosure,
the confidentiality impact will be high. Also, where the consequences of a miscarriage of justice
are likely to endanger public safety (e.g., release of a terrorist or other murderer), the
confidentiality impact will be high.

Given the nature of many of the crimes that are the responsibility of Federal law enforcement
agencies, the consequences associated with unauthorized disclosure of legal prosecution
information must be assumed to pose a threat to human life or result in a loss of major assets.
Additionally, when a legal proceeding concerns matters of trans-national interest, such as trade
enforcement, tariff agreements, etc., or where foreign nationals might be involved, the
confidentiality impact will be high. Information that reveals the identity and/or location of
informants may be of particular concern.

[The impact of unauthorized disclosure of national security information is outside the scope of
this guideline.]

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: Given the public nature of and disclosure rules
associated with most prosecution/litigation information, the provisional confidentiality impact
level recommended is low. In cases where 1) the crimes are not violent and do not involve
extraordinarily large property losses, and 2) there is no indication of a record of violence on the
part of the criminal, the confidentiality impact may be low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Legal
prosecution/litigation activities are not typically time-critical. Unauthorized modification or
destruction of information affecting external communications associated with legal
prosecution/litigation organizations (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect
operations or public confidence in the agency, but the damage to the mission would usually be
limited. In general, the unauthorized modification or destruction of legal prosecution/litigation
information will have only a limited adverse effect on government operations, government
assets, or individuals. However, if evidence or other defense information has been
compromised, legal proceedings may be affected (e.g., a mistrial may be declared). The
subsequent cost to the government in terms of finance, time, and disruption to normal operations
may be severe. If suspicion is raised concerning government complicity or negligence, serious
loss of public confidence in government agencies or the legal process may result.
