                   EI-11        The issuing facility acquires fingerprint images in accordance with [SP 800-76-2], Section 3.2 –
                                Table 3 in [SP 800-76-2].                                           Fingerprint Image Acquisition

                                Assessment
                                Determine that:
                                   (i) fingers are inspected for the absence dirt, coatings, gels,
                                       and other of foreign materials (observe);
                                  (ii) scanner and card surfaces are clean (observe);
                                 (iii) the presentation of fingers for a plain live scan, rolled live
                                       scan, and rolled ink card are based on procedures in
                                       Table 2 of [SP 800-76-2] (observe);\
                                 (iv) multi-finger plain impression images are properly
                                       segmented into single finger images (observe).


                   EI-12        The issuing facility captures the 10 fingerprints of the applicant. In [SP 800-76-2], Section 3.2 –
                                the case where less than ten fingers are available, the missing        Fingerprint Image Acquisition
                                fingers are labeled before transmitting to the FBI for the purpose
                                of conducting a background investigation.

                                Assessment
                                Determine that:
                                   (i) the requirement that the issuing facility captures the 10
                                       fingerprints of the applicant and labels any missing fingers
                                       is documented (review);
                                  (ii) the issuing facility captures the 10 fingerprints of the
                                       applicant and labels any missing fingers (observe).

                                then a 1:1 biometric match of the applicant is performed at each
                                visit against biometric data collected during a previous visit.
                                .
                                Assessment
                                Determine that:
                                    (i) the requirement that if the biometric data for
                                        personalization and background investigation are collected
                                        on separate occasions a 1:1 biometric match of the
                                        applicant is performed at each visit against biometric data
                                        collected during a previous visit (review, observe).
