CP-5      CONTINGENCY PLAN UPDATE

          Control: The organization reviews the contingency plan for the information system [Assignment:
          organization-defined frequency, at least annually] and revises the plan to address
          system/organizational changes or problems encountered during plan implementation, execution, or
          testing.
          Supplemental Guidance: Organizational changes include changes in mission, functions, or business
          processes supported by the information system. The organization communicates changes to
          appropriate organizational elements responsible for related plans (e.g., Business Continuity Plan,
          Disaster Recovery Plan, Continuity of Operations Plan, Business Recovery Plan, Incident
          Response Plan, Emergency Action Plan).
          Control Enhancements: None.

CP-6      ALTERNATE STORAGE SITE

          Control: The organization identifies an alternate storage site and initiates necessary agreements to
          permit the storage of information system backup information.
          Supplemental Guidance: The frequency of information system backups and the transfer rate of
          backup information to the alternate storage site (if so designated) are consistent with the
          organizationâ€™s recovery time objectives and recovery point objectives.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization identifies an alternate storage site that is geographically separated from the
                primary storage site so as not to be susceptible to the same hazards.
          (2)   The organization configures the alternate storage site to facilitate timely and effective recovery
                operations.
          (3)   The organization identifies potential accessibility problems to the alternate storage site in the
                event of an area-wide disruption or disaster and outlines explicit mitigation actions.
