  •   Automating certificate management to minimize human error and maximize
      efficiency on a large scale; and
  •   Enabling rapid migration to new certificates and keys when cryptographic
      mechanisms are found to be weak, compromised, or vulnerable.
The project will result in actionable guidance to help enterprises establish and implement
a TLS server certificate management program.
