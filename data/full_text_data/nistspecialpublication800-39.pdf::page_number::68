 Security Categorization              The process of determining the security category for
                                      information or an information system. Security
                                      categorization methodologies are described in CNSS
                                      Instruction 1253 for national security systems and in
                                      FIPS 199 for other than national security systems.
 Security Control Assessment          The testing and/or evaluation of the management,
 [CNSSI 4009, Adapted]                operational, and technical security controls to determine
                                      the extent to which the controls are implemented
                                      correctly, operating as intended, and producing the
                                      desired outcome with respect to meeting the security
                                      requirements for an information system or organization.
 Security Control Assessor            The individual, group, or organization responsible for
                                      conducting a security control assessment.
 Security Control Baseline            The set of minimum security controls defined for a low-
 [CNSSI 4009]                         impact, moderate-impact, or high-impact information
                                      system.
 Security Control Enhancements        Statements of security capability to: (i) build in
                                      additional, but related, functionality to a basic control;
                                      and/or (ii) increase the strength of a basic control.
 Security Control Inheritance         A situation in which an information system or application
 [CNSSI 4009]                         receives protection from security controls (or portions of
                                      security controls) that are developed, implemented,
                                      assessed, authorized, and monitored by entities other than
                                      those responsible for the system or application; entities
                                      either internal or external to the organization where the
                                      system or application resides. See Common Control.
 Security Controls                    The management, operational, and technical controls
 [FIPS 199, CNSSI 4009]               (i.e., safeguards or countermeasures) prescribed for an
                                      information system to protect the confidentiality,
                                      integrity, and availability of the system and its
                                      information.
 Security Impact Analysis             The analysis conducted by an organizational official to
 [NIST SP 800-37]                     determine the extent to which changes to the information
                                      system have affected the security state of the system.
 Security Objective                   Confidentiality, integrity, or availability.
 [FIPS 199]
 Security Plan                        Formal document that provides an overview of the
 [NIST SP 800-18]                     security requirements for an information system or an
                                      information security program and describes the security
                                      controls in place or planned for meeting those
                                      requirements.
                                      See System Security Plan or Information Security
                                      Program Plan.
 Security Policy                      A set of criteria for the provision of security services.
