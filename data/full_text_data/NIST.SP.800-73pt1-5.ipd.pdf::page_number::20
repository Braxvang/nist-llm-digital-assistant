      NIST SP 800-73pt1-5 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification: Part 1
      September 2023                                 PIV Card Application Namespace, Data Model, and Representation

491   3.1.6. Cardholder Facial Image
492   The facial image data object is used for automated facial authentication in attended and
493   unattended modes (e.g., BIO or BIO-A), as well as automated facial authentication for PIV
494   reissuance and verification data reset. The facial image data object MAY also be used for visual
495   authentication by a guard (VIS). However, this authentication mechanism has been deprecated in
496   accordance with FIPS 201-3. The facial image data object SHALL be encoded as specified in
497   [SP800-76].

498   3.1.7. Security Object
499   The Security Object is in accordance with Appendix 3 to Section IV of Volume 2 of Part 3 of
500   Machine Readable Travel Documents (MRTD) [MRTD]. Tag 0xBA is used to map the
501   ContainerIDs in the PIV data model to the 16 Data Groups specified in the MRTD. The mapping
502   enables the Security Object to be fully compliant for future activities with identity documents.
503   The “DG-number-to-Container-ID” mapping object TLV in tag 0xBA encapsulates a series of
504   three-byte sequences — one for each PIV data object included in the Security Object. The first
505   byte is the Data Group (DG) number, and the second and third bytes are the most and least
506   significant bytes (respectively) of the Container ID value. The DG number assignment is
507   arbitrary. However, the same number assignment applies to the DataGroupNumber in the
508   DataGroupHash. This will ensure that the ContainerIDs in the mapping object refer to the correct
509   hash values in the Security Object (0xBB).
510   The 0xBB Security Object is formatted according to [MRTD, Appendix 3 to Section IV]. The
511   Logical Data Structure (LDS) Security Object itself must be in ASN.1 DER format, formatted as
512   specified in [MRTD, Appendix A.3.2]. This structure is then inserted into the encapContentInfo
513   field of the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) object specified in [MRTD, Appendix A.3.1].
514   The card issuer’s content signing digital signature key used to sign the CHUID SHALL also be
515   used to sign the Security Object. The signature field of the Security Object, tag 0xBB, SHALL
516   omit the issuer’s content signing certificate since it is included in the CHUID. At a minimum,
517   unsigned data objects SHALL be included in the Security Object if present, such as the Printed
518   Information data object. For maximum protection against credential splicing attacks (credential
519   substitution), it is recommended, however, that all PIV data objects be included in the Security
520   Object except for the PIV X.509 certificates and the Secure Messaging Certificate Signer data
521   object.

522           Conditional Data Elements
523   The following two data elements are mandatory if the cardholder has a government-issued email
524   account at the time of credential issuance. These two data elements, when implemented, SHALL
525   conform to the specifications provided in this document.
