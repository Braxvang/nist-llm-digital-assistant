Generally, Federal asset sales information is public. Most managed property would not be of
sufficient individual value to occasion such an occurrence (bid rigging, etc.).

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Where unauthorized knowledge
regarding the property being disposed of might lead to unfair advantage (i.e., ability to accurately
bid on an auction lot to the detriment of other bidders), then the associated confidentiality impact
assigned to Federal asset sales information might be moderate. Such an instance might arise if a
disruption of the proper procedures could reasonably cause an adverse effect on future operations
of the responsible agency, or if the agencyâ€™s image, or individual reputations might be damaged.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for Federal asset sales information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of Federal asset sale information is
partially dependent on the type of property being managed and whether the data is time-critical.
If the modified or destroyed information is substantive financial data, actions that are taken
based on incomplete or false information could have serious adverse effects on individual
financial actions.

Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external communications
(e.g., web pages, solicitations for bid, official notices of disposition, etc.) may adversely affect
the operations, image or reputation of an agency. However, the damage to the management
mission would usually be of more immediate concern. The severity of the consequent integrity
impact depends on the nature of the property but would be most likely be moderate.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
Federal asset sales information is moderate.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the Federal asset sale information. The
missions supported by Federal asset sale information are generally tolerant of delay. Generally,
the consequences of temporary inability to access solicitations for bid, official notices of
disposition, etc., will be minimal.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
Federal asset sale information is low.
