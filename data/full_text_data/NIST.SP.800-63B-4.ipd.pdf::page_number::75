       NIST SP 800-63B-4 ipd                                             Digital Identity Guidelines

2125      • Authenticator availability should also be considered as users will need to remember
2126        to have their authenticator readily available. Consider the need for alternate
2127        authentication options to protect against loss, damage, or other negative impacts
2128        to the original authenticator.
2129      • Whenever possible, based on AAL requirements, users should be provided with
2130        alternate authentication options. This allows users to choose an authenticator based
2131        on their context, goals, and tasks (e.g., the frequency and immediacy of the task).
2132        Alternate authentication options also help address availability issues that may occur
2133        with a particular authenticator.
2134      • Characteristics of user-facing text:
2135           – Write user-facing text (e.g., instructions, prompts, notifications, error
2136             messages) in plain language for the intended audience. Avoid technical jargon
2137             and write for the audience’s expected literacy level.
2138           – Consider the legibility of user-facing and user-entered text, including font
2139             style, size, color, and contrast with surrounding background. Illegible text
2140             contributes to user entry errors. To enhance legibility, consider the use of:
2141               * High contrast. The highest contrast is black on white.
2142               * Sans serif fonts for electronic displays. Serif fonts for printed materials.
2143               * Fonts that clearly distinguish between easily confusable characters (e.g.,
2144                 the capital letter “O” and the number “0”).
2145               * A minimum font size of 12 points as long as the text fits for display on
2146                 the device.
2147      • User experience during authenticator entry:
2148           – Offer the option to display text during entry, as masked text entry is error-
2149             prone. Once a given character is displayed long enough for the user to see, it
2150             can be hidden. Consider the device when determining masking delay time, as
2151             it takes longer to enter memorized secrets on mobile devices (e.g., tablets and
2152             smartphones) than on traditional desktop computers. Ensure masking delay
2153             durations are consistent with user needs.
2154           – Ensure the time allowed for text entry is adequate (i.e., the entry screen does
2155             not time out prematurely). Ensure allowed text entry times are consistent with
2156             user needs.
2157           – Provide clear, meaningful and actionable feedback on entry errors to reduce
2158             user confusion and frustration. Significant usability implications arise when
2159             users do not know they have entered text incorrectly.
