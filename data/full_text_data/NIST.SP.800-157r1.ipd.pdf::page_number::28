751   Appendix B.      Data Model and Interfaces for Removable or Wireless PKI-based
752                    Hardware Cryptographic Devices
753   This appendix is normative.
754   This appendix provides data model and interface requirements for PKI-based derived
755   PIV applications that are implemented on removable or wireless hardware cryptographic
756   tokens.

757   B.1. Derived PIV Application Data Model and Representation
758   The data model and representation requirements for derived PIV applications are based
759   on the requirements for PIV Card applications, as described in [SP800-73] Part 1. The
760   specifications for the mandatory and optional data objects listed below are the same as the
761   specifications for the corresponding data objects on a PIV Card application, as described
762   in [SP800-73] Part 1.

763   B.1.1. Derived PIV Application IdentiÔ¨Åer
764   The application identifier (AID) of the derived PIV application SHALL be (in
765   hexadecimal):
766    A0 00 00 03 08 00 00 20 00 01 00
767   The derived PIV application can be selected as the current application on the removable
768   hardware cryptographic token by providing the full AID listed above or by providing the
769   right truncated version, as follows (hexadecimal):
770    A0 00 00 03 08 00 00 20 00

771   B.1.2. Derived PIV Application Data Model Elements
772   The derived PIV application SHALL contain the following mandatory interoperable data
773   object:
774   X.509 Certificate for Derived PIV Authentication
775      The read access control rule for the X.509 certificate for derived PIV authentication
776      and the PKI cryptographic function access rule for the corresponding private key
777      are as described for the X.509 certificate for PIV authentication in Sec. 3.1.3 of
778      [SP800-73] Part 1.
779   The following data objects MAY also be present:
780   X.509 Certificate for Digital Signature
781      The read access control rule for the X.509 certificate for digital signature and the PKI
782      cryptographic function access rule for the corresponding private key are as described
783      in Sec. 3.2.1 of [SP800-73] Part 1.
