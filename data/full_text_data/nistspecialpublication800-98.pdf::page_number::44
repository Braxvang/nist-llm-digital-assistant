GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



associated with desired features of the finished product. At each station in the assembly process, a reader
would read the tag and take an appropriate action, such as adding a specialized component or using a
particular color of paint. In another typical application, sensors are attached to tags to measure factors
such as temperature, humidity, or shock. Information from the sensors can be used to make decisions
regarding the tagged items. For example, a perishable product may be discarded if it has been exposed to
room temperature for more than a threshold period of time.

In asset management, tracking, and matching applications, each reader only needed to capture the tag’s
identifier (a number permanently assigned to the tag) and apply a timestamp to the transaction. In process
control applications, additional information beyond the tag’s identifier is normally associated with each
tag. That information could reside on the tag itself or in a networked database. In either case, the
additional information introduces a level of complexity not found in the previously discussed
applications. Implementing organizations have additional design issues to consider, such as exactly what
information needs to be recorded, where it should be stored, how it should be protected, and their
customers’ expectation of privacy for that information.

3.1.6    Access Control

Access control systems use RFID to automatically check if an individual is authorized to physically access
a facility (e.g., a gated campus or a specific building) or logically access an information technology
system. Some systems are implemented using contactless RFID smart cards instead of mechanical keys.
Every individual that is given access to specific areas must carry one of these cards. Locked doors or
turnstiles typically protect the areas. To unlock them, authorized personnel must present their smart cards
near the appropriate reader. 26 The door or turnstile will unlock once the reader has authenticated the
smart card. The system can be configured such that only certain cards can be used to unlock certain doors
or turnstiles. The possession of the cards may also be combined with a password, personal identification
number (PIN), or biometric (e.g., fingerprint or retina scan) for additional security.

There are two general types of access control systems: online and offline. Online systems have readers
that are networked to a central computer. In an online system, each card is linked to a specific person.
Each reader is supplied by the central computer with a list of individuals that can access the
corresponding area. Since this system is networked, the central computer can provide updated access lists
to the readers. In contrast, offline systems are not networked. In offline systems, the card lists the rooms
that the holder can access, perhaps also listing an expiration date. When someone attempts to access a
room using the card, the reader checks that the card contains one of the permitted identifiers before
allowing entry.

RFID technology is also used in automobile key applications, which is effectively a type of access
control. There are two basic types: immobilizers and push-button keyless start. With immobilizers, a tag
is embedded into a key similar to a traditional vehicle key; the tag in the key is read by a reader in the
dashboard or steering column. For the key to start the vehicle, it must both have the right shape for the
ignition system and contain the tag. Duplication of these keys is significantly more difficult and costly
than traditional keys, which has helped to reduce vehicle thefts. The second automobile key application
type is push-button keyless start, which allows a driver to start a vehicle without putting a physical key in
the ignition. Instead, each driver simply carries a key fob into the vehicle. Once the key fob is detected,
the vehicle is started by pushing a start button on the dashboard.

     Different standards for contactless smart cards have different read distances. For example, ISO/IEC 14443 proximity smart
     cards have an approximate operating range of between 7 and 15 centimeters and ISO/IEC 15693 vicinity smart cards have
     an approximate range of up to one meter.
