Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of social services
information on the ability of responsible agencies to provide meaningful opportunities for social
and economic growth of the disadvantaged sector of the population in order to develop
individuals into productive and self-reliant citizens and promote social equity. The consequences
of unauthorized disclosure of most social services information would have a limited adverse
effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Exceptions that might have a
potential for more serious consequences include privacy information processed in training and
employment systems (e.g., information required by the Privacy Act of 1974 or other statutes and
executive orders to receive special handling to protect the privacy of individuals). The Privacy
Act Information provisional impact levels are documented in the Personal Identity and
Authentication information type. Other exceptions include unauthorized disclosure of
information that might assist criminals to perpetrate fraud, particularly with respect to income
security disbursements. This can result in assignment of a moderate impact level to such
information.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for social services information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of social services information would
have, at most, a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external communications
(e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect operations and/or public confidence in the
agency, but the damage to the mission would usually be limited. Another threat is that of
unauthorized modification of information to support fraudulent activities. This might result in
harm to individuals, but not to agency operations or missions.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
most social services information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to social services information. The
effects of disruption of access to most social services information or information systems
would have, at most, a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or
individuals.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
social services information is low.
