limitations on liability, and modifications to the terms of the agreement. Privacy and security
risks depend to a great extent on the terms established in the service agreement.

Two types of service agreements exist: predefined non-negotiable agreements and negotiated
agreements [Bra10, UCG10]. Non-negotiable agreements are in many ways the basis for the
economies of scale enjoyed by public cloud computing. The terms of service are prescribed
completely by the cloud provider. They are typically not written with attention to federal privacy
and security requirements [CIO10a]. Furthermore, with some offerings, the provider can make
modifications to the terms of service unilaterally (e.g., by posting an updated version online)
without giving any direct notification to the cloud consumer [Bra10].

Negotiated service agreements are more like traditional outsourcing contracts for information
technology services. They can be used to address an organizationâ€™s concerns about security and
privacy policy, procedures, and technical controls, such as the vetting of employees, data
ownership and exit rights, breach notification, isolation of tenant applications, data encryption
and segregation, tracking and reporting service effectiveness, compliance with laws and
regulations (e.g., Federal Information Security Management Act), and the use of validated
products meeting national or international standards (e.g., Federal Information Processing
Standard 140-2 for cryptographic modules).

Critical data and applications may require an agency to undertake a negotiated service agreement
[Wall0]. Since points of negotiation can significantly perturb and negatively affect the
economies of scale that a non-negotiable service agreement brings to public cloud computing, a
negotiated service agreement is normally less cost effective. The outcome of a negotiation is
also dependent on the size of the organization and the influence it can exert. Regardless of the
type of service agreement, obtaining adequate legal and technical advice is recommended to
ensure that the terms of service adequately meet the needs of the organization.

3.2   The Security and Privacy Upside
While one of the biggest obstacles facing public cloud computing is security, the cloud
computing paradigm provides opportunities for innovation in provisioning security services that
hold the prospect of improving the overall security of some organizations. The biggest
beneficiaries are likely to be smaller organizations that have limited numbers of information
technology administrators and security personnel, and can gain the economies of scale available
to larger organizations with sizeable data centers, by transitioning to a public cloud.

Opportunities for improved security also benefit privacy. That is, effective privacy can exist
only upon a sound foundation of information security. However, privacy, just as security, has
broad organizational, operational, and technical implications. While some aspects of privacy are
closely related to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability objectives of security, other
aspects are not. Instead, they involve important privacy-related principles and considerations
that are addressed in law, regulations, and OMB guidance [CIO10b].

Potential areas of improvement where organizations may derive security and privacy benefits
from transitioning to a public cloud computing environment include the following:
