                               3. Reset the security status of the '96' key
                                  reference by sending the VERIFY command with
                                  • P2, key reference value is set to '96'
                                  • P1 parameter is 'FF' and both L c and the data
                                     field are absent
                               4. Send VERIFY card command with
                                  • P2, key reference value is set to '97'
                                  • Data field of the command will contain a value
                                     that matches the Secondary Finger OCC value
                               5. Send GET DATA command with
                                  • Data field of the command containing the tag
                                     of the Printed Information data object
                               6. Reset the security status of the '97' key
                                   reference by sending the VERIFY command with
                                  • P2, key reference value is set to '97'
                                  • P1 parameter is 'FF' and both L c and the data
                                     field are absent
                               7. Send GET DATA command with
                                  • Data field of the command containing the tag
                                     of the Printed Information data object
                               8. Send VERIFY card command with
                                  • P2, key reference value is set to '96'
                                  • Data field of the command will contain a
                                     random fingerprint value. The fingerprint is
                                     truncated so that the total length is less
                                     than 3 bytes times the minimum number of
                                     minutia specified in the BIT Group Template
                                     for key reference '96'
                               9. Send VERIFY card command with
                                  • P2, key reference value is set to '96'
                                  • Data field of the command will contain a
                                     random fingerprint value. The fingerprint is
                                     padded so that the total length is more than 3
                                     bytes times the maximum number of minutia
                                     specified in the BIT Group Template for key
                                     reference '96'
                               10. Send VERIFY card command repeatedly until after
                                   the issuer specified maximum number of OCC tries
                                   is exceeded with
                                  • P2, key reference value is set to '96'
                                  • Data field of the command will contain an
                                     arbitrary, but correctly formatted, value that
                                     does not match the Primary Finger OCC value
                                     obtained from the vendor
                               11. Repeat steps 8-10 with key reference '97'.
 Expected Result(s)   1. The command returns the application property template with the
                          status word '90 00' at the end.
                      2. The command returns either 1) '6A 82' (data object not found) or
                          2) the Discovery Object with the status word '90 00' at the end
                          (verify that the returned PIN Usage Policy matches to what is
                          described in vendor documentation.
