Special Publication 800-85B                                 PIV Data Model Testing Specification


AS07.04.05: The keyUsage extension shall assert only the digitalSignature bit. No other bits
shall be asserted.
VE07.04.05.01: The vendor shall specify in its documentation the assertion of the
digitalSignature bit in the keyUsage extension as part of the card authentication certificate
profile.
TE07.04.05.01: The tester shall validate the assertion of the digitalSignature bit in the keyUsage
extension in the card authentication certificate issued by the vendor.

AS07.04.06: The policyIdentifier field in the certificatePolicies must assert id-fpki-
common-cardAuth (OID = 2.16.840.1.101.3.2.1.3.17).
VE07.04.06.01: The vendor shall specify in its documentation that the policyIdentifier field in
certificatePolicies asserts the id-fpki-common-cardAuth OID.
TE07.04.06.01: The tester shall validate the policyIdentifier field in certificatePolicies has
asserted the id-fpki-common-cardAuth OID.

AS07.04.07: The extKeyUsage extension shall assert id-PIV-cardAuth (OID =
2.16.840.1.101.3.6.8). This extension is critical.
VE07.04.07.01: The vendor shall specify in its documentation that the extKeyUsage extension
asserts the id-PIV-cardAuth OID.
TE07.04.07.01: The tester shall validate the extKeyUsage asserts the id-PIV-cardAuth OID as a
critical extension.

AS07.04.08: The authorityInfoAccess field shall contain an id-ad-ocsp accessMethod. The
access location uses the URI name form to specify the location of an HTTP accessible
OCSP Server distributing status information for this certificate.
VE07.04.08.01: The vendor shall specify in its documentation the inclusion of an id-ad-ocsp
accessMethod in the authorityInfoAccess extension as part of the card authentication certificate
profile. Additionally, the accessLocation for this accessMethod uses the URI name form to
specify the location of an HTTP accessible OCSP server.
TE07.04.08.01: The tester shall validate the presence of an id-ad-ocsp accessMethod in the
authorityInfoAccess extension in the card authentication certificate issued by the vendor. The
tester shall also validate that the accessLocation for this accessMethod uses the URI name form
and points to an HTTP accessible OCSP server.

AS07.04.09: The FASC-N shall be populated in the subjectAltName extension using the
pivFASC-N attribute OID = 2.16.840.1.101.3.6.6).
VE07.04.09.01: The vendor shall specify in its documentation the inclusion of the FASC-N in
the subjectAltName extension as part of the card authentication certificate profile.
TE07.04.09.01: The tester shall validate the presence of the FASC-N in the subjectAltName
extension in the card authentication certificate issued by the vendor.
