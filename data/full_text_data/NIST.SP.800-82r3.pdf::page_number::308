F.7.18.        SYSTEM AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY – SI
Tailoring Considerations for the System and Information Integrity Family
When the OT cannot support the specific system and information integrity requirements of a
control, the organization employs compensating controls in accordance with the general tailoring
guidance. Examples of compensating controls are given with each control as appropriate.
SI-1    POLICY AND PROCEDURES

                                                                         CONTROL BASELINES

 SI-1       Policy and Procedures                                     Select     Select      Select

OT Discussion: The policy specifically addresses the unique properties and requirements of OT
and the relationship to non-OT systems.
SI-2    FLAW REMEDIATION

                                                                         CONTROL BASELINES

   NO.                     Control Enhancement Name

 SI-2       Flaw Remediation                                          Select     Select      Select

 SI-2 (2)   FLAW REMEDIATION | AUTOMATED FLAW REMEDIATION STATUS                 Select      Select

OT Discussion: Flaw remediation, or patching, is complicated since many OT employ OSs and
other software that are no longer maintained by the vendors. OT operators may also not have the
resources or capability to test patches and are dependent on vendors to validate the operability of
a patch. Sometimes, the organization has no choice but to accept additional risk if no vendor
patch is available, if patching requires additional time to complete validation or testing, or if
deployment requires an unacceptable operations shutdown. In these situations, compensating
controls should be implemented (e.g., limiting the exposure of the vulnerable system, restricting
vulnerable services, implementing virtual patching). Other compensating controls that do not
decrease the residual risk but increase the ability to respond may be desirable (e.g., provide a
timely response in case of an incident, devise a plan to ensure that the OT can identify
exploitation of the flaw). Testing flaw remediation in an OT may exceed the organization’s
available resources.
Control Enhancement: (2) No OT discussion for this control.
SI-3    MALICIOUS CODE PROTECTION

                                                                         CONTROL BASELINES
  CNTL                        CONTROL NAME
   NO.                     Control Enhancement Name
                                                                       LOW         MOD         HIGH

 SI-3       Malicious Code Protection                                 Select     Select      Select

OT Discussion: Malicious code protection should only be deployed after careful consideration
and verification that it does not adversely impact the operation of the OT. Malicious code
