3.4     Describing Web Services Policies (WS-Policy)

WSDL describes how to communicate with a Web service by detailing the protocol bindings and message
formats the Web service expects. In many cases, knowledge of protocol bindings and message formats is
not sufficient for requesters to dynamically bind to the provider. WSDL is limited to describing what
needs to be placed in the message itself; it does not specify what type of metadata should be supplied,
such as how the message will be authenticated or what portions of the message should be signed. To this
end, Microsoft, IBM, BEA and others developed the Web Services Policy (WS-Policy) Framework,
which allows providers to express the capabilities, requirements and characteristics of the Web service.

WS-Policy requirements can range from specific on-the-wire requirements, such as requiring WS-
Security encryption and signatures, to more abstract requirements, such as QoS or privacy requirements.
A WS-Policy policy expression can provide senders with the essential metadata to fully automate the task
of dynamic binding. A policy expression contains a set of policy alternatives encompassing sets of
assertions.

Policy assertions are defined for a number of WS-* specifications, including WS-SecurityPolicy, WS-
ReliableMessaging Policy Assertion (WS-RM Policy) and WS-Addressing WSDL Binding. The WS-
Policy Primer 34 defines how these specifications can be used within a policy expression. As of mid-2007,
there are three primary specifications defining WS-Policy assertions:

 WS-SecurityPolicy defines assertions to specify integrity, confidentiality, and information about
  security tokens.
 WS-RM Policy defines assertions that can be used to specify how a Web service uses WS-
  ReliableMessaging.
 WS-Addressing WSDL Binding defines elements that can be used within a WSDL descriptor to
  specify the use of WS-Addressing.
Figure 3-2 shows a sample WS-Policy expression. 35
