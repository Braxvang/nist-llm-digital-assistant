SECURE DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM (DNS) DEPLOYMENT GUIDE



13.       Guidelines on Securing Validating Resolvers

As discussed in Section 6.1.4, DNSSEC provides data origin authentication and integrity protection for
DNS data. This is done using digital signatures stored with the DNS data and validated by DNS clients.
DNS clients that perform this validation are referred to as validators.

DNS validators check responses by building an authentication chain (a.k.a. chain of trust) from the
response data to a pre-configured trusted key. This may involve the validator sending follow up queries
for public keys or other information (such as DS RRâ€™s) to obtain the full DNSSEC chain. Therefore,
validators are often recursive servers that can perform their own DNS resolution process and cache
results.

13.1 Enabling DNSSEC Validation

Configuring DNSSEC validation requires two tasks: configuring the server to perform validation (not
always required) and configure one or more trusted public keys to act as trust anchors. How this is done
depends on the DNS implementation used, but BIND will be used as an example.

The policy in determining which DNSSEC public keys to configure as trust anchors is beyond the scope
of this guide and would be the part of the organization's security policy. However, given the hierarchy
used in DNS, the higher the public key, the wider range of DNS responses can be validated using that
key.

13.1.1 On the Stub Client

A stub resolver software, by definition, does not perform full resolution and hence is not DNSSEC-aware.
Even if the stub is DNSSEC aware, it may not be able to perform its own validation, but rely on an
upstream server to perform validation on its behalf.


13.1.2 Configuring DNSSEC on a Windows 7 or Windows 8 System

Microsoft Windows 7 and Windows 8 operating systems have the option of having the stub resolver to
explicitly request DNSSEC validation for a given domain. This is done using the Name Resolution Policy
Table (NRPT). A system administrator can set the domain and whether the system should expect
DNSSEC validation from responses. These policies can be set on an individual or enterprise wide basis.

The details on how to set this option in Windows is available from the Microsoft TechNet website14. Note
however that the option is set for an entire domain, not a single zone. If the policy is set for a domain, the
client will automatically expect DNSSEC validation for any subzone under the domain as well, and will
reject any non-validated responses.


13.1.3 Using a Validating Recursive Server

Most current stub resolvers cannot perform DNSSEC validation and may not understand DNSSEC at all.
These stub resolvers will have to rely on an upstream validating recursive resolver to perform DNSSEC
validation on its behalf. On an trusted enterprise network, this does not pose a significant risk, as there
