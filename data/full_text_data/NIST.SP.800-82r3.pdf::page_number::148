NIST SP 800-82r3                                         Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security

            and ensuring that no policy violations or cyber incidents have hindered
            its operation. Strong device monitoring, logging, and auditing are
            necessary to collect, correlate, and analyze security-related information
            and provide actionable communication about the security status across
            the complete OT system. In the event of a cybersecurity incident, the
            information gathered by system use monitoring solutions can be used to
            perform forensic analysis of the OT system.
            System use monitoring solutions can generate significant amounts of
            events, so these solutions should be used in combination with a control
            log management system, such as a SIEM, to help filter the types of
            events and reduce alert fatigue. The amount of tuning and customization
            of events and alerts depends on the type of OT system and the number of
            devices in the system.
            System use monitoring solutions should be subjected to extensive testing
            and implemented in a test environment before being deployed to devices
            in the OT system. Concerns include the performance impacts of host-
            based agents on devices, the impact of active scanning on devices, and
            the capability of the network infrastructure bandwidth. Separate
            appliances can offload the processing. Host-based agents can impact the
            performance of the OT device because of the resources that they
            consume.

6.3.2.3.       Malicious Code Detection (DE.CM-4)
When stored, processed, and transmitted, files and data streams should be scanned using
specialized tools with a combination of heuristic algorithms and known malware signatures to
detect and block potentially malicious code. Malicious code protection tools only function
effectively when they are installed, configured, run full-time, and maintained properly against
the state of known attack methods and payloads.
Supplemental guidance for anti-malware practices can be found in the following documents:
   •   NIST SP 800-83, Rev. 1, Guide to Malware Incident Prevention and Handling for
       Desktops and Laptops
   •   NIST SP 1058, Using Host-Based Anti-Virus Software on Industrial Control Systems:
       Integration Guidance and a Test Methodology for Assessing Performance Impacts
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            While antivirus tools are common in IT computer systems, the use of
            antivirus with OT may require adopting special practices, including
            compatibility checks, change management, and performance impact
            metrics. These practices should be utilized to test new signatures and
            new versions of antivirus software.
            Some OT vendors recommend and even support the use of vendor-
            specific antivirus tools. In some cases, OT system vendors may have
            performed regression testing across their product line for supported
