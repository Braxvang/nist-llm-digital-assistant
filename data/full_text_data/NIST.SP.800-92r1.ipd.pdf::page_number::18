      NIST SP 800-92r1 ipd                                                 Cybersecurity Log Management
      October 2023                                                                        Planning Guide

434              o Perform regular maintenance of the logs and logging software
435              o Handle authorized requests from security administrators, auditors, compliance
436                officers, legal counsel, and others who need copies of log data
437      •   Security administrators who
438              o Manage, secure, and monitor log management infrastructures
439              o Implement, secure, manage, and maintain a passive DNS logging system
440              o Configure logging and synchronize timestamps on security devices and services
441                (e.g., firewalls, antivirus servers, VPNs, SASE)
442              o Configure security devices and services to forward log data to the appropriate
443                logging infrastructure systems for analysis, storage, or other processing
444              o Identify the changes needed to system logging configurations (e.g., which entries
445                and data fields must be sent to the centralized log servers) and inform system-
446                level administrators of the necessary changes
447              o Report on the results of log management activities
448              o Assist others with configuring logging and performing log analysis
449              o Test and implement upgrades and updates to the log management infrastructure’s
450                components
451      •   Operations personnel who
452              o Archive log data to removable media and dispose of that log data properly once it
453                is no longer needed
454              o Monitor logging configurations and operational statuses for individual systems,
455                networks, and the log management infrastructure to identify logging failures (e.g.,
456                a failure of a log management infrastructure component) and potentially
457                unauthorized changes
458              o Initiate appropriate responses to events, including incident handling and
459                operational problems
460      •   Computer security incident response teams who use log data when investigating and
461          handling incidents
462      •   Application developers whose applications perform logging
463      •   Information security officers who oversee the log management infrastructures
464      •   Chief information officers (CIOs) who oversee the technology resources that generate,
465          transmit, and store the logs
466      •   Auditors who use log data when performing audits
467      •   Compliance officers who use log data when verifying compliance or documenting
468          evidence of compliance
469      •   Individuals involved in the procurement of software or software services that can or
470          should generate cybersecurity log data
