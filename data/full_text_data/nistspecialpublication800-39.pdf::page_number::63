 Enterprise                           An organization with a defined mission/goal and a
 [CNSSI 4009]                         defined boundary, using information systems to execute
                                      that mission, and with responsibility for managing its
                                      own risks and performance. An enterprise may consist of
                                      all or some of the following business aspects: acquisition,
                                      program management, financial management (e.g.,
                                      budgets), human resources, security, and information
                                      systems, information and mission management. See
                                      Organization.
 Enterprise Architecture              The description of an enterprise’s entire set of
 [CNSSI 4009]                         information systems: how they are configured, how they
                                      are integrated, how they interface to the external
                                      environment at the enterprise’s boundary, how they are
                                      operated to support the enterprise mission, and how they
                                      contribute to the enterprise’s overall security posture.
 Environment of Operation             The physical surroundings in which an information
 [NIST SP 800-37]                     system processes, stores, and transmits information.
 Executive Agency                     An executive department specified in 5 U.S.C., Sec. 101;
 [41 U.S.C., Sec. 403]                a military department specified in 5 U.S.C., Sec. 102; an
                                      independent establishment as defined in 5 U.S.C., Sec.
                                      104(1); and a wholly owned Government corporation
                                      fully subject to the provisions of 31 U.S.C., Chapter 91.
 Federal Agency                       See Executive Agency.
 Federal Information                  An information system used or operated by an executive
 System                               agency, by a contractor of an executive agency, or by
 [40 U.S.C., Sec. 11331]              another organization on behalf of an executive agency.
 Hybrid Security Control              A security control that is implemented in an information
 [NIST SP 800-53]                     system in part as a common control and in part as a
                                      system-specific control. See Common Control and
                                      System-Specific Security Control.
 Individuals                          An assessment object that includes people applying
                                      specifications, mechanisms, or activities.
 Industrial Control System            An information system used to control industrial
                                      processes such as manufacturing, product handling,
                                      production, and distribution. Industrial control systems
                                      include supervisory control and data acquisition systems
                                      used to control geographically dispersed assets, as well as
                                      distributed control systems and smaller control systems
                                      using programmable logic controllers to control localized
                                      processes.
 Information                          Any communication or representation of knowledge such
