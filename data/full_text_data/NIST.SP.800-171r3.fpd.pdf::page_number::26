362   3.1.11. Session Termination
363             REQUIREMENT: 03.01.11
364             Terminate a user session automatically after [Assignment: organization-defined conditions or
365             trigger events requiring session disconnect].

366             DISCUSSION
367             This requirement addresses the termination of user-initiated logical sessions in contrast to the
368             termination of network connections that are associated with communications sessions (i.e.,
369             disconnecting from the network) in 03.13.09. A logical session is initiated whenever a user (or
370             processes acting on behalf of a user) accesses a system. Logical sessions can be terminated (and
371             thus terminate user access) without terminating network sessions. Session termination ends all
372             system processes associated with a userâ€™s logical session except those processes that are created
373             by the user (i.e., session owner) to continue after the session is terminated. Conditions or trigger
374             events that require automatic session termination can include organization-defined periods of
375             user inactivity, time-of-day restrictions on system use, and targeted responses to certain types of
376             incidents.

380   3.1.12. Remote Access
381             REQUIREMENT: 03.01.12
382             a. Establish usage restrictions, configuration requirements, and connection requirements for
383                each type of allowable remote system access.
384             b. Authorize each type of remote system access prior to establishing such connections.
385             c.   Route remote access to the system through authorized and managed access control points.
386             d. Authorize remote execution of privileged commands and remote access to security-relevant
387                information.

388             DISCUSSION
389             Remote access to the system represents a significant potential vulnerability that can be exploited
390             by adversaries. Monitoring and controlling remote access methods allows organizations to
391             detect attacks and ensure compliance with remote access policies. This occurs by auditing the
392             connection activities of remote users on the systems. Routing remote access through managed
393             access control points enhances explicit control over such connections and reduces susceptibility
394             to unauthorized access to the system, which could result in the unauthorized disclosure of CUI.
