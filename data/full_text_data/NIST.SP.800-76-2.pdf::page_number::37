6.7.1           Properties of iris cameras

6.7.1.1      Scope
The following sub-sections support interoperable recognition by specifying iris camera and iris image properties.
Additionally, when selecting iris cameras, Agencies should consult informative Annex B.

6.7.1.2      Format
The camera shall produce, possibly in conjunction with client-side software, conformant Table 11 [IRISSTD, Image Type
2] instances (suitable for use in an authentication transaction).

6.7.1.3      Iris size
All iris images prepared in PIV (for storage on cards, for authentication and other purposes) shall have an iris diameter
between 160 and 280 pixels. If the camera or client software detects an iris of radius outside this range, re-capture of
the PIV cardholder's iris images should be attempted at least two times. The recapture requirement is intended to
correct out-of-focus irises that have incorrect diameter.
Interpolation of iris images to increase size shall not be performed, unless the physical iris size is actually below 9mm.
Thus the optical design of the camera shall ensure that an iris of physical dimension 10 mm produces an iris of
diameter at least 160 pixels in the digital image.

6.7.1.4      Rectilinear imaging and aspect ratio
The output of the camera shall be a rectilinear image of the iris region. The digital representation of the iris shall
exhibit minimal projective distortion such that the vertical and horizontal scale factors are uniform to within ±2%
throughout the image.

6.7.1.5      Spectral properties of the illuminant
The iris camera shall use dedicated infrared illuminators emitting light in the [700,900] wavelength interval. Cameras
that are primarily sensitive to visible light (e.g.,as used for face photography) are not suitable for PIV and shall not be
used. See Annex B.

6.7.1.6      Safety of the illuminant
The camera shall conform to relevant (irradiance and exposure duration) limits specified for infrared illumination
given in [ICNIRP-LED, ICNIRP-BB] and the threshold limit values specified in [IECLAMP].

6.7.2         Specifications for iris record generators
Production of the standard PIV Card records of Section 6.3 is a non-trivial task because it requires iris detection, and
localization, and preparation of the Figure 5B image. A standard record generator shall be certified if all of the
following hold.
                                            18
―      It converts all PIV-representative captured images to syntactically conformant Table 9 [IRISSTD, Image Type 7]
       instances (suitable for enrollment on PIV Cards).
―      The median time taken to convert PIV-representative captured images to Table 9 [IRISSTD] records is below 0.5
              19
       seconds each.
―      At least one matcher verifies its uncompressed single-eye Table 9 records with false non-match rate (FNMR) no
       higher than the FNMR measured for the parent Table 11 images, when the threshold is set to achieve a false
       match rate (FMR) at or below 0.0001. This specification ensures that the crop, mask and centering operations
       alone do not degrade accuracy (before compression is applied).
―      The images meet the [IRISSTD] requirements for cropping, centering, masking, and boundary blurring.
       Particularly, the eyelids and sclera shall be masked.

     These are 640x480 images conforming to Image Type 2 of [IRISSTD].

  This specification applies to a commercial-off-the-shelf PC procured in 2010 and equipped with a 2GHz processor and 8GB of main memory. This
 specification shall be adjusted by the testing organization to reflect significant changes of the computational platform.
