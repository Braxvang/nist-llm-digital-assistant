OT Discussion: Some OT equipment may be more susceptible to DoS attacks due to the time
criticality of some OT applications. Risk-based analysis informs the prioritization of DoS
protection and the establishment of policy and procedure.

No OT Discussion for this control.
Control Enhancement: (3) (4) (5) (7) (8) (21) No OT discussion for this control.
Control Enhancement: (18) OT Discussion: The organization selects an appropriate failure mode
(e.g., permit or block all communications).
Control Enhancement: (28) OT Discussion: Organizations consider the need for a direct
connection to a public network for each OT system, including potential benefits, additional threat
vectors, and potential adverse impacts that are specifically relevant to the type of public access
that connection introduces.
Control Enhancement: (29) OT Discussion: Subnets can be used to isolate low-risk functions
from higher-risk ones and control from safety. Subnets should be considered along with other
boundary protection technologies.
