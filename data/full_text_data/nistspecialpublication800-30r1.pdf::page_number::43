________________________________________________________________________________________________

The overall likelihood of a threat event is a combination of: (i) the likelihood that the event will occur (e.g., due to
human error or natural disaster) or be initiated by an adversary; and (ii) the likelihood that the initiation/occurrence will
result in adverse impacts. Organizations assess the overall likelihood of threat events by using inputs from Tables G-2,
G-3, and G-4. Any specific algorithm or rule for combining the determined likelihood values depends on: (i) general
organizational attitudes toward risk, including overall risk tolerance and tolerance for uncertainty; (ii) specific
tolerances toward uncertainty in different risk factors; and (iii) organizational weighting of risk factors. For example,
organizations could use any of the following rules (or could define a different rule): (i) use the maximum of the two
likelihood values; (ii) use the minimum of the two likelihood values; (iii) consider likelihood of initiation/occurrence
only, assuming that if threat events are initiated or occur, the events will result in adverse impacts; (iv) consider
likelihood of impact only, assuming that if threat events could result in adverse impacts, adversaries will initiate the
events; or (v) take a weighted average of the two likelihood values. Organizations make explicit the rules used.
Appendix G provides a set of exemplary tables for use in determining likelihood of threat events:
• Table G-1 provides a set of exemplary inputs to the likelihood determination task;
• Table G-2 provides an exemplary assessment scale for assessing the likelihood of initiation for adversarial threat
  events;
• Table G-3 provides an exemplary assessment scale for assessing the likelihood of non-adversarial threat events
  occurring;
• Table G-4 provides an exemplary assessment scale for assessing the likelihood of threat events having adverse
  impacts if the events are initiated (adversarial) or occur (non-adversarial); and
• Table G-5 provides an exemplary assessment scale for assessing the overall likelihood of threat events (i.e., a
  combination of the likelihood of initiation/occurrence and the likelihood of impact).
The information produced in Task 2-4 provides threat event likelihood inputs to the risk tables in Appendix I.




                                    Summary of Key Activities – Task 2-4

       •    Identify likelihood determination inputs (see Table G-1, as tailored by the organization).
       •    Identify likelihood determination factors using organization-defined information sources
            (e.g., threat source characteristics, vulnerabilities, predisposing conditions).
       •    Assess the likelihood of threat event initiation for adversarial threats and the likelihood of
            threat event occurrence for non-adversarial threats (see Table G-2 and Table G-3, as tailored
            by the organization).
       •    Assess the likelihood of threat events resulting in adverse impacts, given likelihood of
            initiation or occurrence (see Table G-4, as tailored by the organization).
       •    Assess the overall likelihood of threat event initiation/occurrence and likelihood of threat
            events resulting in adverse impacts (see Table G-5, as tailored by the organization).
       •    Update Columns 7, 10, and 11 in Table I-5 for adversarial risk (see Table G-2, Table G-4, and
            Table G-5); or update Columns 5, 8, and 9 in Table I-7 for non-adversarial risk (see Table G-3,
            Table G-4, and Table G-5).




DETERMINE IMPACT
TASK 2-5: Determine the adverse impacts from threat events of concern considering: (i) the characteristics of
the threat sources that could initiate the events; (ii) the vulnerabilities/predisposing conditions identified;
and (iii) the susceptibility reflecting the safeguards/countermeasures planned or implemented to impede
such events.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations describe adverse impacts in terms of the potential harm caused to organizational
operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation. Where the threat event occurs and whether the
effects of the event are contained or spread, influences the severity of the impact. Assessing impact can involve
identifying assets or potential targets of threat sources, including information resources (e.g., information, data
