CA-1      CERTIFICATION, ACCREDITATION, AND SECURITY ASSESSMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

          Control: The organization develops, disseminates, and periodically reviews/updates: (i) formal,
          documented, security assessment and certification and accreditation policies that address purpose,
          scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational
          entities, and compliance; and (ii) formal, documented procedures to facilitate the implementation
          of the security assessment and certification and accreditation policies and associated assessment,
          certification, and accreditation controls.
          Supplemental Guidance: The security assessment and certification and accreditation policies and
          procedures are consistent with applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations,
          standards, and guidance. The security assessment and certification and accreditation policies can
          be included as part of the general information security policy for the organization. Security
          assessment and certification and accreditation procedures can be developed for the security
          program in general, and for a particular information system, when required. The organization
          defines what constitutes a significant change to the information system to achieve consistent
          security reaccreditations. NIST Special Publication 800-53A provides guidance on security
          control assessments. NIST Special Publication 800-37 provides guidance on security certification
          and accreditation. NIST Special Publication 800-12 provides guidance on security policies and
          procedures.
          Control Enhancements: None.
