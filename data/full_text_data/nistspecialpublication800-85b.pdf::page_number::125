Special Publication 800-85B                                   PIV Data Model Testing Specification


Test Steps              1. Set cardHandle := <<valid card handle>>
                        2. Set OID := <<PIV Authentication Certificate
                           (2.16.840.1.101.3.7.2.1.1)>>
                        3. Call pivGetData w/
                           • (IN) cardHandle
                              • (IN) OID
                              • (OUT) data
                        4. Extract the value of the keyUsage extension field from
                           the certificate

Expected Result(s)      The digitalSignature bit has been set. No other bits have been set.


11.1.2.2 Verify id-fpki-common-authentication OID

Purpose                 Confirms that the PIV Authentication certificate asserts the id-fpki-
                        common-authentication OID.
Reference(s)            1.    AS07.01.06
Precondition            1.    A valid PIV card is inserted into the contact reader.
                        2.    A valid PC/SC connection exists between the test application and
                              the contact reader.
                        3.    The test application is currently connected to the card application
                              which is accessible through card handle.
                        4.    A PIV authentication key and corresponding certificate are present
                              on the PIV card.
Test Steps              1. Set cardHandle := <<valid card handle>>
                        2. Set OID := <<PIV Authentication Certificate
                           (2.16.840.1.101.3.7.2.1.1)>>
                        3. Call pivGetData w/
                           • (IN) cardHandle
                              • (IN) OID
                              • (OUT) data

                        4.    Extract certificatePolicies->policyIdentifier
                              extension field values from the certificate
Expected Result(s)      A policyIdentifier field in the certificatePolicies extension asserts id-
                        fpki-common-authentication.


11.1.2.3 Verify authority information access extension

Purpose                 Confirms the authority information access extension is populated with
                        the location to the OCSP Server that provides status information for this
                        certificate.
