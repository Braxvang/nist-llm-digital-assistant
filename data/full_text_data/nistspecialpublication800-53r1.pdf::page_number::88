CP-3      CONTINGENCY TRAINING

          Control: The organization trains personnel in their contingency roles and responsibilities with
          respect to the information system and provides refresher training [Assignment: organization-
          defined frequency, at least annually].
          Supplemental Guidance: None.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization incorporates simulated events into contingency training to facilitate effective
                response by personnel in crisis situations.
          (2)   The organization employs automated mechanisms to provide a more thorough and realistic
                training environment.

CP-4      CONTINGENCY PLAN TESTING AND EXERCISES

          Control: The organization: (i) tests and/or exercises the contingency plan for the information
          system [Assignment: organization-defined frequency, at least annually] using [Assignment:
          organization-defined tests and/or exercises] to determine the plan’s effectiveness and the
          organization’s readiness to execute the plan; and (ii) reviews the contingency plan test/exercise
          results and initiates corrective actions.
          Supplemental Guidance: There are several methods for testing and/or exercising contingency plans
          to identify potential weaknesses (e.g., full-scale contingency plan testing, functional/tabletop
          exercises). The depth and rigor of contingency plan testing and/or exercises increases with the
          FIPS 199 impact level of the information system. Contingency plan testing and/or exercises also
          include a determination of the effects on organizational operations and assets (e.g., reduction in
          mission capability) and individuals arising due to contingency operations in accordance with the
          plan. NIST Special Publication 800-84 provides guidance on test, training, and exercise programs
          for information technology plans and capabilities.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization coordinates contingency plan testing and/or exercises with organizational
                elements responsible for related plans.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Examples of related plans include Business Continuity
                Plan, Disaster Recovery Plan, Continuity of Operations Plan, Business Recovery Plan,
                Incident Response Plan, and Emergency Action Plan.
          (2)   The organization tests/exercises the contingency plan at the alternate processing site to familiarize
                contingency personnel with the facility and available resources and to evaluate the site’s
                capabilities to support contingency operations.
          (3)   The organization employs automated mechanisms to more thoroughly and effectively test/exercise
                the contingency plan by providing more complete coverage of contingency issues, selecting more
                realistic test/exercise scenarios and environments, and more effectively stressing the information
                system and supported missions.
