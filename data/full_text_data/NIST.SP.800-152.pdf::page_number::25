SP 800-152                                                    A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


3.4.1 Accommodate User Ability and Preferences
An FCKMS should accommodate differences in user abilities and preferences when
managing their keys and metadata. Differences generally include user knowledge,
experience, task familiarity, and motivation. Preferences often vary between user control and
system control.

An FCKMS could provide fully automated security services to a user or an application, based
on the organizational policy. It could provide a combination of automated security services
and those selected and controlled by a user or application. An FCKMS should support user
control, based on organizational policy and user desires, and provide one or more security-
service-control interfaces for its users and managers.

FR:3.10 The CKMS design shall specify all user interfaces to the system.

FR:3.11 The CKMS design shall specify the results of any user-acceptance tests that have
been performed regarding the ease of using the proposed user interfaces.

                           A Federal CKMS should support user interfaces that:
PA:3.1
                             a) Require minimal user interactions with the FCKMS,
                             b) Are commensurate with the range of experience and
                                capability of its expected users,
                             c) Support a user initiating the generation of cryptographic
                                keys and associated metadata, and
                             d) Provide one or more security-service-control interfaces.

                           A Federal CKMS could provide fully automated services to a
PF:3.2
                           user or an application, based on organizational policy.

3.4.2 Design Principles of the User Interface
Ease-of-use design goals should assure that:
   a) It is intuitive and easy to do the right thing,
   b) It is not easy to do the wrong thing, and
   c) It is intuitive and easy to recover when a wrong thing is done.
FR:3.12 The CKMS design shall specify the design principles of the user interface.

FR:3.13 The CKMS design shall specify all human error-prevention or failsafe features
designed into the system.

                           A Federal CKMS shall support features that are designed to
PR:3.2
                           detect and/or mitigate incorrect user input.


                           A Federal CKMS should support user interfaces (as needed)
PA:3.2
                           that assist the user in selecting and using appropriate security
