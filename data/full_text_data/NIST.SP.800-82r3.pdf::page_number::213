D.2.   Research Initiatives and Programs

D.2.1. Clean Energy Cybersecurity Accelerator Initiative
This initiative is led by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the National Renewable
Energy Laboratory (NREL) and brings together federal infrastructure and expertise, asset owners
in the energy sector, and technology innovators in a unified effort to catalyze the development of
new cybersecurity solutions for the Nation’s future clean energy grid.
The Cybersecurity Accelerator program offers a world-class facility for asset owners of all sizes
and types to work jointly to develop and deploy renewable, modern, and secure grid technologies
that are cost competitive. These innovative technologies will also advance the state of the
practice in demonstrating “security by design,” thus ensuring that cybersecurity is built into
renewable technologies and architectures at the start of the design and development process, not
bolted on after deployment.

D.2.2. Cybersecurity for Energy Delivery Systems (CEDS) R&D Program
The Department of Energy (DOE) Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response
(CESER) Office designed the CEDS R&D program in 2010 to develop cybersecurity solutions
for energy delivery systems through a focused research and development effort. Since then, DOE
CESER has invested more than $240 million with industry partners to make advances in
cybersecurity capabilities for energy delivery systems. These research partnerships are helping to
detect, prevent, and mitigate the consequences of a cyber incident for current and future energy
delivery systems.
