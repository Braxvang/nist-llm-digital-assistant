       Managing OT Security Risk
While the risk management process presented in NIST SP 800-39 [SP800-39] applies to all types
of systems, there are some unique aspects to consider when it comes to managing OT system
security risk. As shown in Fig. 13, the risk management process has four components: framing
risk (i.e., establishing the context for risk-based decisions), assessing risk, responding to risk,
and monitoring risk. These activities are interdependent and often occur simultaneously within
an organization. For example, the results of the monitoring component will feed into the framing
component. Because the environment in which organizations operate is always changing, risk
management must be a continuous process in which all components have ongoing activities. It is
important to remember that these components apply to the management of any type of risk,
including cybersecurity, physical security, safety, and financial. Sections 4.1.1 through 4.1.4
discuss the four components of the risk management process in further detail and provide OT-
specific implementation guidance.

Organization-wide risk management is applied at three levels, as Fig. 14 depicts. Level 1
addresses risk management from the organizational perspective and implements risk framing by
providing context for all risk management activities within the organization. Level 2 addresses
risk from a mission and business process perspective and is informed by the Level 1 risk context,
decisions, and activities. Level 3 addresses risk at the system level and is informed by the Level
1 and 2 activities and outputs.
