       NIST SP 800-63-4 ipd                                               Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022


996    5.1.2. Identify Impact Categories and Potential Harms
997    Initial assurance levels for digital transactions SHALL be determined by assessing the
998    potential impact of, at a minimum, each of the following categories:
999        • Damage to mission delivery
1000       • Damage to trust or reputation
1001       • Loss of sensitive information
1002       • Damage to or loss of economic stability
1003       • Loss of life or damage to safety, health, or environmental stability
1004       • Noncompliance with laws, regulations, and/or contractual obligations
1005   Organizations SHOULD include additional impact categories as appropriate based on
1006   their mission. Each impact category SHALL be documented and consistently applied
1007   across different applications assessed by the organization.
1008   Harms are any adverse effects that would be experienced by an entity. They provide a
1009   means to more effectively understand the impact categories and how they may apply to
1010   specific entities associated with that application. Agencies SHOULD consider specific
1011   harms for each of the defined impact categories to better inform their impact analysis.
1012   Identification of harms for each category SHALL be done for each of the entities
1013   identified during “entity identification” process.
1014   Examples of harms associated with each category include, but are not limited to:
1015   Damage to mission delivery:
1016       • Harms to individuals may include the inability to access government services or
1017         benefits for which they are eligible.
1018       • Harms to the organization may include an inability to perform current
1019         mission/business functions in a sufficiently timely manner, with sufficient
1020         confidence and/or correctness, within planned resource constraints, or an inability,
1021         or limited ability, to perform mission/business functions in the future.
1022   Damage to trust or reputation:
1023       • Harms to individuals may include impersonation or damage to image or reputation.
1024       • Harms to the organization may include damage to trust relationships, image, or
1025         reputation including future, potential trust relationships.
1026   Loss of sensitive information:
1027       • Harms to individuals includes loss of PII or other sensitive information, which may
1028         result in secondary harms such as loss of economic stability, loss of life, physical or
1029         psychological injury, impersonation, identity theft, or persistent inconvenience.
