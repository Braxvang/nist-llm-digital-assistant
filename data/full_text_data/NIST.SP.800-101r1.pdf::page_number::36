to obtain detailed logs of data extraction and other transactions that would aid in validation. An
examiner can compare the output of several tools to verify the consistency of results. While
tool validation is time consuming, it is a necessary practice to follow. As a quality measure,
forensic specialists should also receive adequate up-to-date training in the tools and procedures
they employ.

An important characteristic of a forensic tool is its ability to maintain the integrity of the
original data source being acquired and also that of the extracted data. The former is done by
blocking or otherwise eliminating write requests to the device containing the data. The latter is
done by computing a cryptographic hash over the contents of the evidence files created and
recurrently verifying that this value remains unchanged throughout the lifetime of those files.
Preserving integrity not only maintains credibility from a legal perspective, but it also allows
any subsequent investigation to use the same baseline for replicating the analysis.


    Forensic Hash Validation: A forensic hash is used to maintain the integrity of an acquisition by
    computing a cryptographically strong, non-reversible value over the acquired data. After
    acquisition, any changes made to the data may be detected, since a new hash value computed
    over the data will be inconsistent with the old value. For non-forensic tools, hash values should be
    created using a tool such as sha1sum and retained for integrity verification. Even tools labeled as
    forensic tools may not compute a cryptographic hash, and in these cases an integrity hash should
    be computed separately.

    Note that mobile devices are constantly active and update information (e.g., the device clock)
    continuously. Therefore, back-to-back acquisitions of a device will be slightly different and
    produce different hash values when computed over all the data. However, hash values computed
    over selected data items, such as individual files and directories, generally remain consistent.
    Hash inconsistencies may occur requiring the examiner to perform an element-by-element
    verification ensuring data integrity. Hash validation across multiple tools is challenging due to
    proprietary reporting formats.
