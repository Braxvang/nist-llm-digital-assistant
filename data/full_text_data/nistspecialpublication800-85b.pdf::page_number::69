Special Publication 800-85B                                PIV Data Model Testing Specification


Precondition(s)         1. A valid PIV card is inserted into the contact reader.
                        2. A valid PC/SC connection exists between the test application and
                           the contact reader.
                        3. The test application is currently connected to the card application
                            which is accessible through card handle.
                        4. A valid Card Holder Facial Image object is present on the PIV card.
                        5. Security conditions to read the object are met.
Test Scenario           1. Set cardHandle := <<valid card handle>>
                        2. Set OID := <<Card Holder Facial Image
                           (2.16.840.1.101.3.7.2.96.48)>>
                        3. Call pivGetData w/
                            • (IN) cardHandle
                              • (IN) OID
                              • (OUT) data
                        4. Extract the value field for tag 0xBC, extract the first
                           88 bytes (CBEFF Header) and read the Validity Period
                           field (based on its position) in CBEFF Header.
Expected Result(s) The Validity Period contains two dates and each is encoded in the
                   YYYYMMDDhhmmssZ format.

                        4. Extract the Biometric Type field of CBEFF Header.
                        5. Extract the value field for tag 0xBC, extract the first
                           88 bytes (CBEFF Header) and read the Biometric Type field
                           (based on its position) in CBEFF Header.
Expected Result(s) The value of the Biometric Type field for the facial image is 0x000002
