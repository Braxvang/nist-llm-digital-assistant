Appendix C. Example of Creating a Benchmark Using ODVs
This appendix provides an example of tailoring a baseline to create a custom benchmark using
the generate_baseline.py script. The screenshot below illustrates the first step to creating a
benchmark.




                                 Fig. 14. Generate baseline command.



The -t option for generate_baseline.py is used to customize the specified baseline. The
script prompts for a name for the benchmark being created, as the example below shows.




                                 Fig. 15. Prompt for benchmark name.



Next, for each rule that exists in the specified starting baseline, the script asks if it should be
included in the custom benchmark. An example is shown below.




                                  Fig. 16. Prompt for rule file inclusion.
