2.7.2. Produce Advisory
The FCB should be the primary focal point of government vulnerability advisories. However,
this should not preclude an agency from releasing advisories for vulnerabilities in their systems
or communicating with appropriate stakeholders. 7 Advisories should publish or disclose
information about identifying and remediating the vulnerability with a brief, high-level summary
of the vulnerability to help users understand the salient points of the findings report and quickly
determine if the advisory applies to their environment.
For actively exploited vulnerabilities without available remediation, advisories could inform
users of the current threat and the steps to take in order to reduce risk. When other products share
vulnerabilities with other products and/or systems, authors should coordinate the timing of
advisory releases with those product and/or system owners. The advisory elements should
contain sufficient information to enable the target audience to decide if the vulnerabilities are
relevant and how to remediate them. The timing of the release of advisories should balance risk
with potential disruption to users. For example, batched or scheduled releases may minimize
disruption.
Advisory authors should also consider the needs of the intended audience and produce advisories
that are effective in terms of informational content, distribution mechanisms, and presentation
format. The typical audience includes users who are responsible for identifying vulnerable
systems and performing remediation. Advisories may include sections for specific audiences,
such as further remediation advice for developers, system administrators, or end users.
Audience-specific language in an advisory is optional.
The following elements should be considered for inclusion in an advisory:
        â€¢    Advisory identifiers and vulnerability identifiers should include the product name;
             version information; a reference to a known, supported, and affected product, as well as
             instructions to verify the version of the product; and a unique and consistent identifier to
             minimize confusion with different advisories or vulnerabilities. Advisory authors should
             choose a common, shared vulnerability identification system, such as CVE. However, the
             information should not give too much detail to avoid enabling exploitation of the
             vulnerability. Helpful information to describe affected products can include:
                   o Common or historical product names
                   o Version numbers or strings
                   o Class or type of vulnerabilities (e.g., CWE taxonomy)
                   o File hashes
                   o Proof-of-concept code to safely test for the existence of the vulnerability
