                                                                                           GUIDE TO SECURE WEB SERVICES



Attribute management can also be a concern with WS-Security. With the availability of SAML, many
Web services may use Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC), which allows users to be authorized
based on their attributes rather than their roles or user IDs. Attributes can include a user’s role, location,
nationality, organization or clearance. Attribute management is important even without ABAC, as Web
services may require information about various entities during the course of a Web service transaction.

3.2     Identity Management

Identity management for SOA encompasses the full range of identity-related events, information, and
documents by which an entity’s identity is verified, identity documents and credentials are issued to the
entity, and entity identities are authenticated at point of entry into the SOA. In the SOA, an entity’s
identity forms the basis for both authorization and trust.

An Identity Management System (IDMS), such as that pictured in Figure 3-1, is responsible for verifying
the identities of entities, registering them, and issuing them digital identifiers. In accordance with
Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD) 12, Subject: Policy for a Common Identification
Standard for Federal Employees and Contractors 27, NIST Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS)
201-1, Personal Identity Verification of Federal Employees and Contractors 28, describes a number of
requirements that must be satisfied before a human entity may be registered in a Federal IDMS, including
a National Agency Check and Inquiries (NACI) background check. Non-government organizations may
have different rules for registration. For example, users who wish to gain access to many e-commerce
sites often need to provide only a valid email address and a credit card number.
