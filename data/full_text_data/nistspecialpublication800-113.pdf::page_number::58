                                                                                       GUIDE TO SSL VPNS



 Authentication. Users and groups should be able to authenticate and be granted access to resources.
  If various groups or access to different resources require different authentication methods, then this
  should be verified too.
 Access Control. Resources should be protected in accordance with the access control policy that was
  established. This should be verified by monitoring network traffic and checking SSL VPN device
  logs. If packet filtering or multiple routing tables are used as a means of enforcing access control,
  then this needs to be verified as well.
 Application and Client Interoperability. The solution should not break or interfere with the use of
  existing software applications. This is especially relevant for applications that are translated to be
  accessible by SSL VPN, or for complex Web sites that are processed by the SSL VPN reverse proxy.
  It also applies to SSL VPN client software issues (e.g., conflict between active content components
  and other parts of the client operating system).
 Management. Administrators should be able to configure and manage the solution effectively and
  securely. This includes all components such as devices, management servers, and client software.
  Administrators should verify that they can create backups and restore from them.
 Network Management. If the organization has built a network management infrastructure, this
  infrastructure should periodically monitor uptime and possibly performance of the SSL VPN devices.
  Either the devices should send Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) traps to indicate a
  warning or critical issue or the network management system should determine this through its polling
  process.
 Logging. The logging and data management functions should work properly in accordance with the
  organization’s policies and strategies.
 Performance. The SSL VPN implementation should provide adequate performance during normal
  and peak usage. It is important to consider not only the performance of the primary SSL VPN
  components but also that of intermediate devices such as routers and firewalls. Encrypted traffic
  often consumes more processing power than unencrypted traffic, so it may cause bottlenecks. The
  additional resources necessitated by SSL vary widely based on several factors, including the
  encryption algorithm. Performance also involves the amount of time it takes to establish an SSL
  VPN session; this can be affected by the demands of the back-end authentication system (e.g.,
  RADIUS, LDAP, AD) and also by the size of the keys in the server’s certificate. Also, because
  traffic is encapsulated within an SSL connection, intermediate network devices may need to fragment
  packets, possibly slowing network activity. The typical solution for these types of problems is to
  reduce the size of the maximum transmission unit (MTU) value on the host originating the network
  traffic. The MTU is the maximum allowable packet size. The MTU might be able to be lowered by
  the network administrator so that SSL-encapsulated packets are not large enough to require
  fragmentation. In many cases, the best way to test the performance under load of a prototype
  implementation is to use simulated traffic generators on a live test network to mimic the actual
  characteristics of expected traffic as closely as possible. Testing should incorporate a variety of
  applications that will be used with the SSL VPN implementation, especially those most likely to be
  affected by network throughput or latency issues. Addressing performance problems generally
  involves upgrading or replacing hardware, using an SSL accelerator to offload SSL processing, or
  reducing processing demands (e.g., limiting the number of simultaneous users, limiting the amount of
  encrypted application traffic).
 Portal Design and Layout. The portal provided for SSL VPN access should be intuitive and
  straightforward to navigate. It should also contain the features required by users and only display the
