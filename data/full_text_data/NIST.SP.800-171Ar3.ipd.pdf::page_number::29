      NIST SP 800-171Ar3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                          Assessing CUI Security Requirements
      November 2023

719             ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE
720             Determine if:
721             A.03.01.12.a[01]: types of allowable remote system access are defined.
722             A.03.01.12.a[02]: usage restrictions are established for each type of allowable remote system
723             access.
724             A.03.01.12.a[03]: configuration requirements are established for each type of allowable remote
725             system access.
726             A.03.01.12.a[04]: connection requirements are established for each type of allowable remote
727             system access.
728             A.03.01.12.b: each type of remote system access is authorized prior to establishing such
729             connections.
730             A.03.01.12.c: remote access to the system is routed through managed access control points.
731             A.03.01.12.d[1]: remote execution of privileged commands is authorized.
732             A.03.01.12.d[2]: remote access to security-relevant information is authorized.
