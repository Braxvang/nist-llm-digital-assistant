                                                                 GUIDELINES ON SECURING PUBLIC WEB SERVERS



The disadvantages of a DMZ from a security standpoint are as follows:

 DoS attacks aimed at the Web server may have an effect on the internal network.

 Depending on the firewall configuration controlling traffic between the DMZ and internal network, it
  may be possible for the Web server to be used to attack or compromise hosts on the internal network.
  In other words, protection offered by the DMZ depends in large part on the firewall configuration.

For organizations that support their own Web server, a DMZ is almost invariably the best option. It
offers protection for the Web server and other externally accessible servers without exposing the internal
network. However, it should only be considered secure when employed in conjunction with the other
steps discussed in this document.

8.1.3   Outsourced Hosting

Some organizations choose to outsource the hosting of their Web servers to a third party (e.g., an ISP,
Web hosting service, or other government agency). In this case, the Web server would not be located on
the organization’s network. The hosting service network would have a dedicated network that hosts many
Web servers (for many organizations) operating on a single network (see Figure 8-4).




                                Figure 8-4. Outsourced Web Server Hosting

From a security standpoint, the advantages of outsourcing are as follows:

 DoS attacks aimed at the Web server have no effect on the organization’s production network.

 Compromise of the Web server does not directly threaten the internal production network.

 The outsourcer may have greater knowledge of securing and protecting Web servers.
