NIST SP 800-124r2                                                 Guidelines for Managing the Security
May 2023                                                           of Mobile Devices in the Enterprise

Unidentified mobile devices may leave holes in the enterprise’s infrastructure. These devices
may not acquire the necessary security configuration, which leaves the mobile user and the
enterprise unprotected from vulnerabilities and exploits. Malware or unauthorized access to the
enterprise’s network through the unidentified mobile device can leave the enterprise unaware of
vulnerable attacks due to lack of visibility. Identifying current inventory may be performed
through an inventory management methodology. NIST and DHS produced NISTIR 8011,
Automation Support for Security Control Assessments Volume 2: Hardware Asset Management
[33], which provides operational guidance for automating and assessing FISMA security controls
with regard to hardware asset management.

5.1.3. Choose Deployment Model

Organizational leaders may choose from a variety of deployment models for the mobile devices
to be used within their enterprise. A deployment model captures alternative options for device
ownership, as well as policy and technological controls that manage device behavior. The
spectrum of options ranges from devices issued by (i.e., purchased or leased by) and fully
managed by the enterprise to devices owned by individuals with little or no enterprise
management of device interaction with enterprise systems. The following sections describe three
of the most commonly used categories of options in the spectrum. NIST SP 800-114, Rev. 1,
User’s Guide to Telework and Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) Security, identifies similar
categories in the context of devices used for teleworking [34]. Additional related telework
security guidance can be found in NIST SP 800-46, Rev. 2, Guide to Enterprise Telework,
Remote Access, and Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) Security [48].

5.1.3.1.       Strict Enterprise Usage
Enterprise-enabled mobile devices are issued and owned by the organization, and all users
should be made aware that all information and data on those devices are controlled by the
organization. Within the Federal Government, this deployment model is sometimes known as
Government-furnished equipment (GFE). This section covers enterprise-enabled mobile devices
that are provided to employees for enterprise use only. GFE devices strictly limit personal use;
employees typically own and carry a separate personal device.
Enterprise-enabled mobile devices provide significant security benefits. Organizational leaders
may consider the supply chain of candidate devices before selecting devices for purchase, and IT
system administrators may develop device hardening plans before the products arrive. At
deployment time, the IT staff may configure restrictive policy settings to significantly alter the
functionality of the device, such as removing text messaging functionality, restricting WiFi and
Bluetooth access, and ensuring that communication takes place over a VPN. In this model of
enterprise-enabled device deployment, trade-offs between security and functional usability can
be made entirely at the discretion of organizational leaders.
An example of a strictly enterprise-enabled deployment is a GFE that is provisioned to the end
user as a fully managed or supervised device. Mobile security technologies include enrolling the
device into an MDM with the use of MTD for endpoint protection and access to enterprise
resources through web-based interfaces or mobile applications. An allowlist approach is
implemented for mobile app deployments; all mobile apps on the device will be examined
