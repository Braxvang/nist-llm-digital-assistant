GUIDE TO INTRUSION DETECTION AND PREVENTION SYSTEMS (IDPS)



change management systems, administrators could review change management records regularly and
adjust host inventory information in the NBA to prevent false positives.

6.2.3.4 Technology Limitations

NBA technologies offer strong detection capabilities for certain types of threats, but they also have
significant limitations. Some of these limitations are described in Section 6.2.3.2. An important
limitation is the delay in detecting attacks. Some delay is inherent in anomaly detection methods that are
based on deviations from a baseline, such as increased bandwidth usage or additional connection
attempts. However, NBA technologies often have additional delay caused by their data sources,
especially when they rely on flow data from routers and other network devices. This data is often
transferred to the NBA system in batches; depending on the product’s capabilities, network capacity, and
administrator preferences, this could occur relatively frequently (e.g., every minute, every two minutes) or
relatively infrequently (e.g., every 15 minutes, every 30 minutes). Because of this delay, attacks that
occur quickly, such as malware infestations and DoS attacks, may not be detected until they have already
disrupted or damaged systems.

This delay can be avoided by using sensors that do their own packet captures and analysis instead of
relying on flow data from other devices. However, performing packet captures and analysis is much more
resource-intensive than analyzing flow data. A single sensor can analyze flow data from many networks,
or perform direct monitoring (packet captures) itself generally for a few networks at most. Therefore, to
do direct monitoring instead of using flow data, organizations might have to purchase more powerful
sensors and/or more sensors.

6.2.4   Prevention Capabilities

NBA sensors offer various intrusion prevention capabilities, including the following (grouped by sensor
type):

 Passive Only

    –   Ending the Current TCP Session. A passive NBA sensor can attempt to end an existing TCP
        session by sending TCP reset packets to both endpoints.
 Inline Only

    –   Performing Inline Firewalling. Most inline NBA sensors offer firewall capabilities that can be
        used to drop or reject suspicious network activity.
 Both Passive and Inline

    –   Reconfiguring Other Network Security Devices. Many NBA sensors can instruct network
        security devices such as firewalls and routers to reconfigure themselves to block certain types of
        activity or route it elsewhere, such as a quarantine virtual local area network (VLAN).

    –   Running a Third-Party Program or Script. Some NBA sensors can run an administrator-
        specified script or program when certain malicious activity is detected.
Most NBA sensors allow administrators to specify the prevention capability configuration for each type
of alert. This usually includes enabling or disabling prevention, as well as specifying which type of
prevention capability should be used. Most NBA system implementations use prevention capabilities in a
limited fashion or not at all because of false positives; blocking a single false positive could cause major
