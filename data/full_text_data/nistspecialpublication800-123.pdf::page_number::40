administrator. To reduce this burden, automated log analysis tools have been developed (see Section
6.1.3).

In addition, a long-term and more in-depth analysis of the logs is needed. Because a server attack can
involve hundreds of unique requests, an attacker may attempt to disguise a server attack by increasing the
interval between requests. In this case, reviewing a single day’s or week’s logs may not show
recognizable trends. However, when trends are analyzed over a week, month, or quarter, multiple attacks
from the same host or subnet can be more easily recognized.

Log files should be protected to ensure that if an attacker does compromise a server, the log files cannot
be altered to cover the attack. Although encryption can be useful in protecting log files, the best solution
is to store log files on a host separate from the server. This is often called a centralized logging server.
Centralized logging is often performed using syslog, which is a standard logging protocol. 36 Alternately,
some organizations use security information and event management (SIEM) software that uses centralized
servers to perform log analysis, database servers to store logs, and either agents installed on the individual
hosts or processes running on the centralized servers to transfer server logs or log data from the hosts to
the servers and parse the logs. 37

Log files should be backed up and archived regularly. Archiving log files for a period of time is
important for several reasons, including supporting certain legal actions and troubleshooting problems
with the server. The retention period for archived log files depends on a number of factors, including the
following:

 Legal and regulatory requirements

 Organizational requirements

 Size of logs (which is directly related to the traffic of the site and the number of details logged)

 Value of server data and services

 Threat level.

6.1.3    Automated Log File Analysis Tools

Many servers receive significant amounts of traffic, and the log files quickly become voluminous.
Automated log analysis tools should be installed to ease the burden on server administrators. These tools
analyze the entries in the server log files and identify suspicious and unusual activity. As mentioned in
Section 6.1.2, some organizations use SIEM software for centralized logging, which can also perform
automated log file analysis. Many commercial and public domain tools are also available to support
regular analysis of particular types of server logs.

The automated log analyzer should forward any suspicious events to the responsible server administrator
or security incident response team as soon as possible for follow-up investigation. Some organizations
