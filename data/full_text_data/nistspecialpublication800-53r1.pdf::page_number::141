SI-4      INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES

          Control: The organization employs tools and techniques to monitor events on the information
          system, detect attacks, and provide identification of unauthorized use of the system.
          Supplemental Guidance: Information system monitoring capability is achieved through a variety of
          tools and techniques (e.g., intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems, malicious
          code protection software, audit record monitoring software, network monitoring software).
          Monitoring devices are strategically deployed within the information system (e.g., at selected
          perimeter locations, near server farms supporting critical applications) to collect essential
          information. Monitoring devices are also deployed at ad hoc locations within the system to track
          specific transactions. Additionally, these devices are used to track the impact of security changes
          to the information system. The granularity of the information collected is determined by the
          organization based upon its monitoring objectives and the capability of the information system to
          support such activities. Organizations consult appropriate legal counsel with regard to all
          information system monitoring activities. Organizations heighten the level of information system
          monitoring activity whenever there is an indication of increased risk to organizational operations,
          organizational assets, or individuals based on law enforcement information, intelligence
          information, or other credible sources of information. NIST Special Publication 800-61 provides
          guidance on detecting attacks through various types of security technologies. NIST Special
          Publication 800-83 provides guidance on detecting malware-based attacks through malicious code
          protection software. NIST Special Publication 800-92 provides guidance on monitoring and
          analyzing computer security event logs. NIST Special Publication 800-94 provides guidance on
          intrusion detection and prevention. Related security control: AC-8.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization interconnects and configures individual intrusion detection tools into a
                systemwide intrusion detection system using common protocols.
          (2)   The organization employs automated tools to support near-real-time analysis of events.
          (3)   The organization employs automated tools to integrate intrusion detection tools into access
                control and flow control mechanisms for rapid response to attacks by enabling reconfiguration of
                these mechanisms in support of attack isolation and elimination.
          (4)   The information system monitors inbound and outbound communications for unusual or
                unauthorized activities or conditions.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Unusual/unauthorized activities or conditions include, for
                example, the presence of malicious code, the unauthorized export of information, or signaling
                to an external information system.
          (5)   The information system provides a real-time alert when the following indications of compromise or
                potential compromise occur: [Assignment: organization-defined list of compromise indicators].
