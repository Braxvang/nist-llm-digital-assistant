Network and data security are essential in today’s environment of increasingly open and
interconnected systems, networks, and mobile devices. Cryptographic standards, algorithms,
and methods for encryption, key establishment, and digital signatures provide a critical
foundation for mobile device conversations, secure e-commerce transactions, electronic lock
access, and much more. Cryptography is a continually evolving field that drives research and
innovation. The Data Encryption Standard (DES) was groundbreaking but would fall far short
of the levels of protection needed today. The accomplishments below demonstrate NIST’s
continued dedication to the role it has fulfilled for nearly 50 years – leading public and private
collaborations to foster continued improvement and reliability in cryptographic techniques and
technology.
Post-Quantum Cryptography
In recent years, there has been steady progress in building quantum computers – machines
that exploit quantum mechanical phenomena to solve problems that are difficult or intractable
for conventional computers. When the capacity to build large-scale quantum computers exists,
they will be able to break many of the public-key cryptosystems currently in use. This would
seriously compromise the confidentiality and integrity of digital communications on the
internet and elsewhere. The goal of post-quantum cryptography (PQC ) (also called
quantum-resistant or quantum-safe cryptography) is to develop cryptographic systems that
are secure against both quantum and classical computers and that can be deployed
without drastic changes to existing communication protocols and networks.
