accomplished in a number of ways, such as with the Security Assertion Markup Language
(SAML) standard or the OpenID standard.

           Authentication. Authentication is the process of establishing confidence in user
            identities. Authentication assurance levels should be appropriate for the sensitivity of the
            application and information assets accessed and the risk involved [Bur06]. A growing
            number of cloud providers support the SAML standard and use it to administer users and
            authenticate them before providing access to applications and data. SAML provides a
            means to exchange information between cooperating domains. For example, a SAML
            transaction can convey assertions that a user has been authenticated by an identity
            provider and also include information about the user’s privileges. Upon receipt of the
            transaction, the service provider then uses the information to grant the user an appropriate
            level of access, once the identity and credentials supplied for the user are successfully
            verified.

            SAML request and response messages are typically mapped over SOAP,14 which relies
            on the eXtensible Markup Language (XML) for its format. SOAP messages are digitally
            signed. In a public cloud, for instance, once a user has established a public key certificate
            with the service, the private key can be used to sign SOAP requests.

            SOAP message security validation is complicated and must be carried out carefully to
            prevent attacks. XML wrapping attacks have been successfully demonstrated against a
            public IaaS cloud [Gru09]. XML wrapping involves manipulation of SOAP messages.
            A new element (i.e., the wrapper) is introduced into the SOAP Security header; the
            original message body is then moved under the wrapper and replaced by a bogus body
            containing an operation defined by the attacker [Gaj09, Gru09]. The original body can
            still be referenced and its signature verified, but the operation in the replacement body is
            executed instead.

           Access Control. SAML alone is not sufficient to provide cloud-based identity and
            access management services. The capability to adapt cloud consumer privileges and
            maintain control over access to resources is also needed. As part of identity management,
            standards like the eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) can be used
            by a cloud provider to control access to cloud resources, in lieu of some proprietary
            means. The XACML standard defines an XML-based language for stating policy and
            forming access control decisions. XACML focuses on the mechanism for arriving at
            authorization decisions, which complements SAML’s focus on the means for transferring
            authentication and authorization decisions between cooperating entities.

            XACML is capable of controlling the proprietary service interfaces of most providers,
            and some cloud providers already have it in place. The basic XACML usage model
            assumes that when a resource access is attempted, a Policy Enforcement Point (PEP),
