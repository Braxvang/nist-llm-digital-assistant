GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS

logistics and operational efficiency by tracking DoD assets and personnel from their origin to their
destination.

While many potential methods for building inter-enterprise subsystems exist, EPCglobal’s inter-enterprise
approach is a standards-based architecture that has broad industry support and publicly available
documentation for review. This section focuses on EPCglobal’s approach to the inter-enterprise
subsystem for illustrative purposes, but the basic functional requirements described in the discussion of
the EPCglobal standards would also apply to any alternative inter-enterprise subsystem architecture.

2.5.1   Open System Networks

RFID systems with inter-enterprise subsystems are called open or online systems because multiple entities
have the ability to access tag-related information. In contrast, RFID systems that operate entirely within
an enterprise, and thus have no inter-enterprise subsystem, are called closed or offline systems. EPCglobal
is developing standards for an open infrastructure that will share data associated with EPCs over the
Internet among participating organizations that agree to share such data.

To create an open system, each participating organization grants partner organizations access to its
analytic systems. The access can occur over a network dedicated for this purpose, a public network such
as the Internet, or a VPN that emulates the characteristics of a dedicated network using the infrastructure
of a public or shared network. Both dedicated networks and VPNs are sometimes called extranets, to
denote that information is shared outside the enterprise, as opposed to intranets, which are restricted to
internal users. To enable extranet access, the implementing organization likely modifies its network
firewall to permit RFID-related traffic to traverse the enterprise network boundary and also creates access
privileges for external users on the analytic systems themselves. Companies typically sign agreements or
memoranda of understanding that describe the roles and responsibilities associated with the access before
enabling it.

Figure 2-7 shows how various EPCIS might be connected in an open system network.
