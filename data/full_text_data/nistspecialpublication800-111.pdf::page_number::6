                                             GUIDE TO STORAGE ENCRYPTION TECHNOLOGIES FOR END USER DEVICES



Executive Summary

In today’s computing environment, there are many threats to the confidentiality of information stored on
end user devices, such as personal computers, consumer devices (e.g., personal digital assistant, smart
phone), and removable storage media (e.g., universal serial bus [USB] flash drive, memory card, external
hard drive, writeable CD or DVD). Some threats are unintentional, such as human error, while others are
intentional. Intentional threats are posed by people with many different motivations, including causing
mischief and disruption and committing identity theft and other fraud. A common threat against end user
devices is device loss or theft. Someone with physical access to a device has many options for attempting
to view or copy the information stored on the device. Another concern is insider attacks, such as an
employee attempting to access sensitive information stored on another employee’s device. Malware,
another common threat, can give attackers unauthorized access to a device, transfer information from the
device to an attacker’s system, and perform other actions that jeopardize the confidentiality of the
information on a device.

Many threats against end user devices could cause information stored on the devices to be accessed by
unauthorized parties. To prevent such disclosures of information, particularly of personally identifiable
information (PII) and other sensitive data, the information needs to be secured. Securing other
components of end user devices, such as operating systems, is also necessary, but in many cases
additional measures are needed to secure the stored information. This publication explains the basics of
storage security, which is the process of allowing only authorized parties to access and use stored
information. The primary security controls for restricting access to sensitive information stored on end
user devices are encryption and authentication. Encryption can be applied granularly, such as to an
individual file containing sensitive information, or broadly, such as encrypting all stored data. The
appropriate encryption solution for a particular situation depends primarily upon the type of storage, the
amount of information that needs to be protected, the environments where the storage will be located, and
the threats that need to be mitigated. This publication describes three types of solutions—full disk
encryption, volume and virtual disk encryption, and file/folder encryption—and makes recommendations
for implementing and using each type. This publication also includes several use case examples, which
illustrate that there are multiple ways to meet most storage encryption needs. When selecting a solution
type, organizations should consider the range of solutions that meet the organization’s security
requirements, and not just the solution type that is most commonly used.

Implementing the following recommendations should facilitate more efficient and effective storage
encryption solution design, implementation, and management for Federal departments and agencies.

When selecting a storage encryption technology, organizations should consider solutions that use
existing system features (such as operating system features) and infrastructure.

There are many factors for organizations to consider when selecting storage encryption solutions, such as
the platforms they support, the data they protect, and the threats they mitigate. Some solutions involve
deploying various servers and installing software on the devices to be protected, while other solutions can
use existing servers, as well as software built into the devices to be protected, such as Federal Information
Processing Standard (FIPS) approved encryption features built into the devices’ operating systems.
Generally, the more extensive the changes are to the infrastructure and devices, the more likely it is that
the storage encryption solution will cause a loss of functionality or other problems with the devices.
When evaluating solutions, organizations should compare the loss of functionality with the gain in
security capabilities and decide if the tradeoff is acceptable. Solutions that require extensive changes to
the infrastructure and end user devices should generally be used only when other solutions cannot meet
the organization’s needs.
