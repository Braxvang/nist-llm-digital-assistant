          Measure 12: Media Protection (MP) (program-level and system-level)
         Field                                                 Data
Measure ID       Media Sanitization Measure 1 (or a unique identifier to be filled out by the organization)
Goal             •   Strategic Goal: Ensure an environment of comprehensive security and accountability
                     for personnel, facilities, and products.
                 •   Information Security Goal: Sanitize or destroy information system media before
                     disposal or release for reuse.
Measure          Percentage (%) of media that passes sanitization procedures testing for FIPS 199 high-
                 impact systems
                 NIST SP 800-53 Controls – MP-6: Media Sanitization and Disposal
Measure Type     Effectiveness/Efficiency
Formula          (Number of media that passes sanitization procedures testing/total number of media
                 tested) * 100
Target           This should be a high percentage defined by the organization.
Implementation   1. Is there a policy for sanitizing media before it is discarded or reused (MP-1)?
Evidence
                       Yes                      No

                 2. Does the organization test media sanitization procedures for FIPS 199 high-impact
                    systems (MP-6, Enhancement 2)?

                       Yes                      No
                 3. Number of media that successfully passed sanitization testing for FIPS 199 high-
                 impact systems (MP-6, Enhancement 2)? _____
                 4. Total number of media tested for FIPS 199 high-impact systems (MP-6, Enhancement
                 2)? _____
Frequency        Collection Frequency: Organization-defined (example: quarterly)
                 Reporting Frequency: Organization-defined (example: annually)
Responsible      •   Information Owner: Organization-defined (example: Facility Security Officer)
Parties
                 •   Information Collector: Organization-defined (example: System Owner, Information
                     System Security Officer (ISSO])
                 •   Information Customer: Chief Information Officer (CIO), Senior Agency Information
                     Security Officer (SAISO) (e.g., Chief Information Security Officer [CISO])
Data Source      Sanitization testing results
Reporting        Pie chart comparing the percentage of media passing sanitization procedures testing
Format           versus the percentage of media not passing sanitization procedures testing over the
                 specified period
