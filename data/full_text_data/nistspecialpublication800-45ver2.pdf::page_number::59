                                                                      GUIDELINES ON ELECTRONIC MAIL SECURITY




                     Figure 6.3: Malware Scanning Implemented on User Workstations

The greatest challenge of implementing malware scanning on user workstations is the difficulty in
managing and regularly updating the distributed malware scanners. However, enterprise-level solutions
for malware scanning provide a means of central administration of malware scanners on individual hosts.
Another weakness is that to the degree that users have control of the malware scanner, end users may
disable some or all of its functionality (whether accidentally or intentionally). Enterprise solutions offer
the capability to lock down some or all of the clients’ scanners’ functionality to ensure they are
configured correctly.

The benefits of client-side malware scanning are as follows:

 Does not require any modification to the mail server
 Can scan encrypted emails when they are decrypted by the user
 Distributes malware scanning and thus minimizes the impact of scanning on any one host
 Offers protection to internal users, even when malware is received from an internal user.
The disadvantages of client-side malware scanning are as follows:

 Can be difficult to centrally manage, especially for mobile client hosts (e.g., laptops)
 Can take time before users update malware scanners, resulting in the organization being more
  susceptible to an outbreak
 Can be intentionally or accidentally disabled or weakened by users.
 Can detect only those threats that have been identified; offers little protection against zero-day
  exploits.

6.2.2   Content Filtering

Content filtering works in a similar manner to malware scanning at the firewall or mail server except that
it is looking for emails containing undesirable content other than malware, such as spam or emails
