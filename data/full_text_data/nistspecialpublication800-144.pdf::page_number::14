While the choice of deployment model has implications for the security and privacy of a system,
the deployment model itself does not dictate the level of security and privacy of specific cloud
offerings. That level depends mainly on assurances, such as the soundness of the security and
privacy policies, the robustness of the security and privacy controls, and the extent of visibility
into performance and management details of the cloud environment, which are furnished by the
cloud provider or independently attained by the organization (e.g., via independent vulnerability
testing or auditing of operations).

2.2       Service Models
Just as deployment models play an important role in cloud computing, service models are also an
important consideration. The service model to which a cloud conforms dictates an
organization’s scope and control over the computational environment, and characterizes a level
of abstraction for its use. A service model can be actualized as a public cloud or as any of the
other deployment models. Three well-known and often-used service models are the following
[Lea09, Mel11, Vaq09, You08]:

          Software-as-a-Service. Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) is a model of service delivery
           whereby one or more applications and the computational resources to run them are
           provided for use on demand as a turnkey service. Its main purpose is to reduce the total
           cost of hardware and software development, maintenance, and operations. Security
           provisions are carried out mainly by the cloud provider. The cloud consumer does not
           manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure or individual applications, except
           for preference selections and limited administrative application settings.

          Platform-as-a-Service. Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) is a model of service delivery
           whereby the computing platform is provided as an on-demand service upon which
           applications can be developed and deployed. Its main purpose is to reduce the cost and
           complexity of buying, housing, and managing the underlying hardware and software
           components of the platform, including any needed program and database development
           tools. The development environment is typically special purpose, determined by the
           cloud provider and tailored to the design and architecture of its platform. The cloud
           consumer has control over applications and application environment settings of the
           platform. Security provisions are split between the cloud provider and the cloud
           consumer.

          Infrastructure-as-a-Service. Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) is a model of service
           delivery whereby the basic computing infrastructure of servers, software, and network
           equipment is provided as an on-demand service upon which a platform to develop and
           execute applications can be established. Its main purpose is to avoid purchasing,
           housing, and managing the basic hardware and software infrastructure components, and
           instead obtain those resources as virtualized objects controllable via a service interface.
           The cloud consumer generally has broad freedom to choose the operating system and
           development environment to be hosted. Security provisions beyond the basic
           infrastructure are carried out mainly by the cloud consumer.
