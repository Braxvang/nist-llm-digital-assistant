                                                               GUIDELINES ON ACTIVE CONTENT AND MOBILE CODE



5.      Safeguards

Safeguards are approved security measures taken to prevent or reduce the risk of system compromise. To
protect computational resources from attack, appropriate safeguards must be in place. To mitigate the
risks in using active content, two main approaches can be followed: avoidance – staying completely clear
of known and potential vulnerabilities, and risk mitigation – applying measures to limit the potential loss
due to exposure. These approaches can be realized through the application of appropriate management,
operational, and technical controls as safeguards.

5.1     Management and Operational Safeguards

Common management and operational controls used to safeguard systems against other security threats
also apply to active content. The following subsections highlight some of the more useful safeguards that
can be applied.

5.1.1    Security Policy

A security policy is the set of rules, principles, and practices that determine how an organization
implements its security. A policy reflects an organization's view on required safeguards, based on a
consideration of its assets, the impact of loss or compromise, and the threat environment. Information
security in any organization is largely dependent on the quality of the security policy and the processes
that the organization imposes on itself for implementation, awareness, and enforcement. No amount of
technology can overcome a poorly planned or nonexistent security policy. If the policy is not stated
clearly and consistently, and not made known and enforced throughout an organization, it creates a
situation ripe for exploitation.

Having or establishing an organizational security policy is an important first step in applying safeguards
for active content. For example, an Internet security policy can address enabling Java, JavaScript, or
ActiveX on an individual user's Web browser in various ways:

 Functionality must be disallowed completely.
 Functionality is allowed, but only from internal organizational servers.
 Functionality is allowed, but only from trusted external servers.
 Functionality is allowed from any server.
One practical difficulty is that functionality often takes precedence over security in product marketing and
consumer demand. New technology products may be in use within an organization years before the
security policy is written to guide employees. For example, the Department of Defense (DoD) initially
formulated its policy and guidance on mobile code technology in 2000. While the policy came years after
the respective technology’s debut in products, the DoD started to address the problem relatively early,
compared to most other organizations.

The DoD policy, which was updated in 2006, delineates three categories of technology based on
increasing associated risk [DoD06]. Category 1, the most dangerous, involves technologies having broad
functionality and unmediated access to the services and resources of a computing platform. Examples
include ActiveX and script languages interpreted at the OS command level. Category 2 involves
technologies having full functionality, but mediated or controlled access to the services and resources of a
computing platform. Examples are Java mobile code and various scripting languages running within the
confines of a browser. Category 3 involves technologies having limited functionality, with no capability
