             Network isolation devices may not protect against all network-based
             risks. For example, network isolation does not mitigate risks associated
             with lateral movement within a network segment, such as the
             propagation of a worm or other malicious code. Additionally, some IT
             protocols and many industrial communications protocols have known
             security vulnerabilities that might be exploitable through network
             isolation devices. Organizations should consider limiting the flow of
             insecure protocols, restricting information flow to be unidirectional, and
             utilizing secure and authenticated protocols for supporting information
             exchange between the OT environment and other network segments.

6.2.1.4.        User, Device, and Asset Authentication (PR.AC-7)
Various authentication methods can be implemented within OT environments, including, but not
limited to the methods discussed in this section.

6.2.1.4.1.         Physical Token Authentication
Physical token authentication primarily addresses the easy duplication of a secret code or sharing
it with others (e.g., a password to a “secure” system being written on the wall next to a PC or
operator station). With physical token authentication, the security token cannot be duplicated
without special access to equipment and supplies.
A second benefit is that the secret within a physical token can be very large, physically secure,
and randomly generated. Because it is embedded in metal or silicon, it does not have the same
risks that manually entered passwords do. Traditional passwords can become lost or stolen
without notice, leaving credentials more vulnerable to exploitation. If a security token is lost or
stolen, the token owner is aware of the missing token and can notify security personnel to disable
access.
Common forms of physical or token authentication include:
   •   Traditional physical locks and keys
   •   Security cards (e.g., magnetic, smart chip, optical coding)
   •   Radio frequency devices in the form of cards, key fobs, or mounted tags
   •   Dongles with secure encryption keys that attach to the USB, serial, or parallel ports of
       computers
   •   One-time authentication code generators (e.g., key fobs)
For single-factor authentication with a physical token, the greatest weakness is that physically
holding the token means access is granted (e.g., anyone who finds a set of lost keys can now
access whatever those keys open). Physical token authentication is more secure when combined
with a second form of authentication, such as a memorized PIN used alongside the token.
