Public key/public        A cryptographic key that is used with an asymmetric (public
signature verification   key) cryptographic algorithm and is associated with a private
key                      key. The public key is associated with an owner and may be
                         made public. In the case of digital signatures, the public key is
                         used to verify a digital signature that was signed using the
                         corresponding private key.

Relying party            A party that depends on the validity of the digital signature
                         process.

Security strength        A number associated with the amount of work (e.g., the
                         number of operations) that is required to break a cryptographic
                         algorithm or system.

Shall                    Used to indicate a requirement of this Recommendation.

Signatory                The entity that generates a digital signature on data using a
                         private key.

Signature generation     The process of using a digital signature algorithm and a private
                         key to generate a digital signature on data.

Signature verification   The process of using a digital signature algorithm and a public
                         key to verify a digital signature on data.

Timestamp                A token or packet of information that is used to provide
                         assurance of timeliness; the timestamp contains timestamped
                         data, including a time, and a signature generated by a Trusted
                         Timestamp Authority (TTA).

timestamp                Contains the time and, possibly, other information; a
                         component of timestamped_data.

timestamped_data         The data on which a digital signature is generated by a TTA.

timestamp_packet         A unit of information that is transmitted by a TTA that contains
                         timestamped_data and a timestamp_signature.

timestamp_signatureTTA A digital signature that is generated using a TTAâ€™s private
                       signature key.

Trusted timestamp        A timestamp that has been signed by a TTA.
