1097   5.1.7.1. Single-Factor Cryptographic Device Authenticators
1098   Single-factor cryptographic device authenticators use tamper-resistant hardware to
1099   encapsulate one or more secret keys unique to the authenticator that SHALL NOT be
1100   exportable (i.e., cannot be removed from the device). The authenticator operates using
1101   a secret key to sign a challenge nonce presented through a direct interface between the
1102   authenticator and endpoint (e.g., a USB port or secured wireless connection) as specified
1103   in Sec. 5.2.12. Alternatively, the authenticator could be a suitably secure processor
1104   integrated with the user endpoint itself.
1105   The secret key and its algorithm SHALL provide at least the minimum security
1106   length specified in the latest revision of [SP800-131A] (112 bits as of the date of this
1107   publication). The challenge nonce SHALL be at least 64 bits in length. Approved
1108   cryptography SHALL be used.
1109   Cryptographic device authenticators differ from cryptographic software authenticators
1110   because of the greater protection afforded to the embedded authentication secrets by
1111   cryptographic devices. In order to be considered a cryptographic device, an authenticator
1112    SHALL either be a separate piece of hardware or an embedded processor or execution
1113   environment, e.g., secure element, trusted execution environment (TEE), trusted platform
1114   module (TPM). These hardware authenticators or embedded processors are separate
1115   from a host processor such as the CPU on a laptop or mobile device. A cryptographic
1116   device authenticator SHALL be designed so as to prohibit the export of the authentication
1117   secret to the host processor and SHALL NOT be capable of being reprogrammed by the
1118   host processor so as to allow the secret to be extracted. The authenticator is subject to
1119   applicable [FIPS140] requirements of the AAL at which the authenticator is being used.
1120   Single-factor cryptographic device authenticators SHOULD require a physical input (e.g.,
1121   the pressing of a button) in order to operate. This provides defense against unintended
1122   operation of the device, which might occur if the endpoint to which it is connected is
1123   compromised.

1124   5.1.7.2. Single-Factor Cryptographic Device Veriﬁers
1125   Single-factor cryptographic device verifiers generate a challenge nonce, send it to the
1126   corresponding authenticator, and use the authenticator output to verify possession of the
1127   device. The authenticator output is highly dependent on the specific cryptographic device
1128   and protocol, but it is generally some type of signed message.
1129   The verifier has either symmetric or asymmetric cryptographic keys corresponding to
1130   each authenticator. While both types of keys SHALL be protected against modification,
1131   symmetric keys SHALL additionally be protected against unauthorized disclosure by the
1132   use of access controls that limit access to the key to only those software components on
1133   the device requiring access.
1134   The challenge nonce SHALL be at least 64 bits in length, and SHALL either be unique
1135   over the authenticator’s lifetime or statistically unique (i.e., generated using an approved
