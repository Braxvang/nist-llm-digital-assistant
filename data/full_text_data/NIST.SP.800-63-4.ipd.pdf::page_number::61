       NIST SP 800-63-4 ipd                                                Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022


1786   Core Attributes
1787   The set of identity attributes the CSP has determined and documented to be required for
1788   identity proofing.

1789   Credential
1790   An object or data structure that authoritatively binds an identity - via an identifier or
1791   identifiers - and (optionally) additional attributes, to at least one authenticator possessed
1792   and controlled by a subscriber.
1793   A credential is issued, stored, and maintained by the CSP. Copies of information from
1794   the credential can be possessed by the subscriber, typically in the form of a one or more
1795   digital certificates that are often contained, along with their associated private keys, in an
1796   authenticator.

1797   Credential Service Provider (CSP)
1798   A trusted entity whose functions include identity proofing applicants to the identity
1799   service and the registration of authenticators to subscriber accounts. A CSP may be an
1800   independent third party.

1801   Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)
1802   An attack in which a subscriber currently authenticated to an RP and connected through
1803   a secure session browses to an attackerâ€™s website, causing the subscriber to unknowingly
1804   invoke unwanted actions at the RP.
1805   For example, if a bank website is vulnerable to a CSRF attack, it may be possible for
1806   a subscriber to unintentionally authorize a large money transfer, merely by viewing a
1807   malicious link in a webmail message while a connection to the bank is open in another
1808   browser window.

1809   Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
1810   A vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious code into an otherwise benign
1811   website. These scripts acquire the permissions of scripts generated by the target website
1812   and can therefore compromise the confidentiality and integrity of data transfers between
1813   the website and client. Websites are vulnerable if they display user-supplied data from
1814   requests or forms without sanitizing the data so that it is not executable.

1815   Cryptographic Authenticator
1816   An authenticator that proves possession of an authentication secret through direct
1817   communication, via the endpoint, with a verifier.

1818   Cryptographic Key
1819   A value used to control cryptographic operations, such as decryption, encryption,
1820   signature generation, or signature verification. For the purposes of these guidelines,

                                                    49
