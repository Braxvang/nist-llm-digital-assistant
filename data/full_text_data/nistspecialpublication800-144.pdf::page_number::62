6.    Conclusion
Cloud computing promises to have far-reaching effects on the systems and networks of federal
agencies and other organizations. Emphasis on the cost and performance benefits of public
cloud computing should be balanced with the fundamental security and privacy concerns federal
agencies and organizations have with these computing environments. Many of the features that
make cloud computing attractive can also be at odds with traditional security models and
controls. Several critical pieces of technology, such as a solution for federated trust, are not yet
fully realized, impinging on successful cloud computing deployments. Determining the security
of complex computer systems composed together is also a long-standing security issue that
plagues large-scale computing in general, and cloud computing in particular. Attaining high-
assurance qualities in system implementations has been an elusive goal of computer security
researchers and practitioners and, as demonstrated in the examples given in this report, is also a
work in progress for cloud computing. Nevertheless, public cloud computing is a compelling
computing paradigm that agencies should consider for their information technology solution set.

Accountability for security and privacy in public cloud deployments cannot be delegated to a
cloud provider and remains an obligation for the organization to fulfill. Federal agencies must
ensure that any selected public cloud computing solution is configured, deployed, and managed
to meet the security, privacy, and other requirements of the organization. Organizational data
must be protected in a manner consistent with policies, whether in the organization’s computing
center or the cloud. The organization must ensure that security and privacy controls are
implemented correctly and operate as intended, throughout the system lifecycle.

The transition to an outsourced, public cloud computing environment is in many ways an
exercise in risk management. Risk management entails identifying and assessing risk, and taking
steps to reduce it to an acceptable level. Assessing and managing risk in cloud computing
systems requires continuous monitoring of the security state of the system, and can prove
challenging, since significant portions of the computing environment are under the control of the
cloud provider and likely beyond the organization’s purview. Throughout the system lifecycle,
risks that are identified must be carefully balanced against the security and privacy controls
available and the expected benefits from their utilization. Too many controls can be inefficient
and ineffective. Federal agencies and other organizations must work diligently to maintain an
appropriate balance between the number and strength of controls and the risks associated with
cloud computing solutions.

Cloud computing is a new computing paradigm that is still emerging. Technology advances are
expected to improve performance and other qualities of services from public clouds, including
privacy and security. Many agency systems are long lived and, if transitioned to a public cloud,
will likely experience technology and other changes over the course of their lifetime. Cloud
providers may decide to sell or merge their offerings with other companies; service offerings
may be eclipsed by those of another cloud provider or fall into disfavor; and organizations may
be required to re-compete an existing contract for cloud services, when all option years have
been exhausted. Eventually having to displace some systems to another public cloud is a distinct
possibility that federal agencies and other organizations must not overlook.
