NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1                                                Guidelines for Media Sanitization


4     Information Sanitization and Disposition Decision Making

An organization may maintain storage devices with differing levels of confidentiality, and it is
important to understand what types of data may be stored on the device in order to apply the
techniques that best balance efficiency and efficacy to maintain the confidentiality of the data.
Data confidentiality level should be identified using procedures described in FIPS 199.
Additional information is available on mapping information types to security categories in SP
800-60 Revision 1.

While most devices support some form of Clear, not all devices have a reliable Purge
mechanism. For moderate confidentiality data, the media owner may choose to accept the risk of
applying Clear techniques to the media, acknowledging that some data may be able to be
retrieved by someone with the time, knowledge, and skills to do so.

Purge (and Clear, where applicable) may be more appropriate than Destroy when factoring in
environmental concerns, the desire to reuse the media (either within the organization or by
selling or donating the media), the cost of a media or media device, or difficulties in physically
Destroying some types of media.

The risk decision should include the potential consequence of disclosure of information
retrievable from the media, the cost of information retrieval and its efficacy, and the cost of
sanitization and its efficacy. Additionally, the length of time the data will remain sensitive should
also be considered. These values may vary between different environments.

Organizations can use Figure 4-1 with the descriptions in this section to assist them in making
sanitization decisions that are commensurate with the security categorization of the
confidentiality of information contained on their media. The decision process is based on the
confidentiality of the information, not the type of media. Once organizations decide what type of
sanitization is best for their individual case, then the media type will influence the technique used
to achieve this sanitization goal.
