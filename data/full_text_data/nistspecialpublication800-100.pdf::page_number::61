CHAPTER 6                                                 Interconnecting Systems


6.2.4 Phase 4: Disconnecting the Interconnection
   Phase-out may either be planned or it may be an emergency. Organizations may
wish to restore some of the disconnections but not others.

6.3 Terminating Interconnection
    An organization might have a variety of reasons to terminate an interconnection,
for instance, changed business needs, cost considerations, or changes in system
configuration. The decision to terminate the interconnection should be made by the
system owner with the advice of appropriate management and technical staff. Before
terminating the interconnection, the initiating party should provide written notice to
the receiving party. In turn, the receiving party should acknowledge receipt of the
notification. The notification should describe the reason(s) for the disconnection,
provide the proposed timeline for the disconnection, and identify technical and
management staff that will conduct the disconnection.
    The schedule for terminating the interconnection should permit a reasonable time
period for internal business planning so both sides can make appropriate
arrangements. In addition, staff from both organizations should coordinate to
determine the logistics of the disconnection and the disposition of shared data,
including purging and overwriting sensitive data. The disconnection should be
conducted when the impact on users is minimal. Following the disconnection, each
organization should update its system security plan and related documents.

6.3.1 Emergency Disconnection
    If one or both organizations detect an attack, intrusion attempt, or other
contingency that exploits or jeopardizes the connected systems or their data, it
might be necessary to abruptly terminate the interconnection without providing
written notice to the other party. This extraordinary measure should be taken only
in extreme circumstances and only after consultation with appropriate technical staff
and senior management.
    The decision to make the emergency disconnection should be made by the
system owner (or a designated staff member) and implemented by technical staff.
The system owner or designee should immediately notify the other party verbally
and receive confirmation of the notification. Both parties should work together to
isolate and investigate the incident, in accordance with incident response procedures.
If necessary, law enforcement authorities should be notified, and evidence should be
preserved.
    The initiating party should provide a written notification to the other party in a
timely manner (e.g., within five days). The notification should describe the nature of
the incident, explain why and how the interconnection was terminated, and identify
actions taken to isolate and investigate the incident. The notification should also
specify when and under what conditions the interconnection may be restored, if
appropriate.

6.3.2 Restoration of Interconnection
   Both organizations may choose to restore the system interconnection after it has
been terminated. The decision to restore the interconnection should be based on the
cause and duration of the disconnection. For example, if the interconnection was
terminated because of an attack, intrusion, or other contingency, both parties should
implement appropriate countermeasures to prevent a recurrence of the problem. If
