      NIST SP 800-63B-4 ipd                                             Digital Identity Guidelines
      December 2022                                      Authentication and Lifecycle Management


490   4.2. Authentication Assurance Level 2
491   AAL2 provides high confidence that the claimant controls authenticators bound to the
492   subscriber account. Proof of possession and control of two distinct authentication factors
493   is required through secure authentication protocols. Approved cryptographic techniques
494   are required at AAL2 and above.

495   4.2.1. Permitted Authenticator Types
496   At AAL2, authentication SHALL occur by the use of either a multi-factor authenticator
497   or a combination of two single-factor authenticators. A multi-factor authenticator
498   requires two factors to execute a single authentication event, such as a cryptographically
499   secure device with an integrated biometric sensor that is required to activate the device.
500   Authenticator requirements are specified in Sec. 5.
501   When a multi-factor authenticator is used, any of the following MAY be used:
502       • Multi-Factor Out-of-Band Authenticator (Sec. 5.1.3.4)
503       • Multi-Factor OTP Device (Sec. 5.1.5)
504       • Multi-Factor Cryptographic Software (Sec. 5.1.8)
505       • Multi-Factor Cryptographic Device (Sec. 5.1.9)
506   When a combination of two single-factor authenticators is used, the combination SHALL
507   include a Memorized Secret authenticator (Sec. 5.1.1) and one physical authenticator (i.e.,
508   “something you have”) from the following list:
509       • Look-Up Secret (Sec. 5.1.2)
510       • Out-of-Band Device (Sec. 5.1.3)
511       • Single-Factor OTP Device (Sec. 5.1.4)
512       • Single-Factor Cryptographic Software (Sec. 5.1.6)
513       • Single-Factor Cryptographic Device (Sec. 5.1.7)
514         Note: When biometric authentication meets the requirements in Sec. 5.2.3,
515         the device has to be authenticated in addition to the biometric match. A
516         biometric characteristic is recognized as a factor, but not recognized as an
517         authenticator by itself. Therefore, when conducting authentication with a
518         biometric characteristic, it is unnecessary to use two authenticators because
519         the associated device serves as “something you have,” while the biometric
520         match serves as “something you are.”
