Similarly, the six-step RMF 14 brings together the supporting security standards and guidelines necessary
for managing risk related to information systems. Implementing the RMF on an information system
encompasses a broad range of activities to identify, control, and mitigate risks. From the information
system contingency planning perspective, the six steps in the RMF actively support the development,
implementation, testing, and maintenance of an information system’s contingency plan as it supports the
mission of the organization.

and Step 2 (select security controls) helps to ensure that the
BIA accounts appropriately for the level of risk to the
organization.

Three steps are typically involved in accomplishing the BIA:

       1. Determine mission/business processes and recovery criticality. Mission/Business processes
          supported by the system are identified and the impact of a system disruption to those processes is
          determined along with outage impacts and estimated downtime. The downtime should reflect
          the maximum time that an organization can tolerate while still maintaining the mission.
       2. Identify resource requirements. Realistic recovery efforts require a thorough evaluation of the
          resources required to resume mission/business processes and related interdependencies as

     NIST SP 800-37 further describes the RMF and provides guidance on organization-wide risk management including the
     development of risk management strategies, risk-related governance issues, defining protection requirements and associated
     risks for organizational mission/business processes, integration of security and privacy requirements into enterprise
     architectures, and managing risk within the system development life cycle.
