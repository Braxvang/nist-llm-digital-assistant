                                                  GUIDE TO INTRUSION DETECTION AND PREVENTION SYSTEMS (IDPS)



6.2     Security Capabilities

NBA products provide a variety of security capabilities. Sections 6.2.1 through 6.2.4 describe common
security capabilities, divided into four categories: information gathering, logging, detection, and
prevention, respectively. Some NBA products also provide security information and event management
(SIEM) capabilities; see Section 8.2.2 for information on SIEM.

6.2.1    Information Gathering Capabilities

NBA technologies offer extensive information gathering capabilities, because knowledge of the
characteristics of the organization’s hosts is needed for most of the NBA product’s detection techniques.
NBA sensors can automatically create and maintain lists of hosts communicating on the organization’s
monitored networks. They can monitor port usage, perform passive fingerprinting, and use other
techniques to gather detailed information on the hosts. (As described in Section 6.2.3.1, most products
also allow administrators to specify detailed firewall ruleset-like policies for host-to-host
communications, including permitted or forbidden port numbers.) Information typically collected for
each host includes the following:

 IP address
 Operating system
 What services it is providing, including the IP protocols and TCP and UDP ports it uses to do so
 Other hosts with which it communicates, and what services it uses and which IP protocols and TCP or
  UDP ports it contacts on each host.
NBA sensors constantly monitor network activity for changes to this information. Additional information
on each host’s flows is also collected on an ongoing basis; this is discussed in Section 6.2.3.

6.2.2    Logging Capabilities

NBA technologies typically perform extensive logging of data related to detected events. This data can
be used to confirm the validity of alerts, to investigate incidents, and to correlate events between the NBA
solution and other logging sources. Data fields commonly logged by NBA software include the
following:

 Timestamp (usually date and time)
 Event or alert type
 Rating (e.g., priority, severity, impact, confidence)
 Network, transport, and application layer protocols
 Source and destination IP addresses
 Source and destination TCP or UDP ports, or ICMP types and codes
 Additional packet header fields (e.g., IP time-to-live [TTL])
 Number of bytes and packets sent by the source and destination hosts for the connection
 Prevention action performed (if any).
