                                            ESTABLISHING WIRELESS ROBUST SECURITY NETWORKS: A GUIDE TO IEEE 802.11I



2.      Overview of Wireless Networking

Wireless networking enables devices with wireless capabilities to use computing resources without being
physically connected to a network. The devices simply need to be within a certain distance (known as the
range) of the wireless network infrastructure. A wireless local area network (WLAN) is a group of
wireless networking nodes within a limited geographic area that is capable of radio communications.
WLANs are typically used by devices within a fairly limited range, such as an office building or building
campus, and are usually implemented as extensions to existing wired local area networks to provide
enhanced user mobility.

Since the beginning of wireless networking, many standards and technologies have been developed for
WLANs. One of the most active standards organizations that address wireless networking is the Institute
of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). This section of the guide provides an overview of
wireless networking and focuses on the IEEE 802.11 family of WLAN standards. Section 2.1 discusses
the history of IEEE 802.11 and provides examples of alternative wireless networking standards. 3 Section
2.2 explains the basic IEEE 802.11 WLAN components and architectural models, which lays a foundation
for subsequent sections of the guide. Readers who are already familiar with the basics of WLANs and
IEEE 802.11 might wish to skip this section.

2.1     History of Wireless Networking Standards

WLAN technologies were first available in late 1990, when vendors began introducing products that
operated within the 900 megahertz (MHz) frequency band. These solutions, which used non-standard,
proprietary designs, provided data transfer rates of approximately 1 megabit per second (Mbps). This was
significantly slower than the 10 Mbps speed provided by most wired local area networks (LAN) at that
time. In 1992, vendors began selling WLAN products that used the 2.4 gigahertz (GHz) band. Although
these products provided higher data transfer rates than 900 MHz band products, they also used proprietary
designs. The need for interoperability among different brands of WLAN products led to several
organizations developing wireless networking standards. Section 2.1.1 describes the IEEE 802.11 family
of standards. Section 2.1.2 discusses work from the Wi-Fi Alliance that is closely related to IEEE 802.11,
and Section 2.1.3 briefly highlights other wireless networking standards.

2.1.1     IEEE 802.11 Standards

In 1997, IEEE ratified the 802.11 standard for WLANs. The IEEE 802.11 standard supports three
transmission methods, including radio transmission within the 2.4 GHz band. In 1999, IEEE ratified two
amendments to the 802.11 standard—802.11a and 802.11b—that define radio transmission methods, and
WLAN equipment based on IEEE 802.11b quickly became the dominant wireless technology. IEEE
802.11b equipment transmits in the 2.4 GHz band, offering data rates of up to 11 Mbps. IEEE 802.11b
was intended to provide performance, throughput, and security features comparable to wired LANs. In
2003, IEEE released the 802.11g amendment, which specifies a radio transmission method that uses the
2.4 GHz band and can support data rates of up to 54 Mbps. Additionally, IEEE 802.11g-compliant
products are backward compatible with IEEE 802.11b-compliant products. Table 2-1 compares the basic
characteristics of IEEE 802.11, 802.11a, 802.11b, and 802.11g. 802.11 wireless networking is also known
as Wi-Fi ®.
