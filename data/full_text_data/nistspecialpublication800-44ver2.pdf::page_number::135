                                                                    GUIDELINES ON SECURING PUBLIC WEB SERVERS



     Completed                                             Action
                 Switches are configured in high-security mode to defeat ARP spoofing and ARP
                 poisoning attacks
                 Switches are configured to send all traffic on network segment to network-based IDPS
                 Evaluate load balancers
                 Load balancers are used to increase Web server availability
                 Load balancers are augmented by Web caches if applicable
                 Evaluate reverse proxies
                 Reverse proxies are used as a security gateway to increase Web server availability
                 Reverse proxies are augmented with encryption acceleration, user authentication, and
                 content filtering capabilities, if applicable



Administering the Web Server

     Completed                                             Action
                 Perform logging
                 Use the combined log format for storing the Transfer Log or manually configure the
                 information described by the combined log format to be the standard format for the
                 Transfer Log
                 Enable the Referrer Log or Agent Log if the combined log format is unavailable
                 Establish different log file names for different virtual Web sites that may be
                 implemented as part of a single physical Web server
                 Use the remote user identity as specified in RFC 1413
                 Store logs on a separate (syslog) host
                 Ensure there is sufficient capacity for the logs
                 Archive logs according to organizational requirements
                 Review logs daily
                 Review logs weekly (for more long-term trends)
                 Use automated log file analysis tool(s)
                 Perform Web server backups
                 Create a Web server backup policy
                 Back up Web server differentially or incrementally on a daily to weekly basis
                 Back up Web server fully on a weekly to monthly basis
                 Periodically archive backups
                 Maintain an authoritative copy of Web site(s)
                 Recover from a compromise
                 Report the incident to the organizationâ€™s computer incident response capability
                 Isolate the compromised system(s) or take other steps to contain the attack so
                 additional information can be collected
                 Investigate similar hosts to determine if the attacker has also compromised other
                 systems
                 Consult, as appropriate, with management, legal counsel, and law enforcement
                 officials expeditiously

                 Analyze the intrusion
                 Restore the system
