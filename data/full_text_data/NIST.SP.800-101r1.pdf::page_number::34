                                                              Guidelines on Mobile Device Forensics

       support extraction of GSM and USIM partitions. CSIM data may prove to be of increasing
       forensic importance as this technology evolves.

 3.3   Obstructed Devices

       The following sections discuss techniques for bypassing an obstructed device i.e., a mobile
       device that requires successful authentication using a password or some other means to obtain
       access to the device. A number of ways exist to recover data from obstructed devices. These
       methods fall into one of three categories: software-based, hardware-based and investigative.
       Common obstructed devices include those with missing identity modules, PIN-enabled
       UICCs, or an enabled mobile device lock. Password locked and encrypted memory cards
       provide a user with additional means to protect data. This protection may make recovery of
       such data more complex. Content encryption capabilities are offered as a standard feature in
       many mobile devices or may be available through add-on applications. Software and
       hardware-based methods are often directed at a particular device or narrow class of device.

       As mobile forensics tools have evolved, they have begun to provide automated functions
       allowing examiners to bypass many security mechanisms as a part of their products. For
       instance, some tools provide an automated function to recover passwords from locked mobile
       devices. In developing a method, the following sections provide actions that should be
       considered for determining possible approaches.

3.3.1 Software and Hardware Based Methods

       Software-based methods used to break or bypass authentication mechanisms have begun to
       appear. For instance, some tools provide an automated function to recover passwords from
       locked mobile devices. This type of functionality varies greatly between mobile forensic tools
       and the devices models that are supported.

       Hardware-based methods involve a combination of software and hardware to break or bypass
       authentication mechanisms and gain access to the device. For example, the value of a mobile
       device lock can be readily recovered from a memory dump of certain devices, allowing for a
       follow-on logical acquisition. JTAG and flasher boxes are often used this way to circumvent
       authentication mechanisms. Device-specific attacks, such as cold boot attacks, exist to bypass
       authentication mechanisms. Cold boot attacks have the ability to recover passwords from
       locked Android based devices by cooling the device 10 degrees below Celsius followed by
       disconnecting and reconnecting the battery in 500ms intervals [Mül12].

       Few general-purpose hardware-based methods apply to a general class of mobile devices.
       Most of the techniques are tailored for a specific model within a class.

3.3.2 Investigative Methods

       Investigative methods are procedures the investigative team can apply, which require no
       forensic software or hardware tools. The most obvious methods are the following:

              Ask the owner – If a device is protected with a password, PIN or other authentication
               mechanism involving knowledge-based authentication, the owner may be queried for
               this information during an interview.
