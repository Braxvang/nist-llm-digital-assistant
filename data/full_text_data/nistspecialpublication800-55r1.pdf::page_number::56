Goal             •    Strategic Goal: Ensure an environment of comprehensive security and accountability
                      for personnel, facilities, and products.
                 •    Information Security Goal: Create, protect, and retain information system audit
                      records to the extent needed to enable the monitoring, analysis, investigation, and
                      reporting of unlawful, unauthorized, or inappropriate activity.
Measure          Average frequency of audit records review and analysis for inappropriate activity

Measure Type     Effectiveness/Efficiency
Formula          Average frequency during reporting period
Target           This should be a high frequency defined by the organization.
Implementation   For each system:
Evidence
                 1. Is logging activated on the system (AU-2)?
                        Yes                      No
                 2. Does the organization have clearly defined criteria for what constitutes evidence of
                 “inappropriate” activity within system audit logs?
                        Yes                      No
                 3. For the reporting period, how many system audit logs have been reviewed within the
                 following time frames for inappropriate activity (choose the nearest time period for each
                 system) (AU-3 and AU-6):
                     Within the past day _____
                     Within the past week _____
                     2 weeks to 1 month _____
