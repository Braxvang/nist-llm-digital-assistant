4.3.2. Cybersecurity Recommended Practices
EMM and other mobility management infrastructure rely on COTS systems to perform
management functions. These core systems often run on top of general-purpose OSs and
commodity hardware. It is important that computer security recommended practices – including
network, physical, and personnel security – be applied to these components in the same way they
are applied to general IT systems throughout industry. Protection mechanisms such as patch
management [41], configuration management [42][39] (e.g., disabling serial ports on field
network equipment), identity and access management, malware detection, and intrusion
detection and prevention systems can be carefully planned and implemented throughout the
enterprise.
Threats Addressed: Exploitation of vulnerabilities within the underlying EMM platform

4.3.3. Remote/Secure Wipe
Remote wipe enables enterprise system administrators to delete enterprise data and applications
on enterprise-owned or employee-owned (BYOD) mobile devices. The remote wipe capability is
widely available on mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, that support Android or
iOS. Variations of this feature are also natively available for OSs and third-party applications
that can be installed on these devices.
To enable remote wipe, a system administrator installs and configures a profile/agent on a device
before enterprise data or applications are available to be used. To later perform a remote wipe, an
enterprise server issues an erase command that is sent over the network to instruct the EMM
device agent to delete data and/or apps on the device. The device status in the EMM console is
updated after a wipe so that an administrator can confirm that the erasure has been performed.
Remote wipe may be implemented at different levels of granularity, ranging from full-device
wipe (e.g., deleting everything within the system’s user partition; typically, this level is used for
an enterprise-owned device) to an enterprise wipe (e.g., deleting only those device settings, data,
and apps previously pushed out to the user for enterprise use; typically, this level is used to
delete work data that resides on an employee’s personal device). Native remote wipe capabilities
for iOS and Android devices require the device to be powered on (with a sufficient charge) and
connected to the network. Some third-party EMM systems can execute a remote wipe even when
the device is not connected to the network.
Organizations should not rely on remote wipe as the sole security control for protecting sensitive
data but instead consider it to be one layer of a multi-layered approach to protection. By itself,
remote wipe is a fundamentally unreliable security control. For example, an attacker could
access information on a device before it is wiped, or power off a device to prevent it from
receiving a remote wipe signal.
Threats Addressed: Device loss and theft, credential theft via phishing

4.3.4. Security-Focused Device Selection
Out of the box, some devices may have embedded vulnerabilities or malicious software,
firmware, or hardware. Malicious actors who have access to the hardware, firmware, or software
