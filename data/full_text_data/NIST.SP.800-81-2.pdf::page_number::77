As far as the choice of key size for the ZSK is concerned, performance certainly will be a factor because
the ZSK is used for signing all RRsets in the zone. In terms of impact, however, it is restricted to just a
single zone because the ZSK’s usage is limited to signing RRsets only for that zone. This is the
justification for allowing 1024 bit RSA keys for use with DNSSEC beyond the USG stop date of 2010.
Some network components have been shown to have problems handling large DNS responses. The use of
1024 bit RSA keys is still considered acceptable to compensate for this as long as other rigorous key
management practices are in place.

The choice of crypto period (rollover period) is dictated by the amount of work required to compromise
the given key. The large size of the KSK implies that the crypto period for that key can be long (usually a
year or two). This aids in DNS operations as well, as KSK rollover is more disruptive and requires the
zone administrator to interact with their parent zone to update the KSK’s DS RR in the parent delegation
information. In the case of ZSK, the risk of key guessing is higher of its smaller size. This implies that
ZSKs must be rolled over more frequently than KSKs (usually between 1-3 months). Since the ZSK is
local to the zone, rolling the ZSK is not as disruptive as rolling the KSK.

In the case of ZSK, the risk of compromise may be greater due to more frequent exposure. If the zone allows
dynamic update, the ZSK is often stored on the same server as the zone. This factor, combined with the
relatively smaller size of the key, implies that ZSKs must be rolled over more frequently than KSKs (usually
between 1-3 months).

In terms of the number of keys of each type (KSK and ZSK) to be generated, a good practice is to
generate an extra ZSK in addition to the one that will be used for signing. Hence, the zone administrator
should use the key generation program to generate one KSK and two ZSKs during initial deployment of
DNSSEC. One ZSK is treated as the active key, and its private part (ZSK-private) will be used for
signature generation. The other ZSK (ZSK-public) will be made part of DNSKEY RRSet, but its
associated private part (ZSK-private) will not be used for signing RRsets. This additional ZSK will
provide a readily available ZSK for immediate rollover in emergency situations such as key compromise
and a form of advance notification to validating resolvers that this key is to be the one into which the zone
is going to roll over after the current crypto period expires. The mere presence of the key in the DNSKEY
RRSet enables validating resolvers to cache and establish trust in the new key so that they can
immediately use the key for signature verification as soon as rollover occurs.

The recommended digital signature algorithm suite, key sizes, and crypto periods for the KSK and ZSK
keys are given in Table 9-1 [800-57P1]. As with all data authentication keys, this table assumes approved
components 11 (hardware or software) and management operations are in place within the organization.
