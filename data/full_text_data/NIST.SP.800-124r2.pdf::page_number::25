an enterprise by erasing the enterprise’s records from the EMM and removing enterprise access
for all mobile devices.

3.2.3. Insider Threat
An insider threat originates from an individual (e.g., a current or former employee) who uses
authorized access to an organization’s system to violate the organization’s security policy. As an
essential tool for secure mobile system administration, an EMM system may be a “double-edged
sword.” To wit, it may be used both as a mechanism for protecting an enterprise from insider
threats (e.g., to implement practices focused on password and account management, access
controls, system change controls, and app usage policies) and as an attack vector for a malicious
insider. A malicious insider with access to an EMM system could weaken permissions to enable
data leaks, enroll unauthorized devices or outsiders, or allowlist malicious apps, among other
inappropriate actions. The use of EMM systems and other mobile device administration tools
should be monitored carefully to detect possible malicious insider activities.

3.2.4. Installation of Malicious Developer and EMM Profiles
The installation of EMM profiles enables an enterprise to control privileged operations provided
by mobile OSs. There are multiple ways in which mobile device users can be enrolled into the
EMM and profiles distributed to their mobile devices. One of the most common is installing an
EMM application – sometimes referred to as an MDM agent – directly onto the mobile device.
When this setup is completed, end users can enter information unique to their organization and
authenticate to the EMM server. At this point, an EMM profile is presented to the user. This
profile contains specific permissions and other resources approved by administrators.
EMM profiles can be conveyed to a user through a variety of avenues, such as email, text, and
drive-by downloads. If a user accidentally accepts a malicious profile delivered via one of these
methods, privileged access could be provided to an attacker. Using this access, an attacker can
leverage all management APIs to access enterprise data on the device and possibly even
information stored on backend infrastructure run by the organization.

       Overview of Mobile Security Technologies
Mobile security technologies have evolved over the past decade to become full-featured security
management suites. New capabilities and features are being added to increase the control that
administrators have over their enterprise devices. Some of these capabilities are built into the
device, whereas others are services provided by external systems that reside on more traditional
webservers. Device-side security capabilities are introduced in Section 4.1 and are followed by a
description of enterprise mobile security technologies in Section 4.2. Recommendations on how
to mitigate the threats described in Section 3 through policy, user education, the use of security
management technologies, and industry best practices are presented in Section 4.3.
