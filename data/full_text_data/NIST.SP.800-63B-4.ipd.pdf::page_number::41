       NIST SP 800-63B-4 ipd                                             Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022                                      Authentication and Lifecycle Management


1136   random bit generator [SP800-90Ar1]). The verification operation SHALL use approved
1137   cryptography.

1138   5.1.8. Multi-Factor Cryptographic Software
1139   A multi-factor cryptographic software authenticator is a cryptographic key stored on
1140   disk or some other “soft” media that requires activation through a second factor of
1141   authentication. Authentication is accomplished by proving possession and control of the
1142   key. The authenticator output is highly dependent on the specific cryptographic protocol,
1143   but it is generally some type of signed message. The multi-factor cryptographic software
1144   authenticator is something you have, and it SHALL be activated by either something you
1145   know or something you are.

1146   5.1.8.1. Multi-Factor Cryptographic Software Authenticators
1147   Multi-factor cryptographic software authenticators encapsulate one or more secret keys
1148   unique to the authenticator and accessible only through the presentation and verification
1149   of an activation factor, either a memorized secret or a biometric characteristic. The key
1150    SHOULD be stored in suitably secure storage available to the authenticator application
1151   (e.g., keychain storage, TPM, TEE). The key SHALL be strongly protected against
1152   unauthorized disclosure by the use of access controls that limit access to the key to only
1153   those software components on the device requiring access.
1154   External cryptographic authenticators that do not meet the requirements of cryptographic
1155   hardware authenticators (e.g., that have a mechanism to allow private keys to be exported)
1156   are also considered to be cryptographic software authenticators. They SHALL meet the
1157   requirementss for connected authenticators in Sec. 5.2.12.
1158   Each authentication operation using the authenticator SHALL require the input of the
1159   activation factor.
1160   The use of an activation secret by the authenticator SHALL meet the requirements of
1161   Sec. 5.2.11. A biometric activation factor SHALL meet the requirements of Sec. 5.2.3,
1162   including limits on the number of consecutive authentication failures. Submission of the
1163   activation factor SHALL be a separate operation from unlocking of the host device (e.g.,
1164   smartphone), although the same activation factor used to unlock the host device MAY
1165   be used in the authentication operation. The activation secret or biometric sample — and
1166   any biometric data derived from the biometric sample such as a probe produced through
1167   signal processing — SHALL be zeroized immediately after an authentication transaction
1168   has taken place.

1169   5.1.8.2. Multi-Factor Cryptographic Software Veriﬁers
1170   The requirements for a multi-factor cryptographic software verifier are identical to those
1171   for a single-factor cryptographic device verifier, described in Sec. 5.1.7.2. Verification
