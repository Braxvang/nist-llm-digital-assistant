                                              GUIDE TO INTEGRATING FORENSIC TECHNIQUES INTO INCIDENT RESPONSE



    1. What other sources of data might be spotted by visually surveying the user’s office?

    2. What are the most likely possible data sources outside of the user’s office?

    3. What legal considerations should the analysts be aware of if they want to examine a data source
       that the organization does not own?

Scenario 5: Mistaken Identity

Within the past 24 hours, two employees in the organization have reported fraudulent purchases charged
to their organization-issued credit cards. The organization frequently buys items from the companies that
sold the items in the questioned transactions. A follow-on assessment shows that charges to the
organization’s credit cards across the organization have increased by 30 percent in the past 3 days.

The following are additional questions for this scenario:

    1. How could forensic tools and techniques help analysts determine what has happened (e.g., that
       individual employees in the organization are victims of identity theft, that financial resources
       have been corrupted)?

    2. What privacy concerns should be considered in investigating employees’ financial transactions?

Scenario 6: Unwanted Screen Saver

The organization’s help desk has just received several calls from users who complain that a screen saver
depicting pastoral scenery is activating while they are working at their computers. The screen saver
requires each user to submit his or her password to unlock the screen saver and continue work. At the
same time, the organization’s network intrusion detection systems report several unusual alerts involving
a Web server. The data in the alerts indicates that some suspicious activity was directed at the server, and
the server is now generating similar activity directed at other systems. The intrusion detection analyst’s
initial hypothesis is that a worm may have attacked a vulnerable network service on the Web server.

The following are additional questions for this scenario:

    1. Given the time-sensitive nature of this scenario, how should analysts prioritize their actions?

    2. How would the use of forensic tools and techniques change if the worm disrupted network
       communications?

    3. How would the use of forensic tools and techniques change if the infected desktop systems were
       used to process sensitive information that the organization is required to safeguard?

Scenario 7: Phishing Attempts

In the past 24 hours, several employees have called the help desk to question the validity of e-mails from
the organization’s official credit card provider. The e-mails cite a possible security breach in the financial
institution’s records and ask recipients to follow a link to the institution’s Web site and create a new
password, after identifying themselves by providing their existing passwords and account information.

The following are additional questions for this scenario:

    1. Given the time-sensitive nature of this scenario, how should analysts prioritize their actions?
