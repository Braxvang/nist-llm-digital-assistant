                                                         GUIDE TO INTEGRATING FORENSIC TECHNIQUES INTO INCIDENT RESPONSE



2.       Establishing and Organizing a Forensics Capability

The term data refers to distinct pieces of digital information that have been formatted in a specific way.
The expansion of computers3 for professional and personal use and the pervasiveness of networking have
fueled the need for tools that can record and analyze an ever-increasing amount of data from many
sources. For example, data can be stored or transferred by standard computer systems (e.g., desktops,
laptops, servers), networking equipment (e.g., firewalls, routers), computing peripherals (i.e., printers),
personal digital assistants (PDA), CDs, DVDs, removable hard drives, backup tapes, flash memory,
thumb drives, and jump drives. Many consumer electronic devices (e.g., cell phones, video game
consoles, digital audio players, digital video recorders) can also be used to store data. This increasing
variety of data sources has helped spur the development and refinement of forensics tools and techniques.
This has also been caused by the realization that such tools and techniques can be used for many
purposes, such as investigating crimes, reconstructing computer security incidents, troubleshooting
operational problems, and recovering from accidental system damage.

This section discusses several aspects of organizing a forensics capability for an organization. It begins
by showing the wide variety of potential uses for forensics, and then presents a high-level overview of the
forensics process. The next part of the section discusses how forensics services are typically provided
and provides guidance on building and maintaining the necessary skills to perform forensics tasks. The
section also explains the need to include various teams from throughout the organization, such as legal
advisors and physical security staff, in some forensic activities. The section ends by discussing how
policies, guidelines, and procedures should address forensics (e.g., defining roles and responsibilities,
providing guidance on the proper usage of tools and techniques, incorporating forensics into the
information system life cycle).

The techniques and processes presented in this guide are based on principles of digital forensics.
Forensic science is generally defined as the application of science to the law. Digital forensics, also
known as computer and network forensics, has many definitions. Generally, it is considered the
application of science to the identification, collection, examination, and analysis of data while preserving
the integrity of the information and maintaining a strict chain of custody for the data. Because different
organizations are subject to different laws and regulations, this publication should not be used as a
guide for executing a digital forensic investigation, construed as legal advice, or used as the basis
for investigations of criminal activity. Instead, organizations should use this guide as a starting
point for developing a forensic capability in conjunction with extensive guidance provided by legal
advisors, law enforcement officials, and management.

2.1      The Need for Forensics

Over the last decade, the number of crimes that involve computers has grown, spurring an increase in
companies and products that aim to assist law enforcement in using computer-based evidence to
determine the who, what, where, when, and how for crimes. As a result, computer and network forensics
has evolved to assure proper presentation of computer crime evidentiary data into court. Forensic tools
and techniques are most often thought of in the context of criminal investigations and computer security
incident handlingâ€”used to respond to an event by investigating suspect systems, gathering and
preserving evidence, reconstructing events, and assessing the current state of an event. However, forensic
tools and techniques are also useful for many other types of tasks, such as the following:

        troubleshooting operational issues, such as finding the virtual and physical location of a host with
