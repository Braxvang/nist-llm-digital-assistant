managing security logs within an organization, but any portion of a SOA transaction outside of the
organization's control may not retain security logs.

Availability is increasingly becoming a concern with Web services, so QoS is becoming increasingly
important. For mission critical applications to be built with the SOA paradigm, the SOA must be able to
withstand one or more services becoming unavailable, either due to a DoS or a failure. Web servicesâ€™
support for dynamic discovery and binding allows for failover Web services to be accessed when a DoS
occurs. Similarly, reliable messaging technologies can be used to ensure that messages will be received
in spite of a DoS attack. Finally, QoS technologies can be used to prioritize Web service traffic so that
high priority Web services will still remain functional in the face of an attack on the availability of the
network.
