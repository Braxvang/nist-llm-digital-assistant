Executive Summary


Information systems capture, process, and store information using a wide variety of media.
This information is not only located on the intended storage media but also on devices used to
create, process, or transmit this information. These media may require special disposition in
order to mitigate the risk of unauthorized disclosure of information and to ensure its
confidentiality. Efficient and effective management of information that is created, processed,
and stored by an information technology (IT) system throughout its life, from inception
through disposition, is a primary concern of an information system owner and the custodian of
the data.

With the use of increasingly sophisticated encryption, an attacker wishing to gain access to an
organization’s sensitive information is forced to look outside the system itself for that
information. One avenue of attack is the recovery of supposedly deleted data from media.
These residual data may allow unauthorized individuals to reconstruct data and thereby gain
access to sensitive information. Sanitization can be used to thwart this attack by ensuring that
deleted data cannot be easily recovered.

When storage media are transferred, become obsolete, or are no longer usable or required by
an information system, it is important to ensure that residual magnetic, optical, electrical, or
other representation of data that has been deleted is not easily recoverable. Sanitization refers
to the general process of removing data from storage media, such that there is reasonable
assurance that the data may not be easily retrieved and reconstructed.

This guide will assist organizations and system owners in making practical sanitization
decisions based on the level of confidentiality of their information. It does not, and cannot,
specifically address all known types of media; however, the described sanitization decision
process can be applied universally. It should also be noted that Title 40 USC advises system
owners and custodians that excess equipment is “Educationally useful” and “Federal
equipment is a vital national resource.” Wherever possible, excess equipment and media
should be made available to schools and non-profit organizations to the extent permitted by
law.

1     Introduction


    1.1   Authority
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed this guide in
furtherance of its statutory responsibilities under the Federal Information Security
Management Act (FISMA) of 2002, Public Law 107-347.

NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines, including minimum
requirements, for providing adequate information security for all federal agency operations
and assets, but such standards and guidelines shall not apply to national security systems. This
guideline is consistent with the requirements of Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
Circular A-130, Section 8b (3), (Securing Agency Information Systems) as analyzed in A-130,
Appendix IV: Analysis of Key Sections. Supplemental information is provided in A-130,
Appendix III.

Nothing in this guide should be taken to contradict standards and guidelines made mandatory
and binding on federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory authority, nor
should these guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the
Secretary of Commerce, Director of the OMB, or any other federal official.

    1.2   Purpose and Scope
The information security concern regarding information disposal and media sanitization
resides not in the media but in the recorded information. The issue of media disposal and
sanitization is driven by the information placed intentionally or unintentionally on the media.
With the advanced features of today’s operating systems, electronic media used on a system
should be assumed to contain information commensurate with the security categorization of
the system’s confidentiality. If not handled properly, release of these media could lead to an
occurrence of unauthorized disclosure of information. Categorization of an information
technology (IT) system in accordance with Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS)
199, Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems,
is the critical first step in understanding and managing system information and media.

Based on the results of categorization, the system owner should refer to NIST Special
Publication (SP) 800-53, Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems,
which specifies that, “the organization sanitizes information system digital media using
approved equipment, techniques, and procedures. The organization tracks, documents, and
verifies media sanitization and destruction actions and periodically tests sanitization
equipment/procedures to ensure correct performance. The organization sanitizes or destroys
information system digital media before its disposal or release for reuse outside the
organization, to prevent unauthorized individuals from gaining access to and using the
information contained on the media.”



                                                1
                                                                   Guidelines for Media Sanitization

This document will assist organizations in implementing a media sanitization program with
proper and applicable techniques and controls for sanitization and disposal decisions,
considering the security categorization of the associated system’s confidentiality.

The objective of this special publication is to assist with decision making when media require
disposal, reuse, or will be leaving the effective control of an organization. Organizations
should develop and use local policies and procedures in conjunction with this guide to make
effective, risk-based decisions on the ultimate sanitization and/or disposition of media and
information.

The information in this guide is best applied in the context of current technology and
applications. It also provides guidance for information disposition sanitization and control
decisions to be made throughout the system life cycle. Forms of media exist that are not
addressed by this guide, and media are yet to be developed and deployed that are not covered
by this guide. In those cases, the intent of this guide outlined in the procedures section applies
to all forms of media based on the evaluated security categorization of the system’s
confidentiality according to FIPS 199, Standards for Security Categorization of Federal
Information and Information Systems.

Before any media are sanitized, system owners are strongly advised to consult with designated
officials with privacy responsibilities (e.g., Privacy Officers), Freedom of Information Act
(FOIA) officers, and the local records retention office. This consultation is to ensure
compliance with record retention regulations and requirements in the Federal Records Act. In
addition, organizational management should also be consulted to ensure that historical
information is captured and maintained where required by business needs. This should be
ongoing, as controls may have to be adjusted as the system and its environment changes.

  1.3   Audience
Protecting the confidentiality of information should be a concern for everyone, from federal
agencies and businesses to home users. Recognizing that interconnections and information
exchange are critical in the delivery of government services, this guide can be used to assist in
deciding what processes to use for sanitization or disposal.

  1.4   Assumptions
The premise of this guide is that organizations are able to correctly identify the appropriate
information categories, confidentiality impact levels, and location of the information. Ideally,
this activity is accomplished in the earliest phase of the system life cycle. This critical initial
step is outside the scope of this document, but without this identification, the organization will,
in all likelihood, lose control of some media containing sensitive information.

This guide does not claim to cover all possible media that an organization could use to store
information, nor does it attempt to forecast the future media that may be developed during the
effective life of this guide. Users are expected to make sanitization and disposal decisions
based on the security categorization of the information contained on the media.

  1.5   Relationship to Other NIST Documents
FIPS 199, (Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information
Systems); NIST SP 800-60, (Guide for Mapping Types of Information and Information
Systems to Security Categories) provides guidance for establishing the security categorization
for a system’s confidentiality. This categorization will impact the level of assurance an
organization should require in making sanitization decisions.

FIPS 200, (Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information
Systems) sets a base of security requirements that requires organizations to have a media
sanitization program.

NIST SP 800-53, (Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems)
provides minimum recommended security controls, including sanitization, for Federal systems
based on their overall system security categorization.

NIST SP 800-53A, (Guide for Assessing the Security Controls in Federal Information
Systems) provides guidance for assessing security controls, including sanitization, for federal
systems based on their overall system security categorization.

2     Background

Information disposition and sanitization decisions occur throughout the system life cycle.
Critical factors affecting information disposition and media sanitization are decided at the start
of a system’s development. The initial system requirements should include hardware and
software specifications as well as interconnections and data flow documents that will assist the
system owner in identifying the types of media used in the system. A determination should be
made during the requirements phase about what other types of media will be used to create,
capture, or transfer information used by the system. This analysis, balancing business needs
and risk to confidentiality, will formalize the media that will be considered for the system to
conform to FIPS 200, Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and
Information Systems.
Media sanitization and information disposition activity is usually most intense during the
disposal phase of the system life cycle. However, throughout the life of an information system,
many types of media, containing data, will be transferred outside the positive control of the
organization. This activity may be for maintenance reasons, system upgrades, or during a
configuration update.

    2.1   Need for Proper Media Sanitization and Information Disposition
Media sanitization is one key element in assuring confidentiality. Confidentiality is
“Preserving authorized restrictions on information access and disclosure, including means for
protecting personal privacy and proprietary information…” [44 U.S.C., Sec. 3542]

“A loss of confidentiality is the unauthorized disclosure of information.” [FIPS-199, Standards
for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems]

In order for organizations to have appropriate controls on the information they are responsible
for safeguarding, they must properly safeguard used media. An often rich source of illicit
information collection is either through dumpster diving for improperly disposed hard copy
media, acquisition of improperly sanitized electronic media, or through keyboard and
laboratory reconstruction of media sanitized in a manner not commensurate with the
confidentiality of its information. Media flows in and out of organizational control through
recycle bins in paper form, out to vendors for equipment repairs, and hot swapped into other
systems in response to emergencies. This potential vulnerability can be mitigated through
proper understanding of where information is location, what that information is and how to
protect it.

    2.2   Types of Media
There are two primary types of media in common use:

                Hard Copy. Hard copy media is physical representations of information.
                 Paper printouts, printer, and facsimile ribbons, drums, and platens are all
                 examples of hard copy media. These types of media are often the most

                                                5
                                                                  Guidelines for Media Sanitization

                 uncontrolled. Information tossed into the recycle bins and trash containers
                 exposes a significant vulnerability to “dumpster divers”, and overcurious
                 employees, risking accidental disclosures.
                Electronic (or soft copy). Electronic media are the bits and bytes contained in
                 hard drives, random access memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM),
                 disks, memory devices, phones, mobile computing devices, networking
                 equipment, and many other types listed in Appendix A.

In the future, organizations will be using media types not specifically addressed by this guide.
The processes described in this document should guide media sanitization decision making
regardless of the type of media in use. To effectively use this guide for all media types,
organizations and individuals should focus on the information recorded on the media.

  2.3   Trends in Data Storage Media
Computing technologies change rapidly. Users want more powerful but compact devices.
New technologies constantly increase processing speed and storage capacity, while decreasing
the device size in order to satisfy this demand. These technologies may require new clearing
and purging techniques.

Advancing technology has created a situation that has altered previously held best practices
regarding magnetic disk type storage media. Basically the change in track density and the
related changes in the storage medium have created a situation where the acts of clearing and
purging the media have converged. That is, for ATA disk drives manufactured after 2001
(over 15 GB) clearing by overwriting the media once is adequate to protect the media from
both keyboard and laboratory attack.

Some emerging data storage technologies are:

                Holographic Storage. Stores data on a holographic (3-dimensional) image by
                 passing light through light-sensitive crystals that retain the light patterns. It
                 will have multiple thousands of times more memory capacity and no
                 mechanical movements. Large blocks of data can be written or read with a
                 single read or write command as opposed to today’s 2-dimensional storages
                 devices that read and write data one bit at a time. Researchers believe that a
                 holographic data storage system in which thousands of pages (blocks of data),
                 each containing a million bits, can be stored within the volume of a sugar
                 cube. Ten Gigabytes (GB) of data will fit in one cubic centimeter. Because
                 holographic system can have no moving parts and its pages are accessed in
                 parallel, it is estimated that data throughput on a holographic system can
                 reach one gigabit per second.

                Molecular Memory. Stores data using a protein called bacteriorhodopsin. A
                 laser can change the protein for bR (0 state) to Q (1 state), which makes it an
                 ideal AND data storage gate, or flip-flop. Molecular memory is inexpensive


                                                6
                                                                            Guidelines for Media Sanitization

                 to produce and can operate over a wider range of temperatures than
                 semiconductor memory. A molecule changes states within microseconds; the
                 combined steps to read or write operation take about 10 milliseconds. That
                 might seem slow. However, like the holographic storage, this device obtains
                 data pages in parallel, so a 10 Mbps throughput speed is possible.

  2.4 Types of Sanitization
The key in deciding how to manage media in an organization is to first consider the
information, then the media type. The security categorization of the information, along with
internal environmental factors, should drive the decisions on how to deal with the media.
Again, the key is to first think in terms of information confidentiality, then by media type.

In organizations, information exists that is not associated with any categorized system. This
information is often hard copy internal communications such as memoranda, white papers,
and presentations. Sometimes this information may be considered sensitive. Examples may
include internal disciplinary letters, financial or salary negotiations, or strategy meeting
minutes. Organizations should label these media with their internal operating classifications
and associate a type of sanitization described in this publication.

There are different types of sanitization for each type of media. We have divided media
sanitization into four categories: disposal, clearing, purging and destroying. Disposal exists
where media are just tossed out with no special disposition given to them. Some media can be
simply disposed if information disclosure would have no impact on organizational mission,
would not result in damage to organizational assets, would not result in financial loss or would
not result in harm to any individuals. Disposal is mentioned to assure organizations that all
media does not require sanitization and that disposal is still a valid method for handling media
containing non-confidential information. Since disposal is not technically a type of
sanitization, it will not be mentioned or addressed outside of this section.

It is suggested that the user of this guide categorize the information, assess the nature of the
medium on which it is recorded, assess the risk to confidentiality, and determine the future
plans for the media. Then decide on the appropriate type of sanitization. The selected type
should be assessed as to cost, environmental impact, etc., and a decision made that best
mitigates the risk to confidentiality and best satisfies other constraints imposed on the process.



                                   Table 2-1. Sanitization Types
       Type                                                 Description
Disposal            Disposal is the act of discarding media with no other sanitization considerations. This is
                    most often done by paper recycling containing non-confidential information but may also
                    include other media.
Clearing            Clearing information is a level of media sanitization that would protect the confidentiality of
                    information against a robust keyboard attack. Simple deletion of items would not suffice for
                    clearing. Clearing must not allow information to be retrieved by data, disk, or file recovery
                    utilities. It must be resistant to keystroke recovery attempts executed from standard input

          Type                                        Description
                 devices and from data scavenging tools. For example, overwriting is an acceptable method
                 for clearing media.
                 There are overwriting software or hardware products to overwrite storage space on the
                 media with non-sensitive data. This process may include overwriting not only the logical
                 storage location of a file(s) (e.g., file allocation table) but also may include all addressable
                 locations. The security goal of the overwriting process is to replace written data with
                 random data. Overwriting cannot be used for media that are damaged or not writeable.
                 The media type and size may also influence whether overwriting is a suitable sanitization
                 method. [SP 800-36].
                 Studies have shown that most of today’s media can be effectively cleared by one overwrite.
                 Specific recommendations for clearing different media types are included in Appendix A.
Purging          Purging information is a media sanitization process that protects the confidentiality of
                 information against a laboratory attack. For some media, clearing media would not suffice
                 for purging. However, for ATA disk drives manufactured after 2001 (over 15 GB) the
                 terms clearing and purging have converged.
                 A laboratory attack would involve a threat with the resources and knowledge to use
                 nonstandard systems to conduct data recovery attempts on media outside their normal
                 operating environment. This type of attack involves using signal processing equipment and
                 specially trained personnel.
                 Executing the firmware Secure Erase command (for ATA drives only) and degaussing are
                 examples of acceptable methods for purging. Degaussing of any hard drive assembly
                 usually destroys the drive as the firmware that manages the device is also destroyed.
                 Degaussing is exposing the magnetic media to a strong magnetic field in order to disrupt
                 the recorded magnetic domains. A degausser is a device that generates a magnetic field
                 used to sanitize magnetic media. Degaussers are rated based on the type (i.e., low energy
                 or high energy) of magnetic media they can purge. Degaussers operate using either a
                 strong permanent magnet or an electromagnetic coil. Degaussing can be an effective
                 method for purging damaged media, for purging media with exceptionally large storage
                 capacities, or for quickly purging diskettes. Degaussing is not effective for purging
                 nonmagnetic media, such as optical media [compact discs (CD), digital versatile discs
                 (DVD), etc.). [SP 800-36, Guide to Selecting Information Security Products]
                 Specific recommendations for purging different media types are included in Appendix A. If
                 purging media is not a reasonable sanitization method for organizations, this guide
                 recommends that the media be destroyed.
Destroying       Destruction of media is the ultimate form of sanitization. After media are destroyed, they
                 cannot be reused as originally intended. Physical destruction can be accomplished using a
                 variety of methods, including disintegration, incineration, pulverizing, shredding, and
                 melting.
                 If destruction is decided upon due to the high security categorization of the information or
                 due to environmental factors, any residual medium should be able to withstand a laboratory
                 attack.
                  Disintegration, Incineration, Pulverization, and Melting. These sanitization methods
                   are designed to completely destroy the media. They are typically carried out at an
                   outsourced metal destruction or incineration facility with the specific capabilities to
                   perform these activities effectively, securely, and safely.
                  Shredding. Paper shredders can be used to destroy flexible media such as
                   diskettes once the media are physically removed from their outer containers. The
                   shred size of the refuse should be small enough that there is reasonable assurance
                   in proportion to the data confidentiality level that the information cannot be
                   reconstructed.
                 Optical mass storage media, including compact disks (CD, CD-RW, CD-R, CD-ROM),
                 optical disks (DVD), and magneto-optic (MO) disks must be destroyed by pulverizing,

                          crosscut shredding or burning.
                          Destruction of media should be conducted only by trained and authorized personnel.
                          Safety, hazmat, and special disposition needs should be identified and addressed prior to
                          conducting any media destruction.


  2.5    Other Factors Influencing Sanitization and Disposal Decisions
Several factors should be considered along with the security categorization of the system
confidentiality when making sanitization decisions. The cost versus benefit of a media
sanitization process should be understood prior to a final decision. For instance, it may not be
cost-effective to degauss inexpensive media such as diskettes. Even though clear or purge
may be the recommended solution, it may be more cost-effective (considering training,
tracking, and validation, etc) to destroy media rather than use one of the other options.
Organizations can always increase the level of sanitization applied if that is reasonable, and
indicated by an assessment of the existing risk.

Organizations should consider the following environmental factors. Note that the list is not
all-inclusive:
     What types (e.g., optical non-rewritable, magnetic) and size (e.g., megabyte, gigabyte,
      and terabyte) of media storage does the organization require to be sanitized?
     What is the confidentiality of the data stored on the media?
     Will the media be processed in a controlled area?
     Should the sanitization process be conducted within the organization or outsourced?
     What is the anticipated volume of media to be sanitized by type of media? 1
     What is the availability of sanitization equipment and tools?
     What is the level of training of personnel with sanitization equipment/tools?
     How long will sanitization take?
     What type of sanitization will cost more considering tools, training, validation, and
      reentering media into the supply stream?

3     Roles and Responsibilities:


    3.1   Program Managers/Agency Heads
“Ultimately, responsibility for the success of an organization lies with its senior managers.”2
By establishing an effective information security governance structure, they establish the
organization’s computer security program and its overall program goals, objectives, and
priorities in order to support the mission of the organization. Ultimately, the head of the
organization is responsible for ensuring that adequate resources are applied to the program and
for ensuring program success. Senior management is responsible for ensuring that the
resources are allocated to correctly identify types and locations of information and to ensure
that resources are allocated to properly sanitize the information.

    3.2   Chief Information Officer (CIO)
The CIO3 is charged with promulgating information security policy. A component of this
policy is information disposition and media sanitization. The CIO, as the information
custodian, is responsible for ensuring that organizational or local sanitization requirements
follow the guidelines of this document.

    3.3   Information System Owner
The information system owner4 should ensure that maintenance or contractual agreements are
in place and are sufficient in protecting the confidentiality of the system media and
information commensurate with the impact of disclosure of such information on the
organization.

    3.4   Information Owner
The information owner should ensure that appropriate supervision of onsite media
maintenance by service providers occurs, when necessary. The information owner is also
responsible for ensuring that users of the information are aware of its sensitivity and the basic
requirements for media sanitization.

           The role of the information system owner can be interpreted in a variety of ways depending on the particular agency
          and the system development life-cycle phase of the information system. Some agencies may refer to the information
          system owners as program managers or business/asset/mission owners.

  3.5   Senior Agency Information Security Officer (SAISO)
The SAISO is responsible for ensuring that the requirements of the information security policy
with regard to information disposition and media sanitization are implemented and exercised
in a timely and appropriate manner throughout the organization.

  3.6   System Security Manager/Officer
Often assisting system management officials in this effort is a system security manager/officer
responsible for day-today security implementation/administration duties. Although not
normally part of the computer security program management office, this person is responsible
for coordinating the security efforts of a particular system(s). This role is sometimes referred
to as the Computer System Security Officer or the Information System Security Officer.

  3.7   Property Management Officer
The property management officer is responsible for ensuring that sanitized media and devices
that are redistributed within the organization, donated to external entities or destroyed are
properly accounted for.

  3.8   Records Management Officer
The records management officer is responsible for advising the system and/or data owner or
custodian of retention requirements that must be met so the sanitization of media will not
destroy records that should be preserved.

  3.9   Privacy Officer
The privacy officer is responsible for providing advice regarding the privacy issues
surrounding the disposition of privacy information and the media upon which it is recorded.

  3.10 Users
Users have the responsibility for knowing and understanding the confidentiality of the
information they are using to accomplish their assigned work and ensure proper handling of
information.

4      Information Sanitization and Disposition Decision Making


    Organizations can use Figure 4-1 with the descriptions in this section to assist them in making
    sanitization decisions that are commensurate with the security categorization of the
    confidentiality of information contained on their media. The decision process is based on the
    confidentiality of the information, not the type of media. Once organizations decide what type
    of sanitization is best for their individual case, then the media type will influence the technique
    used to achieve this sanitization goal.




                          Figure 4-1. Sanitization and Disposition Decision Flow


    * For some media, clearing media would not suffice for purging. However, for ATA disk drives manufactured after
    2001 (over 15 GB) the terms clearing and purging have converged. Studies have shown that most of today’s
    media can be effectively cleared and purged by one overwrite using current available sanitization technologies.

                                                                  Guidelines for Media Sanitization



  4.1   Information Decisions In the System Life cycle
The need for, and methods to conduct, media sanitization should be identified and developed
before arriving at the system disposal phase in the system life cycle. At the start of system
development, when the initial system security plan is developed (see NIST SP 800-18,
Revision 1, Guide for Developing Security Plans for Information Technology Systems), media
sanitization controls are developed, documented, and deployed. One of the key decisions that
will affect the ability to conduct sanitization is choosing what media are going to be used with
the system. Although this is mostly a business decision, system owners must understand early
on that this decision affects the types of resources needed for sanitization throughout the rest
of the system life cycle.

Organizations should take care in identifying media for sanitization. Many items used will
contain multiple forms of media that may require different methods of sanitization. For
example, a PC may contain a hard drive, RAM, and ROM, and mobile devices contain on-
board volatile memory as well as nonvolatile removable memory in the form of a Subscriber
Identity Module (SIM).

  4.2   Identification of the Need for Sanitization
One of the first steps in making a sanitization decision is deciding if and when a need exists to
sanitize media.

At all points in the system life cycle, media are generated that contain representations of the
information held in the system. These media can take different forms, such as simple
printouts of data, screenshot captures, or cached memory of user’s activities. Organizations
must know which media are capturing data and when in order to maintain proper control of
the information. This understanding will allow organizations to identify when there is a need
to conduct proper sanitization for media disposal. These decisions on proper disposal can be
as simple as ensuring placement of paper shredders in work areas during system steady-state
activities or address destroying electronic equipment at the end of its life cycle.

  4.3   Determination of Security Categorization
Early in the system life cycle, a system is categorized using the guidance found in FIPS 199
and NIST SP 800-60, including the security categorization for the system’s confidentiality.
This security categorization is often revisited and revalidated throughout the system’s life, and
any necessary changes to the confidentiality category can be made. Once the security
categorization is completed, the system owner can then design a sanitization process that will
ensure adequate protection of the system’s information.

Much information is not associated with a specific system but is associated with internal
business communications, usually on paper. Organizations should label these media with their
internal operating classifications and associate a type of sanitization described in this
publication.

                                               13
                                                                 Guidelines for Media Sanitization

  4.4   Reuse of Media
A key decision on sanitization is whether the media are planned for reuse or recycle. Often,
some forms of media are reused to conserve an organization’s resources.

If media are not intended for reuse either within or outside an organization due to damage or
other reason, the simplest and most cost-effective method of control may be destruction.

  4.5   Control of Media
A factor influencing an organizational sanitization decision is who has control and access to
the media. This aspect must be considered when media leaves organizational control. Media
control may be transferred when media are returned from a leasing agreement or are being
donated or resold to be reused outside the organization. The following are examples of media
control:

Under Organization Control:

                   Media being turned over for maintenance are still considered under
                    organization control if contractual agreements are in place with the
                    organization and the maintenance provider specifically provides for the
                    confidentiality of the information.

                   Maintenance being performed on an organization’s site, under the
                    organization’s supervision, by a maintenance provider is also considered
                    under the control of the organization.

Not Under Organization Control:

                   Media that are being exchanged for warranty, cost rebate, or other
                    purposes and where the specific media will not be returned to the
                    organization are considered to be out of organizational control.

  4.6   Sanitization and Disposal Decision
Once an organization completes an assessment of its system confidentiality, has determined
the need for information sanitization, and has determined the types of media used and the
media disposition, an effective, risk-based decision can be made on the appropriate and
needed level of sanitization. Again, environmental factors and media type might cause the
level of sanitization to change. For example, purging paper copies generally does not make
sense, so destroying them would be an acceptable alternative.

Upon completion of sanitization decision making, the organization should document the
decision and ensure that a process and proper resources are in place to support these decisions.
This process is often the most difficult piece of the media sanitization process because it
includes not only the act of sanitization but also the validation: documenting decisions and
actions, identifying resources, and having critical interfaces with key officials.

  4.7   Verify Methods
Verifying the selected information sanitization and disposal process is an essential step in
maintaining confidentiality. A representative sampling of media should be tested for proper
sanitization to assure the organization that proper protection is maintained. Verification of the
process should be conducted by personnel without a stake in any part of the process.

          4.7.1 Verification of Equipment
          Verification of the sanitization process is not the only assurance required by the
          organization. If the organization is using sanitization tools (e.g., a degausser), then
          equipment calibration, as well as equipment testing, and scheduled maintenance, is also
          required.

          4.7.2 Verification of Personnel Competencies
          Another key element is the potential training needs and current expertise of
          personnel conducting the sanitization. Organizations should ensure that equipment
          operators are competent to perform sanitization functions.

  4.8   Documentation
It is critical that an organization maintain a record of its sanitization to document what media
were sanitized, when, how they were sanitized, and the final disposition of the media. Often
when an organization is suspected of losing control of its information, it is because of
inadequate record keeping of media sanitization.

Organizations should ensure that property management officials are included in documenting
the media sanitization process in order to establish proper accountability of equipment and
inventory control.

Organizations should conduct sensible documentation activities for media containing low
security category information. These are generally considered a consumable or perishable
item by property management.

A sample form for organizations to use in documenting sanitization activities is provided in
Appendix F.

        5   Summary of Sanitization Techniques


        Several different methods can be used to sanitize media. Three of the most common are
        presented in this section. Users of this guide should categorize the information to be disposed
        of, assess the nature of the medium on which it is recorded, assess the risk to confidentiality,
        and determine the future plans for the media. Then, using information in Table 5-1, decide on
        the appropriate method for sanitization. The selected method should be assessed as to cost,
        environmental impact, etc., and a decision should be made that best mitigates the risks to an
        unauthorized disclosure of information.

                                           Table 5-1. Sanitization Methods
 Method                                                          Description
Clear          One method to sanitize media is to use software or hardware products to overwrite storage space on the
               media with non-sensitive data. This process may include overwriting not only the logical storage location of a
               file(s) (e.g., file allocation table) but also may include all addressable locations. The security goal of the
               overwriting process is to replace written data with random data. Overwriting cannot be used for media that are
               damaged or not rewriteable. The media type and size may also influence whether overwriting is a suitable
               sanitization method [SP 800-36].
Purge          Degaussing and executing the firmware Secure Erase command (for ATA drives only) are acceptable
               methods for purging.
               Degaussing is exposing the magnetic media to a strong magnetic field in order to disrupt the recorded
               magnetic domains. A degausser is a device that generates a magnetic field used to sanitize magnetic media.
               Degaussers are rated based on the type (i.e., low energy or high energy) of magnetic media they can purge.
               Degaussers operate using either a strong permanent magnet or an electromagnetic coil. Degaussing can be
               an effective method for purging damaged or inoperative media, for purging media with exceptionally large
               storage capacities, or for quickly purging diskettes. [SP 800-36]
Destroy        There are many different types, techniques, and procedures for media destruction. If destruction is decided on
               because of the high security categorization of the information, then after the destruction, the media should be
               able to withstand a laboratory attack.
                Disintegration, Pulverization, Melting, and Incineration. These sanitization methods are designed to
                 completely destroy the media. They are typically carried out at an outsourced metal destruction or
                 licensed incineration facility with the specific capabilities to perform these activities effectively,
                 securely, and safely.

                Shredding. Paper shredders can be used to destroy flexible media such as diskettes once the media
                 are physically removed from their outer containers. The shred size of the refuse should be small
                 enough that there is reasonable assurance in proportion to the data confidentiality that the data
                 cannot be reconstructed.
               Optical mass storage media, including compact disks (CD, CD-RW, CD-R, CD-ROM), optical disks (DVD),
               and MO disks, must be destroyed by pulverizing, crosscut shredding or burning. When material is
               disintegrated or shredded all residues must be reduced to nominal edge dimensions of five millimeters (5 mm)
                                                                         2
               and surface area of twenty-five square millimeters (25 mm ).

             Appendix A. Minimum Sanitization Recommendation for Media
             Containing Data

             Once a decision is made (see section 4) and after applying relevant organizational
             environmental factors, then Table A-1 can be used to determine recommended sanitization of
             specific media. This recommendation should reflect the Federal Information Processing
             Standard (FIPS) 199 security categorization of the system confidentiality to reduce the impact
             of harm of unauthorized disclosure of information from the media.

             Although use of Table A-1 is recommended here, other methods exist to satisfy the intent of
             clear, purge (still relevant in some cases), and destroy, and methods not specified in this table
             may be suitable as long as they are vetted and found satisfactory by the organization. Not all
             types of available media are specified in this table. If your media are not included in this
             guide, organizations are urged to identify and use processes that will fulfill the intent to clear,
             purge, or destroy their media.

             When an organization or agency has a sanitization technology, method and/or tool that they
             trust and have validated, they are strongly encouraged to share this information through public
             forums, such as the Federal Agency Security Practices (FASP) website. The FASP effort was
             initiated as a result of the success of the Federal Chief Information Officer (CIO) Council’s
             Federal Best Security Practices (BSP) pilot effort to identify, evaluate, and disseminate best
             practices for critical infrastructure protection (CIP) and security. FASP can be found at
             http://csrc.nist.gov/fasp/.

Clear              To use software or hardware products to overwrite storage space on the media with non-
                   sensitive data. This process may include overwriting not only the logical storage location of
                   a file(s) (e.g., file allocation table) but also may include all addressable locations. See
                   comments on clear/purge convergence.

                   limited to IDE, EIDE, ATA, SCSI and Jaz) will render the drive permanently unusable
                   since these drives store track location information on the hard drive in dedicated regions of
                   the drive in between the data sectors.
Destruction        The result of actions taken to ensure that media cannot be reused as originally intended and
                   that information is virtually impossible to recover or prohibitively expensive.
Digital            The binary coding scheme generally used in computer technology to represent data as
                   binary bits (1s and 0s).
Disintegration     A physically destructive method of sanitizing media; the act of separating into component
                   parts.
Disposal           Disposal is the act of discarding media with no other sanitization considerations. This is
                   most often done by paper recycling containing non-confidential information but may also
                   include other media.
DVD                Digital Video Disc – a disc the same shape and size as a CD; but the DVD has a higher
                   density and gives the option for data to be double-sided or double-layered.
DVD-RW             A rewritable (re-recordable) DVD disk for both movies and data from the DVD Forum.
DVD+RW             A rewritable (re-recordable) DVD disk for both movies and data from the DVD+RW
                   Alliance.
DVD+R              A write-once (read only) version of the DVD+RW optical disk from the DVD+RW
                   Alliance.

Hard Disk          A rigid magnetic disk fixed permanently within a drive unit and used for storing data.
Incineration       A physically destructive method of sanitizing media; the act of burning completely to
                   ashes.
Information        Meaningful interpretation or expression of data.
Media              Plural of medium.

Glossary Term                                                Definition
Media Sanitization   A general term referring to the actions taken to render data written on media unrecoverable
                     by both ordinary and extraordinary means.
Medium               Material on which data are or may be recorded, such as paper, punched cards, magnetic
                     tape, magnetic disks, solid state devices, or optical discs.
Melting              A physically destructive method of sanitizing media; to be changed from a solid to a liquid
                     state generally by the application of heat.
Optical Disks        A plastic disk that is “written” (encoded) and “read” using an optical laser device. The disc
                     contains a highly reflective metal and uses bits to represent data by containing areas that
                     reduce the effect of reflection when illuminated with a narrow-beam source, such as a laser
                     diode.
Overwrite            Writing patterns of data on top of the data stored on a magnetic medium. NSA has
                     researched that one overwrite is good enough to sanitize most drives. See comments on
                     clear/purge convergence.
Physical             A sanitization method for optical media, such as CDs.
Destruction
Pulverization        A physically destructive method of sanitizing media; the act of grinding to a powder or
                     dust.
Purge                Rendering sanitized data unrecoverable by laboratory attack methods. See comments on
                     clear/purge convergence.
Read                 Fundamental process in an information system that results only in the flow of information
                     from an object to a subject.
Record               To write data on a medium, such as a magnetic tape, magnetic disk, or optical disc.
Recovery             Action necessary to store data files of an information system and computational capability
Procedures           after a system failure.
(recoverable)
Remanence            Residual information remaining on storage media after clearing.
Residue              Data left in storage after information processing operations are complete, but before
                     degaussing or overwriting has taken place.
ROM                  Read Only Memory. Generally a commercially available disc or solid state device on
                     which the content was recorded during the manufacturing process.
Sanitize             Process to remove information from media such that data recovery is not possible. It
                     includes removing all classified labels, markings, and activity logs.
Secure Erase         An overwrite technology using firmware based process to overwrite a hard drive. Is a drive
                     command defined in the ANSI ATA and SCSI disk drive interface specifications, which
                     runs inside drive hardware. It completes in about 1/8 the time of 5220 block erasure. It
                     Was added to the ATA specification in part at CMRR request. For ATA drives
                     manufactured after 2001 (Over 15 GB) have the Secure Erase command and successfully
                     pass secure erase validation testing at CMRR. A standardized internal secure erase
                     command also exists for SCSI drives, but it is optional and not currently implemented in
                     SCSI drives tested by CMRR. SCSI drives are a small percentage of the world’s hard disk
                     drives, and the command will be implemented when users demand it.
Shred                A method of sanitizing media; the act of cutting or tearing into small particles.
Storage              Retrievable retention of data. Electronic, electrostatic, or electrical hardware or other
                     elements (media) into which data may be entered, and from which data may be retrieved.
WORM                 Write-Once Read Many.
Write                Fundamental operations of an information system that results only in the flow of
                     information from a subject to an object.

Appendix C. Tools and Resources


Many different government, U.S. military, and academic institutions have
conducted extensive research in sanitization tools, techniques, and procedures in
order to validate them to a certain level of assurance. The National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST) does not conduct an evaluation of any tool set to
validate its ability to clear, purge, or destroy information contained on any specific
medium.

Organizations are encouraged to seek products that they can evaluate on their own.
They can use a trusted service or other federal organizations’ evaluation of tools
and products and they are expected to continually monitor and validate the
effectiveness of their selected sanitization tools as they are used.

If an organization has a product that they trust and have validated, then they are
strongly encouraged to share this information through public forums, such as the
Federal Agency Security Practices (FASP) website. The FASP effort was initiated
as a result of the success of the Federal Chief Information Officer (CIO) Council’s
Federal Best Security Practices (BSP) pilot effort to identify, evaluate, and
disseminate best practices for critical infrastructure protection (CIP) and security.
FASP can be found at http://csrc.nist.gov/fasp/.

This guide also recommends that the user consider the NSA devices posted on the
public NSA website. NSA states “The products on these lists have met NSA
specific performance requirements; however, inclusion on the list does not
constitute an endorsement by NSA or the U.S. government.
NSA/CSS-EPL-02-01-M - NSA/CSS Evaluated Products List (EPL) for High
Security Crosscut Paper Shredders, Annex A to NSA/CSS 02-01, version M, dated:
April 2005

NSA/CSS-EPL-02-02-F - NSA Evaluated High-Security Disintegrators, Annex A
to NSA/CSS 02-02, version F, dated: April 2005

NSA/CSS EPL 04-02-B - Optical Media Destruction Devices, Annex A to
NSA/CSS 04-02, version B, Date: 30 September 2005

NSA/CSS-EPL-9-12A-B - Degausser Approved Products List - Annex A to
NSA/CSS Manual 130-2, version B, dated: May 2005”

In addition to the NSA device listing, the Defense Security Service (DSS) publishes
an Assessed Product List (APL), which is a listing of products assessed against the
vendors claims of sanitation. The DSS APL states, “The APL does not endorse
any company’s product, nor does it constitute certification or accreditation for the
product’s use in a classified environment. The intent is to give security personnel

                                          29
                                                                    Guidelines for Media Sanitization

information on the capability of the product, whereby, they can determine the
possible application of the product to meet their security requirement.”5

This listing can be found at http://www.dss.mil/infoas/assessed_products_list.doc.

For hard drive devices or devices where firmware purge commands can be
accessed and utilized, this may be the best option for an organization. Firmware
purge commands can provide strong assurance of data protection while allowing
the device to be reused. More information on firmware secure erasure for ATA
hard drives can be found at http://cmrr.ucsd.edu/hughes/subpgset.htm.

Organizations and individuals wishing to donate used electronic equipment or
seeking guidance on disposal of residual materials after sanitization should consult
the Environmental Protection Agencies (EPA) electronic recycling and electronic
waste information website at http://www.epa.gov/e-Cycling/. This site offers
advice, regulations, and standard publications related to sanitization, disposal, and
donations. It also provides external links to other sanitization tool resources.

Organizations can outsource media sanitization and destruction if business and
security management decide that this would be the most reasonable option for them
to maintain confidentiality while optimizing available resources. When exercising
this option, this guide recommends that organizations exercise “due diligence”
when entering into a contract with another party engaged in media sanitization.
Due diligence for this case is accepted as outlined in 16 CFR 682 which states “due
diligence could include reviewing an independent audit of the disposal company’s
operations and/or its compliance with this rule [guide], obtaining information about
the disposal company from several references or other reliable sources, requiring
that the disposal company be certified by a recognized trade association or similar
third party, reviewing and evaluating the disposal company’s information security
policies or procedures, or taking other appropriate measures to determine the
competency and integrity of the potential disposal company.’6

Appendix D. Considerations for the Home User and
Telecommuter


For home users and telecommuters needing to sanitize media, media sanitization
methods developed for organizations might be impractical or unsafe.
Telecommuters should check their organizational policies before attempting any
type of sanitization. Here are a few guidelines that home users and telecommuters
could follow:
       If you are a telecommuter, ensure that you follow your organizations
        sanitization policies and instructions first. Organization policies and
        procedures take precedent over these instructions.
       Check your provided instruction manual. If guidance for information
        sanitization for the system is provided, follow those instructions.
        Instruction manual sanitization guidance takes precedent over these
        instructions.
       If you are unsure, unclear or cannot conduct sanitization in a safe manner
        with suitable assurance that your information has been sanitized, take the
        system to a professional either through your organization or with an outside
        vendor.
       Be sure you are ready to dispose of your media. Have backup copies made
        of all your information to keep in a secure place in case you ever need to
        refer to your data.
       When you are ready to dispose of the system, ensure you follow all disposal
        instructions. Many media contain hazardous material.

Decide: If you require sanitization for the media under consideration. Is this just a
cell phone with public numbers stored in the phone book or is it your home PC
with tax preparations, bank account information, and investment records?

First: Ensure that all power sources are disconnected, unplugged, or removed.

If: You have a cell phone, PDA, or other form of mobile computing device,

Then: Manually delete all information. Then see your instruction manual for how
to conduct a factory hard reset. Ensure that any removable storage media are
removed from the device.

If: You have removable mass storage media, including (but not limited to)
compact disks (CD, CD-RW, CD-R, CD-ROM), optical disks (DVD),
Compact Flash, Memory Sticks, Secure Digital, Jump Drives and
magneto-optic disks (MO),



                                          31
                                                                   Guidelines for Media Sanitization

Then: These media should be destroyed by shredding, physically breaking, or
rendering the media physically unable to be reinserted into the device to read the
media.
IF: You have a PC,

Then: You can conduct sanitization through the following two methods.

1. Use software to conduct sanitization. Check with your PC maker for a recommended
   tool and check testimonies of sanitization tools in industry and computing magazines.
   These resources can be found in hard copy in your local library and online. Conducting
   online searches for ‘Sanitization Tools’ and ‘Disk Drive Sanitization’ will yield multiple
   sources for research into tools for sanitization. Users can also check the NIST Federal
   Agency Security Practices (FASP) website at http://csrc.nist.gov/fasp/ to see what tools
   and procedures some federal agencies are using for sanitization.                                       Some
                                                                                                       schematics
                                                                                                       located on
2. Physically impair your disk drive to prevent information recovery from a                             inside of
   keyboard attack. In order to conduct this, ensure all power sources are                               chassis.
   disconnected. Locate computer hard drive. Use your provided instruction
   manual and/or provided schematic to locate. Remove hard drive from
   PC.
    Remove any steel shielding materials, mounting brackets, and cut any
    electrical connection to the hard drive unit.

The hard drive should then be subjected, in a suitable facility with
individuals wearing appropriate safety equipment, to physical force… (e.g.,
pounding with a hammer…) that will disfigure, bend, mangle, or otherwise
mutilate the hard drive so that it cannot be reinserted into a functioning
computer. Sufficient force should be used directly on top of the hard drive
unit to cause shock/damage to the disk surfaces. In addition, any connectors
that interface into the computer must be mangled, bent, or otherwise damaged to
the point that the hard drive could not be reconnected without significant rework.
