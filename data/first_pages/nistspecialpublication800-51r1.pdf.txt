2.    Overview of Vulnerability Naming Schemes

A vulnerability naming scheme is a systematic method for creating and maintaining a standardized
dictionary of common names for a set of vulnerabilities in IT systems, such as software flaws in an
operating system or security configuration issues in an application. The naming scheme ensures that each
vulnerability entered into the dictionary has a unique name. Using standardized vulnerability naming
schemes supports interoperability. Organizations typically have many tools for system security
management that reference vulnerabilities—for example, vulnerability and patch management software,
vulnerability assessment tools, antivirus software, and intrusion detection systems. If these tools do not
use standardized names for vulnerabilities, it may not be clear that multiple tools are referencing the same
vulnerabilities in their reports, and it may take extra time and resources to resolve these discrepancies and
correlate the information. This lack of interoperability can cause delays and inconsistencies in security
assessment, reporting, decision-making, and vulnerability remediation, as well as hampering
communications both within organizations and between organizations. Use of standardized names also
helps minimize confusion regarding which problem is being addressed, such as which vulnerabilities a
new patch mitigates. This helps organizations to quickly identify the information they need, such as
remediation information, when a new problem arises.

This publication provides information and recommendations related to two commonly used vulnerability
naming schemes: Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE), and Common Configuration
Enumeration (CCE). Both are described in detail below.

2.1   Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)

The CVE vulnerability naming scheme is for a dictionary of unique, common names for publicly known
software flaws. CVE provides the following:

 A comprehensive list of publicly known software flaws
 A globally unique name to identify each vulnerability
 A basis for discussing priorities and risks of vulnerabilities
 A way for a user of disparate products and services to integrate vulnerability information
A CVE vulnerability entry consists of a unique identifier number, a short description of the vulnerability,
and references to public advisories on the vulnerability. Figure 1 shows an example.

       CVE ID:        CVE-2000-0001
       Description:   RealMedia server allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a
                      long ramgen request.

                                        Figure 1. Example CVE Entry

Working with researchers, The MITRE Corporation assigns CVE IDs to publicly known vulnerabilities in
commercial and open source software. General information on CVE is available at http://cve.mitre.org/.
The National Vulnerability Database (NVD), which is maintained by NIST, provides several ways of

accessing CVE entries. NVD offers CVE search capabilities, as well as a variety of XML and RSS data
feeds with CVE entries and supplemental information to support security automation technologies. NVD
is publicly available at http://nvd.nist.gov/.

The MITRE Corporation maintains information on the use of CVE. Vendors that include CVE identifiers
in their security advisories are listed at http://cve.mitre.org/compatible/alerts_announcements.html.
Products and services that have been reviewed and evaluated by the MITRE Corporation and determined
to be “CVE-compatible”, which means that they meet a set of CVE requirements, are listed at
http://cve.mitre.org/compatible/compatible.html.

2.2   Common Configuration Enumeration (CCE) 5

The CCE 5 vulnerability naming scheme is for a dictionary of names for software security configuration
settings. Each type of security-related configuration issue is assigned a unique identifier to facilitate fast
and accurate correlation of configuration data across multiple information sources and products.

There are five attributes in a CCE entry: a unique identifier number, a description of the configuration
issue, logical parameters of the CCE, the associated technical mechanisms related to the CCE, and
references to additional sources of information. Figure 2 provides an example of these attributes for a
CCE 5 entry for Windows XP.

          CCE ID:         CCE-3108-8
          Description:    The correct service permissions for the Telnet service should be assigned.
          Parameters:     (1) set of accounts (2) list of permissions
          Technical
          Mechanisms: (1) set via Security Templates (2) defined by Group Policy

3.      Recommendations for End-User Organizations

This section provides recommendations for end-user organizations on how they should take advantage of
the CVE and CCE specifications to improve their system security management. For all recommendations
in this section involving an organization using CVE and CCE names, the organization should use the
authoritative names; locations for downloading these are listed in Section 2.

Some of the recommendations in this section involve the Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) version
2.2 specification. CPE provides standardized, consistent names for referring to operating systems,
hardware, and applications. CPE names are often used in conjunction with CVE and CCE names. Each
CVE name and CCE name is related to one or more IT components, which can be expressed using CPE
names. For example, a particular software flaw (identified by a CVE name) may affect seven products
(identified by their CPE names). Using CPE names with CVE and CCE names further supports
interoperability and standardization across products and services. The official CPE dictionary is available
at http://nvd.nist.gov/cpe.cfm.

3.1     Product and Service Selection and Design

      1. When evaluating IT products and services that use vulnerability names, such as for possible
         acquisition, organizations should take into consideration the products and services’ support for
         CVE and/or CCE (as appropriate). Most organizations use a variety of products and services to
         detect, track, and mitigate vulnerabilities. Using standardized vulnerability names across products
         and services makes it much easier and faster to correlate information and to aggregate data from
         many disparate sources into a unified interface, such as a security dashboard.

      2. Organizations developing their own custom security software that will use vulnerability names
         should ensure that the software uses authoritative CVE and/or CCE names, as appropriate, and
         uses CPE names with them when indicating which IT products the CVE and CCE names apply
         to. Using CVE, CCE, and CPE names supports interoperability with other software and services.

3.2     Vulnerability Communications and Reporting

      1. Organizations should use authoritative CVE and CCE names in their internal vulnerability
         assessment and reporting, including assessment reports, notifications to system owners of
         detected vulnerabilities, and alerts identifying the vulnerabilities being targeted by active exploits.
         Use of CVE and CCE names will help to minimize confusion regarding which vulnerability is
         being referenced and whether a particular vulnerability has been mitigated. Organizations should
         also use CPE names when indicating which IT products the vulnerabilities apply to.

      2. Organizations should use authoritative CVE and CCE names in their external vulnerability
         communications, as well as the CPE names for the IT products that the vulnerabilities apply to.
         For example, communications to incident response teams should reference, when known, the
         CVE or CCE names of the vulnerabilities that are being exploited and the CPE names of the
         products that are being exploited. This ensures that incident communications precisely identify
         relevant vulnerabilities and affected products, enable correlation and integration of reports, and
         enable correlation with supplemental information residing in other data repositories. Another
         example is that organizations should use CVE and CCE names when communicating with
         vendors that support CVE and CCE names. Suppose that a vendor-supplied patch that purports to
         fix a vulnerability is defective; a statement to the vendor that a given CVE vulnerability remains
         after applying the patch conveys important information clearly and succinctly. Communications


                                                        4

   with vendors of scanning tools regarding false positives or false negatives will be clearer if the
   vulnerability is labeled by CVE or CCE name.

3. As recommended in NIST SP 800-117 Revision 1, organizations should encourage security
   software vendors to incorporate support for CVE and CCE into their products, as well as
   encourage all software vendors to include authoritative CVE and CCE names in their product
   security advisories and other security-related documentation and communications, as well as to
   reference the CPE names for their products.

4.      Recommendations for Software Developers and Service Providers

This section makes recommendations for how software developers and service providers should take
advantage of CVE and CCE’s capabilities. This improves interoperability, thus increasing the efficiency
of security management and improving the effectiveness of security operations. Also, as described in the
introduction to Section 3, using CPE names when indicating which products CVE and CCE names apply
to further supports interoperability and standardization.

4.1     Name Creation

      1. Software developers should participate in the CVE issuance processes to help ensure that CVEs
         provide the necessary information and are created in a timely manner, such as while planning a
         public vulnerability announcement or immediately after a vulnerability has been publicly
         announced. For more information on the CVE issuance process, see
         http://cve.mitre.org/cve/identifiers/index.html or contact cve@mitre.org.

      2. Authors of CVE names should reference applicable vendor patch identification whenever
         possible.

      3. Software developers are encouraged to work with the MITRE Corporation to establish unique
         CCE identifiers for their products’ security configuration settings. Basic information on this is
         available at http://cce.mitre.org/lists/creation_process.html. Software developers should contact
         the CCE Content Team at cce@mitre.org for more information on the process.

4.2     Name Use

      1. Software developers and service providers should incorporate support for CVE and CCE into
         their products and services that reference publicly known software vulnerabilities. Also, CPE
         names should be used when indicating which products the CVE and CCE names apply to.

      2. Software developers and service providers should incorporate the appropriate authoritative CVE
         and/or CCE names in their security advisories and other vulnerability-related documentation and
         communications, as well as the CPE names that indicate which products the CVE and/or CCE
         names apply to. Using CVE, CCE, and CPE names supports the use of standardized security
         automation technologies, which rely on common vulnerability and product names, and ensures
         clarity when referencing a given vulnerability.
