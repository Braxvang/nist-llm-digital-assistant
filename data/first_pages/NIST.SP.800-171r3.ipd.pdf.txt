May 2023

Abstract
The protection of Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) resident in nonfederal systems and
organizations is of paramount importance to federal agencies and can directly impact the ability
of the Federal Government to successfully conduct its essential missions and functions. This
publication provides agencies with recommended security requirements for protecting the
confidentiality of CUI when the information is resident in nonfederal systems and organizations,
when the nonfederal organization is not collecting or maintaining information on behalf of a
federal agency or using or operating a system on behalf of an agency, and where there are no
specific safeguarding requirements for protecting the confidentiality of CUI prescribed by the
authorizing law, regulation, or governmentwide policy for the CUI category listed in the CUI
Registry. The requirements apply to components of nonfederal systems that process, store, or
transmit CUI or that provide protection for such components. The security requirements are
intended for use by federal agencies in contractual vehicles or other agreements established
between those agencies and nonfederal organizations.

Audience
This publication serves a diverse group of individuals and organizations in the public and private
sectors, including individuals with:
    •   System development life cycle responsibilities (e.g., program managers, mission/business
        owners, information owners/stewards, system designers and developers, system/security
        engineers, systems integrators)
    •   Acquisition or procurement responsibilities (e.g., contracting officers)
    •   System, security, or risk management and oversight responsibilities (e.g., authorizing
        officials, chief information officers, chief information security officers, system owners,
        information security managers)
    •   Security assessment and monitoring responsibilities (e.g., auditors, system evaluators,
        assessors, independent verifiers/validators, analysts)
The above roles and responsibilities can be viewed from two perspectives:
    •   Federal perspective: The entity establishing and conveying the security requirements in
        contractual vehicles or other types of agreements
    •   Nonfederal perspective: The entity responding to and complying with the security
        requirements set forth in contracts or agreements

Note to Reviewers
This update to NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-171 represents over one year of data
collection, technical analysis, customer interaction, redesign, and development of the security
requirements and supporting information for the protection of Controlled Unclassified
Information (CUI). Many trade-offs have been made to ensure that the technical and non-
technical requirements have been stated clearly and concisely, while at the same time
recognizing the specific needs of both federal and nonfederal organizations. The following
provides a summary of the significant changes that have been made to NIST SP 800-171 in
transitioning from Revision 2 to Revision 3:
    •   Streamlined introductory information in Section 1 and Section 2 to improve clarity and
        customer understanding
    •   Modified the security requirements and families in Section 3 to reflect the controls in the
        NIST SP 800-53B [13] moderate baseline and the tailoring actions in Appendix C
    •   Eliminated the distinction between basic and derived security requirements
    •   Increased the specificity of security requirements to remove ambiguity, improve the
        effectiveness of implementation, and clarify the scope of assessments
    •   Introduced organization-defined parameters (ODP) in selected security requirements to
        increase flexibility and help organizations better manage risk
    •   Grouped security requirements, where possible, to improve understanding and efficiency
        of implementation and assessments
    •   Removed outdated and redundant security requirements
    •   Added titles to security requirements
    •   Introduced a new tailoring category, Not Applicable (NA)
    •   Recategorized selected controls in the NIST SP 800-53B moderate baseline (using the
        tailoring criteria in Appendix C)
    •   Recast the security requirements, where possible, for consistency with the security
        control language in NIST SP 800-53
    •   Developed a prototype CUI overlay that expresses security requirements using the
        tailored security controls in NIST SP 800-53
    •   Revised the structure of the References, Acronyms, and Glossary sections for greater
        clarity and ease of use
    •   Revised the tailoring table in Appendix C for consistency with the changes to the security
        requirements
    •   Transitioned the mapping tables formerly resident in Appendix D of NIST SP 800-171,
        Revision 2 to the publication details web page along with other supporting material

Information regarding the transition of security requirements from NIST SP 800-171, Revision 2
to Revision 3 can be found on the publication details web page.

     May 2023


 1       Introduction
 2   Executive Order (EO) 13556 [1] established a governmentwide program to standardize the way
 3   the executive branch handles Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). 1 EO 13556 required
 4   that the CUI program emphasize openness, transparency, and uniformity of governmentwide
 5   practices and that the program implementation take place in a manner consistent with Office of
 6   Management and Budget (OMB) policies and National Institute of Standards and Technology
 7   (NIST) standards and guidelines. As the CUI program Executive Agent, the National Archives
 8   and Records Administration (NARA) provides information, guidance, policy, and requirements
 9   on handling CUI [4]. This includes approved CUI categories and descriptions, the basis for
10   safeguarding and dissemination controls, and procedures for the use of CUI. 2 The CUI federal
11   regulation [5] provides guidance to federal agencies on the designation, safeguarding, marking,
12   dissemination, decontrolling, and disposition of CUI; establishes self-inspection and oversight
13   requirements; and delineates other facets of the program.

14   The CUI regulation requires federal agencies that use federal information systems 3 to process,
15   store, or transmit CUI to comply with NIST standards and guidelines. The responsibility of
16   federal agencies to protect CUI does not change when such information is shared with nonfederal
17   organizations. 4 Therefore, a similar level of protection is needed when CUI is processed, stored,
18   or transmitted by nonfederal organizations using nonfederal systems. 5 The security requirements
19   for safeguarding CUI in nonfederal systems and organizations are derived from FIPS 199 [6],
20   FIPS 200 [7], and NIST SP 800-53 [8] to maintain a consistent level of protection.

21            Purpose and Applicability
22   The purpose of this publication is to provide federal agencies with recommended security
23   requirements 6 for protecting the confidentiality of CUI: 7
24        •     When the CUI is resident in a nonfederal system and organization
25        •     When the nonfederal organization is not collecting or maintaining information on behalf
26              of a federal agency or using or operating a system on behalf of an agency 8



     1
       CUI is any information that law, regulation, or governmentwide policy requires to have safeguarding or disseminating controls, excluding
     information that is classified under E.O. 13526 [2] or any predecessor or successor order, or the Atomic Energy Act [3] as amended.
     2
       Procedures for the use of CUI include marking, safeguarding, transporting, disseminating, reusing, and disposing of the information.
     3
       An information system is a discrete set of information resources organized expressly for the collection, processing, maintenance, use, sharing,
     dissemination, or disposition of information. Information systems also include specialized systems, such as industrial/process control systems,
     cyber-physical systems, embedded systems, and devices. A federal information system is a system that is used or operated by an executive
     agency, by a contractor of an executive agency, or by another organization on behalf of an executive agency. The term system is used in this
     publication to represent all types of computing platforms that can process, store, or transmit CUI.
     4
       A nonfederal organization is any entity that owns, operates, or maintains a nonfederal system.
     5
       A nonfederal system is any system that does not meet the criteria for a federal information system.
     6
       The term security requirements refers to the protection needs for a system or organization. Security requirements may be derived from many
     sources (e.g., laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, mission and business needs, or risk assessments).
     7
       In accordance with E.O. 13526 [2] and 32 CFR 2002 [5], the scope of CUI protection is limited to confidentiality. However, the security
     objectives of confidentiality and integrity are closely related since many of the underlying security mechanisms at the system level support both
     objectives. Therefore, the security requirements in this publication address the protection of CUI from unauthorized disclosure and modification.
     8
       Nonfederal organizations that collect or maintain information on behalf of a federal agency or that use or operate a system on behalf of an
     agency must comply with the requirements in FISMA [9].

28             of CUI prescribed by the authorizing law, regulation, or governmentwide policy for the
29             CUI category listed in the CUI registry

30   The security requirements in this publication are only applicable to components of nonfederal
31   systems 9 that process, store, or transmit CUI or that provide protection for such components. 10
32   The requirements are intended for use by federal agencies in contractual vehicles or other
33   agreements that are established between those agencies and nonfederal organizations.

49        The Fundamentals
50   This section describes the basic assumptions and methodology used to develop the requirements
51   to protect the confidentiality of CUI in nonfederal systems and organizations. It also includes the
52   tailoring 11 criteria applied to the requirements and controls in FIPS 200 [7] and NIST SP 800-53
53   [8].

54            Basic Assumptions
55   The recommended security requirements in this publication are based on the following
56   assumptions:
57        •     Federal information designated as CUI has the same value, whether such information
58              resides in a federal or a nonfederal system or organization.
59        •     Statutory and regulatory requirements for the protection of CUI are consistent in federal
60              and nonfederal systems and organizations.
61        •     Safeguards implemented to protect CUI are consistent in federal and nonfederal systems
62              and organizations.
63        •     The confidentiality impact value for CUI is no less than moderate. 12

64            Security Requirement Development Methodology
65   Starting with the NIST SP 800-53 security controls in the NIST SP 800-53B [13] moderate
66   control baseline, which satisfy the minimum-security requirements in FIPS 200, the controls are
67   tailored to eliminate selected controls or parts of controls that are:
68        •     Primarily the responsibility of the Federal Government
69        •     Not directly related to protecting the confidentiality of CUI
70        •     Expected to be implemented by nonfederal organizations without specification by the
71              Federal Government

72   The NIST SP 800-171 security requirements represent a subset of the controls that are necessary
73   for a comprehensive information security program. The security requirements are organized into
74   17 families, as illustrated in Table 1. Each family contains the particular requirements related to
75   the general security topic of the family. Certain families from NIST SP 800-53 are not included
76   due to the aforementioned tailoring criteria. 13




     11
        The term tailoring is the process by which security and privacy control baselines are modified to achieve certain organizational goals and
     objectives [13].
     12
        In accordance with 32 CFR 2002 [5], CUI is categorized at no less than the moderate confidentiality impact value as defined in FIPS 199 [6].
     However, when federal law, regulation, or governmentwide policy establishing the control of CUI specifies controls that differ from those of the
     moderate confidentiality baseline, then these will be followed.
     13
        The PII Processing and Transparency (PT) family is not included because PII is a category of CUI, and therefore, no additional requirements
     are specified for confidentiality protection. The Program Management (PM) family is not included because it is not associated with any security
     control baseline.



                                                                             3

 78
 79   For some requirements, organization-defined parameters (ODP) are included. These ODPs
 80   provide additional flexibility by allowing federal organizations to specify values for the
 81   designated parameters, as needed. Flexibility is achieved using assignment and selection
 82   operations. The assignment and selection operations provide the capability to customize the
 83   requirements based on organizational protection needs. Determination of organization-defined
 84   parameter values can be guided and informed by laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations,
 85   policies, standards, guidance, or mission and business needs. Once specified, the values for the
 86   organization-defined parameters become part of the requirement.

 87   A discussion section is included with each requirement. It is derived from the controls discussion
 88   sections in NIST SP 800-53 and provides additional information to facilitate the implementation
 89   and assessment of the requirements. The discussion section is informative, not normative. It is
 90   not intended to extend the scope of a requirement or to influence the solutions that organizations
 91   may use to satisfy a requirement. The use of examples is notional, not exhaustive and not
 92   reflective of potential options available to organizations. A references section provides the
 93   source controls from NIST SP 800-53 and a list of NIST Special Publications with additional
 94   information on the topic described in the security requirement.

 95   The structure and content of a typical security requirement is provided in the example below:
 96   3.1.8   Unsuccessful Logon Attempts
 97           Limit the number of consecutive invalid logon attempts by a user to [Assignment: organization-
 98           defined number] in [Assignment: organization-defined time period].

 99           DISCUSSION
100           Due to the potential for denial of service, automatic system lockouts are in most cases, temporary and
101           automatically release after a predetermined period established by the organization (i.e., using a delay
102           algorithm). Organizations may employ different delay algorithms for different system components based on
103           the capabilities of the respective components. Responses to unsuccessful system logon attempts may be
104           implemented at the system and application levels.

111      The Requirements
112   This section describes 17 families of security requirements for protecting the confidentiality of
113   CUI in nonfederal systems and organizations. When used in the context of the requirements in
114   Section 3, the term system means a nonfederal system that processes, stores, or transmits CUI.

115         Access Control

116   3.1.1. Account Management
117           a. Define and document the types of system accounts allowed and prohibited.
118           b. Create, enable, modify, disable, and remove accounts in accordance with [Assignment:
119              organization-defined policy, procedures, prerequisites, and criteria].
120           c.   Specify authorized users of the system, group and role membership, and access
121                authorizations (i.e., privileges).
122           d. Authorize access to the system based on a valid access authorization and intended system
123              usage.
124           e. Monitor the use of accounts.
125           f.   Disable accounts of individuals within [Assignment: organization-defined time period] when
126                the accounts:
127                1. Have expired;
128                2. Are no longer associated with a user or individual;
129                3. Are in violation of organizational policy; or
130                4. Have been inactive for [Assignment: organization-defined time period].
131           g. Disable accounts of individuals within [Assignment: organization-defined time period] of
132              discovery of [Assignment: organization-defined significant risks].
133           h. Notify [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] within [Assignment:
134              organization-defined time period]:
135                1. When accounts are no longer required;
136                2. When users are terminated or transferred; and
137                3. When system usage or need-to-know changes for an individual.

138           DISCUSSION
139           This requirement focuses on account management for systems and applications. The definition of
140           and enforcement of access authorizations other than those determined by account type (e.g.,
141           privileged access, non-privileged access) are addressed in requirement 3.1.2. System account
142           types include individual, shared, group, temporary, system, guest, anonymous, emergency,
143           developer, and service. Users who require administrative privileges on system accounts receive
144           additional scrutiny by organizational personnel responsible for approving such accounts and
145           privileged access. Types of accounts that organizations may prohibit due to increased risk include
146           shared, group, emergency, guest, anonymous, and temporary.
147           Organizations may choose to define access privileges or other attributes by account, by type of
148           account, or a combination of both. Other attributes required for authorizing access include
149           restrictions on time-of-day, day-of-week, and point-of-origin. In defining other account attributes,

150           organizations consider system-related requirements (e.g., system upgrades, scheduled
151           maintenance) and mission and business requirements (e.g., time zone differences, remote access
152           to support travel requirements).
153           Users who pose a significant security risk include individuals for whom reliable evidence
154           indicates either the intention to use authorized access to the system to cause harm or that
155           adversaries will cause harm through them. Close coordination among human resource managers,
156           system administrators, legal staff, and human resource managers is essential when disabling
157           system accounts for high-risk individuals. Time periods for notification of organizational
158           personnel or roles may vary.

164   3.1.2. Access Enforcement
165           Enforce approved authorizations for logical access to CUI and system resources in accordance
166           with applicable access control policies.

167           DISCUSSION
168           Access control policies control access between active entities or subjects (i.e., users or processes
169           acting on behalf of users) and passive entities or objects (i.e., devices, files, records, domains) in
170           organizational systems. Types of system access include remote access and access to systems that
171           communicate through external networks, such as the internet. Access enforcement mechanisms
172           can also be employed at the application and service level to provide increased protection for CUI.
173           This recognizes that the system can host many applications and services in support of mission and
174           business functions.

180   3.1.3. Flow Enforcement
181           Enforce approved authorizations for controlling the flow of CUI within the system and between
182           connected systems.

183           DISCUSSION
184           Information flow control regulates where information can transit within a system and between
185           systems (versus who can access the information) and without explicit regard to subsequent
186           accesses to that information. Flow control restrictions include the following: keeping export-
187           controlled information from being transmitted in the clear to the internet, blocking outside traffic
188           that claims to be from within the organization, restricting requests to the internet that are not from
189           the internal web proxy server, and limiting information transfers between organizations based on
190           data structures and content.

191           Organizations commonly use information flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms to
192           control the flow of information between designated sources and destinations (e.g., networks,
193           individuals, and devices) within systems and between interconnected systems. Flow control is
194           based on characteristics of the information or the information path. Enforcement occurs in
195           boundary protection devices (e.g., encrypted tunnels, routers, gateways, and firewalls) that
196           employ rule sets or establish configuration settings that restrict system services, provide a packet-
197           filtering capability based on header information, or provide a message-filtering capability based
198           on message content (e.g., implementing key word searches or using document characteristics).
199           Organizations also consider the trustworthiness of filtering and inspection mechanisms (i.e.,
200           hardware, firmware, and software components) that are critical to information flow enforcement.
201           Transferring information between systems that represent different security domains with different
202           security policies introduces risk that such transfers violate one or more domain security policies.
203           In such situations, information owners or stewards provide guidance at designated policy
204           enforcement points between interconnected systems. Organizations consider mandating specific
205           architectural solutions when required to enforce specific security policies. Enforcement includes
206           prohibiting information transfers between interconnected systems (i.e., allowing information
207           access only), employing hardware mechanisms to enforce one-way information flows, and
208           implementing trustworthy regrading mechanisms to reassign security attributes and security
209           labels.

213   3.1.4. Separation of Duties
214           a. Identify the duties of individuals requiring separation.
215           b. Define system access authorizations to support separation of duties.

216           DISCUSSION
217           Separation of duties addresses the potential for abuse of authorized privileges and helps reduce
218           the risk of malevolent activity without collusion. Separation of duties includes dividing mission
219           functions and support functions among different individuals or roles, conducting system support
220           functions with different individuals or roles (e.g., quality assurance, configuration management,
221           testing, system management, programming, and network security), and ensuring that security
222           personnel who administer access control functions do not also administer audit functions.
223           Because separation of duty violations can span systems and application domains, organizations
224           consider the entirety of their systems and system components when developing policies on
225           separation of duties.

229   3.1.5. Least Privilege
230           a. Allow only authorized system access for users (or processes acting on behalf of users) that
231              are necessary to accomplish assigned organizational tasks.

232           b. Authorize access for [Assignment: organization-defined individuals or roles] to [Assignment:
233              organization-defined security functions and security-relevant information].
234           c.   Review [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] the privileges assigned to [Assignment:
235                organization-defined roles or classes of users] to validate the need for such privileges.
236           d. Reassign or remove privileges, as necessary.

237           DISCUSSION
238           Organizations employ the principle of least privilege for specific duties and authorized access for
239           users and processes. Security functions include establishing system accounts, configuring access
240           authorizations (i.e., permissions, privileges), configuring settings for events to be audited, and
241           establishing intrusion detection parameters. Security-relevant information includes filtering rules
242           for routers or firewalls, configuration parameters for security services, cryptographic key
243           management information, and access control lists. Authorized personnel include security
244           administrators, system administrators, system security officers, system programmers, and other
245           privileged users. Organizations consider creating additional processes, roles, and system accounts
246           to achieve least privilege. Least privilege is also applied to the development, implementation, and
247           operation of the system.

251   3.1.6. Least Privilege – Privileged Accounts
252           a. Restrict privileged accounts on the system to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or
253              roles].
254           b. Require that users of system accounts (or roles) with access to [Assignment: organization-
255              defined security functions or security-relevant information] use non-privileged accounts or
256              roles when accessing nonsecurity functions.

257           DISCUSSION
258           Privileged accounts, including super user accounts, are typically described as system
259           administrator accounts for various types of commercial off-the-shelf operating systems.
260           Restricting privileged accounts to specific personnel or roles prevents nonprivileged users from
261           accessing privileged information or privileged functions. In restricting privileged accounts,
262           organizations may differentiate between allowed privileges for local accounts and domain
263           accounts provided that they retain the ability to control system configurations for key parameters
264           and as otherwise necessary to sufficiently mitigate risk.
265           Requiring the use of non-privileged accounts when accessing nonsecurity functions limits
266           exposure when operating from within privileged accounts or roles. The inclusion of roles
267           addresses situations in which organizations implement access control policies, such as role-based
268           access control, and where a change of role provides the same degree of assurance in the change of
269           access authorizations for the user and the processes acting on behalf of the user as would be
270           provided by a change between a privileged and non-privileged account.

274   3.1.7. Least Privilege – Privileged Functions
275           a. Prevent non-privileged users from executing privileged functions.
276           b. Log the execution of privileged functions.

277           DISCUSSION
278           Privileged functions include establishing system accounts, performing system integrity checks,
279           conducting patching operations, or administering cryptographic key management activities. Non-
280           privileged users do not possess appropriate authorizations. Circumventing intrusion detection and
281           prevention mechanisms or malicious code protection mechanisms are examples of privileged
282           functions that require protection from non-privileged users. Note that this requirement represents
283           a condition to be achieved by the definition of authorized privileges in 3.1.2.
284           The misuse of privileged functions – whether intentionally or unintentionally by authorized users
285           or by unauthorized external entities that have compromised system accounts – is a serious and
286           ongoing concern that can have significant adverse impacts on organizations. Logging the use of
287           privileged functions is one way to detect such misuse and mitigate the risk from insider threats
288           and advanced persistent threats.

292   3.1.8. Unsuccessful Logon Attempts
293           Limit the number of consecutive invalid logon attempts by a user to [Assignment: organization-
294           defined number] in [Assignment: organization-defined time period].

295           DISCUSSION
296           Due to the potential for denial of service, automatic system lockouts are in most cases, temporary
297           and automatically release after a predetermined period established by the organization (i.e., using
298           a delay algorithm). Organizations may employ different delay algorithms for different system
299           components based on the capabilities of the respective components. Responses to unsuccessful
300           system logon attempts may be implemented at the system and application levels.

304   3.1.9. System Use Notification
305           Display system use notification message or banner to users before granting access to the system
306           that provides privacy and security notices consistent with applicable CUI rules.

307           DISCUSSION
308           System use notifications can be implemented using messages or warning banners that are
309           displayed before individuals log in to the system. System use notifications are used only for
310           access via logon interfaces with human users and are not required when human interfaces do not
311           exist. Based on a risk assessment, organizations consider whether a secondary system use
312           notification is needed to access applications or other system resources after the initial network

319   3.1.10. Device Lock
320             a. Prevent access to the system by [Selection (one or more): initiating a device lock after
321                [Assignment: organization-defined time period] of inactivity; requiring the user to initiate a
322                device lock before leaving the system unattended].
323             b. Retain the device lock until the user reestablishes access using established identification
324                and authentication procedures.
325             c.   Conceal, via the device lock, information previously visible on the display with a publicly
326                  viewable image.

327             DISCUSSION
328             Device locks are temporary actions taken to prevent access to the system when users depart
329             from the immediate vicinity of the system but do not want to log out because of the temporary
330             nature of their absences. Device locks can be implemented at the operating system or
331             application level. User-initiated device locking is behavior- or policy-based and requires users
332             to take physical action to initiate the device lock. Device locks are not an acceptable substitute
333             for logging out of the system, such as when organizations require users to log out at the end of
334             workdays. Pattern-hiding displays can include static or dynamic images, such as patterns used
335             with screen savers, photographic images, solid colors, a clock, a battery life indicator, or a blank
336             screen with the caveat that controlled unclassified information is not displayed.

340   3.1.11. Session Termination
341             Terminate a user session automatically after [Assignment: organization-defined conditions or
342             trigger events].

343             DISCUSSION
344             This requirement addresses the termination of user-initiated logical sessions in contrast to the
345             termination of network connections that are associated with communications sessions (i.e.,
346             disconnecting from the network) in 3.13.9. A logical session is initiated whenever a user (or
347             process acting on behalf of a user) accesses a system. Such sessions can be terminated (and
348             terminate user access) without terminating network sessions. Session termination terminates all
349             processes associated with a user’s logical session except those processes that are specifically
350             created by the user (i.e., session owner) to continue after the session is terminated. Conditions
351             or trigger events that require automatic session termination can include organization-defined
352             periods of user inactivity, time-of-day restrictions on system use, and targeted responses to
353             certain types of incidents.

357   3.1.12. Remote Access
358             a. Establish, authorize, and document usage restrictions, configurations, and connections
359                allowed for each type of permitted remote access.
360             b. Monitor and control remote access methods.
361             c.   Route remote access to the system through managed access control points.
362             d. Authorize remote execution of privileged commands and remote access to security-relevant
363                information.
364             e. Implement cryptographic mechanisms to protect the confidentiality of remote access
365                sessions.

366             DISCUSSION
367             Remote access to the system represents a significant potential vulnerability that can be exploited
368             by adversaries. Monitoring and controlling remote access methods allows organizations to
369             detect attacks and help ensure compliance with remote access policies. This occurs by auditing
370             the connection activities of remote users on a variety of systems, including servers, notebook
371             computers, workstations, smart phones, and tablets. Routing remote access through managed
372             access control points enhances explicit control over such connections. It also reduces the
373             susceptibility to unauthorized access to the system which could result in the unauthorized
374             disclosure of CUI.
375             Restricting the execution of privileged commands and access to security-relevant information
376             via remote access reduces the exposure of the organization and its susceptibility to threats by
377             adversaries. A privileged command is a human-initiated command executed on a system that
378             involves the control, monitoring, or administration of the system, including security functions
379             and security-relevant information. Security-relevant information is information that can
380             potentially impact the operation of security functions or the provision of security services in a
381             manner that could result in failure to enforce the system security policy or maintain isolation of
382             code and data. Privileged commands give individuals the ability to execute sensitive, security-
383             critical, or security-relevant system functions. Controlling access from remote locations helps to
384             ensure that unauthorized individuals are not able to execute such commands with the potential
385             to do serious or catastrophic damage to the system.

393   3.1.16. Wireless Access
394             a. Establish configuration requirements, connection requirements, and implementation
395                guidance for wireless access to the system.
396             b. Authorize wireless access to the system prior to allowing such connections.
397             c.   Protect wireless access to the system using authentication and encryption.
398             d. Disable, when not intended for use, wireless networking capabilities embedded within the
399                system prior to issuance and deployment.

400             DISCUSSION
401             Establishing usage restrictions, configuration requirements, and connection requirements for
402             wireless access to the system provides criteria for organizations to support wireless access
403             authorization decisions. These restrictions and requirements help to reduce the susceptibility to
404             unauthorized system access through wireless technologies. Wireless networks use
405             authentication protocols that provide credential protection and mutual authentication.
406             Organizations authenticate individuals and devices to protect wireless access to the system.
407             Special attention is given to the wide variety of devices that are part of the Internet of Things
408             with potential wireless access to the system. Wireless networking capabilities that are embedded
409             within system components represent a significant potential vulnerability that can be exploited
410             by adversaries. Disabling wireless capabilities when not needed for essential organizational
411             missions or functions can reduce susceptibility to threats by adversaries involving wireless
412             technologies.

419                guidance for organization-controlled mobile devices.
420             b. Authorize the connection of mobile devices to the system.
421             c.   Implement [Selection: full-device encryption; container-based encryption] to protect the
422                  confidentiality of CUI on mobile devices.

423             DISCUSSION
424             A mobile device is a computing device that has a small form factor such that it can easily be
425             carried by a single individual; is designed to operate without a physical connection; possesses
426             local, non-removable or removable data storage; and includes a self-contained power source.
427             Mobile device functionality may also include voice communication capabilities, on-board
428             sensors that allow the device to capture information, and/or built-in features for synchronizing
429             local data with remote locations. Examples include smart phones and tablets. Mobile devices
430             are typically associated with a single individual. The processing, storage, and transmission
431             capability of mobile devices may be comparable to or a subset of notebook/desktop systems,
432             depending on the nature and intended purpose of the device. The protection and control of
433             mobile devices is behavior- or policy-based and requires users to take physical action to protect

434             and control such devices when outside of controlled areas. Controlled areas are spaces for
435             which the organization provides physical or procedural controls to meet the requirements
436             established for protecting CUI.
437             Due to the large variety of mobile devices with different characteristics and capabilities,
438             organizational restrictions may vary for the different classes or types of such devices. Usage
439             restrictions and specific implementation guidance for mobile devices include configuration
440             management, device identification and authentication, implementation of mandatory protective
441             software, scanning devices for malicious code, updating virus protection software, scanning for
442             critical software updates and patches, conducting primary operating system (and possibly other
443             resident software) integrity checks, and disabling unnecessary hardware.
444             Organizations can employ full-device encryption or container-based encryption to protect the
445             confidentiality of CUI on mobile devices and computing platforms. Container-based encryption
446             provides a fine-grained approach to the encryption of data and information, including
447             encrypting selected data structures such as files, records, or fields.

452   3.1.20. Use of External Systems
453             a. [Selection (one or more): Establish [Assignment: organization-defined terms and
454                conditions]; Identify [Assignment: organization-defined controls asserted to be implemented
455                on external systems]], consistent with the trust relationships established with other
456                organizations owning, operating, and/or maintaining external systems, allowing authorized
457                individuals to:
458                 1. Access the system from external systems; and
459                 2. Process, store, or transmit CUI using external systems; or
460             b. Prohibit the use of [Assignment: organizationally-defined types of external systems].

461             DISCUSSION
462             External systems are systems that are used by but are not part of the organizational system and
463             for which the organization has no direct control over the implementation of required controls or
464             the assessment of control effectiveness. External systems include personally owned systems,
465             system components, or devices; privately owned computing and communication devices in
466             commercial or public facilities; systems owned or controlled by nonfederal organizations; and
467             systems managed by contractors. Organizations have the option to prohibit the use of any type
468             of external system or specified types of external systems, (e.g., prohibit the use of any external
469             system that is not organizationally owned or prohibit the use of personally owned systems).
470             Authorized individuals include organizational personnel, contractors, or other individuals with
471             authorized access to the organizational system and over whom organizations have the authority
472             to impose specific rules of behavior regarding system access. Restrictions that organizations
473             impose on authorized individuals need not be uniform, as the restrictions may vary depending
474             on the trust relationships between organizations.

478   3.1.21. External Systems – Limits and Restrictions on Authorized Use
479             a. Permit authorized individuals to use an external system to access the system or to process,
480                store, or transmit CUI only after:
481                 1. Implemented controls on the external system as specified in the organization’s security
482                    policies and security plans are verified; or
483                 2. Approved system connection or processing agreements with the organizational entity
484                    hosting the external system are retained.
485             b. Restrict the use of organization-controlled portable storage devices by authorized
486                individuals on external systems as follows: [Assignment: organization-defined usage
487                restrictions].

488             DISCUSSION
489             Limiting authorized use recognizes circumstances in which individuals who use external
490             systems may need to access the organizational system. Organizations need assurance that the
491             external systems contain the necessary controls so as not to compromise, damage, or otherwise
492             harm the system. Verification that the required controls have been implemented can be achieved

516             DISCUSSION
517             Inactivity logout is behavior- or policy-based and requires users to take physical action to log
518             out when they are expecting inactivity longer than the defined period. Automatic enforcement
519             of inactivity logout is addressed by 3.1.10.

523         Awareness and Training

524   3.2.1. Literacy Training and Awareness
525           a. Provide security literacy training to system users:
526                1. As part of initial training for new users and [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]
527                   thereafter; and
528                2. When required by system changes or following [Assignment: organization-defined
529                   events].
530           b. Update training and awareness content [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and
531              following [Assignment: organization-defined events].

532           DISCUSSION
533           Organizations provide basic and advanced levels of literacy training to system users (including
534           managers, senior executives, system administrators, and contractors) and measures to test the
535           knowledge level of users. Organizations determine the content of literacy training and awareness
536           based on specific organizational requirements, the systems to which personnel have authorized
537           access, and work environments (e.g., telework). The content includes an understanding of the
538           need for security and the actions required of users to maintain security and to respond to
539           suspected incidents. The content also addresses the need for operations security and the handling
540           of CUI.
541           Awareness techniques include displaying posters, offering supplies inscribed with security
542           reminders, displaying logon screen messages, generating email advisories or notices from
543           organizational officials, and conducting awareness events. Literacy training is conducted at a
544           frequency consistent with applicable laws, directives, regulations, and policies. Updating literacy
545           training and awareness content on a regular basis helps to ensure that the content remains
546           relevant. Events that may precipitate an update to literacy training and awareness content include,
547           but are not limited to, assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in
548           applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines.

552   3.2.2. Role-Based Training
553           a. Provide role-based security training to organizational personnel:
554                1. Before authorizing access to the system, CUI, or performing assigned duties, and
555                   [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] thereafter; and

557           b. Update role-based training content [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and
558              following [Assignment: organization-defined events].

559           DISCUSSION
560           Organizations determine the content and frequency of security training based on the assigned
561           duties, roles, and responsibilities of individuals and the security requirements of organizations
562           and the systems to which personnel have authorized access. In addition, organizations provide
563           system developers, enterprise architects, security architects, acquisition/procurement officials,
564           software developers, system developers, systems integrators, system and network administrators,
565           personnel conducting configuration management and auditing activities, personnel performing
566           independent verification and validation, security assessors, and personnel with access to system-
567           level software with security-related technical training specifically tailored for their assigned
568           duties.
569           Comprehensive role-based training addresses management, operational, and technical roles and
570           responsibilities that cover physical, personnel, and technical controls. Such training can include
571           policies, procedures, tools, and artifacts for the security roles defined. Organizations also provide
572           the training necessary for individuals to carry out their responsibilities related to operations and
573           supply chain security within the context of organizational information security programs.

577   3.2.3. Advanced Literacy Training
578           Provide literacy training on recognizing and reporting potential and actual indicators of insider
579           threat, social engineering, and social mining.

580           DISCUSSION
581           Potential indicators and possible precursors of insider threat include behaviors such as inordinate,
582           long-term job dissatisfaction; attempts to gain access to information that is not required for job
583           performance; unexplained access to financial resources; bullying or sexual harassment of fellow
584           employees; workplace violence; and other serious violations of the policies, procedures,
585           directives, rules, or practices of organizations. Security awareness training includes how to
586           communicate employee and management concerns regarding potential indicators of insider threat
587           through appropriate organizational channels in accordance with established organizational
588           policies and procedures. Organizations may consider tailoring insider threat awareness topics to
589           the role (e.g., training for managers may be focused on specific changes in the behavior of team
590           members, while training for employees may be focused on more general observations).
591           Social engineering is an attempt to deceive an individual into revealing information or taking an
592           action that can be used to breach, compromise, or otherwise adversely impact a system. Social
593           engineering includes phishing, pretexting, impersonation, baiting, quid pro quo, thread-jacking,

594           social media exploitation, and tailgating. Social mining is an attempt to gather information about
595           the organization that may be used to support future attacks. Literacy training includes information
596           on how to effectively communicate the concerns of employees and management regarding
597           potential and actual instances of social engineering and data mining through organizational
598           channels based on established policies and procedures.

602         Audit and Accountability

603   3.3.1. Event Logging
604           a. Specify the following event types for logging within the system: [Assignment: organization-
605              defined event types].
606           b. Review and update the event types selected for logging [Assignment: organization-defined
607              frequency].

608           DISCUSSION
609           An event is any observable occurrence in a system, which includes unlawful or unauthorized
610           system activity. Organizations identify event types for which a logging functionality is needed as
611           those events that are significant and relevant to the security of systems and the environments in
612           which those systems operate to meet specific and ongoing auditing needs. Event types can
613           include password changes, failed logons or failed accesses related to systems, administrative
614           privilege usage, or third-party credential usage. In determining event types that require logging,
615           organizations consider the system monitoring and auditing that are appropriate for each of the
616           CUI security requirements. When defining event types, organizations consider the logging
617           necessary to cover related events, such as the steps in distributed, transaction-based processes
618           (e.g., processes that are distributed across multiple organizations) and actions that occur in
619           service-oriented or cloud-based architectures. Monitoring and auditing requirements can be
620           balanced with other system needs. For example, organizations may determine that systems must
621           have the capability to log every file access, both successful and unsuccessful, but not activate that
622           capability except for specific circumstances due to the potential burden on system performance.
623           The event types that are logged by organizations may change over time. Periodically reviewing
624           and updating the set of logged event types is necessary to ensure that the current set remains
625           necessary and sufficient.

633           DISCUSSION
634           Audit record content that may be necessary to support the auditing function includes time stamps,
635           source and destination addresses, user or process identifiers, event descriptions, filenames, and
636           the access control or flow control rules that are invoked. Event outcomes can include indicators of
637           event success or failure and event-specific results (e.g., the security state of the system after the
638           event occurred). Detailed information that organizations may consider in audit records includes a
639           full text recording of privileged commands or the individual identities of group account users.

647           c.   Retain audit records for [Assignment: organization-defined time period consistent with
648                records retention policy, applicable contract requirement, law, or regulation].

649           DISCUSSION
650           Audit records can be generated at various levels of abstraction, including at the packet level as
651           information traverses the network. Selecting the appropriate level of abstraction is a critical
652           aspect of an audit logging capability and can facilitate the identification of root causes to
653           problems. The ability to add information generated in audit records is dependent on system
654           functionality to configure the audit record content. Organizations may consider additional
655           information in audit records including access control or flow control rules invoked and individual
656           identities of group account users. Organizations may also consider limiting additional audit
657           record information to only information that is explicitly needed for audit requirements.

664           b. Take the following additional actions: [Assignment: organization-defined additional actions].

665           DISCUSSION
666           Audit logging process failures include software and hardware errors, failures in audit log
667           capturing mechanisms, and reaching or exceeding audit log storage capacity. Response actions
668           include overwriting the oldest audit records, shutting down the system, and stopping the
669           generation of audit records. Organizations may choose to define additional actions for audit
670           logging process failures based on the type of failure, the location of the failure, the severity of the
671           failure, or a combination of such factors. When the audit logging process failure is related to

684           c.   Analyze and correlate audit records across different repositories to gain organization-wide
685                situational awareness.

686           DISCUSSION
687           Audit record review, analysis, and reporting covers information security-related logging
688           performed by organizations and can include logging that results from the monitoring of account
689           usage, remote access, wireless connectivity, configuration settings, the use of maintenance tools
690           and non-local maintenance, system component inventory, mobile device connection, physical
691           access, temperature and humidity, equipment delivery and removal, communications at system
692           interfaces, and the use of mobile code. Findings can be reported to organizational entities that
693           include the incident response team, help desk, and security or privacy offices. If organizations are
694           prohibited from reviewing and analyzing audit records or unable to conduct such activities, the
695           review or analysis may be carried out by other organizations granted such authority. The scope,
696           frequency, and/or depth of the audit record review, analysis, and reporting may be adjusted to
697           meet organizational needs based on new information received. Correlating audit record review,
698           analysis, and reporting processes helps to ensure that they do not operate independently but rather
699           collectively create a more complete view of events. Regarding the assessment of a given system,
700           the requirement is agnostic as to whether this correlation is applied at the system level or at the
701           organization level across all systems.

709           b. Preserve the original content and time ordering of audit records.

710           DISCUSSION
711           Audit record reduction is a process that manipulates collected audit information and organizes it
712           in a summary format that is more meaningful to analysts. Audit record reduction and report
713           generation capabilities do not always come from the same system or organizational entities that

714           conduct auditing activities. An audit record reduction capability can include, for example, modern
715           data mining techniques with advanced data filters to identify anomalous behavior in audit records.
716           The report generation capability provided by the system can help generate customizable reports.
717           The time ordering of audit records can be a significant issue if the granularity of the time stamp in
718           the record is insufficient.

724           b. Record time stamps for audit records that meet [Assignment: organization-defined granularity
725              of time measurement] and that:
726                1. Use Coordinated Universal Time (UTC);
727                2. Have a fixed local time offset from UTC; or
728                3. Include the local time offset as part of the time stamp.

729           DISCUSSION
730           Time stamps generated by the system include the date and time. Time is commonly expressed in
731           Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) – a modern continuation of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) –
732           or local time with an offset from UTC. The granularity of time measurements refers to the degree
733           of synchronization between system clocks and reference clocks (e.g., clocks synchronizing within
734           hundreds of milliseconds or tens of milliseconds). Organizations may define different time
735           granularities for different system components. Time service can be critical to other security
736           capabilities, such as access control, and identification and authentication, depending on the nature
737           of the mechanisms used to support those capabilities.

742           Protect audit information and audit logging tools from unauthorized access, modification, and
743           deletion.

744           DISCUSSION
745           Audit information includes information needed to successfully audit system activity, such as audit
746           records, audit log settings, audit reports, and personally identifiable information. Audit logging
747           tools are programs and devices used to conduct system audit and logging activities. The
748           protection of audit information focuses on technical protection and limits the ability to access and
749           execute audit logging tools to authorized individuals. The physical protection of audit information

754   3.3.9. Audit Information Access
755           Authorize access to management of audit logging functionality to a subset of privileged users or
756           roles.

757           DISCUSSION
758           Individuals or roles with privileged access to a system and who are also the subject of an audit by
759           that system may affect the reliability of the audit information by inhibiting audit activities or
760           modifying audit records. Requiring privileged access to be further defined between audit-related
761           privileges and other privileges limits the number of users or roles with audit-related privileges.

765         Configuration Management

766   3.4.1. Baseline Configuration
767           a. Develop, document, and maintain under configuration control, a current baseline
768              configuration of the system.
769           b. Review and update the baseline configuration of the system [Assignment: organization-
770              defined frequency] and when system components are installed or upgraded.

771           DISCUSSION
772           Baseline configurations for systems and system components include aspects of connectivity,
773           operation, and communications. Baseline configurations are documented, formally reviewed, and
774           agreed-upon specifications for systems or configuration items within those systems. Baseline
775           configurations serve as a basis for future builds, releases, or changes to systems and include
776           security control implementations, information about system components, operational procedures,
777           network topology, and the logical placement of components in the system architecture.
778           Maintaining baseline configurations requires creating new baselines as organizational systems
779           change over time. Baseline configurations of systems reflect the current enterprise architecture.

790           DISCUSSION
791           Configuration settings are the set of parameters that can be changed in hardware, software, or
792           firmware components of the system that affect the security posture or functionality of the system.
793           Security-related configuration settings can be defined for computing systems (e.g., servers,
794           workstations), input and output devices (e.g., scanners, copiers, printers), network components
795           (e.g., firewalls, routers, gateways, voice and data switches, wireless access points, network
796           appliances, sensors), operating systems, middleware, and applications.
797           Security parameters are those parameters that impact the security state of systems, including the
798           parameters required to satisfy other security requirements. Security parameters include registry
799           settings; account, file, and directory permission settings; and settings for functions, ports,
800           protocols, and remote connections. Organizations establish organization-wide configuration
801           settings and subsequently derive specific configuration settings for systems. The established
802           settings become part of the systems configuration baseline.
803           Common secure configurations (also referred to as security configuration checklists, lockdown
804           and hardening guides, security reference guides, and security technical implementation guides)
805           provide recognized, standardized, and established benchmarks that stipulate secure configuration
806           settings for specific information technology platforms/products and instructions for configuring
807           those system components to meet operational requirements. Common secure configurations can
808           be developed by a variety of organizations, including information technology product developers,
809           manufacturers, vendors, consortia, academia, industry, federal agencies, and other organizations
810           in the public and private sectors.

814   3.4.3. Configuration Change Control
815           a. Determine the types of changes to the system that are configuration-controlled.
816           b. Review proposed configuration-controlled changes to the system, and approve or disapprove
817              such changes with explicit consideration for security impacts.
818           c.   Implement and document approved configuration-controlled changes to the system.
819           d. Monitor and review activities associated with configuration-controlled changes to the system.

820           DISCUSSION
821           Configuration change control refers to tracking, reviewing, approving or disapproving, and
822           logging changes. Specifically, it involves the systematic proposal, justification, implementation,
823           testing, review, and disposition of changes to systems, including system upgrades and
824           modifications. Configuration change control includes changes to baseline configurations for
825           system components and configuration items of systems, changes to configuration settings for IT
826           products (e.g., operating systems, applications, firewalls, routers, mobile devices), unscheduled
827           and unauthorized changes, and changes to remediate vulnerabilities.

831   3.4.4. Impact Analyses
832           a. Analyze the security impact of changes to the system prior to implementation.
833           b. After system changes, verify that the impacted controls are implemented correctly, operating
834              as intended, and producing the desired outcome with regard to meeting specified security
835              requirements.

836           DISCUSSION
837           Organizational personnel with security responsibilities conduct impact analyses which include
838           reviewing security plans, policies, and procedures to understand security controls; reviewing
839           system design documentation and operational procedures to understand control implementation
840           and how specific system changes might affect the controls; reviewing with stakeholders, the
841           impact of changes on supply chain partners; and determining how potential changes to a system
842           create new risks and the ability of implemented controls to mitigate those risks. Impact analyses
843           also include risk assessments to understand the impact of changes and to determine whether
844           additional controls are required.

848   3.4.5. Access Restrictions for Change
849           Define, document, approve, and enforce physical and logical access restrictions associated with
850           changes to the system.

851           DISCUSSION
852           Changes to the hardware, software, or firmware components of systems or the operational
853           procedures related to the systems can have potentially significant effects on the security of the
854           systems. Therefore, organizations permit only qualified and authorized individuals to access
855           systems for the purpose of initiating changes. Access restrictions include physical and logical
856           access controls, software libraries, workflow automation, media libraries, abstract layers (i.e.,
857           changes implemented into external interfaces rather than directly into systems), and change
858           windows (i.e., changes occur only during specified times).

871           d. Review the system [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] to identify and
872              disable/remove functions, ports, protocols, software, and/or services identified in 3.4.6b.

873           DISCUSSION
874           Systems can provide a variety of functions and services. Some functions and services that are
875           routinely provided by default may not be necessary to support essential organizational missions,
876           functions, or operations. It may be convenient to provide multiple services from single system
877           components. However, doing so increases risk over limiting the services provided by any one
878           component. Where feasible, organizations limit functionality to a single function per component.
879           Organizations review the functions and services provided by systems or system components to
880           determine which functions and services are candidates for elimination. Organizations disable
881           unused or unnecessary physical and logical ports and protocols to prevent the unauthorized
882           connection of devices, the transfer of information, and tunneling. Organizations can utilize
883           network scanning tools, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and end-point protections
884           (e.g., firewalls and host-based intrusion detection systems) to identify and prevent the use of
885           prohibited functions, ports, protocols, and services.
886           Restricting the use of nonessential software (programs) includes restricting the roles allowed to
887           approve program execution, prohibiting auto-execute, and restricting the number of program
888           instances executed at the same time. Bluetooth, File Transfer Protocol (FTP), and peer-to-peer
889           networking are examples of protocols that organizations consider eliminating, restricting, or
890           disabling.

902           If provided with the necessary privileges, users can install software in organizational systems. To
903           maintain control over the software installed, organizations identify permitted and prohibited
904           actions regarding software installation. Permitted software installations include updates and
905           security patches to existing software and downloading new applications from organization-
906           approved “app stores.” Prohibited software installations include software with unknown or
907           suspect pedigrees or software that organizations consider potentially malicious. The policies
908           selected for governing user-installed software are organization-developed or provided by some
909           external entity. Policy enforcement methods can include procedural methods and automated
910           methods.

911           Authorized software programs can be limited to specific versions or from a specific source. To
912           facilitate a comprehensive authorized software process and increase the strength of protection
913           against attacks that bypass application-level authorized software, software programs may be
914           decomposed into and monitored at different levels of detail. These levels include applications,
915           application programming interfaces, application modules, scripts, system processes, system
916           services, kernel functions, registries, drivers, and dynamic link libraries. Organizations consider
917           verifying the integrity of authorized software programs using digital signatures, cryptographic
918           checksums, or hash functions. The verification of authorized software can occur either prior to
919           execution or at system startup.

944             DISCUSSION
945             System components are discrete, identifiable information technology assets that include
946             hardware, software, and firmware. Organizations may choose to implement centralized system
947             component inventories that include components from all organizational systems. In such

976                [Assignment: organization-defined controls].

977             DISCUSSION
978             When it is known that systems or system components will be in high-risk areas external to the
979             organization, additional controls may be implemented to counter the increased threat. For
980             example, organizations can take actions for notebook computers used by individuals departing
981             on and returning from travel. Actions include determining the locations that are of concern,
982             defining the required configurations for the components, ensuring that components are
983             configured as intended before travel is initiated, and applying controls to the components after
984             travel is completed. Specially configured notebook computers include computers with sanitized
985             hard drives, limited applications, and more stringent configuration settings. Controls applied to
986             mobile devices upon return from travel include examining the mobile device for signs of
987             physical tampering and purging and reimaging disk drives.

 992   3.5.1. User Identification, Authentication, and Re-Authentication
 993           a. Uniquely identify and authenticate system user, and associate that unique identification with
 994              processes acting on behalf of those users.
 995           b. Re-authenticate users when [Assignment: organization-defined circumstances or situations
 996              requiring re-authentication].

 997           DISCUSSION
 998           System users include employees or individuals who have equivalent status to employees.
 999           Typically, individual identifiers are the usernames associated with the system accounts assigned
1000           to those individuals. Since processes execute on behalf of groups and roles, organizations may
1001           require the unique identification of individuals in group accounts or accountability of individual

1011           Uniquely identify and authenticate [Assignment: organization-defined devices and/or types of
1012           devices] before establishing a system or network connection.

1013           DISCUSSION
1014           Devices that require unique device-to-device identification and authentication are defined by
1015           type, device, or a combination of type and device. Organization-defined device types include
1016           devices that are not owned by the organization. Systems use shared known information (e.g.,
1017           Media Access Control [MAC], Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol [TCP/IP]
1018           addresses) for device identification or organizational authentication solutions (e.g., Institute of
1019           Electrical and Electronics Engineers [IEEE] 802.1x and Extensible Authentication Protocol
1020           [EAP], RADIUS server with EAP-Transport Layer Security [TLS] authentication, Kerberos) to
1021           identify and authenticate devices on local and wide area networks.

1027           DISCUSSION
1028           Multi-factor authentication requires the use of two or more different factors to achieve
1029           authentication. The authentication factors are defined as follows: something you know (e.g., a
1030           personal identification number [PIN]), something you have (e.g., a physical authenticator, such as
1031           a cryptographic private key), or something you are (e.g., a biometric). Multi-factor authentication
1032           solutions that feature physical authenticators include hardware authenticators that provide time-
1033           based or challenge-response outputs and smart cards. In addition to authenticating users at the
1034           system level, organizations may also employ authentication mechanisms at the application level
1035           to provide increased information security.

1040           Implement replay-resistant authentication mechanisms for access to system accounts.

1041           DISCUSSION
1042           Authentication processes resist replay attacks if it is impractical to successfully authenticate by
1043           recording or replaying previous authentication messages. Replay-resistant techniques include
1044           protocols that use nonces or challenges, such as time synchronous or challenge-response one-time
1045           authenticators.

1049   3.5.5. Identifier Management
1050           a. Receive authorization from [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] to assign
1051              an individual, group, role, service, or device identifier.
1052           b. Select and assign an identifier that identifies an individual, group, role, service, or device.
1053           c.   Prevent reuse of identifiers for [Assignment: organization-defined time period].
1054           d. Identify the status of each individual with the following characteristic: [Assignment:
1055              organization-defined characteristic].

1056           DISCUSSION
1057           Identifiers are provided for users, processes acting on behalf of users, and devices. Preventing the
1058           reuse of identifiers implies preventing the assignment of previously used individual, group, role,
1059           service, or device identifiers to different individuals, groups, roles, services, or devices.
1060           Characteristics that identify the status of individuals include contractors, foreign nationals, and
1061           non-organizational users. Identifying the status of individuals by these characteristics provides
1062           useful information about the people with whom organizational personnel are communicating. For
1063           example, it might be useful for an employee to know that one of the individuals on an email
1064           message is a contractor.

1071              defined composition and complexity rules].
1072           b. Allow user selection of long passwords and passphrases, including spaces and all printable
1073              characters.
1074           c.   Verify, when users create or update passwords, that the passwords are not found on the list
1075                of commonly-used, expected, or compromised passwords.
1076           d. Transmit passwords only over cryptographically-protected channels.
1077           e. Store passwords using an approved salted key derivation function, preferably using a keyed
1078              hash.
1079           f.   Select a new password immediately upon account recovery.
1080           g. Allow the use of a temporary password for system logons with an immediate change to a
1081              permanent password.

1082           DISCUSSION
1083           Password-based authentication applies to passwords used in single-factor or multi-factor
1084           authentication. Long passwords or passphrases are preferable over shorter passwords. Enforced
1085           composition rules provide marginal security benefits while decreasing usability. However,
1086           organizations may choose to establish certain rules for password generation (e.g., minimum
1087           character length) under certain circumstances and can enforce this requirement. For example,
1088           account recovery can occur when a password is forgotten. Cryptographically protected passwords
1089           include salted one-way cryptographic hashes of passwords. The list of commonly used,
1090           compromised, or expected passwords includes passwords obtained from previous breach
1091           corpuses, dictionary words, and repetitive or sequential characters. The list includes context-
1092           specific words, such as the name of the service, username, and derivatives thereof. Changing
1093           temporary passwords to permanent passwords immediately after system logon ensures that the
1094           necessary strength of the authentication mechanism is implemented at the earliest opportunity and
1095           reduces the susceptibility to authenticator compromises.

1102   3.5.11. Authentication Feedback
1103             Obscure feedback of authentication information.

1104             DISCUSSION
1105             The feedback from systems does not provide information that would allow unauthorized
1106             individuals to compromise authentication mechanisms. For example, for desktop or notebook
1107             computers with relatively large monitors, the threat may be significant (often referred to as
1108             shoulder surfing). For mobile devices with small displays, this threat may be less significant and
1109             is balanced against the increased likelihood of input errors due to small keyboards. Therefore,
1110             the means for obscuring the authenticator feedback is selected accordingly. Obscuring
1111             authenticator feedback includes displaying asterisks when users type passwords into input
1112             devices or displaying feedback for a limited time before fully obscuring it.

1116   3.5.12. Authenticator Management
1117             a. Establish initial authenticator content for any authenticators issued by the organization.
1118             b. Verify the identity of the individual, group, role, service, or device receiving the authenticator
1119                as part of the initial authenticator distribution.
1120             c.   Establish and implement administrative procedures for initial authenticator distribution, for
1121                  lost, compromised, or damaged authenticators, and for revoking authenticators.
1122             d. Protect authenticator content from unauthorized disclosure and modification.
1123             e. Change default authenticators prior to first use.
1124             f.   Change or refresh authenticators [Assignment: organization-defined time period by
1125                  authenticator type] or when [Assignment: organization-defined events].
1126             g. Change authenticators for group or role accounts when membership to those accounts
1127                  change.

1128             DISCUSSION
1129             Authenticators include passwords, cryptographic devices, biometrics, certificates, one-time
1130             password devices, and ID badges. The initial authenticator content is the actual content of the
1131             authenticator (e.g., the initial password). In contrast, requirements for authenticator content
1132             contain specific characteristics. Authenticator management is supported by organization-defined
1133             settings and restrictions for various authenticator characteristics (e.g., password complexity and
1134             composition rules, validation time window for time synchronous one-time tokens, and the
1135             number of allowed rejections during the verification stage of biometric authentication).
1136             The requirement to protect individual authenticators may be implemented by 3.15.3 for
1137             authenticators in the possession of individuals and by 3.1.1, 3.1.2, 3.1.5, and 3.13.8 for
1138             authenticators stored in organizational systems. This includes passwords stored in hashed or
1139             encrypted formats or files that contain encrypted or hashed passwords accessible with
1140             administrator privileges. Actions can be taken to safeguard authenticators, including
1141             maintaining possession of authenticators, not sharing authenticators with others, and
1142             immediately reporting lost, stolen, or compromised authenticators. Developers may deliver
1143             system components with factory default authentication credentials to allow for initial

1144             installation and configuration. Default authentication credentials are often well-known, easily
1145             discoverable, and present a significant risk. Authenticator management includes issuing and

1157           c.   Update the incident response plan to address system and organizational changes or
1158                problems encountered during plan implementation, execution, or testing.

1159           DISCUSSION
1160           It is important that organizations develop and implement a coordinated approach to incident
1161           response. Organizational mission and business functions determine the structure of incident
1162           response capabilities. Incident-related information can be obtained from a variety of sources,
1163           including audit monitoring, network monitoring, physical access monitoring, user and
1164           administrator reports, and reported supply chain events. An effective incident handling capability
1165           involves coordination among many organizational entities, including mission and business
1166           owners, system owners, human resources offices, physical and personnel security offices, legal
1167           departments, operations personnel, and procurement offices.

1197           Organizations test incident response capabilities to determine their effectiveness and identify
1198           potential weaknesses or deficiencies. Incident response testing includes the use of checklists,
1199           walk-through or tabletop exercises, and simulations. Incident response testing can include a
1200           determination of the effects of incident response on organizational operations, organizational
1201           assets, and individuals. The use of qualitative and quantitative data aids in determining the
1202           effectiveness of incident response processes.

1211           DISCUSSION
1212           Incident response training is associated with the assigned roles and responsibilities of
1213           organizational personnel to ensure that the appropriate content and level of detail are included in
1214           such training. For example, users may only need to know who to call or how to recognize an
1215           incident; system administrators may require additional training on how to handle incidents; and
1216           incident responders may receive specific training on forensics, data collection techniques,
1217           reporting, system recovery, and system restoration. Incident response training includes user
1218           training in identifying and reporting suspicious activities from external and internal sources.
1219           Incident response training for users may be provided as part of 3.2.2. Events that may precipitate
1220           an update to incident response training content include incident response plan testing, response to
1221           an actual incident, audit or assessment findings, or changes in applicable laws, Executive Orders,
1222           policies, directives, regulations, standards, and guidelines.

1238                   authorizing removal of the equipment from the facility.

1239           DISCUSSION
1240           Approving, controlling, monitoring, and reviewing maintenance tools address security-related
1241           issues associated with the tools that are used for diagnostic and repair actions on the system.
1242           Maintenance tools can include hardware and software diagnostic and test equipment as well as
1243           packet sniffers. The tools may be pre-installed, brought in with maintenance personnel on media,
1244           cloud-based, or downloaded from a website. Diagnostic and test programs are potential vehicles
1245           for transporting malicious code into the system, either intentionally or unintentionally. Examples
1246           of media inspection include checking the cryptographic hash or digital signatures of diagnostic
1247           and test programs and/or media. If, upon inspection of media that contain maintenance diagnostic

1258   3.7.5. Nonlocal Maintenance
1259           a. Approve and monitor nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic activities.
1260           b. Implement multi-factor authentication and replay resistance in the establishment of nonlocal
1261              maintenance and diagnostic sessions.

1263           DISCUSSION
1264           Nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic activities are conducted by individuals who communicate
1265           through either an external or internal network. Local maintenance and diagnostic activities are
1266           carried out by individuals who are physically present at the system location and not
1267           communicating across a network connection. Authentication techniques used to establish
1268           nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic sessions reflect the requirements in 3.5.1.

1273           a. Establish a process for maintenance personnel authorization, and maintain a list of
1274              authorized maintenance organizations or personnel.
1275           b. Verify that non-escorted personnel who perform maintenance on the system possess the
1276              required access authorizations.
1277           c.   Designate organizational personnel with required access authorizations and technical
1278                competence to supervise the maintenance activities of personnel who do not possess the
1279                required access authorizations.

1280           DISCUSSION
1281           Maintenance personnel refers to individuals who perform hardware or software maintenance on
1282           the system, while 3.10.1 addresses physical access for individuals whose maintenance duties
1283           place them within the physical protection perimeter of the system. Technical competence of
1284           supervising individuals relates to the maintenance performed on the system, while having
1285           required access authorizations refers to maintenance on and near the system. Individuals not
1286           previously identified as authorized maintenance personnel (e.g., manufacturers, consultants,
1287           systems integrators, and vendors) may require privileged access to the system, such as when they
1288           are required to conduct maintenance with little or no notice. Organizations may choose to issue
1289           temporary credentials to these individuals based on their risk assessments. Temporary credentials
1290           may be for one-time use or for very limited time periods.

1294         Media Protection

1295   3.8.1. Media Storage
1296           Physically control and securely store digital and non-digital media containing CUI until the media
1297           are destroyed or sanitized using approved equipment, techniques, and procedures.

1298           DISCUSSION
1299           Digital media includes diskettes, flash drives, magnetic tapes, external or removable solid state or
1300           magnetic drives, compact discs, and digital versatile discs. Non-digital media includes paper and
1301           microfilm. Physically controlling stored media includes conducting inventories, establishing
1302           procedures to allow individuals to check out and return media to libraries, and maintaining
1303           accountability for stored media. Secure storage includes a locked drawer, desk, or cabinet or a
1304           controlled media library. Controlled areas provide physical and procedural controls to meet the
1305           requirements established for protecting information and systems.

1311           personnel or roles].

1312           DISCUSSION
1313           Access to CUI on system media can be restricted by physically controlling such media, which
1314           includes conducting inventories, ensuring that procedures are in place to allow individuals to
1315           check out and return media to the media library, and maintaining accountability for stored media.

1319   3.8.3. Media Sanitization
1320           Sanitize system media containing CUI prior to maintenance, disposal, release out of
1321           organizational control, or release for reuse.

1322           DISCUSSION
1323           Media sanitization applies to all digital and non-digital system media subject to disposal or reuse,
1324           whether or not the media is considered removable. Examples include digital media in scanners,
1325           copiers, printers, notebook computers, workstations, mobile devices, network components, and
1326           non-digital media. The sanitization process removes CUI from system media such that the
1327           information cannot be retrieved or reconstructed. Sanitization techniques (e.g., clearing, purging,
1328           cryptographically erasing, and destroying) prevent the disclosure of information to unauthorized
1329           individuals when such media is reused or released for disposal. Organizations determine the
1330           appropriate sanitization methods with the recognition that destruction is sometimes necessary

1336   3.8.4. Media Marking
1337           a. Mark system media containing CUI indicating distribution limitations, handling caveats, and
1338              security markings.
1339           b. Exempt [Assignment: organization-defined types of system media containing CUI] from
1340              marking if the media remain within [Assignment: organization-defined controlled areas].

1341           DISCUSSION
1342           Security marking refers to the application or use of human-readable security attributes. Security
1343           labeling refers to the use of security attributes for internal system data structures. Digital media
1344           includes diskettes, magnetic tapes, external or removable solid state or magnetic drives, flash
1345           drives, compact discs, and digital versatile discs. Non-digital media includes paper and microfilm.
1346           CUI is defined by NARA along with appropriate safeguarding and dissemination requirements
1347           for such information.

1352           a. Protect, control, and maintain accountability for system media containing CUI and during
1353              transport outside of controlled areas.
1354           b. Implement cryptographic mechanisms to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of CUI stored
1355              on digital media during transport.

1356           DISCUSSION
1357           System media includes digital and non-digital media. Digital media includes flash drives,
1358           diskettes, magnetic tapes, external or removable solid state or magnetic drives, compact discs,
1359           and digital versatile discs. Non-digital media includes microfilm and paper. Controlled areas are
1360           spaces for which organizations provide physical or procedural controls to meet the requirements
1361           established for protecting information and systems. Controls to protect media during transport
1362           include cryptography and locked containers. Cryptographic mechanisms can provide
1363           confidentiality protections, depending on the mechanisms implemented. Activities associated
1364           with media transport include releasing media for transport, ensuring that media enters the
1365           appropriate transport processes, and the actual transport. Authorized transport and courier
1366           personnel may include individuals external to the organization. Maintaining accountability of
1367           system media during transport includes restricting transport activities to authorized personnel and
1368           tracking or obtaining records of transport activities as the media moves through the transportation
1369           system to prevent and detect loss, destruction, or tampering.

1374   3.8.7. Media Use
1375           a. [Selection: Restrict; Prohibit] the use of [Assignment: organization-defined removable system
1376              media].
1377           b. Prohibit the use of portable storage devices when such devices have no identifiable owner.

1378           DISCUSSION
1379           In contrast to requirement 3.8.1, which restricts user access to media, this requirement restricts
1380           the use of certain types of media on systems, such as restricting or prohibiting the use of flash
1381           drives or external hard drives. Organizations can employ technical and nontechnical controls
1382           (e.g., policies, procedures, and rules of behavior) to control the use of system media. For
1383           example, organizations may control the use of portable storage devices by using physical cages
1384           on workstations to prohibit access to external ports or disabling or removing the ability to insert,
1385           read, or write to devices.
1386           Organizations may limit the use of portable storage devices to only approved devices, including
1387           devices provided by the organization, devices provided by other approved organizations, and
1388           devices that are not personally owned. Finally, organizations may control the use of portable
1389           storage devices based on the type of device – prohibiting the use of writeable, portable devices –
1390           and implement this restriction by disabling or removing the capability to write to such devices.
1391           Requiring identifiable owners (e.g., individuals, organizations, or projects) for portable storage
1392           devices reduces the risk of using such technologies by allowing organizations to assign
1393           responsibility and accountability for addressing known vulnerabilities in the devices (e.g.,
1394           insertion of malicious code).

1401           storage locations.

1402           DISCUSSION
1403           Organizations can employ cryptographic mechanisms or alternative physical controls to protect
1404           the confidentiality of backup information at designated storage locations. Backed-up information
1405           that contains CUI may include system-level information and user-level information. System-level
1406           information includes system-state information, operating system software, application software,
1407           and licenses. User-level information includes information other than system-level information.

1435                3. Modify access authorization as needed to correspond with any changes in operational
1436                   need due to reassignment or transfer.

1437           DISCUSSION
1438           Security-related system property includes hardware authentication tokens, system administration
1439           technical manuals, keys, identification cards, and building passes. Exit interviews ensure that
1440           terminated individuals understand the security constraints imposed by being former employees
1441           and that accountability is achieved for the organizational property. Security topics at exit
1442           interviews include reminding individuals of potential limitations on future employment and
1443           nondisclosure agreements. Exit interviews may not always be possible for some individuals,
1444           including in cases related to the unavailability of supervisors, illnesses, or job abandonment.

1445           The timely execution of termination actions is essential for individuals who have been terminated
1446           for cause. Organizations may consider disabling the accounts of individuals who are being
1447           terminated prior to the individuals being notified. This requirement applies to the reassignment or
1448           transfer of individuals when the personnel action is permanent or of such extended duration as to
1449           require protection. Protections that may be required for transfers or reassignments to other
1450           positions within organizations include returning old and issuing new identification cards, keys,
1451           and building passes; changing system access authorizations (i.e., privileges); closing system
1452           accounts and establishing new accounts; and providing access to official records to which
1453           individuals had access at previous work locations in previous system accounts.

1500             Physical access monitoring includes publicly accessible areas within organizational facilities.
1501             Examples of physical access monitoring include the employment of guards, video surveillance
1502             equipment (i.e., cameras), and sensor devices. Reviewing physical access logs can help identify
1503             suspicious activity, anomalous events, or potential threats. The reviews can be supported by
1504             audit logging controls if the access logs are part of an automated system. Organizational
1505             incident response capabilities include investigations of physical security incidents and responses
1506             to the incidents. Incidents include security violations or suspicious physical access activities,
1507             such as access outside of normal work hours, repeated access to areas not normally accessed,
1508             access for unusual lengths of time, and out-of-sequence access.

1517             b. Employ the following controls at alternate work sites: [Assignment: organization-defined
1518                controls].

1519             DISCUSSION
1520             Alternate work sites include the private residences of employees or other facilities designated
1521             by the organization. Alternate work sites can provide readily available alternate locations during
1522             contingency operations. Organizations can define different sets of controls for specific alternate
1523             work sites or types of sites depending on the work-related activities conducted at the sites.
1524             Implementing and assessing the effectiveness of organization-defined controls and providing a
1525             means to communicate incidents at alternate work sites supports the contingency planning
1526             activities of organizations.

1532                points to the facility where the system resides] by:
1533                  1. Verifying individual access authorizations before granting access to the facility; and
1534                  2. Controlling ingress and egress to the facility using [Selection (one or more):
1535                     [Assignment: organization-defined physical access control systems or devices];
1536                     guards].
1537             b. Maintain physical access audit logs for [Assignment: organization-defined entry or exit
1538                points].
1539             c.   Escort visitors and control visitor activity [Assignment: organization-defined circumstances

1541             d. Secure keys, combinations, and other physical access devices.

1542             DISCUSSION
1543             Physical access control applies to employees and visitors. Individuals with permanent physical
1544             access authorizations are not considered visitors. Organizations determine the types of guards
1545             needed, including professional security staff or administrative staff. Physical access devices
1546             include keys, locks, combinations, biometric readers, and card readers. Physical access control
1547             systems comply with applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations,
1548             standards, and guidelines. Organizations have flexibility in the types of audit logs employed.
1549             Audit logs can be procedural, automated, or some combination thereof. Physical access points
1550             can include facility access points, interior access points to systems that require supplemental
1551             access controls, or both.

1555   3.10.8. Access Control for Transmission and Output Devices
1556             a. Control physical access to system distribution and transmission lines within organizational
1557                facilities.
1558             b. Control physical access to output from [Assignment: organization-defined output devices] to
1559                prevent unauthorized individuals from obtaining the output.

1560             DISCUSSION
1561             Safeguarding measures applied to system distribution and transmission lines prevent accidental
1562             damage, disruption, and physical tampering. Such controls may also be necessary to prevent
1563             eavesdropping or the modification of unencrypted transmissions. Security controls used to
1564             control physical access to system distribution and transmission lines include disconnected or
1565             locked spare jacks, locked wiring closets, protection of cabling by conduit or cable trays, and
1566             wiretapping sensors. Controlling physical access to output devices includes placing output
1567             devices in locked rooms or other secured areas with keypad or card reader access controls and
1568             allowing access to authorized individuals only, placing output devices in locations that can be
1569             monitored by personnel, installing monitor or screen filters, and using headphones. Examples of
1570             output devices include monitors, printers, scanners, audio devices, facsimile machines, and
1571             copiers.

1575           Risk Assessment

1576   3.11.1. Risk Assessment
1577             a. Assess the risk (including supply chain risk) of unauthorized disclosure resulting from the
1578                processing, storage, or transmission of CUI.
1579             b. Update risk assessments (including supply chain risk) [Assignment: organization-defined
1580                frequency].

1581             DISCUSSION
1582             Clearly defined system boundaries are a prerequisite for effective risk assessments. Risk
1583             assessments consider threats, vulnerabilities, likelihood, and impact to organizational operations
1584             and assets based on the operation and use of the system. Risk assessments also consider risk
1585             from external parties (e.g., service providers, contractors operating systems on behalf of the
1586             organization, individuals accessing systems, outsourcing entities). Risk assessments, either
1587             formal or informal, can be conducted at the organization level, the mission or business process
1588             level, or the system level and at any phase in the system development life cycle.
1589             Risk assessments include supply chain-related risks associated with suppliers or contractors and
1590             the system, system component, or system service that they provide. Supply chain events that
1591             affect risk include disruption, the use of defective components, the insertion of counterfeits,
1592             theft, malicious development practices, improper delivery practices, and the insertion of
1593             malicious code. These events can have a significant impact on the system and its information
1594             and, therefore, can also adversely impact organizations. The supply chain events may be
1595             unintentional or malicious and can occur at any point in the system life cycle.

1599   3.11.2. Vulnerability Monitoring and Scanning
1600             a. Monitor and scan for vulnerabilities in the system [Assignment: organization-defined
1601                frequency] and when new vulnerabilities affecting the system are identified.
1602             b. Remediate vulnerabilities [Assignment: organization-defined response times] in accordance
1603                with an organizational assessment of risk.
1604             c.   Update vulnerabilities to be scanned [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].
1605             d. Implement privileged access authorization to the system for vulnerability scanning activities.

1606             DISCUSSION
1607             Organizations determine the required vulnerability scanning for system components (including
1608             hardware, software, firmware, and applications) and ensure that potential sources of
1609             vulnerabilities (e.g., networked printers, scanners, and copiers) are not overlooked. The
1610             vulnerabilities to be scanned are readily updated as new vulnerabilities are discovered and
1611             announced and new scanning methods are developed. This process ensures that potential
1612             vulnerabilities in the system are identified and addressed as quickly as possible.
1613             Vulnerability analyses for custom software may require additional approaches, such as static
1614             analysis, dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three approaches. Organizations
1615             can employ these analysis approaches in source code reviews and in a variety of tools (e.g.,
1616             static analysis tools, web-based application scanners, binary analyzers). Vulnerability scanning
1617             includes scanning for patch levels; scanning for functions, ports, protocols, and services that
1618             should not be accessible to users or devices; and scanning for improperly configured or
1619             incorrectly operating information flow control mechanisms.
1620             To facilitate interoperability, organizations consider using products that are Security Content
1621             Automated Protocol (SCAP)-validated, as well as scanning tools that express vulnerabilities in
1622             the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming convention and that employ the
1623             Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL) to determine the presence of system
1624             vulnerabilities. Sources for vulnerability information include the Common Weakness
1625             Enumeration (CWE) listing and the National Vulnerability Database (NVD).
1626             Security assessments, such as red team exercises, provide additional sources of potential
1627             vulnerabilities for which to scan. Organizations also consider using scanning tools that express
1628             vulnerability impact by the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). In certain
1629             situations, the nature of the vulnerability scanning may be more intrusive, or the system
1630             component that is the subject of the scanning may contain highly sensitive information.
1631             Privileged access authorization to selected system components facilitates thorough vulnerability
1632             scanning and protects the sensitive nature of such scanning.

1638   3.11.4. Risk Response
1639             Respond to findings from security assessments, monitoring, and audits.

1640             DISCUSSION
1641             Organizations have many options for responding to risk, including mitigating risk by
1642             implementing new controls or strengthening existing controls, accepting risk with appropriate
1643             justification or rationale, sharing or transferring risk, or avoiding risk. The organizational risk
1644             management strategy and risk tolerance influence risk response decisions and actions. This
1645             requirement addresses the need to determine an appropriate response to risk before generating a
1646             plan of action and milestones entry. For example, the response may be to accept risk or reject
1647             risk, or it may be possible to mitigate the risk immediately so that a plan of action and
1648             milestones entry is not needed. However, if the risk response is to mitigate the risk, and the
1649             mitigation cannot be completed immediately, a plan of action and milestones entry is generated.

1653           Security Assessment and Monitoring

1654   3.12.1. Control Assessments
1655             Assess the controls in the system and its environment of operation [Assignment: organization-
1656             defined frequency] to determine the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly,
1657             operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting specified
1658             security requirements.

1659             DISCUSSION
1660             Organizations assess security controls in the system and the environment in which that system
1661             operates as part of the system development life cycle. Security controls are the safeguards that
1662             organizations implement to satisfy security requirements. By assessing implemented security
1663             controls, organizations determine whether the necessary safeguards are in place and operating
1664             as intended. Security control assessments identify weaknesses and deficiencies early in the
1665             system life cycle, provide essential information needed to make risk-based decisions, and ensure
1666             compliance to vulnerability mitigation procedures. Assessments are conducted on the
1667             implemented controls as documented in system security plans.
1668             Security assessment reports document assessment results in sufficient detail as deemed
1669             necessary by organizations to determine the accuracy and completeness of the reports and
1670             whether the security controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing
1671             the desired outcome with respect to meeting security requirements. Security assessment results
1672             are provided to the individuals or roles appropriate for the types of assessments being
1673             conducted.
1674             Organizations ensure that assessment results are current, relevant to the determination of control
1675             effectiveness, and obtained with the appropriate level of assessor independence. Organizations
1676             can choose to use other types of assessment activities, such as vulnerability scanning and
1677             system monitoring, to maintain the security posture of the system during the system life cycle.

1682             a. Develop a plan of action and milestones for the system:
1683                 1. To document the planned remediation actions to correct weaknesses or deficiencies
1684                    noted during control assessments; and
1685                 2. To reduce or eliminate known vulnerabilities in the system.
1686             b. Update the existing plan of action and milestones [Assignment: organization-defined
1687                frequency] based on the findings from control assessments, independent audits or reviews,
1688                and continuous monitoring activities.

1689             DISCUSSION
1690             Plans of action and milestones (POAMs) are important documents in organizational security
1691             programs. Organizations use POAMs to describe how unimplemented security requirements
1692             and security controls will be met and how planned mitigations will be implemented.
1693             Organizations can document system security plans and POAMs as separate or combined
1694             documents and in any chosen format. Federal agencies may consider system security plans and
1695             POAMs as inputs to risk-based decisions on whether to process, store, or transmit CUI on a
1696             system hosted by a nonfederal organization.

1701             Develop and implement a system-level continuous monitoring strategy that includes ongoing
1702             monitoring and assessment of control effectiveness.

1703             DISCUSSION
1704             Continuous monitoring at the system level facilitates ongoing awareness of the system security
1705             posture to support organizational risk management decisions. The terms continuous and
1706             ongoing imply that organizations assess and monitor their controls and risks at a frequency
1707             sufficient to support risk-based decisions. Different types of controls may require different
1708             monitoring frequencies. When monitoring the effectiveness of multiple controls that have been
1709             grouped into capabilities, a root cause analysis may be needed to determine the specific control
1710             that has failed.

1716   3.12.5. Independent Assessment
1717             Use independent assessors or assessment teams to assess controls.

1718             DISCUSSION
1719             Independent assessors or assessment teams are individuals or groups who conduct impartial
1720             security assessments of the system. Impartiality means that assessors are free from perceived or
1721             actual conflicts of interest regarding the development, operation, sustainment, or management
1722             of the system under assessment or the determination of control effectiveness. To achieve
1723             impartiality, assessors do not create a mutual or conflicting interest with the organizations
1724             where the assessments are being conducted, assess their own work, act as management or
1725             employees of the organizations they are serving, or place themselves in positions of advocacy
1726             for the organizations that acquire their services.

1734             DISCUSSION
1735             The types of agreements selected are based on factors such as the relationship between the
1736             organizations exchanging information (e.g., government to government, government to
1737             business, business to business, government or business to service provider, government or
1738             business to individual) or the level of access to the organizational system by users of the other
1739             system. Types of agreements can include interconnection security agreements, information
1740             exchange security agreements, memoranda of understanding or agreement, service-level
1741             agreements, or other types of agreements. Organizations may incorporate agreement
1742             information into formal contracts, especially for information exchanges established between
1743             federal agencies and nonfederal organizations (e.g., service providers, contractors, system
1744             developers, and system integrators). Examples of the types of information contained in
1745             exchange agreements include the interface characteristics, security requirements, controls, and
1746             responsibilities for each system.

1755             DISCUSSION
1756             Internal system connections are connections between the organizational system and separate
1757             constituent system components (i.e., connections between components that are part of the same
1758             system), including components used for system development. Intra-system connections include
1759             connections with mobile devices, notebook and desktop computers, tablets, printers, copiers,
1760             facsimile machines, scanners, sensors, and servers. Instead of authorizing each internal system
1761             connection, organizations can authorize internal connections for a class of system components
1762             with common characteristics and/or configurations, including printers, scanners, and copiers
1763             with a specified processing, transmission, and storage capability or smart phones and tablets
1764             with a specific baseline configuration.

1770             a. Monitor and control communications at the external managed interfaces to the system and
1771                at key internal managed interfaces within the system.
1772             b. Implement subnetworks for publicly accessible system components that are physically or
1773                logically separated from internal networks.
1774             c.   Connect to external networks or systems only through managed interfaces consisting of
1775                  boundary protection devices arranged in accordance with an organizational security
1776                  architecture.

1777             DISCUSSION
1778             Managed interfaces include gateways, routers, firewalls, guards, network-based malicious code
1779             analysis, virtualization systems, or encrypted tunnels implemented within a security
1780             architecture. Subnetworks that are either physically or logically separated from internal
1781             networks are referred to as demilitarized zones or DMZs. Restricting or prohibiting interfaces
1782             within organizational systems includes restricting external web traffic to designated web servers
1783             within managed interfaces, prohibiting external traffic that appears to be spoofing internal
1784             addresses, and prohibiting internal traffic that appears to be spoofing external addresses.
1785             Boundary protection may be implemented as a common control for all or part of an
1786             organizational network such that the boundary to be protected is greater than a system-specific
1787             boundary (i.e., an authorization boundary).
1788             Organizations consider the shared nature of commercial telecommunications services in the
1789             implementation of security requirements associated with the use of such services. Commercial
1790             telecommunications services are commonly based on network components and consolidated
1791             management systems shared by all attached commercial customers and may also include third
1792             party-provided access lines and other service elements. Such transmission services may
1793             represent sources of increased risk despite contract security provisions.

1800             Separate user functionality from system management functionality.

1801             DISCUSSION
1802             System management functionality includes the functions necessary to administer databases,
1803             network components, workstations, or servers and typically requires privileged user access. The
1804             separation of user functionality from system management functionality is physical or logical.
1805             Organizations can implement the separation of system management functionality from user
1806             functionality by using different computers, different central processing units, different instances
1807             of operating systems, different network addresses, virtualization techniques, or combinations of
1808             these or other methods, as appropriate. This type of separation includes web administrative
1809             interfaces that use separate authentication methods for users of any other system resources. The
1810             separation of functionality may include isolating administrative interfaces on different domains
1811             and with additional access controls.

1815   3.13.4. Information in Shared System Resources
1816             Prevent unauthorized and unintended information transfer via shared system resources.

1817             DISCUSSION
1818             Preventing unauthorized and unintended information transfer via shared system resources stops
1819             information produced by the actions of prior users or roles (or actions of processes acting on
1820             behalf of prior users or roles) from being available to current users or roles (or current processes
1821             acting on behalf of current users or roles) that obtain access to shared system resources after
1822             those resources have been released back to the system. Information in shared system resources
1823             also applies to encrypted representations of information. In other contexts, the control of
1824             information in shared system resources is referred to as object reuse and residual information
1825             protection. Information in shared system resources does not address information remanence,
1826             which refers to the residual representation of data that has been nominally deleted, covert
1827             channels (including storage and timing channels) in which shared system resources are
1828             manipulated to violate information flow restrictions, or components within systems for which
1829             there are only single users or roles.

1835             Deny network communications traffic by default, and allow network communications traffic by
1836             exception.

1837             DISCUSSION
1838             This requirement applies to inbound and outbound network communications traffic at the
1839             system boundary and at identified points within the system. A deny-all, allow-by-exception
1840             network communications traffic policy ensures that only essential and approved connections are
1841             allowed.

1845   3.13.7. Split Tunneling
1846             Prevent split tunneling for remote devices unless the split tunnel is securely provisioned using
1847             [Assignment: organization-defined safeguards].

1848             DISCUSSION
1849             Split tunneling is the process of allowing a remote user or device to establish a non-remote
1850             connection with a system and simultaneously communicate with a resource in an external
1851             network via some other connection. This method of network access enables a user to access
1852             remote devices and simultaneously access uncontrolled networks. Split tunneling may be
1853             desirable by remote users to communicate with system resources, such as printers or file
1854             servers. However, split tunneling can facilitate unauthorized external connections and make the
1855             system vulnerable to attack and the exfiltration of CUI.
1856             Split tunneling can be prevented by disabling configuration settings that allow such capabilities
1857             in remote devices and by preventing those configuration settings from being configurable by
1858             users. Prevention can also be achieved through the detection of split tunneling (or of
1859             configuration settings that allow split tunneling) in the remote device and by prohibiting the
1860             connection if the remote device is using split tunneling. A virtual private network (VPN) can be
1861             used to securely provision a split tunnel. A securely provisioned VPN includes locking
1862             connectivity to exclusive, managed, and named environments or to a specific set of pre-
1863             approved addresses without user control.

1869             transmission and while in storage.

1870             DISCUSSION
1871             This requirement applies to internal and external networks and any system components that can

1873             printers, copiers, scanners, facsimile machines, and radios. Communication paths outside of the
1874             physical protection of controlled boundaries are susceptible to both interception and
1875             modification. Encryption protects CUI from unauthorized disclosure during transmission.
1876             Cryptographic mechanisms that protect the confidentiality and integrity of information during
1877             transmission include TLS and IPsec. Cryptographic standards include FIPS-validated
1878             cryptography [30] [31] [32] and NSA-approved cryptography. Information at rest refers to the
1879             state of CUI when it resides on the system and is not in process or in transit, including internal
1880             or external storage devices, storage area network devices, and databases. The focus of
1881             protecting CUI at rest is not on the type of storage device or the frequency of access to that
1882             device but rather on the state of the information.

1962               Protecting session authenticity addresses communications protection at the session level, not
1963               at the packet level. Such protection establishes grounds for confidence at both ends of the
1964               communications sessions in the ongoing identities of other parties and validity of transmitted
1965               information. Authenticity protection includes protecting against “adversary-in-the-middle”
1966               attacks (also known as “man-in-the middle” attacks), session hijacking, and the insertion of
1967               false information into sessions.

1973               Route internal network communications traffic to external networks through an authenticated
1974               proxy server.

1975               DISCUSSION
1976               External networks are networks outside of organizational control. A proxy server is a server
1977               (i.e., system or application) that acts as an intermediary for clients who request system
1978               resources from non-organizational or other organizational servers. System resources that may
1979               be requested include files, connections, web pages, or services. Client requests established
1980               through a connection to a proxy server are assessed to manage complexity and provide
1981               additional protection by limiting direct connectivity. Web content filtering devices are one of
1982               the most common proxy servers that provide access to the internet. Proxy servers can support
1983               the logging of Transmission Control Protocol sessions and the blocking of specific Uniform
1984               Resource Locators, Internet Protocol addresses, and domain names. Web proxies can be
1985               configured with organization-defined lists of authorized and unauthorized websites. Note that
1986               proxy servers may inhibit the use of virtual private networks (VPNs) and create the potential

1995               DISCUSSION
1996               Limiting the number of external network connections facilitates the monitoring of inbound
1997               and outbound communications traffic and is important during transition periods from older to
1998               newer technologies. Such transitions may require implementing older and newer technologies
1999               simultaneously during the transition period and thus increase the number of access points to
2000               the system.

2012             DISCUSSION
2013             Organizations identify systems that are affected by announced software and firmware flaws,
2014             including potential vulnerabilities that result from those flaws, and report this information to
2015             designated personnel with information security responsibilities. Security-relevant updates
2016             include patches, service packs, hot fixes, and anti-virus signatures. Organizations address the
2017             flaws discovered during security assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response
2018             activities, and system error handling. Organizations can take advantage of available resources,
2019             such as the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) or Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
2020             (CVE) databases, in remediating the flaws discovered in organizational systems. Organization-
2021             defined time periods for updating security-relevant software and firmware may vary based on a
2022             variety of factors, including the criticality of the update (i.e., severity of the vulnerability related
2023             to the discovered flaw). Some types of flaw remediation may require more testing than other
2024             types of remediation.

2028   3.14.2. Malicious Code Protection
2029             a. Implement malicious code protection mechanisms at designated locations within the system
2030                to detect and eradicate malicious code.
2031             b. Update malicious code protection mechanisms as new releases are available in accordance
2032                with organizational configuration management policy and procedures.

2033             DISCUSSION
2034             Malicious code insertions occur through the exploitation of system vulnerabilities. Periodic
2035             scans of the system and real-time scans of files from external sources as files are downloaded,
2036             opened, or executed can detect malicious code. Malicious code can be inserted into the system
2037             in a variety of ways, including by electronic mail, the world wide web, and portable storage
2038             devices. Malicious code includes viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and spyware. Malicious code
2039             can be encoded in various formats, contained in compressed or hidden files, or hidden in files
2040             using techniques such as steganography. In addition to the above technologies, pervasive
2041             configuration management, comprehensive software integrity controls, and anti-exploitation
2042             software may be effective in preventing the execution of unauthorized code. Malicious code
2043             may be present in commercial off-the-shelf software as well as custom-built software and could
2044             include logic bombs, backdoors, and other types of attacks that could affect organizational
2045             mission and business functions.
2046             In situations where malicious code cannot be detected by detection methods or technologies,
2047             organizations rely on other types of controls – including secure coding practices, configuration
2048             management and control, trusted procurement processes, and monitoring practices – to ensure
2049             that software does not perform functions other than the functions intended. Organizations may
2050             determine that different actions are warranted in response to the detection of malicious code.
2051             For example, organizations can define actions in response to malicious code detection during
2052             scans, the detection of malicious downloads, or the detection of maliciousness when attempting
2053             to open or execute files.

2060             DISCUSSION
2061             There are many publicly available sources of system security alerts and advisories. For
2062             example, the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security
2063             Agency (CISA) generates security alerts and advisories to maintain situational awareness across
2064             the Federal Government and in nonfederal organizations. Software vendors, subscription
2065             services, and industry Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) may also provide

2066             security alerts and advisories. Compliance with security directives is essential due to the critical
2067             nature of many of these directives and the potential immediate adverse effects on organizational
2068             operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation should the directives not
2069             be implemented in a timely manner. Examples of response actions include notifying relevant
2070             external organizations, such as external mission and business partners, supply chain partners,
2071             service providers, and peer or supporting organizations.

2077   3.14.6. System Monitoring
2078             a. Monitor the system, including inbound and outbound communications traffic, to detect:
2079                 1. Attacks and indicators of potential attacks;
2080                 2. Unusual or unauthorized activities or conditions; and
2081                 3. Unauthorized connections.
2082             b. Identify unauthorized use of the system.

2083             DISCUSSION
2084             System monitoring involves external and internal monitoring. External monitoring includes the
2085             observation of events that occur at the system boundary, while internal monitoring includes the
2086             observation of events that occur within the system. Organizations can monitor the system, for
2087             example, by observing audit record activities in real time or by observing other system aspects,
2088             such as access patterns, characteristics of access, and other actions. The monitoring objectives
2089             may guide determination of the events.
2090             A system monitoring capability is achieved through a variety of tools and techniques (e.g., audit
2091             record monitoring software, intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems,
2092             malicious code protection software, scanning tools, network monitoring software). Strategic
2093             locations for monitoring devices include selected perimeter locations and near server farms that
2094             support critical applications with such devices being employed at managed system interfaces.
2095             The granularity of monitoring the information collected is based on organizational monitoring
2096             objectives and the capability of the system to support such objectives.
2097             System monitoring is an integral part of continuous monitoring and incident response programs.
2098             The output from system monitoring serves as input to continuous monitoring and incident
2099             response programs. A network connection is any connection with a device that communicates
2100             through a network (e.g., local area network, internet). A remote connection is any connection
2101             with a device that communicates through an external network (e.g., the internet). Local,
2102             network, and remote connections can be either wired or wireless.
2103             Unusual or unauthorized activities or conditions related to inbound and outbound
2104             communications traffic include internal traffic that indicates the presence of malicious code in
2105             the system or propagating among system components, the unauthorized export of information,

2106             or signaling to external systems. Evidence of malicious code is used to identify a potentially
2107             compromised system. System monitoring requirements, including the need for types of system
2108             monitoring, may be referenced in other requirements.

2132             This requirement addresses policies and procedures for the protection of CUI. Policies and
2133             procedures contribute to security assurance and should address each family of CUI security
2134             requirements. Policies can be included as part of the generalized security policy or be
2135             represented by separate policies that address each family of security requirements. Procedures
2136             describe how policies, requirements, and controls are implemented and can be directed at the
2137             individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system
2138             security plans or in one or more separate documents.

2143   3.15.2. System Security Plan
2144             a. Develop and document a system security plan that describes:
2145                 1. System boundary and operating environment;
2146                 2. Security requirements, tailoring actions, and implementation; and
2147                 3. Connections to other systems.
2148             b. Review and update the plan at [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].

2149             DISCUSSION
2150             System security plans relate security requirements to a set of security controls. System security
2151             plans also provide a high-level description of how the controls meet those requirements but do
2152             not provide detailed descriptions of the design or implementation of the controls. System
2153             security plans contain sufficient information to enable a design and implementation that is
2154             unambiguously compliant with the intent of the plans and the subsequent determinations of risk
2155             if the plan is implemented as intended. System security plans can be a collection of documents,
2156             including documents that already exist. Effective system security plans make use of references
2157             to policies, procedures, and additional documents (e.g., design specifications) where detailed
2158             information can be obtained. This reduces the documentation requirements associated with
2159             security programs and maintains security information in other established management or
2160             operational areas related to enterprise architecture, the system development life cycle, systems
2161             engineering, and acquisition.

2169             DISCUSSION
2170             Rules of behavior represent a type of access agreement for system users. Organizations consider
2171             rules of behavior for the handling of CUI based on individual user roles and responsibilities and
2172             differentiate between rules that apply to privileged users and rules that apply to general users.

2180             DISCUSSION
2181             Organizations apply systems security engineering principles to new development systems or
2182             systems undergoing major upgrades. For legacy systems, organizations apply systems security
2183             engineering principles to system upgrades and modifications to the extent feasible, given the
2184             current state of hardware, software, and firmware components within those systems. The
2185             application of systems security engineering concepts and principles helps to develop
2186             trustworthy, secure, and resilient systems and reduce the susceptibility of organizations to
2187             disruptions, hazards, and threats. Examples include developing layered protections; establishing

2193             security engineering concepts and principles can facilitate the development of trustworthy,
2194             secure systems, system components, and system services; reduce risk to acceptable levels; and
2195             make informed risk-management decisions.

2199   3.16.2. Unsupported System Components
2200             a. Replace system components when support for the components is no longer available from
2201                the developer, vendor, or manufacturer; or
2202             b. Provide options for alternative sources for continued support for unsupported components.

2203             DISCUSSION
2204             Support for system components includes software patches, firmware updates, replacement parts,
2205             and maintenance contracts. An example of unsupported components includes when vendors no
2206             longer provide critical software patches or product updates, which can result in an opportunity
2207             for adversaries to exploit weaknesses in the installed components. Exceptions to replacing
2208             unsupported system components include systems that provide critical mission or business
2209             capabilities where newer technologies are not available or where the systems are so isolated that
2210             installing replacement components is not an option.
2211             Alternative sources for support address the need to provide continued support for system
2212             components that are no longer supported by the original manufacturers, developers, or vendors
2213             when such components remain essential to organizational mission and business functions. If
2214             necessary, organizations can establish in-house support by developing customized patches for
2215             critical software components or, alternatively, obtain the services of external providers who
2216             provide ongoing support for the designated unsupported components through contractual
2217             relationships. Such contractual relationships can include open-source software value-added
2218             vendors. The increased risk of using unsupported system components can be mitigated, for
2219             example, by prohibiting the connection of such components to public or uncontrolled networks
2220             or implementing other forms of isolation.

2224   3.16.3. External System Services
2225             a. Require the providers of external system services to comply with organizational security
2226                requirements, and implement the following controls: [Assignment: organization-defined
2227                controls].
2228             b. Define and document organizational oversight and user roles and responsibilities with
2229                regard to external system services.
2230             c.   Implement the following processes, methods, and techniques to monitor control compliance
2231                  by external service providers on an ongoing basis: [Assignment: organization-defined
2232                  processes, methods, and techniques].

2233             DISCUSSION
2234             External system services are provided by an external provider, and in most cases, the
2235             organization has no direct control over the implementation of the required controls or the
2236             assessment of control effectiveness. Organizations establish relationships with external service
2237             providers in a variety of ways, including through business partnerships, contracts, interagency
2238             agreements, lines of business arrangements, licensing agreements, joint ventures, and supply
2239             chain exchanges. The responsibility for managing risks from the use of external system services
2240             remains with the organization charged with protecting CUI. Service-level agreements define the
2241             expectations of performance for the implemented controls, describe measurable outcomes, and
2242             identify remedies, mitigations, and response requirements for identified instances of
2243             noncompliance. Information from external service providers regarding the specific functions,
2244             ports, protocols, and services used in the provision of such services can be useful when the need
2245             arises to understand the trade-offs involved in restricting certain functions and services or
2246             blocking certain ports and protocols.

2250           Supply Chain Risk Management

2251   3.17.1. Supply Chain Risk Management Plan
2252           a. Develop a plan for managing supply chain risks associated with the development,
2253              manufacturing, acquisition, delivery, operations, maintenance, and disposal of the system,
2254              system components, or system services.
2255           b. Review and update the plan [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].

2256           DISCUSSION
2257           Dependence on the products, systems, and services from external providers and the nature of the
2258           relationships with those providers present an increasing level of risk to an organization. Threat
2259           actions that may increase security risks include unauthorized production, the insertion or use of
2260           counterfeits, tampering, theft, insertion of malicious software and hardware, and poor
2261           manufacturing and development practices in the supply chain. Supply chain risks can be endemic
2262           or systemic within a system, component, or service. Managing supply chain risk is a complex,
2263           multifaceted undertaking that requires a coordinated effort across an organization to build trust
2264           relationships and communicate with internal and external stakeholders.

2265           Supply chain risk management (SCRM) activities include identifying and assessing risks,
2266           determining appropriate risk response actions, developing SCRM plans to document response
2267           actions, and monitoring performance against plans. The system-level SCRM plan is
2268           implementation-specific and provides policy implementation, requirements, constraints and
2269           implications. It can either be stand-alone or incorporated into system security plans. The SCRM
2270           plan addresses the management, implementation, and monitoring of SCRM controls and the
2271           development or sustainment of systems across the SDLC to support mission and business
2272           functions. Because supply chains can differ significantly across and within organizations, SCRM
2273           plans are tailored to individual program, organizational, and operational contexts.

2277   3.17.2. Acquisition Strategies, Tools, and Methods
2278             Develop and implement acquisition strategies, contract tools, and procurement methods to
2279             protect against, identify, and mitigate supply chain risks.

2280             DISCUSSION
2281             The acquisition process provides an important vehicle for protecting the supply chain. There are
2282             many useful tools and techniques available, including obscuring the end use of a system or
2283             system component, using blind or filtered buys, requiring tamper-evident packaging, or using
2284             trusted or controlled distribution. The results from a supply chain risk assessment can inform
2285             the strategies, tools, and methods that are most applicable to the situation. Tools and techniques
2286             may provide protections against unauthorized production, theft, tampering, the insertion of
2287             counterfeits, the insertion of malicious software or backdoors, and poor development practices
2288             throughout the system life cycle.
2289             Organizations also consider providing incentives for suppliers to implement controls, promote
2290             transparency in their processes and security practices, provide contract language that addresses
2291             the prohibition of tainted or counterfeit components, and restrict purchases from untrustworthy
2292             suppliers. Organizations consider providing training, education, and awareness programs for
2293             personnel regarding supply chain risk, available mitigation strategies, and when the programs
2294             should be employed. Methods for reviewing and protecting development plans, documentation,
2295             and evidence are commensurate with the security requirements of the organization. Contracts
2296             may specify documentation protection requirements.

2300   3.17.3. Supply Chain Controls and Processes
2301             a. Establish a process or processes for identifying and addressing weaknesses or deficiencies
2302                in the supply chain elements and processes.
2303             b. Employ the following controls to protect against supply chain risks to the system, system
2304                component, or system service and to limit the harm or consequences from supply chain-
2305                related events: [Assignment: organization-defined supply chain controls].

2306             DISCUSSION
2307             Supply chain elements include organizations, entities, or tools that are employed for the
2308             research and development, design, manufacturing, acquisition, delivery, integration, operations
2309             and maintenance, and disposal of systems and system components. Supply chain processes
2310             include hardware, software, and firmware development processes; shipping and handling
2311             procedures; personnel security and physical security programs; configuration management
2312             tools, techniques, and measures to maintain provenance; or other programs, processes, or
2313             procedures associated with the development, acquisition, maintenance and disposal of systems
2314             and system components. Supply chain elements and processes may be provided by
2315             organizations, system integrators, or external providers. Weaknesses or deficiencies in supply
2316             chain elements or processes represent potential vulnerabilities that can be exploited by
2317             adversaries to harm the organization and affect its ability to carry out its core missions or
2318             business functions.

2322   3.17.4. Component Disposal
2323             Dispose of system components, documentation, or tools containing CUI using the following
2324             techniques and methods: [Assignment: organization-defined techniques and methods].

2325             DISCUSSION
2326             Data, documentation, tools, or system components can be disposed of at any time during the
2327             system development life cycle (not only in the disposal or retirement phase of the life cycle).
2328             For example, disposal can occur during research and development, design, prototyping,
2329             operations, or maintenance and include methods such as disk cleaning, the removal of
2330             cryptographic keys, the partial reuse of components. Opportunities for compromise during
2331             disposal affect physical and logical data, including system documentation in paper-based or
2332             digital files, shipping and delivery documentation, memory sticks with software code, or
2333             complete routers or servers that include permanent media that contain sensitive or proprietary
2334             information. Additionally, the proper disposal of system components helps to prevent such
2335             components from entering the gray market.

2942   remote access
2943   Access to an organizational system by a user (or a process acting on behalf of a user) communicating through an
2944   external network (e.g., the internet). Remote access methods include dial-up, broadband, and wireless.

2945   remote maintenance
2946   Maintenance activities conducted by individuals communicating through an external network (e.g., the internet).

2947   replay resistant
2948   Protection against the capture of transmitted authentication or access control information and its subsequent
2949   retransmission with the intent of producing an unauthorized effect or gaining unauthorized access.

2950   risk
2951   A measure of the extent to which an entity is threatened by a potential circumstance or event, and typically is a
2952   function of: (i) the adverse impact, or magnitude of harm, that would arise if the circumstance or event occurs; and
2953   (ii) the likelihood of occurrence. [14]

2954   risk assessment
2955   The process of identifying risks to organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, reputation),
2956   organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation, resulting from the operation of a system. [59]

2957   sanitization
2958   Actions taken to render data written on media unrecoverable by both ordinary and, for some forms of sanitization,
2959   extraordinary means.
2960   Process to remove information from media such that data recovery is not possible. It includes removing all classified
2961   labels, markings, and activity logs.

2962   security
2963   A condition that results from the establishment and maintenance of protective measures that enable an organization
2964   to perform its mission or critical functions despite risks posed by threats to its use of systems. Protective measures
2965   may involve a combination of deterrence, avoidance, prevention, detection, recovery, and correction that should
2966   form part of the organization’s risk management approach. [82]

2967   security assessment
2968   See security control assessment.

2969   security control
2970   The safeguards or countermeasures prescribed for an information system or an organization to protect the
2971   confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system and its information. [14]

2972   security control assessment
2973   The testing or evaluation of security controls to determine the extent to which the controls are implemented
2974   correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security
2975   requirements for an information system or organization. [14]

2976   security domain
2977   A domain that implements a security policy and is administered by a single authority. Adapted from [82]

2978   security functions
2979   The hardware, software, or firmware of the system responsible for enforcing the system security policy and
2980   supporting the isolation of code and data on which the protection is based.

2981   split tunneling
2982   The process of allowing a remote user or device to establish a non-remote connection with a system and
2983   simultaneously communicate via some other connection to a resource in an external network. This method of
2984   network access enables a user to access remote devices (e.g., a networked printer) at the same time as accessing
2985   uncontrolled networks.

2986   system
2987   See information system.

2988   system component
2989   A discrete identifiable information technology asset that represents a building block of a system and may include
2990   hardware, software, and firmware. [45]

2991   system security plan
2992   A document that describes how an organization meets the security requirements for a system or plans to meet the
2993   requirements. In particular, the system security plan describes the system boundary; the environment in which the
2994   system operates; how the security requirements are implemented; and the relationships with or connections to other
2995   systems.

2996   system service
2997   A capability provided by a system that facilitates information processing, storage, or transmission.

2998   threat
2999   Any circumstance or event with the potential to adversely impact organizational operations, organizational assets,
3000   individuals, other organizations, or the Nation through a system via unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure,
3001   modification of information, and/or denial of service. [59]

3002   system user

3052   Appendix D. Change Log
3053   This publication incorporates the following changes from the original edition (February 2020;
3054   updated January 28, 2021):
3055       •   Streamlined introductory information in Section 1 and Section 2 to improve clarity and
3056           customer understanding
3057       •   Modified the security requirements and families in Section 3 to reflect the security
3058           controls in the NIST SP 800-53B [13] moderate baseline and the tailoring actions in
3059           Appendix C
3060       •   Eliminated the distinction between basic and derived security requirements
3061       •   Increased the specificity of security requirements to remove ambiguity, improve the
3062           effectiveness of implementation, and clarify the scope of assessments
3063       •   Introduced organization-defined parameters (ODP) in selected security requirements to
3064           increase flexibility and help organizations better manage risk
3065       •   Grouped security requirements, where possible, to improve understanding and efficiency
3066           of implementation and assessments
3067       •   Removed outdated and redundant security requirements
3068       •   Added titles to security requirements
3069       •   Introduced a new tailoring category, Not Applicable (NA)
3070       •   Recategorized selected controls in the NIST SP 800-53B moderate baseline (using the
3071           tailoring criteria in Appendix C)
3072       •   Recast the security requirements, where possible, for consistency with the security
3073           control language in NIST SP 800-53
3074       •   Revised the structure of the References, Acronyms, and Glossary sections for greater
3075           clarity and ease of use
3076       •   Revised the tailoring table in Appendix C for consistency with the changes to the security
3077           requirements
