Executive Summary

    Mobile phone forensics is the science of recovering digital evidence from a mobile phone
    under forensically sound conditions using accepted methods. Mobile phones, especially those
    with advanced capabilities, are a relatively recent phenomenon, not usually covered in classical
    computer forensics. This guide attempts to bridge that gap by providing an in-depth look into
    mobile phones and explaining the technologies involved and their relationship to forensic
    procedures. It covers phones with features beyond simple voice communication and text
    messaging and their technical and operating characteristics. This guide also discusses
    procedures for the preservation, acquisition, examination, analysis, and reporting of digital
    information present on cell phones, as well as available forensic software tools that support
    those activities.

    The objective of the guide is twofold: to help organizations evolve appropriate policies and
    procedures for dealing with cell phones, and to prepare forensic specialists to contend with
    new circumstances involving cell phones, when they arise. The guide is not all-inclusive nor is
    it prescribing how law enforcement and incident response communities handle mobile devices
    during investigations or incidents. However, from the principles outlined and other
    information provided, organizations should nevertheless find the guide helpful in setting
    policies and procedures. This publication should not be construed as legal advice.
    Organizations should use this guide as a starting point for developing a forensic capability in
    conjunction with extensive guidance provided by legal advisors, officials, and management.

    The information in this guide is best applied in the context of current technology and practices.
    Every situation is unique, as are the experiences of the forensic specialists and the tools and
    facilities at their disposal. The judgment of the forensic specialists should be given deference
    in the implementation of the procedures suggested in this guide. Circumstances of individual
    cases; international, federal, state, local laws and rules; and organization-specific policies may
    also require actions other than those described in this guide. As always, close and continuing
    consultation with legal counsel is advised.

    Implementing the following recommendations should facilitate efficient and effective digital
    forensic activities involving cell phones and cellular devices.

    Organizations should ensure that their policies contain clear statements about forensic
    considerations involving cell phones.

    At a high level, policy should allow authorized personnel to perform investigations of
    organizationally issued cell phones for legitimate reasons, under the appropriate circumstances.
    The forensic policy should clearly define the roles and responsibilities of the workforce and of
    any external organizations performing or assisting with the organization’s forensic activities.
    The policy should also indicate internal teams and external organizations to be contacted under
    various circumstances.

    Organizations should create and maintain procedures and guidelines for performing
    forensic tasks on cell phones.

    Guidelines should focus on general methodologies for investigating incidents using forensic
    techniques. While developing comprehensive procedures tailored to every possible situation is

not generally feasible, organizations should consider developing step-by-step procedures for
performing all routine activities in the preservation, acquisition, examination and analysis, and
reporting of digital evidence found on cell phones and associated media. The guidelines and
procedures should facilitate consistent, effective, accurate, and repeatable actions carried out in
a forensically sound manner, suitable for legal prosecution or disciplinary actions. The
guidelines and procedures should support the admissibility of evidence into legal proceedings,
including seizing and handling evidence properly, maintaining the chain of custody, storing
evidence appropriately, establishing and maintaining the integrity of forensic tools and
equipment, and demonstrating the integrity of any electronic logs, records, and case files. The
guidelines and procedures should be reviewed periodically, and also whenever significant
changes in cell phone technology appear that affect them.

Organizations should ensure that their policies and procedures support the reasonable
and appropriate use of forensic tools for cell phones.

Policies and procedures should clearly explain what actions are to be taken by a forensic unit
under various circumstances commonly encountered with cell phones. They should also
describe the quality measures to apply in verifying the proper functioning of any forensic tools
used in examining cell phones and associated media. Procedures for handling sensitive
information that might be recorded by forensic tools should also be addressed. Legal counsel
should carefully review all forensic policy and high-level procedures for compliance with
international, federal, state, and local laws and regulations, as appropriate.

Organizations should ensure that their forensic professionals are prepared to conduct
activities in cell phone forensics.

Forensic professionals, especially first responders to incidents, should understand their roles
and responsibilities for cell phone forensics and receive training and education on related
forensic tools, policies, guidelines, and procedures. Forensic professionals should also consult
closely with legal counsel both in general preparation for forensics activities, such as
determining which actions should and should not be taken under various circumstances. In
addition, management should be responsible for supporting forensic capabilities, reviewing
and approving forensic policy, and examining and endorsing unusual forensic actions that may
be needed in a particular situation.

1. Introduction

1.1   Authority

       The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed this guide in
       furtherance of its statutory responsibilities under the Federal Information Security
       Management Act (FISMA) of 2002, Public Law 107-347.

       NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines, including minimum
       requirements, for providing adequate information security for all Federal agency operations
       and assets; but such standards and guidelines shall not apply to national security systems. This
       guideline is consistent with the requirements of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
       Circular A-130, Section 8b(3), “Securing Agency Information Systems,” as analyzed in A-
       130, Appendix IV: Analysis of Key Sections. Supplemental information is provided in A-130,
       Appendix III.

       This guide has been prepared for use by Federal agencies. It may be used by non-
       governmental organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright, though
       attribution is desired.

       Nothing in this guide should be taken to contradict standards and guidelines made mandatory
       and binding on Federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory authority, nor
       should these guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the
       Secretary of Commerce, Director of the OMB, or any other Federal official.

1.2   Purpose and Scope

       This guide provides basic information on the preservation, acquisition, examination, analysis,
       and reporting of digital evidence on cell phones, relevant to law enforcement, incident
       response, and other types of investigations. The guide focuses mainly on the characteristics of
       cell phones, including smart phones having advanced capabilities. It also covers provisions to
       be taken into consideration during the course of an incident investigation.

       The guide is intended to address common circumstances that may be encountered by
       organizational security staff and law enforcement investigators, involving digital electronic
       data residing on cell phones and associated electronic media. It is also intended to complement
       existing guidelines and delve more deeply into issues related to cell phones and their
       examination and analysis.

       Procedures and techniques presented in this document are a compilation of the authors’
       opinions and references taken from existing forensic guidelines. The publication is not to be
       used as a step-by-step guide for executing a proper forensic investigation when dealing with
       mobile phones or construed as legal advice. Its purpose is to inform readers of the various
       technologies involved and potential ways to approach them from a forensic point of view.
       Readers are advised to apply the recommended practices only after consultation with
       management and legal officials for compliance with laws and regulations (i.e., local, state,
       federal, and international) that pertain to their situation.

1.3   Audience and Assumptions

       The intended audience is varied and ranges from response team members handling a computer
       security incident to organizational security officials investigating an employee-related situation
       to forensic examiners involved in criminal investigations. The practices recommended in this
       guide are designed to highlight key technical principles associated with the handling and
       examination of electronic evidence, in general, and cell phones in particular. Readers are
       assumed to have a basic grounding in classical computer forensics involving individual
       computer systems (e.g., personal computers) and network servers. Because of the constantly
       changing nature of handheld devices and related forensic procedures and tools, readers are
       expected to take advantage of other resources, including those listed in this guide, for more
       current and detailed information.

2. Background

       The digital forensic community faces a constant challenge to stay abreast of the latest
       technologies that may be used to expose relevant clues in an investigation. Mobile phones are
       commonplace in today’s society, used by many individuals for both personal and professional
       purposes. Mobile phone forensics is the science of recovering digital evidence from a mobile
       phone under forensically sound conditions using accepted methods. Cell phones vary in
       design and are continually undergoing change as existing technologies improve and new
       technologies are introduced. When a cell phone is encountered during an investigation, many
       questions arise: What should be done about maintaining power? How should the phone be
       handled? How should valuable or potentially relevant data contained on the device be
       examined? The key to answering these questions is an understanding of the hardware and
       software characteristics of cell phones.

       This chapter gives an overview of the hardware and software capabilities of cell phones and
       their associated cellular networks. The overview provides a summary of general
       characteristics and, where useful, focuses on key features. Developing an understanding of the
       components and organization of cell phones (e.g., memory organization and use) is a
       prerequisite to understanding the criticalities involved when dealing with them forensically.
       For example, cell phone memory that contains user data may be volatile (i.e., RAM) and
       require continuous power to maintain content, unlike a personal computer’s hard disk.
       Similarly, features of cellular networks are an important aspect of cell phone forensics, since
       logs of usage and other data are maintained therein. Handheld device technologies and cellular
       networks are rapidly changing, with new technologies, products, and features being introduced
       regularly. Because of the fast pace with which cellular device technologies are evolving, this
       discussion captures a snapshot of the cell phone area at the present time.

2.1   Cell Network Characteristics

       Within the U.S., different types of digital cellular networks abound that follow distinct
       incompatible sets of standards. The two most dominant types of digital cellular networks are
       known as Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) and Global System for Mobile
       Communications (GSM) networks. Other common cellular networks include Time Division
       Multiple Access (TDMA) and Integrated Digital Enhanced Network (iDEN). IDEN networks
       use a proprietary protocol designed by Motorola, while the others follow standardized open
       protocols. A digital version of the original analog standard for cellular telephone phone
       service, called Digital Advanced Mobile Phone Service (D-AMPS), also exist.

       CDMA refers to a technology designed by Qualcomm in the U.S., which employs spread
       spectrum communications for the radio link. Rather than sharing a channel as many other
       network air interfaces do, CDMA spreads the digitized data over the entire bandwidth
       available, distinguishing multiple calls through a unique sequence code assigned. Successive
       versions of the IS-95 standard define CDMA conventions in the U.S., which is the reason why
       the term CDMA is often used to refer to IS-95 compliant cellular networks. IS-95 CDMA
       systems are sometimes referred to as cdmaOne. The next evolutionary step for CDMA to 3G

services is cdma2000, TIA/EIA/IS-2000 Series1 , Release A, based on the ITU IMT-2000
standard. Both Verizon and Sprint operate nationwide CDMA networks in the U.S.

GSM is a cellular system used worldwide that was designed in Europe, primarily by Ericsson
and Nokia. Cingular and T-Mobile operate nationwide networks in the U.S. GSM uses a
TDMA air interface. TDMA refers to a digital link technology whereby multiple phones share
a single carrier, radio frequency channel by taking turns – using the channel exclusively for an
allocated time slice, then releasing it and waiting briefly while other phones use it. A packet
switching enhancement to GSM wireless networks called General Packet Radio Service
(GPRS) was standardized to improve the transmission of data. The next generation of GSM,
commonly referred to as the third generation or 3G, is known as Universal Mobile
Telecommunications System (UMTS) and involves enhancing GSM networks with a
Wideband CDMA (W-CDMA) air interface.

TDMA is also used to refer specifically to the standard covered by IS-136, which defines a
specific type of cellular network. Using the term TDMA to refer to a general technique or a
specific type of cellular network can be a source of confusion. For example, although GSM
uses a TDMA air interface (i.e., the general technique), as does iDEN, neither of those systems
is compatible with so-called TDMA cellular networks that follow IS-136.

Mobile phones work with certain subsets of the network types mentioned, typically those
associated with the service provider providing the phone and from whom a service agreement
was arranged. For example, a service provider or network operator for a GSM network that
has some older TDMA network segments in operation might supply a phone that has GSM
voice and data capabilities, and TDMA capabilities. Such a phone would not be compatible
with CDMA networks. Mobile phones can also be acquired without service from a
manufacturer, vendor, or other source, and have their service set up separately with a service
provider or network operator, provided that the phone is compatible with the network. When
in operation, mobile phones may contact compatible networks operated for or by another
service provider, and gain service. To administer the cellular network system, provide
subscribed services, and accurately bill or debit subscriber accounts, data about the service
contract and associated service activities are captured and maintained by the network system.

As the name implies, cellular networks provide coverage based on dividing up a large
geographical service area into smaller areas of coverage called cells. Cells play an important
role in reuse of radio frequencies in the limited radio spectrum available to allow more calls to
occur than otherwise would be possible. As a mobile phone moves from one cell to another,
however, a cellular arrangement requires active connections to be monitored and effectively
passed along between cells to maintain the connection

Despite their differences in technology, cellular networks are organized similarly to one
another, in a manner illustrated in Figure 1. The main components are the radio transceiver
equipment that communicates with mobile phones, the controller that manages the transceiver
equipment and performs channel assignment, and the switching system for the cellular
network. The technical names for these components are respectively the Base Transceiver
Station (BTS), the Base Station Controller (BSC), and the Mobile Switching Center (MSC).
The BSC and the BTS units it controls are sometimes collectively referred to as a Base Station

       Subsystem. The transceivers at the BTS can be configured in a variety of ways. A typical
       configuration involves three distinct sectors of 120 degree coverage: 0 degrees North to 120
       degrees Southeast, 120 degrees Southeast to 240 degrees Southwest, and 240 degrees
       Southwest to 360 degrees North. A cell identifier uniquely identifies the BTS and sector
       involved in servicing a call.




                                 Figure 1: Cellular Network Organization

       The MSC controls a set of BSCs and manages overall communications throughout the cellular
       network, including interfacing to the public switch telephone network. To perform its tasks,
       the MSC uses several databases. A key database is the central repository system for subscriber
       data and service information, called the Home Location Register (HLR). Another database
       used in conjunction with the HLR for mobile phones roaming outside of their service area is
       the Visitor Location Register. Account information, such as data about the subscriber (e.g., a
       billing address), the subscribed services, and the location update last registered with the
       network are maintained at the HLR and used by the MSC to route calls and messages and to
       generate usage records called call detail records. The subscriber account data and call detail
       records are often a valuable source of evidence in an investigation.

2.2   Mobile Phone Characteristics

       Mobile phones are highly mobile communications devices that perform an array of functions
       ranging from that of a simple digital organizer to that of a low-end personal computer.
       Designed for mobility, they are compact in size, battery powered, and lightweight. Most cell
       phones have a basic set of comparable features and capabilities. They house a microprocessor,
       read only memory (ROM), random access memory (RAM), a radio module, a digital signal
       processor, a microphone and speaker, a variety of hardware keys and interfaces, and a liquid
       crystal display (LCD). The operating system (OS) of the device is held in ROM, which with
       the proper tools typically can be erased and reprogrammed electronically. RAM, which for

certain models may be used to store user data, is kept active by batteries, whose failure or
exhaustion causes that information to be lost.

The latest cell phones come equipped with system-level microprocessors that reduce the
number of supporting chips required and include considerable memory capacity. Built-in Mini
Secure Digital (MiniSD)2 , MultiMedia Card Mobile (MMCmobile)3 , or other types of card
slots support removable memory cards or specialized peripherals, such as an SDIO WiFi card.
Wireless communications such as infrared (i.e., IrDA) or Bluetooth may also be built into the
device.

Different devices have different technical and physical characteristics (e.g., size, weight,
processor speed, memory capacity). Devices may also use different types of expansion
capabilities to provide additional functionality. Furthermore, cell phone capabilities
sometimes include those of other devices such as PDAs, global positioning systems, and
cameras. Overall, they can be classified as basic phones that are primarily simple voice and
messaging communication devices; advanced phones that offer additional capabilities and
services for multimedia; and smart phones or high-end phones that merge the capabilities of an
advanced phone with those of a PDA. Table 1 highlights the general hardware characteristics
of basic, advanced, and smart phone models, which underscore this diversity.

Note that the characteristics used in this classification scheme are illustrative. The features of
actual devices do vary and can span more than one category identified. Over time, advanced

features also tend to appear in more basic phones as new ones are added to the high end.
Though the lines among this classification scheme are somewhat fuzzy and dynamic, it
nevertheless serves as a general guide.

Despite the type of cell phone, nearly all devices support voice and text messaging, a set of
basic Personal Information Management (PIM) applications that includes phonebook and date
book facilities, and a means to synchronize PIM data with a desktop computer. More
advanced devices also provide the ability to perform multimedia messaging, connect to the
Internet and surf the Web, exchange electronic mail, or chat using instant messaging. They
may also provide enhanced PIM applications that work with specialized built-in hardware,
such as a camera.

Finally, very high-end devices called smart phones add PDA-like capability for reviewing
electronic documents (e.g., reports, briefing slides, and spreadsheets) and running a wide
variety of general and special-purpose applications. Smart phones are typically larger than
other phones, support a bigger-size display (e.g., ¼ VGA and higher), and may have an
integrated QWERTY keyboard or touch sensitive screen. They also offer more extended
expansion capabilities through peripheral card slots, other built-in wireless communications
such as Bluetooth and WiFi, and synchronization protocols to exchange other kinds of data
beyond basic PIM data (e.g., graphics, audio, and archive file formats). Table 2 lists the
differences in software capabilities found on these device classes.

The basic and advanced cell phones typically use a company proprietary operating system. A
number of companies specializing in embedded software also offer real-time operating system
solutions for manufacturers of portable devices, including cell phones. Nearly all cell phones
claiming to be smart phones use one of the following operating systems: Palm OS, Windows
Mobile (phone edition), RIM OS, Symbian OS, or Linux. Unlike the more limited, real-time
kernels in basic and advanced phones, these operating systems are multi-tasking and full-
featured, designed specifically to match the capabilities of high-end mobile devices. Besides a
wide array of applications, they often come complete with a Java Virtual Machine and native

2.3   Identity Module Characteristics

       Subscriber Identity Modules are synonymous with mobile phones and devices that interoperate
       with GSM cellular networks. Under the GSM framework, a cellular phone is referred to as a
       Mobile Station and is partitioned into two distinct components: the Subscriber Identity Module
       (SIM) and the Mobile Equipment (ME). As the name implies, a SIM is a removable
       component that contains essential information about the subscriber. The ME, the remaining
       radio handset portion, cannot function fully without one. The SIM’s main function entails
       authenticating the user of the cell phone to the network to gain access to subscribed services.
       The SIM also provides storage for personal information, such as phone book entries and text
       messages, as well as service-related information.

       The SIM-ME partitioning of a cell phone stipulated in the GSM standards has brought about a
       form of portability. Moving a SIM between compatible cell phones automatically transfers
       with it the subscriber’s identity and the associated information and capabilities. In contrast,
       present-day CDMA phones do not employ a SIM. Analogous SIM functionality is instead
       directly incorporated within the device. While SIMs are most widely used in GSM systems,
       comparable modules are also used in iDEN phones and UMTS user equipment (i.e., a USIM).
       Because of the flexibility a SIM offers GSM phone users to port their identity, personal
       information, and service between devices, eventually all cellular phones are expected to
       include (U)SIM-like capability. For example, requirements for a Removable User Identity
       Module (R-UIM), as an extension of SIM capabilities, have been specified for cellular
       environments conforming to TIA/EIA/IS-95-A and -B specifications, which include Wideband
       Spread Spectrum based CDMA [3GP02].

       At its core, a (U)SIM is a special type of smart card that typically contains a processor and
       between 16 to 128 KB of persistent electronically erasable, programmable read only memory
       (EEPROM). It also includes RAM for program execution and ROM for the operating system,
       user authentication and data encryption algorithms, and other applications. The (U)SIM’s
       hierarchically organized file system resides in persistent memory and stores such things as
       names and phone number entries, text messages, and network service settings. Depending on
       the phone used, some information on the (U)SIM may coexist in the memory of the phone.
       Information may also reside entirely in the memory of the phone instead of available memory
       reserved for it in the file system of the (U)SIM [Wil05, Jan06].

       The (U)SIM operating system controls access to elements of the file system [3GP05a].
       Actions such are reading or updating can be permitted or denied unconditionally, or allowed
       conditionally with certain access rights. Rights are assigned to a subscriber through 4-8 digit
       Personal Identification Number (PIN) codes. PINs protect core (U)SIM subscriber-related
       data and certain optional data. PIN codes can be modified by the subscriber, and their function
       disabled or enabled. A preset number of attempts, usually three, are allowed for providing the
       correct PIN code to the (U)SIM before further attempts are blocked completely, rendering
       communications inoperative. Only by providing a correct PIN Unblocking Key (PUK) can the

value of a PIN and its attempt counter be reset on the (U)SIM. If the number of attempts to
enter the correct PUK value exceeds a set limit, normally ten attempts, the card becomes
blocked permanently. The PUK for a PIN can be obtained from the service provider or
network operator by providing the identifier of the SIM (i.e., its Integrated Circuit Chip
Identifier or ICCID). The ICCID is normally imprinted on the (U)SIM, but can also be read
from an element of the file system.

(U)SIMs have a width of 25 mm, a height of 15 mm, and a thickness of .76 mm, which is
roughly the footprint of a postage stamp. Though similar in dimension to a MiniSD or an
MMCmobile removable memory card supported by some cell phones, (U)SIMs follow a
different set of specifications with vastly different characteristics. For example, their pin
connectors are not aligned along a bottom edge as with removable media cards, but instead
form a circular contact pad integral to the smart card chip, which is embedded in a plastic
frame, as shown in Figure 2. (U)SIMs also employ a broad range of tamper resistance
techniques to protect the information they contain.




                                   Figure 2: (U)SIM Format

The slot for the (U)SIM card is normally not accessible from the exterior of the phone to
facilitate frequent insertion and removal as with a memory card. Instead, it typically is found
in the battery compartment under the battery. When a (U)SIM is inserted into a phone handset
and pin contact is made, a serial interface is used for communicating between them. A
(U)SIM can be removed from a phone and read using a specialized (U)SIM reader and
software through the same interface. Standard-size smart card adapters are also available for
(U)SIMs, which allows them to be inserted into and read with a conventional smart card
reader.

Authenticating a device to a network securely is a vital function performed via the SIM.
Cryptographic key information and algorithms within the tamper resistant module provide the
means for the device to participate in a challenge-response dialogue with the network and
respond correctly, without exposing key material and other information that could be used to
clone the SIM and gain access to a subscriber’s services. Cryptographic key information in the
SIM also supports stream cipher encryption to protect against eavesdropping on the air
interface [Ved93, Wil03].

3. Forensic Tools

     The situation with forensic software tools for cell phones is considerably different from
     personal computers. While personal computers are designed as general-purpose systems, cell
     phones are designed more as special-purpose appliances that perform a set of predefined tasks.
     Cellular phone manufacturers also tend to rely on assorted proprietary operating systems rather
     than the more standardized approach found in personal computers. Because of this, the variety
     of toolkits for mobile devices is diverse and the range of devices over which they operate is
     typically narrowed to distinct platforms for a manufacturer’s product line, an operating system
     family, or a type of hardware architecture. Short product release cycles are the norm for
     cellular phones, requiring tool manufacturers to update their tools continually to keep coverage
     current. The task is formidable and tool manufacturers’ support for newer models often lags
     significantly. Some have argued that the current state is likely to continue, keeping the cost of
     examination significantly higher than if a few standard operating systems prevailed [Moo06].

     Forensic tools acquire data from a device in one of two ways: physical acquisition or logical
     acquisition. Physical acquisition implies a bit-by-bit copy of an entire physical store (e.g., a
     memory chip), while logical acquisition implies a bit-by-bit copy of logical storage objects
     (e.g., directories and files) that reside on a logical store (e.g., a file system partition). The
     difference lies in the distinction between memory as seen by a process through the operating
     system facilities (i.e., a logical view), versus memory as seen in raw form by the processor and
     other related hardware components (i.e., a physical view).

     Physical acquisition has advantages over logical acquisition, since it allows deleted files and
     any data remnants present (e.g., in unallocated memory or file system space) to be examined,
     which otherwise would go unaccounted. Extracted device images need to be parsed, decoded,
     and translated to uncover the data present. The work is tedious and time consuming to perform
     manually. Physical device images can be imported into a tool to automate examination and
     reporting, however, only a few tools tailored for obtaining cell phone images are currently
     available. A logical acquisition, though more limited than a physical acquisition, has the
     advantage that the system data structures are normally easier for a tool to extract and provide a
     more natural organization to understand and use during examination. If possible, doing both
     types of acquisition is preferable – a physical acquisition before a logical acquisition.

Most forensic software tools for cell phones and (U)SIMs acquire data logically, using
common device protocols for synchronization, communications, and debugging, as shown in
Figure 3 [Gra02, Mcc05]. Some tools may also be capable of acquiring data physically for
certain classes of phones. AT commands, Sync ML, and the other protocols listed are
commonly used in the logical acquisition of cell phones. Because handsets can support
multiple protocols, a tool may employ several of them in succession to acquire the broadest
range of available data. Even if a tool uses multiple protocols for a particular handset, all of
the data available may not be able to be retrieved.

Different tools can use a different protocol to acquire the same data. Table 3 illustrates the
protocol exchanges used by several tools to acquire the IMEI (i.e., ASCII value of
356661005704092) from a Nokia 6101 cell phone. The first tool listed uses a standardized AT
Command exchange [Nok05], while the other two tools use the FBUS protocol [Pea05].
While many of the protocols are standardized and publicly available, some such as MBUS and
FBUS are proprietary. Even standardized protocols often include manufacturer extensions or
variants. (U)SIMs follow stricter standards than handsets and the application protocol data
unit (APDU) interface protocol listed in Figure 3 is normally used exclusively with them.

The raw data logically acquired from a phone or (U)SIM is often encoded unconventionally,
such as with text represented in the 7-bit GSM alphabet, and difficult to interpret. Other
encodings that can be encountered include Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) and Unicode. To
facilitate interpretation, most tools decode the data for the operator, as illustrated in Figure 3.
Some tools go a step further and, where appropriate, translate the decoded data (e.g., numeric
codes representing a country and a network operator) into more meaningful forms (e.g.,
country and network operator names) using a database (DB).

The types of software tools available for cell phone examination include commercial forensic
tools, device management tools, open source tools, self-developed tools, diagnostic tools, and
hacker tools. Forensic tools are typically designed to acquire data from the internal memory of

                                           14
                                                                         Guidelines on Cell Phone Forensics


a handset and any removable identity modules such as SIMs found in GSM and other types of
phones. Both forensic and non-forensic software tools often use the same protocols to
communicate with the device. However, non-forensic tools allow a two-way flow of
information to enhance or customize one’s cellular device (e.g., to add customized phone
rings, wallpaper, themes, etc.), while forensic tools are designed specifically to acquire data
from the device without altering device content and to calculate integrity hashes over the
acquired data. Most practitioners use a collection of both forensic and non-forensic tools along
with other accessories to form their “toolbox.”5 Tools not designed specifically for forensic
purposes are questionable, however [New07]. Before considering their use, they should be
thoroughly evaluated and the implications of any associated forensic issues should be fully
understood. In some situations, non-forensic tools might be the only means to retrieve data
that could be relevant as evidence and may be appropriate to use when the proper precautions
are taken.


       Port Monitoring: On occasion one might be faced with having to use a non-forensic tool, such
       as a phone manager, to recover data. Besides using test phones in thoroughly evaluating and
       understanding the tool, some additional steps can be considered. One of the easiest things to do,
       not only during the tool evaluation, but also during an actual acquisition once the evaluation has
       been completed, is to capture the protocol exchanges that occur over the serial connection
       between the phone and forensic workstation. Port monitors with such logging capabilities for
       cabled devices include Portmon 6 and Serial Monitor.7 Infrared and Bluetooth monitoring is also
       possible using a separate workstation to eavesdrop on the wireless communications.

       During evaluation, the protocol exchanges can be analyzed for specific actions taken at the user
       interface and benign actions identified. During an actual acquisition, capturing the protocol
       exchanges serves as a record of the events that occurred, which can be kept for reference to
       refute any concerns that may be raised at a later time.

       Port monitoring can also be carried out with a forensic tool to gain insight on its operation or
       simply to capture a complete log of an acquisition. For example, the entries shown in Table 3
       were captured this way. Monitoring of (U)SIM tool exchanges can be done similarly. Built-in
       logging of protocol exchanges is a useful feature that some forensic tools provide, and precludes
       the need for a separate tool.



While most forensic tools support a full range of acquisition, examination, and reporting
functions, some tools focus only on a subset. Different tools may also support different
interfaces (e.g., IrDA, Bluetooth, or serial cable) to acquire device contents. Acquisition
through a cable interface generally yields superior results than other interfaces. However,
under certain conditions, a wireless interface such as infrared or Bluetooth can serve as a
reasonable alternative (e.g., when the correct cable is not readily available and the forensic
issues of using another interface are understood). Regardless of the interface used, vigilance of
the potential forensic issues associated is paramount. For example, Bluetooth typically
involves an exchange of information with the forensic workstation to setup a connection,

which is then retained on the device. Enabling the connection and pairing the device to the
workstation also requires key entries on the handset.

Most forensic software tools address a wide range of applicable devices, handle the most
common investigative situations, and require a modest level of skill to operate. Table 4 gives
an overview of available tools used in cell phone investigations, and identifies the facilities
they provide: acquisition, examination, or reporting. Additional tools do exist, but only those
familiar to the authors are discussed. The tools are grouped into tools that target SIMs
exclusively, tools that target handsets exclusively, and toolkits that target both handsets and
SIMs. The range of devices a tool addresses is often narrowed to those from certain
manufacturers, with specific operating systems, or with distinct hardware architectures. To
cover the broadest range of mobile phones and (U)SIMs, a set of several tools is required.
More detailed information about the performance forensic tools can be found in two
companion reports [Aye05, Aye07]. The remaining sections of this chapter give a synopsis for
each category of tool and an overview of their capabilities. Note that the capabilities of the
tools listed are constantly improving and may differ slightly from the description given.

3.1   (U)SIM Tools

       A few forensics tools deal exclusively with (U)SIMs. These tools perform a direct read of a
       module’s contents via a (U)SIM reader, as opposed to an indirect read via the phone handset.
       The richness and scope of data acquired varies with the capabilities and features of the tool.
       The majority of (U)SIM exclusive tools acquire the following data: International Mobile
       Subscriber Identity (IMSI), Integrated Circuit Card ID (ICCID), Abbreviated Dialling
       Numbers (ADN), Last Numbers Dialled (LND), SMS messages, and Location Information
       (LOCI) [Aye05, Aye07].

       More capable tools provide additional information such as deleted SMS messages, properly
       rendered foreign language SMS messages, and EMS messages with simple graphics and
       sounds embedded [Jan06]. They also attempt to translate certain data such as country and
       network operator codes into meaningful names, and provide other facilities such as PIN
       administration. Below is a brief overview of some tools that are designed to acquire data
       specifically from SIMs.

                Forensic Card Reader (FCR) is a forensic tool from Becker & Partner that provides
                 the means to extract data from SIMs. FCR does not generate a case file, but outputs
                 the acquired data in an XML-format that can be viewed with the appropriate editor.
                 FCR consists of the software and a proprietary USB smart card reader necessary for
                 acquisition. Neither integrity hash protection nor customizable report facilities are
                 provided.

              The Forensic SIM Toolkit (FST) is a forensic tool from Radio Tactic that provides the
               means to extract and duplicate data from SIMs/USIMs. The case file is stored in a
               proprietary FST format and can be output in either an HTML or RTF/Word file-
               format. A USB dongle is needed to operate the software on a desktop computer. The
               FST acquisition terminal, a standalone unit, duplicates the contents of the target
               (U)SIM to a set of FST data storage cards (i.e., the Master Data Storage Card,
               Defense Data Storage Card, and Prosecution Data Storage Card). Data analysis can
               be carried out using the appropriate FST data storage card with the ForensicSIM card
               reader (i.e., PC/SC-compatible card reader) attached to a PC running the ForensicSIM
               analysis application. An MD5 checksum provides integrity protection for the
               generated case data. FST allows the import of archived case files and basic searches
               of the acquired data file.

              SIMCon is a forensic tool from InsideOut Forensics that provides the means to extract
               data from SIMs and USIMs. The case file has a proprietary format but can be
               exported to a standard ASCII text format. Additional hardware (e.g., USB dongle,
               proprietary card readers) are not necessary for acquisition. SIMCon acquires data
               from a (U)SIM via a PC/SC-compatible card reader and uses a SHA1 hash to protect
               the integrity of the generated case data. SIMCon provides the ability to import
               archived case files and export specific data out into a final report.

              SIMIS is a forensic tool from Crownhill USA that provides means to extract data
               from SIMs and USIMs. The case file is generated in an HTML file-format. An
               additional “SIM dump” feature provides a more detailed case file in a standard ASCII
               text format. A USB dongle is needed to operate the software on a desktop computer.
               SIMIS acquires information from a (U)SIM via a PC/SC-compatible card reader and
               generates MD5 and SHA2 hashes of the acquired data. SIMIS provides the ability to
               create report notes, import archived case files, search acquired data, and administer
               PINs. The search function can range over any archived SIMs present in the program
               folder.

              Quantaq Solutions’ USIMdetective SIM acquisition tool provides examiners with the
               ability to acquire, examine, and produce reports from any SIM or USIM card using a
               PC/SC compatible reader. Acquired elements can be displayed in a textual or
               hexadecimal format. USIMdetective uses an internal hashing facility to ensure the
               integrity of case. Image Integrity Check (.iic) files are created with each acquisition to
               protect against data tampering. SHA1 and MD5 hashes ensure that the original
               acquired file is consistent with the reopened case file. USIMdetective provides
               multiple report output types ranging from a “Standard Report” to a more detailed
               “File Content Report.”

3.2   Handset Tools

       A few forensic tools deal with handsets exclusively, designed strictly for the acquisition of
       their internal memory. These tools sometimes stem from tools aimed at pure PDA devices and
       thus are useful with smart phones that incorporate operating systems with a PDA heritage,
       such as Palm OS and Windows Mobile devices. Others have arisen from phone management
       software modified to disable writing to the device. They generally exclude the capability to
       acquire data from SIMs using a direct read. Below is a brief overview of some tools designed
       for memory acquisition from mobile devices with cellular capabilities.

                                                 18
                                                       Guidelines on Cell Phone Forensics


   PDA Seizure is a forensic software toolkit from Paraben that provides the means to
    extract data from mobile devices running Palm OS, Windows CE, and RIM OS. The
    case file has a proprietary format and can be output in an HTML file format.
    Acquisition occurs via a cable, IrDA, or Bluetooth interface; no additional hardware is
    necessary. Although the tool can be used with smart phones, the toolkit is oriented
    toward non-cellular devices. PDA Seizure’s features include the ability to perform a
    logical acquisition and, for certain devices, a physical acquisition, providing views of
    internal memory as well as individual files and databases. An MD5 message digest is
    created for individual data objects and the overall case file. Additionally, the case
    files are encrypted to prevent tampering and data modification. PDA Seizure provides
    examiners with the ability to create customized reports and report notes, import
    archived case files, bookmark significant findings, and search the acquired data.

   Pilot-link is a non-forensic open source software suite originally developed for the
    Linux community as a means to transfer data between Linux hosts and Palm OS
    devices. Pilot-link provides the ability to extract RAM, ROM and individual files
    present on Palm OS devices. Two programs of interest to forensic examiners are pi-
    getram and pi-getrom, which respectively retrieve the physical contents of RAM and
    ROM from a device. Another useful program is pilot-xfer, which provides a means to
    acquire the contents of a device logically. Neither an overall case file, integrity hash
    computation, nor customizable report facility are provided.

   The forensic version of Oxygen Phone Manager (OPM) from Oxygen Software is a
    variant of the phone management product of the same name, which works mainly on
    Nokia phones. The forensic version differs from the non-forensic version by
    prohibiting modification to the target device. OPM provides examiners with the
    ability to extract data from cellular devices operating over the GSM network. OPM
    does not allow examiners to export an overall case file; however, acquired data is
    stored in multiple files (e.g., Phonebook, SMS, and Gallery) that correlate with the
    related function. OPM does not protect acquired data via hashing functions.
    Acquired data can be exported out into various supported format types.

   A forensic version of Oxygen Phone Manager for Symbian devices, from Oxygen
    Software, also exists. The tool targets mobile phones and smart phones that use the
    Symbian OS. The above-mentioned characteristics of OPM apply equally to OPM
    for Symbian devices.

   BitPIM is open source software available under the GNU General Public License. It
    is a phone management program that allows the viewing and manipulation of data
    primarily from CDMA cell phones by various manufacturers. A read-only check box
    is provided to disable writing to the phone when used for acquisition. BitPIM does
    not allow examiners to export or save an overall case file; however, acquired data is
    stored in multiple files (e.g., Phonebook, SMS, and Filesystem) and can be exported
    in common formats for reporting purposes. BitPIM does not protect acquired data via
    hashing functions.

   Phone flashing tools are available for different families of cell phones from a variety
    of sources. These tools are intended to load new versions of software into the
    memory of a phone as a means of repair and upgrade. While they do provide the
    means to acquire handset memory physically, they are strictly non-forensic in nature,


                                      19
                                                                  Guidelines on Cell Phone Forensics


               have little documentation and support, and do not compute an integrity hash over
               acquired data. Phone flashers should be used with extreme caution only after
               sufficient testing and study is done. Mapping the layout of recovered memory,
               identifying objects, and decoding data is time-consuming to perform manually.
               However, the process can recover such things as phone locks, deleted data, and other
               useful information normally not recoverable through a logical acquisition, such as
               historical information (e.g., the IMSI of previous (U)SIMs used with the phone).

3.3   Integrated Toolkits

       Several toolkits incorporate the capabilities of both (U)SIM and handset tools under a unified
       framework. One advantage for those devices that involve (U)SIMs is that the results of
       handset and (U)SIM examinations can appear within the same generated report. This
       advantage disappears if another tool is used for either device, such as in the case where a
       particular handset might not be supported by the tool.

              Cell Seizure from Paraben is a forensic software toolkit that provides the means to
               extract data from GSM and non-GSM (i.e., CDMA, TDMA) cellular devices and
               (U)SIMs. The case file is in a proprietary format and case data can be output in either
               an ASCII or HTML format. Acquisition occurs via a cable, IrDA, or Bluetooth
               interface. Cell Seizure also allows direct acquisition of (U)SIM cards with the
               included RS-232 SIM card reader. The package comes complete with cables and
               drivers for supported phones, as well as the application software. Cell Seizure’s
               features include the ability to perform a logical and physical acquisition, providing
               views of internal memory as well as individual files and databases. MD5 and SHA1
               hash values are created for individual data objects and an overall message digest of the
               acquired case data is calculated. The case file is also encrypted, preventing tampering
               and data modification. Cell Seizure provides examiners with the ability to create
               customized reports and report notes, import archived case files, bookmark significant
               findings, and search the acquired data.

              CellDEK from Logicube Inc. is designed to acquire data from cell phones operating
               over GSM and non-GSM networks, PDAs, SIM cards and flash-based media. The
               CellDEK terminal contains an embedded touch-screen PC, data cables for various
               devices, a PC/SC SIM card reader, and a write-protected memory card reader,
               packaged in a rugged, watertight carrying case. The unit provides the ability to
               connect to cell phones and PDAs via a cable, Bluetooth or IrDA connection.
               Acquisitions are stored on the CellDEK’s hard disk and can be moved or backed up to
               a USB thumb drive. All data is individually hashed using the MD5 algorithm to
               ensure that the integrity of the data can be verified. CellDEK generates report files in
               an HTML format, containing all of the data recovered. Reports can be customized
               with company logos and case details when entered by the examiner before acquiring
               the device.

              GSM .XRY is a forensic software toolkit from Micro Systemation that provides the
               means to extract data from GSM and non-GSM (i.e., CDMA) cellular devices and
               SIM/USIM cards. A USB dongle is needed to operate the software. The GSM .XRY
               hub provides an interface for the dongle and device cables, and interfaces for
               Bluetooth and IrDA. The package comes complete with cables and drivers for
               supported phones, as well as the application software. Data acquired from cell phone

    devices are stored in the proprietary .XRY format and cannot be altered, but can be
    exported into external formats and viewed with third-party applications. GSM .XRY
    encrypts case data and compares digital signatures for consistency when previously
    stored case data is re-opened for examination. Additionally, case files can be locked
    and password protected, providing an extra layer of security against alteration. GSM
    .XRY provides the ability to create customized reports, import archived case files, and
    perform searches on the acquired data.

   MOBILedit! Forensic from Compelson Labs is an application that provides the means
    to acquire data logically from GSM or non-GSM (i.e., CDMA) devices and SIM
    cards. The tool is based on the non-forensic phone management software of the same
    name. Phone data can be acquired via cable, Bluetooth, or IrDA, and via a PC/SC
    compatible card reader for SIMs. Acquired data is stored in a proprietary case file
    format and can be exported to XML. Mobiledit! provides the ability to create
    customized reports, import archived case files and perform search queries on specific
    folders. Mobiledit! does not protect acquired data via hash value computations.

   PhoneBase 2 from Envisage Systems Ltd. provides the means to acquire data from
    GSM and non-GSM cellular devices and data contained on (U)SIMs. PhoneBase 2
    uses the MOBILedit! acquisition engine for its handset support, but complements that
    with its own facility for (U)SIM acquisition. A USB dongle is needed to operate the
    software. Data can be acquired via cable, Bluetooth, IrDA or a PC/SC compatible
    card reader for SIMs. Acquired data is stored in a common database format and
    protected from tampering via a PhoneBase security (pbs) file. PhoneBase 2 provides
    examiners with the ability to create customized reports, import archived case files and
    perform search queries over multiple cases.

   Secure View is a commercial forensic tool from Susteen, derived from the company’s
    Datapilot phone management software, which provides examiners with the ability to
    extract data from cellular devices operating over GSM and non-GSM (i.e., CDMA,
    TDMA) networks. Recent versions of Secure View also can acquire SIM card data
    using a PC/SC-compatible reader. Secure View does not allow examiners to export
    an overall case file; however, acquired data is stored in multiple files (e.g., Address
    book, SMS, Graphics, and Audio) that correlate with the related function. The
    package comes complete with cables and drivers for supported phones, and the
    application software. Secure View does not protect acquired data via hashing
    functions. However, data can be password protected, allowing only authorized
    access. Secure View provides a search engine that allows a subset of the acquired
    data to be analyzed and the ability to import pre-existing case data.

   TULP2G (2nd generation) is an open source forensic software tool from the
    Netherlands Forensic Institute that provides the means to acquire data from cellular
    GSM and non-GSM (i.e., CDMA) devices and SIMs [Bos05]. Data can be acquired
    via a cable, Bluetooth or IrDA interface. Reading SIMs requires a PC/SC-compatible
    smart card reader. TULP2G generates a set of raw data in XML format, which can be
    converted to a readable format using embedded XSL stylesheets. SHA1 and MD5
    hashes are created over the entire case file, ensuring the integrity of acquired data.
    TULP2G provides the ability to create a report over selected data elements or the
    entire case file and import archived case files.

                                                                          Guidelines on Cell Phone Forensics



           Tool Segregation: With the use of multiple forensic tools, the possibility exists for conflicts to
           occur among certain ones. Resolving such conflicts can sometimes be onerous and time
           consuming, and may need to be repeated across a number of forensic workstations. One
           method to avoid these problems is to use a product such as VMware to create a virtual machine
           environment on each forensic workstation for the tool to execute.

           Each software tool and its operating system can be installed in a distinct virtual machine
           environment, independently from other tools, effectively segregating each tool from the others.
           Compatible collections of tools could also be isolated from incompatible tools this way. Cloning
           the virtual machine with the installed tool or tool collection can be done to baseline a configuration
           for distribution and execution at other workstations’ virtual machines, establishing a common
           computational environment throughout an organization while simplifying the configuration
           process. Since multiple independent virtual machines can run simultaneously on a single
           workstation, several tools or tool collections that otherwise would be incompatible are readily
           supported.



3.4   Capabilities

       Forensic software tools strive to address a wide range of applicable devices to handle the most
       common investigative situations with modest skill level requirements and keep the device
       intact. More difficult situations, such as the recovery of deleted data, require more specialized
       tools and expertise, and often disassembly of the device [Wil05]. The range of support
       provided, including phone cables and drivers, product documentation, (U)SIM readers, and
       updates, can vary significantly among products. The features offered such as searching,
       bookmarking, and reporting capabilities can also vary considerably.

       Quality measures should be applied when first choosing a tool to ensure its acceptability and
       reapplied when updates or new versions of the tool become available to uphold consistency.
       Validating a tool entails defining a comprehensive test data set, loading it onto the device using
       the same methods a user would, and following procedures to acquire and recover the test data
       [Goo03, Aye05, Aye07]. While tool validation can be time consuming to perform, it is a
       necessary standard quality practice to follow. Forensic specialists should also receive adequate
       up-to-date training in the tools and procedures to employ, as a quality measure.

       Mobile phone forensic tools are in their early stages of maturity. They typically have
       limitations in both the breadth of the devices supported and the depth of evidence recovered.
       Subtle errors may also be encountered in their use. For example, a data item displayed on
       screen may vary from the same item appearing in a generated report. Practice and experience
       with a tool can normally compensate for such problems and procedures can be adapted
       accordingly. Occasionally, new versions of a tool may fail to perform as well as a previous
       one.

       The most important characteristic of a forensic tool is its ability to maintain the integrity of the
       original data source being acquired and also that of the extracted data. The former is done by
       blocking or otherwise eliminating write requests to the device containing the data. The latter is
       done by calculating a cryptographic hash of the contents of the evidence files created and
       recurrently verifying that this value remains unchanged throughout the lifetime of those files.
       Preserving integrity not only maintains credibility from a legal perspective, but it also allows
       any subsequent investigation to use the same baseline for replicating the analysis.


                                                      22
                                                              Guidelines on Cell Phone Forensics



Forensic Hash: A forensic hash is used to maintain the integrity of an acquisition by computing a
cryptographically strong, non-reversible value over the acquired data. After acquisition, any
changes made to the data can be detected, since a new hash value computed over the data will
be inconsistent with the old value. For non-forensic tools, hash values should be created
manually using a tool such as sha1sum or md5sum and retained for integrity verification. Even
tools labeled as forensic tools may not compute a cryptographic hash, and an integrity hash
should be computed manually.

Note that mobile devices are constantly active, updating information (e.g., the device clock)
continuously. Some devices, stemming mainly from a PDA heritage, are active even when turned
off [Bur02]. Therefore, back-to-back acquisitions of a device will be slightly different and produce
different hash values when computed over all the data. However, hash values computed over
selected portions of the data, such as individual files and directories, generally remain constant.
Only a few forensic tools offer more granular hash computation of files and directories. Some
forensic tools also do not notify the user automatically about hash inconsistencies, placing the
onus on the forensic specialist to check the hash values manually.

4. Procedures and Principles

       Investigations and incidents are handled in various ways depending upon the circumstances of
       the incident, the gravity of the incident, and the preparation and experience of the investigation
       team. Digital investigations are comparable to crime scenes where investigative techniques
       used by law enforcement have been applied as a foundation for the creation of procedures used
       when dealing with digital evidence. This chapter provides an overview of various procedural
       models and principles that have been proposed.

4.1   Roles and Responsibilities

       Whatever the type of incident, the various types of roles involved are similar. Planning should
       address how existing personnel fulfill these roles when responding and participating in an
       investigation. A set of generic roles and associated responsibilities are given below as an
       example. They include First Responders, Investigators, Technicians, Forensic Examiners,
       Forensic Analysts, and Evidence Custodians. Organizations may need to blend together these
       roles to match their method of operation and level of staffing. In given situations, a single
       individual may also be expected to perform more than one role. Nevertheless, distinguishing
       distinct roles is a useful way to identify associated responsibilities and ensure that the overall
       scope of activities is complete and sufficient.

       First Responders are trained personnel who arrive first on the scene of an incident, provide an
       initial assessment, and begin the appropriate level of response. The responsibilities of First
       Responders are to secure the incident scene, call for the appropriate support needed, and assist
       with evidence collection.

       Investigators plan and manage preservation, acquisition, examination, analysis, and reporting
       of electronic evidence. The Lead Investigator is in charge of making sure that activities at the
       scene of an incident are executed in the right order and at the right time. The Lead Investigator
       may be responsible for developing the evidence, preparing a case report, and briefing any
       findings and determinations to senior officials.

       Technicians carry out actions at the direction of the Lead Investigator. Technicians are
       responsible for identifying and collecting evidence and documenting the incident scene. They
       are specially trained personnel who seize electronic equipment and acquire digital images
       resident within memory. More than one technician is typically involved in an incident,
       because different skills and knowledge are needed. Sufficient expertise should be available at
       the scene to address all distinct digital apparatus involved in the incident.

       Evidence Custodians protect all evidence gathered that is stored in a central location. They
       accept evidence collected by Technicians, ensure it is properly tagged, check it into and out of
       protective custody, and maintain a strict chain of custody.

       Forensic Examiners are specially trained personnel who reproduce images acquired from
       seized equipment and recover digital data. Examiners make visible evidential information on
       the device. Examiners may also acquire more elusive data using highly specialized equipment,
       intensive reverse engineering, or other appropriate means unavailable to Forensic Technicians.
       Having individuals serve as both an Investigator and a Forensic Examiner in an investigation
       should generally be avoided.

       Forensic Analysts evaluate the product of the Forensic Examiner for its significance and

4.2   Evidential Principles

       As a backdrop to any investigation, basic principles have been proposed for dealing with
       digital evidence. Digital evidence by its very nature is extremely fragile, especially that found
       on cell phones. A phone’s contents and the evidence it contains can be affected or even lost
       any time it is on. Digital evidence has two aspects: the physical components, peripherals, and
       media, that may contain data, and the data extracted from those sources. Each has associated
       chain of custody issues. The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) Good Practice
       Guide for Computer based Electronic Evidence [ACPO] suggests four principles when dealing
       with digital evidence, summarized here:

              No actions performed by investigators should change data contained on digital
               devices or storage media that may subsequently be relied upon in court.

              Individuals accessing original data must be competent to do so and have the ability to
               explain their actions.

              An audit trail or other record of applied processes, suitable for replication of the
               results by an independent third-party, must be created and preserved, accurately
               documenting each investigative step.

              The person in charge of the investigation has overall responsibility for ensuring the
               above-mentioned procedures are followed and in compliance with governing laws.

       The Proposed Standards for the Exchange of Digital Evidence [IOCE] suggest a similar set of
       principals for the standardized recovery of computer-based evidence:

              Upon seizing digital evidence, actions taken should not change that evidence.

              When it is necessary for a person to access original digital evidence, that person must
               be forensically competent.

              All activity relating to the seizure, access, storage, or transfer of digital evidence must
               be fully documented, preserved, and available for review.

              An individual is responsible for all actions taken with respect to digital evidence while
               the digital evidence is in their possession.

              Any agency that is responsible for seizing, accessing, storing, or transferring digital
               evidence is responsible for compliance with these principles.

       The above sets of principles aim to ensure the integrity and accountability of digital evidence
       through its entire life cycle. Proper handling of evidence is always vital for it to be admissible
       in judicial proceedings. However, different standards may apply to different types of
       investigations. The degree of training and expertise required to execute a forensic task largely
       depends on the level of evidence required in the case [Pur]. For example, using a forensic
       software tool requires modest skill levels to acquire active data, compared with those required


                                                  25
                                                                    Guidelines on Cell Phone Forensics


       to remove a memory chip and recover data contents, which includes both active and deleted
       data.

       The Daubert method, a set of standards that serve as a guide when dealing with evidence in a
       court of law, proposes several reliability factors, which should be kept in mind when applying
       and reporting on a scientific technique that is being used in a forensic examination [Oco04]:

              Testability – Has the scientific theory or technique been empirically tested?
               According to K. Popper (1989) in The Growth of Scientific Knowledge, "the criterion
               on the scientific status of a theory is its falsifiability, refutability, and testability."

              Acceptance – Has the scientific theory or technique been subjected to peer review
               and publication? This ensures that flaws in the methodology would have been
               detected and that the technique is finding its way into use via the literature.

              Error Rate – What is the known or potential error rate? Scientific measures
               generally have associated error rates, which can be estimated with a fair amount of
               precision. Known threats exist against the validity and reliability in any test
               (experimental and quasi-experimental) of a theory.

              Credibility – What is the expert's qualifications and stature in the scientific
               community? Does the technique rely upon the special skills and equipment of one
               expert, or can it be replicated by other experts elsewhere?

              Clarity – Can the technique and its results be explained with sufficient clarity and
               simplicity so that the court and the jury can understand its plain meaning? This
               criterion is implicitly assumed to be incorporated in Daubert.

       The procedures used to acquire evidence affect its admissibility. This applies as well to
       evidence acquired from mobile phones using forensic software tools [Mcc06]. Even outside of
       law enforcement investigations, evidence should be collected in a manner that is suitable for
       admissibility in court. It may not be obvious when an investigation is initiated, for example,
       when a computer security incident is first detected, that court action may ensue. Important
       evidence might be overlooked, improperly handled, or accidentally destroyed before the
       seriousness of the incident is realized.

4.3   Procedural Models

       The Electronic Crime Scene Investigation – A Guide for First Responders, produced by the
       U.S. Department of Justice [DOJ01], offers the following suggestions when approaching a
       digital crime scene.

              Securing and Evaluating the Scene – Steps should be taken to ensure the safety of
               individuals and to identify and protect the integrity of potential evidence.

              Documenting the Scene – Create a permanent record of the scene, accurately
               recording both digital-related and conventional evidence.

              Evidence Collection – Collect traditional and digital evidence in a manner that
               preserves their evidentiary value.


                                                  26
                                                           Guidelines on Cell Phone Forensics


       Packaging, Transportation, and Storage – Take adequate precautions when
        packaging, transporting, and storing evidence, maintaining chain of custody.

Incident Response [Man01], an “Incident Response Methodology” proposes the following
phases when encountering an incident or performing a digital investigation.

       Pre-incident preparation – Through training and education, gain an understanding
        on how to respond to an incident.

       Detection of incidents – Develop techniques on how to detect suspect activities.

       Initial Response – Confirm that an incident has occurred and obtain volatile
        evidence.

       Response strategy formulation – Respond to incident based upon knowledge of all
        known facts collected from the Initial Response phase.

       Duplication (forensic backups) – Based upon the scenario, either create a physical
        forensic image or do a live retrieval of evidence.

       Investigation – Determine what happened, who did it and how the incident can be
        prevented in the future.

       Security measure implementation – Apply security measures to isolate and contain
        infected systems.

       Network monitoring – Monitor network traffic for ongoing or additional attacks.

       Recovery – Restore the affected system to a secure, operational state.

       Reporting – Document all of the details and investigative steps taken throughout the
        incident.

       Follow-up – Learn from the incident by reviewing how and why it happened and
        make necessary adjustments.

Research conducted at the U.S. Air Force proposes the following steps when dealing with a
forensic investigation [Rei02].

       Identification – Recognize and determine the type of incident.

       Preparation – Prepare tools, techniques, search warrants, authorizations, and
        management approval.

       Approach Strategy – Maximize untainted evidence collection while minimizing the
        impact upon the victim.

       Preservation – Isolate, secure, and preserve the state of physical and digital evidence.

       Collection – Record the physical scene and duplicate digital evidence.


                                          27
                                                          Guidelines on Cell Phone Forensics


       Examination – Search for evidence relating to the suspected crime.

       Analysis – Determine significance, reconstruct fragments of data, and draw
        conclusions based on the evidence found. The Analysis phase may go through
        numerous iterations until a theory has been supported.

       Presentation – Summarize and provide an explanation of conclusions.

       Return Evidence – Ensure physical and digital property is returned to the proper
        owner.

Although developed primarily for computer systems, each of the above procedural models and
the evidential principles discussed contain important points that should be considered when
dealing with digital evidence on cell phones. Because every investigation is distinct with its
own unique set of circumstances, a single definitive procedural approach is difficult to
prescribe. Nevertheless, most models touch on the same key areas, though stressing different
aspects. The remaining chapters of this guide follow a simple framework of four topical areas:
obtaining an exhibit, making a forensic copy of its contents, obtaining evidence from the
forensic copy, and reporting on the evidence obtained and process used. They are respectively
referred to within this document as preservation, acquisition, examination and analysis, and
reporting.

5. Preservation

     Evidence preservation is the process of seizing suspect property without altering or changing
     the contents of data that reside on devices and removable media. It is the first step in digital
     evidence recovery. The chapter begins with a generic introduction to preservation, and then
     provides more specific guidance about cell phones.

     Preservation involves the search, recognition, documentation, and collection of electronic-
     based evidence. In order to use evidence successfully, whether in a court of law or a less
     formal proceeding, it must be preserved. Failure to preserve evidence in its original state could
     jeopardize an entire investigation, potentially losing valuable case-related information.

     The DOJ’s Electronic Crime Scene Investigation report covers this subject in detail [DOJ01].
     The guide offers principles, policies, and procedures to follow when encountering a digital
     evidence scene. The reader is directed to that report for additional information. The following
     is a summary of the key points to observe.

            Securing and Evaluating the Scene

                 Ensure the safety of all individuals at the scene.

                 Protect the integrity of traditional and electronic evidence.

                 Evaluate the scene and formulate a search plan.

                 Identify potential evidence.

                 Conduct interviews.

            Documenting the Scene

                 Create a permanent historical record of the scene.

                 Accurately record the location and condition of computers, storage media, other
                  digital devices, and conventional evidence.

                 Document the condition and location of the computer system, including power
                  status of the computer (on, off, or in sleep mode).

                 Identify and document related electronic components that will not be collected.

                 Photograph the entire scene to create a visual record as noted by the first
                  responder.

                                                      Guidelines on Cell Phone Forensics


   Collecting Evidence

       Handle computer evidence, whether physical or digital, in a manner that preserves
        its evidentiary value.

       Recover non-electronic evidence (e.g., written passwords, handwritten notes,
        blank pads of paper with indented writing, hardware and software manuals,
        calendars, literature, text or graphical computer printouts, and photographs).

   Packaging, Transporting, and Storing Evidence

       Take no actions to add, modify, or destroy data stored on a computer or other
        media.

       Avoid high temperatures and humidity, physical shock, static electricity, and
        magnetic sources.

       Maintain chain of custody of electronic evidence, documenting its packaging,
        transportation and storage.

           Packaging Procedure

               Properly document, label, and inventory evidence before packaging.

               Pack magnetic media in antistatic packaging (paper or antistatic plastic
                bags).

               Avoid folding, bending, or scratching computer media such as diskettes,
                CD-ROMs, removable media, etc.

               Properly label evidence containers.

           Transportation Procedure

               Avoid magnetic sources (e.g., radio transmitters, speaker magnets).

               Avoid conditions of excessive heat, cold, or humidity while in transit.

               Avoid shock and excessive vibrations.

           Storage Procedures

               Ensure evidence is inventoried in accordance with authoritative policies.

               Store evidence material in a secure area away from temperature and
                humidity extremes.

               Protect evidence material from magnetic sources, moisture, dust, and
                other harmful particles or contaminants.

       The Good Practice Guide for Computer Based Electronic Evidence [ACPO] suggests the
       following procedures when handling cell phones:

              Before handling, consider what other types of evidence, such as DNA or fingerprints,
               are needed from the phone and follow the appropriate handling procedures.

              Switching the phone off is advisable, because of the potential for loss of data if either
               the battery expires or network activity occurs, causing call logs or other recoverable
               data to be overwritten.

              If the phone remains on for some purpose, it should be kept charged and not tampered
               with, then switched off before transport.

              To prevent accidental operation in transit, the phone should be packaged in a rigid
               container, secured with support ties.

              The container should be placed into an evidence bag, sealed to restrict access, and the
               labeling procedures completed for the exhibit.

       The remaining sections of this chapter provide supplemental information related to cell
       phones, following the paradigm of Securing and Evaluating the Scene, Documenting the
       Scene, Collecting Evidence, and Packaging, Transporting, and Storing Evidence.

5.1   Securing and Evaluating the Scene

       Ensuring that the proper authorizations (e.g., a search warrant or consent from the owner) are
       in place is paramount for beginning an investigation. When searching a site, the team should
       proceed cautiously. Incorrect procedures or improper handling of a mobile phone during
       seizure can cause loss of digital evidence. Moreover, traditional forensic measures, such as
       fingerprints or DNA testing, may need to be applied to establish a link between a mobile phone
       and its owner or user, or for other reasons. If the device is not handled properly, physical
       evidence can be easily contaminated and rendered useless.

       Alertness to device characteristics and issues (e.g., memory volatility) and familiarity with
       associated accessories (e.g., media, cables, cradles, and power adapters) are essential. For cell
       phones, sources of evidence include the device, (U)SIM, and media. Associated peripherals,
       cables, cradles, power adapters, and other accessories are also of interest. The surrounding
       area and rooms, other than where a device is found, should be searched to ensure related
       evidence is not overlooked. To avoid unwanted interaction with devices found on the scene,
       consideration should be given to turning off wireless interfaces, such as Bluetooth and WiFi
       radios, on equipment brought into the search area.

       Equipment associated with the cell phone, such as removable media, (U)SIMs, or even
       personal computers possibly synched with it, may prove more valuable than the phone itself.
       Removable media varies from the size of a fingernail to that of a postage stamp, and can be
       easily hidden and difficult to find. Most often, removable memory cards are identifiable by
       their distinctive shape and the presence of pins, pin receptacles, or contacts located on their
       body, used to establish an electrical interface with the device.




                                                 31
                                                                                Guidelines on Cell Phone Forensics


       When interviewing the owner or user of a mobile device, consider requesting any security
       codes or passwords needed to gain access to its contents. For example, a PIN can be set on
       GSM phones and some of them also have lock codes that can be set in conjunction with or in
       lieu of the PIN. Suspects should never be allowed to handle mobile phones or other mobile
       devices. Many phones have master reset codes that clear the contents of the phone to the
       original factory conditions. Removing the battery can also cause the contents of some devices
       to be lost, such as certain smart phones.

       Phones may be found in a compromised state that can complicate seizure, such as immersed in
       a liquid. In the case of liquids, the battery should be removed to prevent electrical shorting.
       The remainder of the phone should be sealed in an appropriate container filled with the same
       liquid for transport to the lab, provided the liquid is not caustic. Some compromised states,
       such as blood contamination or use with explosives (i.e., as a bomb component) can pose a
       danger to the technician collecting evidence. In such situations, a specialist should be
       consulted for specific instructions or assistance, if doubt exists on how to proceed.11

       Mobile phones and associated media may be found in a damaged state, caused by accident or
       deliberate action. Devices or media with visible external damage do not necessarily prevent
       the extraction of data from them. Damaged equipment should be taken back to the lab for
       closer inspection. Repairing damaged components on a mobile phone and restoring the device
       to working order for examination and analysis may be possible. Undamaged memory
       components may also be removed from a damage device and their contents recovered
       independently.

       Legal advisors should be contacted for assistance, if needed, with the following two critical
       legal considerations [DOJ04]:

                Determining the extent of the authority to search and what additional legal process
                 may be necessary to continue the search (e.g., warrant, amended consent form), if
                 evidence is located that was not authorized in the original search authority.

                Identifying possible concerns related to applicable local policies and laws, and
                 International, Federal, or State statutes, such as the Electronic Communications
                 Privacy Act of 1986 (ECPA) and the Cable Communications Policy Act (CCPA).

5.2   Documenting the Scene

       Evidence must be accurately accounted for and identified. Non-electronic evidence such as
       invoices, manuals, and packaging material may provide useful information about the
       capabilities of the device, the network used, account information, and unlocking codes for the
       PIN. The labeling process should document the case number, a brief description, signature,
       and the date and time the evidence was collected. Photographing the crime scene in
       conjunction with documenting a report of the state of each digital device and computer
       encountered (personal computers may contain useful data that has not been synchronized with
       the owner’s mobile phone) can be helpful, particularly if questioned about the environment
       later [Kru01].

                                                                   Guidelines on Cell Phone Forensics


       A record of all visible data should be created. All digital devices, including mobile phones,
       which may store data, should be photographed along with all peripherals cables, cradles,
       power connectors, removable media, and connections. Avoid touching or contaminating the
       phone when photographing it and the environment where found. If the device’s display is in a
       viewable state, the screen’s contents should be photographed and, if necessary, recorded
       manually, capturing the time, service status, battery level, and other displayed icons. Other
       characteristics such as LED activity (e.g., blinking), physical condition, physical connectivity,
       or visible identifiers should also be noted. Having an individual in charge to perform evidence
       custodian duties at the scene, alongside a partner responsible for documentation of evidence, is
       desirable during the collection phase [Kru01].

       Actions taken on the system to view and record other volatile data not under display at the time
       can affect the state of the device. For example, launching an application on a smart phone can
       overwrite parts of memory. Furthermore, it risks activating Trojan horse code hidden within
       the application or accidentally hitting an incorrect key sequence, and causing unintended
       effects.

       The chain of custody procedure is a simple yet effective process of documenting the complete
       journey of evidence through the lifecycle of the case. Carefully maintaining the chain of
       custody not only protects the integrity of evidence, but also makes if difficult for someone to
       argue that the evidence was tampered with [Kru01]. The documentation should answer the
       following questions:

              Who collected it? (i.e., devices, media, associated peripherals, etc.)

              How and where? (i.e., how was the evidence collected and where was it located)

              Who took possession of it? (i.e., individual in charge of seizing evidence)

              How was it stored and protected in storage? (i.e., evidence-custodian procedures)

              Who took it out of storage and why? (i.e., on-going documentation of individual’s
               name and purpose for checking-out evidence)

       Documentation to all of the above questions must be maintained and filed in a secure location
       for current and future reference.

5.3   Collecting the Evidence

       The Mobile Phone Forensics Sub-Group of the Interpol European Working Party on IT Crime
       has identified how the ACPO Principles of Evidence apply to seizure of mobile phones
       [INT06]. Some key implications for proper collection are summarized below.

       Isolating the phone from other devices used for data synchronization is important to keep new
       data from contaminating existing data. If the device is found in a cradle or connected with a
       computer via a cable, pulling the plug from the back of the computer eliminates data transfer or
       synchronization overwrites. The phone should be seized along with the cradles and cables
       found. Media cards, (U)SIMs, and other hardware residing in the phone should not be
       removed. Also, seizing the computer that was connected to the phone allows the possibility to
       acquire synchronized data from the hard disk that might not be obtained from the phone. Any


                                                 33
                                                                       Guidelines on Cell Phone Forensics


associated hardware such as media cards, (U)SIMs, power adapters, device sleeves, or
peripherals, should be seized along with related materials such as product manuals, packaging,
and software.

Isolating the phone from the radio network is important to keep new traffic, such as SMS
messages, from overwriting existing data, if the phone is turned on when found. Besides the
risk of overwriting potential evidence, the question may arise whether data received on the
phone after seizure is within the scope of the original authority granted. Add-on programs,
such as LockMe12 and OmaiProtect13 , are also available that enable the phone lock to be set
remotely upon receipt of a properly formatted message. Moreover, vulnerabilities may exist
that can be exploited. For example, a malformed message sent to a Nokia 6210 phone has
been shown to disable it completely, much like the a malformed ICMP packet known as the
“ping of death” did to older Windows computers [Ley01].

Two basic methods for isolating the phone from radio communication and preventing these
problems are to “Turn (the) device off at the point of seizure” or to “Place (the) device in a
shielded container/bag” [INT06]. Alternatively, if the device has an “Airplane Mode”
function, the setting could be enabled [Bur02]. Each method has certain drawbacks, however.

           Turning off the phone may activate authentication codes (e.g., SIM PIN and/or
            handset security codes), which are then required to gain access to the device,
            complicating acquisition and delaying examination.

           Keeping the phone on, but radio isolated, hastens battery life due to increased power
            consumption as it tries unsuccessfully to connect to a network, raising its signal
            strength to the maximum. After some period, failure to connect to the network may
            cause certain phones to reset or clear network data that otherwise would be useful if
            recovered [Smi05]. Containers attenuate the radio signal, but not necessarily
            eliminate it completely, allowing the possibility of communications being established
            with a cell tower, if in its immediate vicinity. The risk of improperly sealing the radio
            isolation container and unknowingly allowing access to the cell network also exists.

           Enabling “Airplane Mode” requires interaction with the phone via the keypad, which
            poses some risk – less so, if the technician is familiar with the device in question and
            documents the actions taken (e.g., on paper or on video).

If user data resides in battery-dependent volatile memory, expiration of the battery would be
disastrous. Before collecting such a mobile phone, the power state must be considered. For
example, the device may be fully charged, receiving power from a charger or cradle plugged
into an outlet, or extremely low on battery power. Steps must be taken to maintain the battery
level at an appropriate level until a successful acquisition takes place. This may be especially
challenging if the device needs to be radio isolated, requiring it to be placed in the container
together with a portable source of supplemental power (e.g., a disposable charger such as

cellboost14 or a battery-powered charger15 ), after full charging. If sufficient power cannot be
supplied, consideration should be given to switching off the phone to preserve battery life,
documenting the current device state and noting the time and date of the shutdown.

Charging may also be required post-examination, if reexamination of the original device is
anticipated due to expected challenges to the results of the initial examination. Otherwise,
replication of results cannot be achieved once battery depletion causes loss of volatile memory
content. Even when the phone is isolated, content changes may occur on an active device that
could be undesirable, such as the execution of a scheduled script that purges old data.

To conserve power, some smart phones are normally configured to enter energy savings mode
and shut off the display after a short period of inactivity. Some phones also shut themselves
off if the battery level drops below a certain threshold to protect data stored in volatile
memory, which defeats the original purpose of keeping it turned on. Keeping a device in the
active state is troublesome, requiring periodic interaction with the device. Anecdotal evidence
suggests that built-in and add-on protections, such as user authentication and content
encryption, are not employed for the vast majority of phones seized. If additional power
cannot be supplied to a device and it is turned off to conserve power and preserve memory
contents, the risk of encountering a protection mechanism when turned on again should overall
be low. Moreover, authentication mechanisms, such as passwords, typically cannot be
deactivated without first satisfying the mechanism (e.g., supplying the correct password). For
these reasons, procedures for some organizations may recommend turning off certain classes
of phones, if found powered on.

“A small number of mobile communication devices … use alkaline batteries as a power
source. Consideration should be given to replacing the batteries prior to transit to minimize the
risk of data loss due to complete battery discharge before the device reaches the examination
unit [INT06].” Some smart phones use rechargeable batteries that are replaceable, and a fully
charged replacement battery can be substituted, if available. Such phones keep a small charge
to the device to maintain volatile data for a short amount of time during battery replacement.
To prevent loss of volatile data, batteries must be replaced quickly.

The time maintained on the phone may be set independently of that from the network. Always
record the date and time shown on the handset, if it is turned on, and compare them with a
reference clock, noting any inconsistencies. If the screen is dim due to power management, it
may be necessary to press an insignificant key such as the volume key to light the screen.
When preparing the packing labels, be sure to record the manufacturer and model of the seized
equipment, and also its condition. The make and model may be branded on the body of the
handset and also appear in the interior of the handset under the battery. However, do not
remove the battery to read this information, if the phone is on.

Caution should be exercised when handling a phone suspected of being modified, especially if
the modifications are presumed to be done by a security-minded individual or organization.
Certain types of modifications to the software applications and operating system of the device

       might affect the way it is handled. The following is a list of examples of some classes of
       modifications to consider:

                   Security Enhancements – Organizations and individuals may enhance their
                    handheld devices with add-on security mechanisms. A variety of visual login,
                    biometric, and token-based authentication mechanisms are available for smart phones
                    to use as replacements or supplements to password mechanisms. Improper interaction
                    with a mechanism could cause the device to lock down and even destroy its contents.
                    This is particularly a concern with mechanisms that use security tokens whose
                    presence is constantly monitored and whose disconnection from a card slot or other
                    device interface is immediately acted upon.

                   Malicious Programs – A phone may contain a virus or other malicious software.
                    Such malware16 may attempt to spread to other devices over wired or wireless
                    interfaces, including cross platform jumps to completely different platforms such as
                    Windows computers. Common utilities or functions may also be intentionally
                    replaced with versions that contain software designed to alter or damage data present
                    on a phone. Such Trojan-bearing programs could conditionally be activated or
                    suppressed based on conditions such as input parameters or hardware key interrupts.
                    Watchdog applications could also be written to listen for specific events (e.g., key
                    cords or over the air messages) and carry out actions such as wiping the device clean.

                   Key Remapping – Hardware keys may be remapped to perform a different function
                    than the default. A key press or combination of key presses intended for one purpose
                    could launch an arbitrary program.

5.4   Packaging, Transporting, and Storing Evidence

       Once the device is ready to be seized, the forensic specialist should seal the device in a static
       proof bag and tag it. The individual who seizes the device must sign and date the tag to initiate
       a chain of custody. The device should be secured properly to prevent keys from being pressed
       accidentally (e.g., turning the device on) when in the evidence bag. Hard containers are
       manufactured specifically for this purpose and are recommended for use.17 Radio frequency
       isolation bags are also available for attenuating a device’s radio signal and should be used with
       phones left on. An independent external power charger may be connected and placed in the
       bag with the device to keep the power level full during transit. Phones with volatile memory
       resident user data, which are left off, turned off, or in “Airplane Mode,” may be packaged to
       allow a power adaptor to be connected to the device through a hole in the evidence bag to keep
       the power level high. Rechargeable devices can usually be powered through a compatible
       cigarette-lighter adapter cable to keep charge to the device while in transit. If a power adapter
       is used in conjunction with a radio frequency isolation bag, the cable must be properly shielded
       to prevent it from serving as an antenna and nullifying the effect of the isolation bag.

       Digital devices are fragile and easily damaged. When a device is transported, it should be
       handled carefully and adequately protected from shock, breakage, and extreme temperature.
       Due to the volatile nature of some smart phones, they should immediately be checked into a

forensic laboratory to be processed and the evidence custodian should be made aware of the
situation regarding power requirements. Battery powered devices held in storage for more
than a few days risk power depletion and data loss, unless a process is in place to avoid this
outcome.

Storage facilities that hold evidence should provide a cool, dry environment appropriate for
valuable electronic equipment. All evidence should be in sealed containers, in a secure area
with controlled access.

6. Acquisition

     Acquisition is the process of imaging or otherwise obtaining information from a digital device
     and its peripheral equipment and media. Performing acquisition at the scene has the advantage
     that loss of information due to battery depletion, damage, etc. during transportation and storage
     is avoided. However, finding a controlled setting in which to work, having the appropriate
     equipment, and satisfying other prerequisites may not be possible at the scene, but readily
     achievable within a laboratory setting. For the purpose of discussion, a laboratory
     environment is assumed throughout this chapter. Powered on devices should be handled with
     caution in a radio frequency shielded work area or have their wireless communications
     disabled by some other means.


         Radio Isolation Techniques: A number of techniques exist for isolating a mobile phone from
         cell tower communications [INT06]. Because communications are blocked, the handset
         continues increasing its signal strength up to the maximum as it continually attempts to make
         contact. This activity significantly shortens battery life. The device should be fully charged prior to
         examination and consideration should be given to having a fixed or portable power source
         attached.

         Use a jamming or spoofing device - Emitting a signal stronger than a cell phone’s or interfering
         with the signal can render a cell phone useless. Another technique involves tricking the phone
         into thinking a “no service” signal is coming from the nearest cell tower. Because such devices
         can affect communications in the surrounding public airspace beyond the examination area, they
         are illegal in many countries. [Wyl00, NIJ05]

         Use a shielded work area - Shielding an entire work area can be an expensive but effective way
         to conduct examinations safely in a fixed location. A “Faraday tent” is a cheaper alternative that
         also allows portability. Feeding cables into the tent is problematic, however, since without proper
         isolation they can behave as an antenna, defeating the purpose of the tent. The work space can
         also be very restrictive.

         Use a shielded container - A portable shielded container can allow examinations to be conducted
         safely once the phone is situated inside. Cables into the box must be fully isolated to prevent
         network communications from occurring.

         Use a substitute (U)SIM - A substitute (U)SIM mimics the identity of the original and prevents
         network access by the handset. Such cards trick the handset into accepting them as the original
         (U)SIM. The technique allows examinations to be conducted safely at any location.

         Arrange for the network service to be disabled - The cellular carrier providing service to the device
         might be induced to disable service. The service provider or network operator must be
         determined and contacted with details identifying the service to be disabled (e.g., the equipment
         identifier, subscriber identifier, phone number). Such information is not always readily available,
         however, and the coordination and confirmation process also imposes delay.



     Acquisition should occur at a forensics laboratory once the seized equipment has arrived and
     been checked in. The forensic examination begins with the identification of the device. The
     type of device, its operating system, and other characteristics determine the route to take in
     creating a forensic copy of the contents of the device. Only a few forensic software tools
     currently exist that image certain types of phones, and no single tool presently handles the full

                                                                            Guidelines on Cell Phone Forensics


       range of phones on the market [Aye05, Aye07]. The type of phone under examination,
       therefore, generally dictates which tools to use in an investigation.

6.1   Device Identification

       To proceed effectively, devices need to be identified by the make, model, and service provider.
       This information allows examiners to select the appropriate tools for acquisition. Individuals
       may attempt to thwart specialists by altering the device to conceal its true identity. Device
       alteration could range from removing manufacturer labels to filing off logos. In addition, the
       operating system and applications may be modified or in rare situations completely replaced,
       and appear differently as well as behave differently than expected. For example, removing or
       replacing splash screens is a widely discussed modification in phone forums.

       If the phone is powered on, the information appearing on the display can sometimes help
       identify the type of phone. For example, the manufacturer’s or service provider’s name may
       appear on the display, or the screen layout may indicate the family of operating system used.
       Information such as the manufacturer’s label may be found in the battery cavity (e.g., Make,
       Model, IMEI, or ESN). Removing the battery from the cavity of a phone, even when powered
       off, can affect its state, particularly the contents of volatile memory. Most phones keep user
       data in non-volatile memory, however, with the exception of certain smart phones. If the
       phone is powered on, battery removal will power it off, possibly causing an authentication
       mechanism to trigger when again powered on.

       Other clues that allow identification of a device include such things as manufacturer logos,
       serial numbers, the cradle, and power adapter. Overall, knowing the make and model helps to
       limit the potential service providers, by differentiating the type of network the device operates
       over (i.e., GSM, non-GSM), and vice versa. Synchronization software discovered on an
       associated computer also helps to differentiate among operating system families. Further
       means of identification include the following areas:

                Device Characteristics – The make and manufacturer of a phone can sometimes be
                 identified by its observable characteristics (e.g., weight, dimensions, and form factor),
                 particularly if unique design elements exist. Various Web sites contain databases of
                 phones that can be queried based on selected attributes to identify a particular device
                 and obtain its specifications and features.18 Coverage is considerable, but not
                 extensive or complete, and may require consulting more than one repository before
                 making a match.

                Device Interface – The power connector is often specific to a manufacturer and a
                 reliable aid to identification. With familiarization and experience, the manufacturers
                 of certain devices can be readily identified. Similarly, the size, number of contacts,
                 and shape of the data cable interface of a phone used to create a connection to a host
                 computer are often specific to a particular manufacturer and may prove helpful in




       18
          Several examples of such Web sites include the following: http://www.phonescoop.com/phones/finder.php,
       http://www.gsmarena.com/search.php3, and http://mobile.softpedia.com/phoneFinder.

             identification.19 Unfortunately, the available databases for these interfaces lack the
             broad coverage to be of assistance.

            Device Label – For phones powered off, information obtained from within the battery
             cavity can be revealing, particularly when coupled with an appropriate database. The
             manufacturer’s label often lists the make and model number of the phone and also
             unique identifiers, such as the Federal Communications Commission Identification
             Number (FCC ID) and an equipment identifier (IMEI or ESN). The FCC and
             equipment identifiers can be found on cell phones sold in the U.S. domestic market.

             For GSM or other (U)SIM bearing phones, the (U)SIM is usually located under the
             battery and is typically imprinted with a unique identifier called the Integrated Circuit
             Card Identification (ICCID). For powered on GSM and UMTS phones, the
             International Mobile Equipment Identifier (IMEI) can be obtained by keying in
             *#06#. Similar codes exist for obtaining the Electronic Serial Number (ESN) from
             powered on CDMA phones. Various sites on the Internet offer databases for querying
             the identifier and providing information about the device.

                 The IMEI is a 15-digit number that indicates the manufacturer, model type, and
                  country of approval for GSM devices. The initial 8-digit portion of the IMEI,
                  known as the Type Allocation Code (TAC), gives the model and origin. The
                  remainder of the IMEI is manufacturer specific, with a check digit at the end
                  [GSM04]. A database lookup service is available from the GSM numbering plan
                  Web site.20

                 The ESN is a unique 32-bit identifier recorded on a secure chip in a mobile phone
                  by the manufacturer. The first 8-14 bits identify the manufacturer and the
                  remaining bits the assigned serial number. Many phones have codes that can be
                  input into the handset to display the ESN. Hidden menus can also be activated on
                  certain phones by placing them in “test mode” through the input of a code.
                  Besides the ESN, other useful information such as the phone number of the
                  device can be obtained. Manufacturer codes can be checked on-line at the
                  Telecommunications Industry Association Web site.21

                 The ICCID of the (U)SIM can be up to 20 digits long. It consists of an industry
                  identifier prefix (89 for telecommunications), followed by a country code, an
                  issuer identifier number, and an individual account identification number
                  [ITU06]. The country and network operator name can be determined by the
                  ICCID. If the ICCID does not appear on the (U)SIM, it can always be obtained
                  with a (U)SIM acquisition tool. The GSM numbering plan Web site supports
                  ICCID queries for this information22 .

                        The first 3 characters of the FCC ID are the company code; the next 14 are the
                         product code. The FCC provides a database lookup service that can be used to
                         identify a device manufacturer and retrieve information about the phone,
                         including photos, user manual, and radio frequency test results.23

                   Reverse Lookup – If the telephone number of the phone is known, a reverse lookup
                    can be used to identify the network operator (e.g., Cingular) and the originating city
                    and state (e.g., Washington D.C.). For example, FoneFinder is a service to obtain
                    such information by inputting the user’s area code, three-digit prefix, and the seventh
                    digit of the phone number.24 The network operator’s Web site typically contains lists
                    of supported phones that can be used to narrow down and possible identify the phone
                    in question. Because phone numbers can be ported among service providers, in many
                    situations more up-to-date information is needed. The Number Portability
                    Administration Center (NPAC) provides an automated phone system for law
                    enforcement agencies to determine the current service provider assigned to a number
                    and obtain contact information.25 The service covers both U.S. and Canadian phone
                    numbers.

6.2   Tool Selection and Expectations

       Once the make and model of the phone are known, available manuals can be retrieved and
       studied. The manufacturer’s Web site is a good place to begin. Typing the model number
       into Google or another search engine can also reveal a significant amount of information about
       the device. As mentioned earlier, the device being acquired largely dictates the choice of
       forensic tools. The following criteria have been suggested as a fundamental set of
       requirements for forensic tools [Car02], and should be considered when a choice of tools is
       available:

                   Usability – the ability to present data in a form that is useful to an investigator

                   Comprehensive – the ability to present all data to an investigator so that both
                    inculpatory and exculpatory evidence can be identified

                   Accuracy – the quality that the output of the tool has been verified and a margin of
                    error ascertained

                   Deterministic – the ability for the tool to produce the same output when given the
                    same set of instructions and input data

                   Verifiable – the ability to ensure accuracy of the output by having access to
                    intermediate translation and presentation results

                                                                  Guidelines on Cell Phone Forensics


       Other factors in choosing among software tools include the Daubert considerations mentioned
       earlier in section 4.2 (particularly Acceptance) and the following items:

              Quality – technical support, reliability, and upgrade version path

              Capability – supported feature set, performance, and richness of features with regard
               to flexibility and customization

              Affordability – cost versus benefits in productivity

       Experimenting with various tools on test devices to find out which acquisition tools work
       efficiently with particular device types is highly recommended. Besides gaining familiarity
       with the capabilities of the tool, experimentation allows special purpose search filters and
       custom configurations to be set up before use in an actual case. In addition, any needed
       software updates from the manufacturer can be installed.

       Established procedures should guide the technical process of acquisition, as well as the
       examination of evidence. New circumstances can arise sporadically that require adjustment to
       existing procedures, and in some situations require new procedures and methods be devised.
       Recent examples include (U)SIMs being permanently bonded into the handset of certain
       phones, handsets that are capable of supporting two (U)SIMS, and phones that block logical
       acquisition ports until a connection is made with a cell tower. Procedures must be tested to
       ensure that the results obtained are valid and independently reproducible. The development
       and validation of the procedures should be documented and include the following steps
       [DOJ04]:

              Identifying the task or problem

              Proposing possible solutions

              Testing each solution on an identical test device and under known control conditions

              Evaluating the results of the test

              Finalizing the procedure

6.3   Memory Considerations

       A mobile phone contains various types of volatile and non-volatile memory over which several
       general categories of data can reside: storage for the operating system code, including the
       kernel, device drivers, and system libraries; memory for executing operating system
       applications and for storing and executing user applications loaded onto the device; and user
       storage for various kinds of text, image, audio, video, and other data files, including PIM
       application data. The structure of phone memory may be partitioned into fixed areas for
       certain data, such as phonebook entries, calendar entries, call logs, and SMS messages, or
       assigned dynamically from a common shared pool of memory. Memory may also be
       structured more rigorously as a formatted file system.

       The type of memory in which each category of data is stored and the memory structure
       employed vary among manufacturers and often are based on the characteristics of the


                                                    42
                                                          Guidelines on Cell Phone Forensics


operating system used. Even for a given model of phone, data storage location assignments
can vary somewhat between subsidized phones supplied by different network carriers,
depending on the adaptations made for the carriers by the manufacturer. Firmware updates
sent out by a network carrier can also affect data locations [Vam07].

Figure 4 illustrates the most typical arrangement in which user files reside in non-volatile
memory, such as Flash ROM or possibly a micro hard drive, along with the operating system
code. Since the storage is persistent, the contents are unaffected by complete power drainage.
Volatile memory is used for dynamic storage and its contents are lost when power is drained
from the phone.




                               Figure 4: Storage Assignments

A common alternative memory arrangement, used mainly in smart phones that have a PDA
heritage, is shown in Figure 5. Volatile memory is used for dynamic storage and user file
storage. Non-volatile memory is used mainly to hold the operating system code, and possibly
PIM data or files backed up from volatile memory by the user. Completely draining power
from the phone clears the contents of volatile memory, while non-volatile memory is
unaffected.




                         Figure 5: Alternative Storage Assignments

A (U)SIM is similar to a mobile phone insofar as it has both volatile and non-volatile memory
that can contain the same general categories of data as found in a mobile phone. It can be
thought of as a trusted sub-processor that interfaces to a phone and draws power from it. The
file system of a SIM resides in nonvolatile memory and is organized as a hierarchical tree
structure, composed of three types of elements: the root of the file system (MF), subordinate

                                                                   Guidelines on Cell Phone Forensics


       directory files (DF), and files containing elementary data (EF). Figure 6 illustrates the
       structure of the file system. The EFs under DFGSM and DFDCS1800 contain mainly network
       related information for different frequency bands of operation. The EFs under DFTELECOM
       contain service related information.




                                          Figure 6: SIM File System

       Various types of digital evidence can exist in elementary data files scattered throughout the file
       system and be recovered from a (U)SIM. Some of the same information held in the (U)SIM
       may be maintained in the memory of the mobile phone and encountered there as well. Besides
       the standard files defined in the GSM specifications, a (U)SIM may contain non-standard files
       established by the network operator [Cas06]. Several general categories of evidence that can
       be found in standard elementary data files are as follows [Jan06]:

              Service-related Information, including unique identifiers for the (U)SIM, the
               Integrated Circuit Card Identification (ICCID), and the subscriber, the International
               Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI)

              Phonebook and Call Information, known respectively as the Abbreviated Dialling
               Numbers (ADN) and Last Numbers Dialled (LND)

              Messaging Information, including both Short Message Service (SMS) textual
               messages and Enhanced Messaging Service (EMS) simple multimedia messages.

              Location Information, including Location Area Information (LAI) for voice
               communications and Routing Area Information (RAI) for data communications

6.4   Unobstructed Devices

       An unobstructed device refers to a device that does not require a password or other
       authentication technique to be satisfied to gain access to the device and perform an acquisition.
       Anecdotally, most devices seized in investigations appear to fall into this category.
       Unobstructed devices include mainly CDMA phones, freestanding (U)SIMs, and GSM phones
       containing a (U)SIM. A GSM phone that contains no (U)SIM is considered to be an
       “Obstructed Device,” discussed later in this chapter. Depending on the type of the phone,
       potential evidence, particularly user data, may reside in either the volatile or non-volatile

                                                  44
                                                                    Guidelines on Cell Phone Forensics


        memory, and must be handled accordingly. While the recoverable memory of (U)SIMs is
        non-volatile and in and of itself not a concern when found freestanding, their insertion and
        removal from a GSM mobile phone has forensic implications on the contents of the phone that
        must be taken into account.

        To preserve the integrity of the data, examiners should handle the original evidence as little as
        possible. Generally, it is recommended to create a “master” forensic copy of the device case
        file first, which is kept completely pristine. The master copy is then used to create additional
        mirror images needed for analysis and examination of evidence [Gas03]. A strong one-way
        cryptographic hash (e.g., SHA1) should be performed to ensure that the additional images
        created from the master copy are identical.

6.4.1   Mobile Phone Acquisition

        Often phones are submitted for laboratory processing with only specific items requested for
        recovery, such as phone call logs or images. If any doubt or concerns exist about the requested
        data, contacting the person who initiated the examination for clarification is recommended.
        Though it is not always necessary to recover all available data, a complete acquisition avoids
        having to redo the process later, if other data is needed, and the possibility that technical
        problems may arise on a later attempt.

        To acquire data from a phone, a connection must be established to the device from the forensic
        workstation. Before performing an acquisition, the version of the tool being used should be
        documented, along with any applicable patches or errata from the manufacturer applied to the
        tool. As mentioned earlier, caution should be taken to avoid altering the state of a mobile
        phone when handling it, for example, by pressing keys that could potentially corrupt or erase
        evidence. Once the connection has been established, the forensic software suite can proceed to
        acquire data from the device. Appendix C gives an overview of the steps involved in an
        acquisition. They entail selecting a connection, identifying the device to be acquired,
        identifying the data to be recovered, and viewing the recovered data.

        Acquiring a device’s contents logically, the prevailing technique used by present day forensic
        tools, requires the device to be switched on. This effectively means that the first evidentiary
        principle mentioned in section 4.2 – actions taken should not modify data contained on the
        device – cannot be complied with, strictly speaking. Therefore, the goal during acquisition is
        to affect memory contents as little as possible and then only with the knowledge of what is
        occurring internally, relying more on adherence to the second and third evidentiary principles
        that respectively emphasize high competence of the specialist and the capture of a detailed
        audit trail of the actions taken [ACPO].

        The date and time maintained on the mobile phone is an important piece of information. The
        date and time may be obtained from the network or manually set by the user. Suspects may
        manually set the day or time to a completely different value from the actual one to leave
        misleading values in the call and message records found on the phone. If the phone was on
        when seized, the date and time maintained and differences from a reference clock should have
        already been recorded, as mentioned earlier. Nevertheless, confirmation at acquisition may
        prove useful. If the phone was off when seized, the date and time maintained and differences
        from a reference clock should be recorded immediately when first turned on in the laboratory.
        Note that actions taken during acquisition, such as removal of the battery to view the device
        label, may affect the time value maintained.


                                                  45
                                                                    Guidelines on Cell Phone Forensics


        Unlike desktop machines or network servers, only a few phones have a hard disk and rely
        instead completely on semiconductor memory. Specialized software exists for performing a
        logical acquisition of PIM data and, for certain phones, producing a physical image. However,
        the contents of a phone are typically dynamic and continually changing. Two back-to-back
        acquisitions of a device using the same tool may produce different results overall (e.g., if
        memory compaction occurs), though the majority of information, such as PIM data, remains
        unchanged.

        Increasingly, mobile phones come with a built-in slot for some family of memory cards.
        Forensic tools that acquire the contents of a resident memory card normally perform a logical
        acquisition. To recover deleted data that might reside on the memory card, a direct acquisition
        can be performed on it after the contents of the mobile phone have been successfully acquired.
        With either type of acquisition, the forensic tool may or may not have the capability to decode
        recovered phone data stored on the card (e.g., SMS text messages), requiring additional
        manual steps to be taken.

        After an acquisition is finished, the forensic specialist should always confirm that the contents
        of a device were captured correctly. On occasion, a tool may fail its task without any error
        notification and require the specialist to reattempt acquisition with the same tool or another
        tool. Similarly, some tools do not work as well with certain devices as others do, and may fail
        with an error notification. Thus, where possible, it is advisable to have multiple tools available
        and be prepared to switch to another if difficulties occur with the initial tool.

        Invariably, not all relevant data viewable on a phone using the available menus can be captured
        through a logical acquisition. For example, draft and archived messages are sometimes not
        recovered by forensic tools. Manually scrutinizing the contents via the phone interface menus
        while video recording the process not only allows such items to be captured and reported, but
        also confirms that the contents reported by the tool are consistent with observable data.
        Manual acquisition must always be done with care, preserving the integrity of the device in
        case further, more elaborate acquisitions need to be conducted.

        The contents of a phone’s memory often contain information, such as deleted data, that is not
        recoverable through either a logical acquisition or a manual examination. Lacking a software
        tool able to perform a physical acquisition, it may be necessary to turn to a hardware-based
        technique. Two techniques commonly used for non-volatile memory are acquisition through a
        standardized Joint Test Action Group (JTAG) test interface, if supported on the device, and
        acquisition by directly reading memory that has been removed from the device [Will05]. The
        techniques are discussed in a bit more detail in section 6.5.3, under Hardware Base Methods.

6.4.2   GSM Phone Considerations

        CDMA phones and other mobile phones that do not use an identity module are relatively
        straightforward insofar as the acquisition entails a single device. The considerations described
        above are the main considerations to be addressed. GSM phones on the other hand are slightly
        more complex because of the handset/(U)SIM partitioning of the phone. Depending on the
        type of phone, whether it is on or off, and other conditions, the phone and (U)SIM could be
        acquired jointly or separately.

        If the mobile phone is active, a joint acquisition of the handset and (U)SIM contents should be
        carried out before the (U)SIM is acquired directly. A direct acquisition recovers deleted


                                                   46
                                                                   Guidelines on Cell Phone Forensics


        messages present on a (U)SIM, while an indirect acquisition via the handset does not. The
        SIM must be removed from the phone and inserted into an appropriate reader for direct
        acquisition. One reason for this sequence is that removal of the (U)SIM, which is typically
        located beneath the battery, can result in the loss of non-volatile memory due to the power
        disruption. Additionally, the fact that the device was kept in an active state when seized may
        be an indication that some concern exists about triggering authentication or some other
        security mechanism if power is lost.

        A well-known forensic issue that arises when following this sequence is that the reported status
        of unread SMS text messages is inconsistent between each (U)SIM acquisition – the first one
        declaring it to be unread, while the second one read. Reading an unread SMS message from a
        (U)SIM indirectly through the handset causes the operating system of the phone to change the
        status accordingly. Had the (U)SIM been read directly by a tool, no change in status would
        occur. One way to avoid the inconsistency is to omit selecting the recovery of (U)SIM-
        resident SMS text messages when performing the joint acquisition, if the tool allows such an
        option.

        If the mobile phone is inactive, the contents of the (U)SIM may be acquired independently
        before that of the handset. The (U)SIM acquisition should be done directly through a (U)SIM
        reader. The handset acquisition should be attempted without the (U)SIM present. Many
        phones permit an acquisition under such conditions, allowing PIN entry for the (U)SIM to be
        bypassed, if it were enabled. If the acquisition attempt is unsuccessful, the (U)SIM can be
        reinserted and a second attempt made. Performing separate independent acquisitions (i.e.,
        acquiring the (U)SIM before acquiring the contents of the handset) avoids any operating
        system-related forensic issues associated with an indirect read of (U)SIM data. However,
        removing the SIM can reportedly cause data to be deleted on some phones [Goo03]. In
        addition, if removing the battery is required to gain access to the SIM, a loss of the date and
        time values can occur in certain phones [Mel04]. Similarly, when the battery is removed from
        certain smart phones, the user data present in volatile memory can be lost if a second backup
        battery is not built-in to support battery replacement or cannot maintain volatile memory for a
        sufficient time. In situations where lost data can occur, the acquisition sequence described at
        the beginning of this section for active phones should be followed.

6.4.3   (U)SIMs

        Similar to a mobile phone, to acquire data from a (U)SIM, a connection must be established
        from the forensic workstation to the device, using a reader. As before, the version of the tool
        being used should be documented, along with any applicable patches or errata from the
        manufacturer applied to the tool. Once the connection has been established, the forensic
        software tool can proceed to acquire data from the device.

        Capturing a direct image of the (U)SIM data is not possible because of the protection
        mechanisms built into the module. Instead, forensic tools send command directives called
        Application Protocol Data Units (APDUs) to the (U)SIM to extract data logically, without
        modification, from each elementary data file of the file system. The APDU protocol is a
        simple command-response exchange. Each element of the file system defined in the GSM
        standards has a unique numeric identifier assigned, which can be used to walk through the file
        system and recover data by referencing an element and performing some operation, such as
        reading its contents.



                                                  47
                                                                                 Guidelines on Cell Phone Forensics


       Because (U)SIMs are highly standardized devices, few issues exist with regard to a logical
       acquisition. The main consideration is selecting a tool that reports the status of any PINs and
       recovers the data of interest. Vast differences exist in the data recovered by (U)SIM tools, with
       some recovering only the data thought to have the highest relevance in a typical investigation,
       and others performing a complete recovery of all data, even though much of it is network
       related with little investigative value.

6.5   Obstructed Devices

       Obstructed devices typically refer to devices that are shut off and require successful
       authentication using a password or some other means to gain access. Common obstructed
       devices include mobile phones with missing identity modules, with PIN-enabled identity
       modules, or with an enabled phone lock setting. Password locked memory cards are beginning
       to emerge as the capability to set such locks appears in more phones. Content encryption
       capabilities are currently not offered as a standard feature in most cell phones, but may be
       available through an add-on application.

       A number of ways exist to recover data from obstructed devices. They fall into three classes:
       investigative, software-based, and hardware-based methods. Experimenting with a seized
       device to bypass or overcome its security mechanisms should be avoided and instead done
       with a test device of the same make, model, and version of software. Seemingly simple
       actions can cause the device to lock permanently or lose data, making evidence recovery more
       difficult or impossible. PIN and password-protected devices may require the expertise of a
       specially trained forensic specialist to gain access to the device contents in a forensically sound
       manner, once conventional techniques have been exhausted. Preserving the contents of the
       device when conventional techniques are applied is vital to allow more sophisticated
       techniques to succeed.

       Software and hardware-based methods are often directed at a particular device or narrow class
       of device, as are some investigative methods. In developing a method, the following actions
       should be considered for determining possible approaches:

                   Contacting the device manufacturer and service provider for information on known
                    backdoors and vulnerabilities that might be exploited.

                   Reviewing manufacturer specifications and other documentation when formulating
                    plausible approaches.

                   Contacting commercial evidence recovery professionals that specialize in handheld
                    devices.

                   Searching Internet sites for developer, hacker, and security exploit information.

                   Contacting device maintenance and repair companies, as well as commercial
                    organizations that provide architecture information on handheld device products.26

                                                                   Guidelines on Cell Phone Forensics


6.5.1   Investigative Methods

        Investigative methods are procedures the investigative team can apply, which require no
        forensic software or hardware tools. The most obvious methods are the following:

               Ask the suspect – If a device is protected with a password, PIN, token, or other
                authentication mechanism involving knowledge-based authentication, the suspect can
                be queried for this information during the initial interview.

               Review seized material – Passwords or PINs may be written down on a slip of paper
                and kept with or near the phone, at a desktop computer used to synchronize with the
                phone, or on the suspect’s person, such as within a wallet, and may be recovered
                through visual inspection. Packaging material for a (U)SIM or a GSM phone may
                disclose a PIN unlocking key (PUK) that can be used to reset the value of the PIN.

               Manually supply commonly used input – Users may weaken a mechanism by the
                way in which it is used. For example, if the (U)SIM of a mobile phone requires a 4-
                digit PIN, an examiner may wish to try a commonly used PIN combination (e.g.,1-2-
                3-4, 0-0-0-0, etc.), as one of the three attempts allowed before the device is completely
                locked down [Kni02]. Most (U)SIM tools, but not all, report the remaining number of
                attempts.

               Ask the service provider – If a GSM mobile phone is protected with a PIN-enabled
                (U)SIM, the SIM’s identifier (i.e., the ICCID) can be obtained from it and used to
                request the PUK from the service provider and reset the PIN. Some service providers
                offer the ability to retrieve the PUK on-line, by entering the telephone number of the
                phone and certain subscriber information into public web pages set up for this
                purpose.

               Exploit possible insecure settings – Some models of phones may easily yield access
                because of common user configuration errors. For example, certain Motorola phones
                provide a two-level access mechanism that can be enabled on the handset: a phone
                lock needed to gain access to the device and a security code needed to reset the phone
                lock in case it is forgotten. A user may set the phone lock, but not change the security
                code from its default value, allowing anyone to gain access using the default security
                code value to reset or disable the phone lock.

6.5.2   Software-based Methods

        Software-based methods involve software techniques used to break or bypass authentication
        mechanisms. While some general-purpose software techniques and tools may apply to a class
        of mobile phones, most of the techniques are specialized for a specific model within a class.
        When a specialized technique is developed, it is normally programmed and tested on an
        identical test device. Software-based methods include the following:

               Exploit known weaknesses in authentication – If an authentication mechanism is
                weak, exploiting the weaknesses to defeat it may be possible. For example, early
                password protection schemes on Palm OS PDAs obfuscated the password using a
                reversible algorithm [Kin01], allowing it to be recovered easily from devices running
                version 4.0 or earlier, using a utility. Similarly, early versions of the Pocket PC


                                                  49
                                                                       Guidelines on Cell Phone Forensics


            ActiveSync protocol allow unlimited authentication attempts to be made without
            penalty, allowing a dictionary attack of commonly used passwords to be attempted.

            Some devices may have a reserve password or master password built into the
            authentication mechanism, which allows unfettered access when entered, bypassing
            the phone lock set by the user [Kni02, Smi06]. For example, the master security code
            for overriding the phone lock mechanism on certain Nokia handsets can be calculated
            directly from the equipment identifier.27 A number of GSM mobile phones allow
            acquisition, if a PIN-enabled (U)SIM is missing or removed from the device, as
            mentioned earlier. It is also possible to create a substitute (U)SIM for certain models
            of phones that fools them into treating the (U)SIM as though it were the original and
            allowing access.

           Gain access through a backdoor – Manufacturers often build in test facilities or
            have other software backdoors that an examiner can exploit to obtain information.
            For example, a few software tools are able to acquire the memory of certain phones
            directly through a diagnostic/debugging protocol that bypasses the authentication
            mechanism. Scanning the memory contents can reveal authentication information
            such as passwords or phone locks.

            The bootloaders on some mobile phones and PDA devices also support functions that,
            among other things, allow the devices’ memory to be read. For instance, the iPAQ
            3900 and other models in that product series support the parrot bootloader, an
            unadvertised utility so named because of the bird that appears on the display [Log01].
            When triggered by a specific combination key chord and provided appropriate
            commands via the serial port, the bootloader returns the contents of memory or copies
            it to a memory card. Similarly, the penguin bootloader for Linux handheld devices
            can be used to copy memory to a memory card.

           Exploit known system vulnerabilities – Mobile systems may possess system
            vulnerabilities within a standard interface protocol that an examiner can exploit to
            bypass authentication and gain access to information. For example, access to the
            device may be possible via a misconfigured network service [Cha02], a flaw in a
            standard networking protocol supported by the device, or an error in the protocol’s
            implementation that makes it susceptible to an attack method such as a buffer
            overflow. Possible communications interfaces for exploitation include the serial,
            USB, IrDA, Bluetooth, WiFi, and GSM/GPRS facilities.


       Substitute (U)SIMs: Occasionally, a (U)SIM may not be recovered with a phone, or may be
       intentionally damaged and unusable with the phone, but needed for the acquisition of the phone
       with a forensic tool. One of the most common mistakes a forensic specialist can make is to insert
       another available (U)SIM into the phone to acquire the data with a forensic tool. Certain data
       stored in the memory of the phone, such as call logs (missed, incoming and outgoing calls) and
       SMS messages, is linked to the last (U)SIM used. Inserting a different (U)SIM causes that data to
       be erased from the phone’s memory. Some phones may also start copying SIM data to the
       phone memory when another (U)SIM is inserted.

                                                                           Guidelines on Cell Phone Forensics



            A better approach is to create a substitute (U)SIM to use with the phone that mimics key
            characteristics of the original (U)SIM, tricking the phone to accept it as the original. Several tools
            that can be used to create a substitute (U)SIMs are the Forensic SIM Toolkit, GSM .XRY SIM ID
            Cloner, SIMgen, and the TULP 2G SIMIC protocol plug-in.

            Substitute (U)SIMs, sometimes referred to as access cards, can be useful in a number of
            situations:

            •   As already mentioned, if the (U)SIM for a phone is missing or damaged and needed for
            acquisition with a forensic tool, a substitute (U)SIM allows phone data to be recovered.

            •   If the (U)SIM for a phone is present, but requires a PUK code, a substitute (U)SIM allows
            acquisition to proceed immediately without having to contact the service provider for the PUK.

            •    If radio isolation is needed to prohibit communications to acquire evidence from a phone,
            avoiding incoming calls or messages from altering or modifying evidence, a substitute (U)SIM can
            be used in lieu of a Faraday room or enclosure.

            •   If the forensic tool used to examine a handset accesses the resident (U)SIM indirectly, using
            a substitute (U)SIM in the handset eliminates the possibility of the original being altered during
            examination.

            The values by which the phone remembers the previously inserted (U)SIMs are the ICCID and
            the IMSI. Often only one of these values is used. Both identifiers are unique and used to
            authenticate the user to the network. If these values are known for a specific phone (e.g., either
            indirectly through the service provider records or directly by reading memory from the phone), it
            may be possible to prepare a substitute (U)SIM with the correct values needed to trick the phone
            to accepting it. While the minimum data needed to create a (U)SIM may be simply one of these
            two values, some phones may require additional data to be populated on the (U)SIM to be
            correctly recognized. The possibility exists that data, other than user data, may change on the
            handset as the result of inserting a substitute (U)SIM [INT06].



6.5.3   Hardware-based Methods

        Hardware-based methods involve a combination of software and hardware to break or bypass
        authentication mechanisms and gain access to the device. For example, the value of a phone
        lock can be readily recovered from a memory dump of certain phones, allowing for a follow-
        on logical acquisition. Few general-purpose hardware-based methods apply to a general class
        of mobile phone. Most of the techniques are specialized for a specific model within a class.
        As with software-based methods, when a specialized technique is developed, a test device
        identical to the one under examination should be used. The device manufacturer may also
        provide useful information and tools for extracting data. Hardware-based methods include the
        following:

                Gain access through a hardware backdoor – Hardware backdoors, such as
                 interfaces for debugging, production testing, or maintenance, may be used to gain
                 access to memory. For example, some mobile phones have active hardware test
                 points on the circuit board that can be used to probe the device. Many manufacturers
                 now support the JTAG standard, which defines a common test interface for processor,
                 memory, and other semiconductor chips, on their devices [Int96]. Forensic examiners
                 can communicate with a JTAG-compliant component by utilizing software and an
                 add-in hardware controller in a personal computer card slot or a special purpose

                                                       51
                                                                       Guidelines on Cell Phone Forensics


          standalone programmer device to probe defined test points [Will05]. The JTAG
          testing unit can send commands and data to the JTAG-compliant component and
          return the results to the unit for storage and rendition [Bre06, Xjt03]. JTAG gives
          specialists another avenue for imaging devices that are locked or devices that may
          have minor damage and cannot be properly interfaced otherwise.

         Examine memory independently of the device – An experienced examiner may be
          able to examine memory chips directly on the device and extract information from
          them. For example, the Netherlands Forensic Institute has developed a general-
          purpose tool for examining a wide range of memory chips. Once physically
          connected via a memory clip, the tool is able not only to read and store memory
          contents, but also to overwrite them [Kni02]. Memory may also be acquired by
          dismantling the phone, heating the circuit board sufficiently to desolder the memory
          chips, and using a memory chip reader to access their contents [Will05].

         Find and exploit vulnerabilities – Mobile phone vulnerabilities discovered through
          close study and experimentation are sometimes posted on the Web.28 They can also
          be discovered through reverse engineering. Reverse engineering involves retrieving
          the operating system code from the ROM of a mobile phone identical to the one under
          examination and analyzing the code to understand its structure and use of the device
          hardware [Haa04]. With the understanding gained, any plausible vulnerabilities noted
          can be systematically tested to determine a useful exploit technique. For example, for
          a password authentication mechanism, it may be possible using memory injection to
          overwrite the password with a known value or replace the authentication program
          with a version that always authenticates successfully [Kni02]. Similarly, flipping two
          bits in a data structure, which determine whether the start-up password is active and
          configured, may turn off the mechanism completely, as reported for the XDA
          PDA/phone hybrid device [Its].

         Infer information by monitoring physical device characteristics – Techniques that
          monitor power consumption or other device characteristics have been effective in
          systematically determining the password or PIN. For example, forensic specialists
          report that the passwords of some electronic organizers have been uncovered by
          determining the address area of the password and, as characters are entered,
          systematically monitoring the data and address bus of those memory locations to
          reveal the value one character at a time [Kni02]. Differential power analysis, which
          has been shown to be effective in gaining information from smart cards, is another
          technique that could be applied [Aig]. Simply observing data on an interface can also
          reveal information. For example, the dialog between the phone and a password-
          protected memory card can be monitored to reveal the password supplied by the
          phone to unlock the card, which can then be used in an external examination to access
          the memory card contents.

         Use automated brute force – If a password mechanism has no restrictions on the
          number of manual attempts made and the examiner had time to spare, a brute force
          dictionary attack could be attempted. Normally, this approach would be out of the



28
   For example, a security hole discovered in the Motorola MPx200 is discussed at
http://msmobiles.com/news.php/1640.html.

                                                   52
                                                                     Guidelines on Cell Phone Forensics


                 question. However, with automated keystroke entry, it is plausible. For example, the
                 Netherlands Forensic Institute developed an automated password entry system for
                 devices with a keyboard and screen. Equipped with a robot arm and video camera,
                 the unit can systematically enter passwords until the correct entry is detected or, in the
                 worst case, the keys become damaged [Kni02].

6.6     Tangential Equipment

         Tangential equipment includes devices that contain memory and are associated with a mobile
         phone. The two main categories are memory cards and host computers to which a mobile
         phone has synchronized its contents. Surprisingly, USB memory drives, which are a common
         peripheral for host computers, are generally not a factor for mobile phones because of interface
         issues.

         Mobile phones, especially higher smart phones, typically support Secure Digital (SD),
         MultiMedia Cards (MMC), and other types of removable media designed specifically for
         handheld devices, which can contain significant amounts of data. Memory cards are typically
         semiconductor memory, used as auxiliary user file storage, for backup of important content, or
         as a means to convey files to and from the device. The physical sizes of memory cards
         supported by handheld devices are noteworthy insofar as they are quite small, about the size of
         a coin, and easy to overlook. Therefore, investigators should take their time and thoroughly
         search the premises when seizing material. Data can be acquired from removable media with
         the use of a media reader and a forensic application used to image hard drives.

         The data contained on a mobile phone is often present on a personal computer, due to the
         capability of mobile phones to synchronize or otherwise share information among one or more
         host computers. Such personal computers or workstations are referred to as synched devices.
         Because of synchronization, a significant amount of evidence on a mobile phone may also be
         present on the suspect’s laptop or personal computer, and recovered using a conventional
         computer forensic tool for hard drive acquisition and examination.

6.6.1    Synched Devices

         Synchronization refers to the process of resolving differences in certain classes of data, such as
         e-mail residing on two devices (i.e., a mobile phone and a computer), to obtain a version that
         reflects any actions taken by the user (e.g., deletions or additions) on one device or the other.
         Synchronization of information may occur at either the record level or the file level. When
         done at the file level, any discrepancies from the last synchronization date and time result in
         the latest version automatically replacing the older version. Occasionally manual intervention
         may be needed if both versions were modified independently since the last synchronization
         occurred. Record level synchronization is done similarly, but with more granularity, whereby
         only out-of-date parts of a file are resolved and replaced.

         Phones are typically populated with data from the personal computer during the
         synchronization process. A significant amount of informative data, therefore, may reside
         locally on a personal computer. Data from the phone can also be synchronized to the
         computer, through user-defined preferences in the synchronization software. Because the
         synchronized contents of a phone and personal computer tend to diverge quickly over time,
         additional information may be found in one device or the other.



                                                    53
                                                                     Guidelines on Cell Phone Forensics


        The synchronization software and the device type determine where the phone’s files are stored
        on the PC. Each synchronization protocol has a default installation directory, but the locale
        can be user specified.

6.6.2   Memory Cards

        Mobile phones use a wide array of memory cards, ranging from the size of a contact lens to
        that of a matchbook. Unlike RAM within a device, such removable media is non-volatile
        storage and requires no battery to retain data. Memory card storage capacity ranges from 8MB
        to 2GB and beyond. As technological advances are made, such media becomes smaller and
        offers larger storage densities. Removable media extends the storage capacity of mobile
        phones, allowing individuals to store additional files beyond the device’s built-in capacity and
        to share data between compatible devices.

        Some forensics tools are able to acquire the contents of memory cards; many are not. If the
        acquisition is logical, deleted data present on the card is not recovered. Fortunately, such
        media can be treated similarly to a removable disk drive, and imaged and analyzed using
        conventional forensic tools with the use of an external media reader. Memory card adapters
        exist that support an Integrated Drive Electronics (IDE) interface. Such adapters allow
        removable media to be treated as a hard disk and used with a write blocker, which ensures that
        the removable media remains unaltered. A Universal Serial Bus (USB) memory card reader
        used with write blocker hardware is also an available alternative.

        Data contained on the media can be imaged and searched, and deleted files can be recovered,
        providing possibilities of uncovering evidence. One drawback is that phone data, such as SMS
        text messages, stored on the media may require manual decoding or a separate decoding tool to
        interpret. A more serious issue is that content protection features incorporated into the card
        may block the recovery of data. The most notable example is MMC cards that conform to
        version 4.1 of the standard, which provides for password protection and is supported
        increasingly on newer models of phones. Table 5 gives a brief overview of various storage
        media in use today.

        Memory cards may support extensions for added functionality. For example, the X-Mobile
        Card from Renesas is a MultiMedia card that contains both a smart card and a memory chip.
        Through the use of a built-in controller, the card is able to function in either mode. Another
        example is SD cards that have WiFi or other wireless capability.

6.6.3   USB Memory Drives

        USB drives, sometimes referred to as thumb drives, are chewing-gum-pack size hardware
        components with a USB connector at one end, and built as a printed circuit board within a
        plastic housing that encases a processor and memory. USB memory drives can be treated
        similarly to a removable disk drive, and imaged and analyzed using conventional forensic
        tools.

        Many manufacturers produce USB memory drives of various capacities. Currently, however,
        very few mobile phones support host USB ports, which are needed to interface with these
        peripherals. Moreover, few if any USB drive manufacturers provide the necessary drivers for
        mobile phone operating systems. This situation is understandable, given that host USB
        specifications intend for an interface to be capable of supporting multiple devices sharing the
        port, which if permitted would place a significant power drain on the battery of the device.
        Other factors include the restrictions in mobility imposed by a USB drive sticking out of the
        side of a mobile phone compared to the benefits of providing one or more memory card slots
        that completely contain a card when inserted.

        As with memory card extensions, USB drives may offer additional capabilities such as a
        wireless interface. Access to memory contents may also be protected through a built-in
        fingerprint reader or some other mechanism such as a smart card, which complicates the
        acquisition process. However, for the reasons mentioned above these peripherals are not
        normally associated with mobile phones.

7. Examination and Analysis

       The examination process uncovers digital evidence, including that which may be hidden or
       obscured. The results are gained through applying established scientifically based methods,
       and should describe the content and state of the data fully, including the source and the
       potential significance. Data reduction, separating relevant from irrelevant information, occurs
       once the data is exposed. The analysis process differs from examination in that it looks at the
       results of the examination for its direct significance and probative value to the case [ACPO].
       Examination is a technical process that is the province of a forensic specialist. However,
       analysis may be done by roles other than the forensic analyst, such as the investigator or the
       forensic examiner.

       The examination process begins with a copy of the evidence acquired from the device.
       Fortunately, compared with classical examination of individual workstations or network
       servers, the amount of acquired data to examine is much smaller with mobile phones. Because
       of the prevalence of proprietary case file formats, the forensic toolkit used for acquisition will
       typically be the one used for examination and analysis. Interoperability among the acquisition
       and examination facilities of different tools is also unlikely for this reason, with the exception
       of certain Palm OS devices and perhaps other devices with a PDA lineage.

       The examiner should have studied the case, if possible, and become familiar with the
       parameters of the wrongdoing, the parties involved, and potential evidence that might be
       found. Conducting the examination in a partnership with the forensic analyst or the
       investigator guiding the case construction is advisable for the examiner. The investigator or
       analyst provides insight into the types of things sought, while the forensic examiner provides
       the means to find relevant information that might be on the system [Wol03].

       If the forensic examiner performs the analysis independently, without conferring directly with
       the forensic analyst or investigator, the understanding gained by studying the case should
       provide ideas about the type of data to target and specific keywords or phrases to use when
       searching the acquired data. Depending on the type of case, the strategy varies. For example,
       a case about child pornography may begin with browsing all of the graphic images on the
       system, while a case about an Internet-related offense might begin with browsing the Internet
       history files [Wol03].

       Examination often reveals not only potentially incriminating data but also useful information
       such as passwords, network logon names, and Internet activity. Certain data can also provide
       linkage to other potential sources of evidence maintained elsewhere, particularly by network
       service providers. In addition to evidence directly related to an incident, information can be
       uncovered about the lifestyle of suspects, their associates, and the types of activities in which
       they are involved.

7.1   Potential Evidence

       Mobile phone manufacturers typically offer a similar set of information handling features and
       capabilities, including Personal Information Management (PIM) applications, messaging and
       e-mail, and Web browsing. The set of features and capabilities can vary, of course, with the
       era in which the phone was manufactured, the version of firmware running, modifications


                                                  56
                                                               Guidelines on Cell Phone Forensics


made for a particular service provider, and any modifications or applications installed by the
user. The potential evidence on these devices includes the following items:

       Subscriber and equipment                                     Electronic mail
        identifiers
                                                                     Photos
       Date/time, language, and
        other settings                                               Audio and video recordings

       Phonebook information                                        Multi-media messages

       Appointment calendar                                         Instant messaging and Web
        information                                                   browsing activities

       Text messages                                                Electronic documents

       Dialed, incoming, and missed                                 Location information
        call logs
Other data found on a mobile phone may also prove useful in an investigation. For example,
something seemingly immaterial such as ring tones can have relevance, given that mobile
phone users often load distinctive ring tones onto a phone to distinguish theirs from others’. A
witness to an incident may recall having heard a particular tune on a suspect’s phone, which
may contribute to the identification of an individual. Even esoteric network information found
on a (U)SIM may prove useful in an investigation. For example, if a network rejects a location
update from a phone attempting to register itself, the list of forbidden network entries in the
Forbidden PLMNs elementary file is updated with the code of the country and network
involved [3GP05a]. The phone of an individual suspected of traveling to a neighboring
country might be checked for this information.

The items present on a device are dependent not only on the features and capabilities of the
phone, but also on the voice and data services subscribed to by the user. For example, prepaid
phone service typically does not include data services and rules out the possibility for multi-
media messaging, electronic mail, and Web browsing. Similarly, a contract subscription may
selectively exclude certain types of service, though the phone itself could support them.


    Reported Examples: News articles sometimes describe the types of digital evidence found on a
    mobile phone that was used successfully in an investigation. Some illustrative examples are
    given below.

       Text Message and Call Data – “A pastor of the Pentecostal congregation in the small
        community of Knutby was sentenced to life in prison for persuading one of his lovers (the au
        pair) to shoot and kill his wife and trying to kill the husband of another mistress. Two days
        after the murder, the pastor’s au pair Sarah S. claimed that she did it. Despite her claims …
        the police believed she had an accomplice.”

        “The strongest evidence against the pastor was the extensive communication through text
        messages and voice calls between him and the au pair on the day of the murder and just
        before that. What they did not know was that their (anonymously sent and) carefully deleted
        text messages were possible to recover.” [Bur05]

         Email Data – “The case against Dan Kincaid was strong. A homeowner in northern Boise,
          Idaho, had identified Mr. Kincaid, 44, as the person who had broken into his suburban house.
          But eyewitness testimony isn't always rock solid, and Mr. Kincaid was refusing to talk. The
          police wanted more. So they searched Mr. Kincaid's BlackBerry e-mail-capable phone
          electronically, and found all the evidence they needed.“

          “‘Just trying to find a way out of this neighborhood without getting caught,’ Mr. Kincaid wrote
          to his girlfriend on Aug. 1, 2005, shortly after he had been spotted. ‘Dogs bark if I'm between
          or behind houses. ... ‘ ‘Cops know I have a blue shirt on,’ he continued. ‘I need to get out of
          here before they find me.’ Faced with his e-mailed admission, Mr. Kincaid agreed to a deal
          with prosecutors over that crime and a string of others.” [Sha06]

         Image and Multi-media Message Data – “It was alleged that a young boy had conducted a
          serious assault on another child whilst his friend took pictures on his mobile phone. The
          young boy was initially denying all knowledge of the incident, until the Police were informed
          that there was evidence on the mobile phone.” “… analysts recovered the pictures in
          question in a forensically sound manner following ACPO guidelines. They also recovered a
          deleted multimedia text message sent to another child with one of the pictures attached to
               29
          it.”

         Location Data – “Mr Bristowe told BBC News Online: ‘It was mobile phone evidence which
          made the police look more closely at Huntley. He had been Mr. Useful, helping them to
          search the college grounds, but when they checked Jessica's phone and discovered when
          and where it had been switched off alarm bells began to ring… (Jessica's phone)
          disengaged itself from the network, in effect it says goodbye’ at 1846 BST on the Sunday
          when the girls disappeared. Jessica's phone contacted the Burwell mast when it was turned
          off.”

          "’The police provided us with a map of the route they thought the girls would have taken, and
          the only place on that route where the phone could have logged on to Burwell (and
          disengaged itself) was inside or just outside Huntley's house.’ It is believed to be that crumb
          of crucial evidence which forced Huntley to change his story earlier this year and suddenly
          admit the girls died in his bathroom.” [Sum03]



Two types of computer forensic investigations generally take place. The first type is where an
incident has occurred, but the identity of the offender is unknown (e.g., a hacking incident).
The second is where the offender and the incident are both known (e.g., a child-porn
investigation). Prepared with the background of the incident, the forensic examiner and
analyst can proceed toward accomplishing the following objectives:

         Gather information about the individual(s) involved {who}.

         Determine the exact nature of the events that occurred {what}.

         Construct a timeline of events {when}.

         Uncover information that explains the motivation for the offense {why}.

               Discover what tools or exploits were used {how}.

       Table 6 below provides a cross reference of generic evidence sources commonly found on
       mobile phones and their likely contribution toward satisfying the above objectives. In many
       instances, the data is peripheral to an investigation, useful in substantiating or refuting the
       claims of an individual about some incident. On occasion, direct knowledge, motivation, and
       intention may be established. Most of the evidence sources are from PIM data, call data,
       messaging, and Internet related information. Other support applications that run on the device
       potentially provide other evidence sources. User files placed on the device for rendition,
       viewing, or editing are also another important evidence source. Besides graphic files, other
       relevant file content includes audio and video recordings, spreadsheets, presentation slides, and
       other similar electronic documents. Installed executable programs may also have relevance in
       certain situations. Perhaps the most important data recovered is that which links to information
       held by the service provider. Service providers maintain databases for billing or debiting
       accounts based on call logs, which can be queried using the subscriber or equipment
       identifiers. Similarly, undelivered SMS text messages, multi-media, or voice messages may
       also be recoverable.

7.2   Applying Tools

       Once a copy of the acquisition results is available, the next steps involve searching the data,
       identifying evidence, creating bookmarks, and developing the contents of a final report.
       Knowledge and experience with the tools used for examination is extremely valuable, since
       proficient use of the available features and capabilities of a forensic tool can greatly speed the
       examination process.

       Forensic tools are a crucial component, as they translate data from a raw encoded form to a
       format and structure that is understandable by the examiner, enabling identification and
       recovery of evidence. A variety of different and sometimes unusual encodings are used with

                                                  59
                                                              Guidelines on Cell Phone Forensics


cell phone data and found in the memory of handsets and (U)SIMS, such as text encoded in
the packed 7-bit GSM alphabet, which would be onerous, errorful, and time consuming to
decode manually.

It is important to note that forensic tools have the possibility to contain some degree of error in
their operation. For example, the implementation of the tool may have a programming error;
the specification of a file structure used by the tool to translate bits into data comprehensible by
the examiner may be inaccurate or out of date; or the file structure generated by another
program as input may be incorrect, causing the tool to function improperly [Car02].
Experiments conducted with mobile phone forensic tools indicate a prevalence of such errors
[Aye05, Jan06, Aye07]. Therefore, having a high degree of trust and understanding of the
tool’s ability to perform its function properly is essential.

A knowledgeable suspect may tamper with device information, such as purposefully
misnaming a file extension to foil the workings of a tool, altering the date/time of the phone to
falsify timestamps associated with logged activities, creating false transactions in the memory
of the phone or (U)SIM, or applying a wiping tool to remove or eliminate data from memory.
Seasoned experience with a tool provides an understanding of its limitations, allowing an
examiner to compensate for them and avoid error to achieve the best possible results.

To uncover evidence, specialists should gain a background of the suspect and offense and
determine a set of terms for the examination. Search expressions can be developed in a
systematic fashion, such as using contact names that may be relevant. By proceeding
systematically, the specialist creates a profile for potential leads that may unveil valuable
findings. Forensic Examination of Digital Evidence – A Guide for Law Enforcement,
produced by the U.S. Department of Justice [DOJ04], offers the following suggestions for the
analysis of extracted data:

        Ownership and possession – Identify the individuals who created, modified, or
         accessed a file, and the ownership and possession of questioned data by placing the
         subject with the device at a particular time and date, locating files of interest in non-
         default locations, recovering passwords that indicate possession or ownership, and
         identifying contents of files that are specific to a user.

        Application and file analysis – Identify information relevant to the investigation by
         examining file content, correlating files to installed applications, identifying
         relationships between files (e.g., e-mail files to e-mail attachments), determining the
         significance of unknown file types, examining system configuration settings, and
         examining file metadata (e.g., documents containing authorship identification).

        Timeframe analysis – Determine when events occurred on the system to associate
         usage with an individual by reviewing any logs present and the date/time stamps in
         the file system, such as the last modified time. Besides call logs, the date/time and
         content of messages and e-mail can prove useful. Such data can also be corroborated
         with billing and subscriber records kept by the service provider [Hos98].

               gaining access to steganographic information detected in images; and gaining access
               to reserved areas of data storage outside the normal file system.

       The capabilities of the tool and the richness of its features, versus the operating system and
       type of device under examination, determines what information can be recovered, identified,
       and reported, and the amount of effort needed. The search engine plays a significant role in the
       discovery of information used for the creation of bookmarks and final reporting. For example,
       some tools used to search for textual evidence identify and categorize files based on file
       extension, where others use a file signature database. The latter feature is preferable since it
       eliminates the possibility of missing data because of an inconsistent file name extension (e.g.,
       eliminating a text file whose extension was changed to that of a graphics or image file).
       Similarly, the ability for the tool to find and gather images automatically into a common
       graphics library for examination is extremely useful.

       Searching data for positive results on incriminating evidence takes patience and can be time
       consuming. Some tools have a simple search engine that matches an input text string exactly,
       allowing only for elementary searches to be performed. Other tools incorporate more
       intelligent and feature rich search engines, allowing for generalized regular expression patterns
       (grep) type searches, including wildcard matches; filtering of files by extension, directory, etc.;
       and batch scripts that search for specific types of content (i.e., e-mail addresses, URLs). The
       greater the tool’s capabilities, the more the forensic examiner benefits from experience with
       and knowledge of the tool.

7.3   Call and Subscriber Records

       Records maintained by the service provider capture information needed to accurately bill a
       subscriber or, in the case of a prepaid service plan, debit the balance. The records collected are
       referred to as call detail records, which are generated by the switch handling an originating call
       or SMS message from a mobile phone. For some service providers, the records may also
       include fixed line, international gateway, and voice over IP transaction information. While the
       content and format of these records can differ widely from one service provider to another, the
       fundamental data needed to identify the subscriber/device initiating the call, the initial cell
       servicing the call, the number dialed, and the duration of the call is captured. Detailed
       information such as the identifier of the cell (i.e., the BTS) and the sector involved are often
       included. Appendix D gives an example of the data elements of a call detail record, specified
       in the GSM standards. As one can see, considerable discretion about what is implemented is
       left open to the service providers and network operators.

       The retention period for maintaining call detail and other types of records varies among service
       providers [GSM05]. However, the period is generally limited, requiring immediate action to
       avoid data loss. One should act quickly to have the cellular carrier preserve any data that can
       be used to identify communications that have occurred and are linked to the parties of interest,
       stressing non-disclosure of that action to the account subscriber [Ala03, Ala04]. The data
       available may include subscriber records, the content of email servers (i.e., undelivered email),
       email server logs, RADIUS or other IP address authentication logs, the content of SMS and
       MMS message servers, and the content of voicemail servers. Note that certain types of
       undelivered content, such as voicemail, may be considered in transit from a legal standpoint in
       some jurisdictions, and obtaining or listening to them without the proper authority may be
       treated as an illegal interception of communications [Ala03]. While the USA PATRIOT Act


                                                  61
                                                                          Guidelines on Cell Phone Forensics


eliminated this issue at the federal level, state statutes may be intentionally more restrictive or
not yet be realigned completely with the federal statute.30

Call detail records can be obtained from U.S. service providers through their law enforcement
point of contact, with the appropriate legal documents. Procedures may vary among states in
the U.S., and new laws regarding proper seizure are continually legislated. Procedures also
vary for getting records from service providers and network operators located in other
countries. Close and continuing consultation with legal counsel is advised. Various on-line
law enforcement forums can also be helpful in identifying points of contact and sharing tips on
procedures for accurately obtaining the required data.31

Besides call detail records, subscriber records maintained by a service provider can provide
data useful in an investigation. For example, for GSM systems, the database usually contains
the following information about each customer [Wil03]:

         Customer name and address

         Billing name and address (if other than customer)

         User name and address (if other than customer)

         Billing account details

         Telephone number (MSISDN)

         IMSI

         (U)SIM serial number (ICCID)

         PIN/PUK for the (U)SIM

         Services allowed

Other useful information, including phone numbers (i.e., work or home), contact information
(e.g., email address), and credit card numbers used, may also be retained in subscriber records.
Pay-as-you-go prepaid phones purchased anonymously over the counter may also have useful
information maintained with their accounts, which was supplied by the subscribers, such as the
credit card numbers used for purchases of additional time or an email address registered online
for receipt of notifications. Gaining access to the call records of prepaid phones should not be
ruled out.

Call detail records and other records maintained by the service provider can be requested using
subscriber or equipment identifier information seized or acquired from a phone or (U)SIM.
Subscriber information often used for this purpose includes the IMSI from the (U)SIM and the
cell phone number. Equipment identifiers used are the ESN or IMEI of the phone and the

serial number (i.e., ICCID) of the (U)SIM. The search criteria used could be, for example, all
calls received by a certain phone number (e.g., that of a victim) or all calls handled by a base
station responsible for a particular cell (i.e., to determine who was in a certain area at a certain
time) [Wil05]. The analysis of the initial set of records obtained usually leads to additional
requests for related records of other subscribers and equipment, based on the data uncovered.
For example, frequent calls to a victim’s mobile phone from one or more other phones before a
homicide would logically lead to interest in obtaining the records of the caller(s).

Call detail records can be analyzed for a variety of purposes. For example, a service provider
may use them to understand the calling patterns of their subscribers and the performance of the
network [Aja06, Hin96]. Call detail records can also be used with cell site tower information
obtained from the service provider to translate cell identifiers into geographical locations for
the cells involved and identify the general locale from which calls were placed. While plotting
call record locations and information onto a map can sometimes be useful, it does not
necessarily provide a complete and accurate picture. Cell towers can service phones at
distances of up to 35 kilometers (approximately 21 miles) and may service several distinct
sectors. Radio frequency coverage maps maintained by the service provider can be obtained to
create a more exact portrayal of the data for the sectors involved. The results of the data
analysis can be used to corroborate or refute statements made by individuals regarding their
whereabouts at a given time. A change of cell identifier between the beginning and the end of
a call, over a series of calls, may also indicate a general direction of travel or pattern of
behavior.

Cell boundaries are somewhat fuzzy. Various factors, such as terrain, seasonal changes,
antenna performance, and call loading, affect the coverage area of cells and the plausible locale
to associate with a call record. Detailed field tests and measurements may be required to ensure
accuracy the analysis. Such surveys are regularly performed by network operators to verify
and improve network performance [Ko96]. Tools also exist to aid law enforcement in
performing cell site analysis and mapping activities independently.32 In some situations,
however, such as densely populated urban locations involving microcells or picocells with a
limited coverage area, location determination may be relatively straightforward by the very
nature of the network [Gar01].

Identifying the geographical coverage of specific cells can provide valuable information when
combined with call detail records, geographically establishing plausible locations with some
degree of certainty for the times involved. Professional criminals are aware of these
capabilities and may attempt to turn them to their advantage by having someone use their
phone to establish a false alibi. Attempts at evasion may also occur. A common ploy used is
to purchase, use, and quickly dispose of pay-as-you-go prepaid phones to minimize exposure
or use stolen phones. To obfuscate usage and complicate analysis of records, a variety of
different (U)SIMs may be swapped among different GSM/UMTS handsets.

Careful analysis of the call records in conjunction with other forms of available evidence
overcomes most of these kinds of attempts at evasion. For example, call detail records of pay-
as-you-go prepaid phones are maintained by and available from network providers, the same
as for contract subscriptions. By analyzing the patterns and content of communications and

mapping the evidence to known associates of a suspect, ownership of such phones is possible
to establish. Other traditional forms of forensic evidence may also be used to establish
ownership.

8. Reporting

     Reporting is the process of preparing a detailed summary of all the steps taken and conclusions
     reached in the investigation of a case. Reporting depends on maintaining a careful record of all
     actions and observations, describing the results of tests and examinations, and explaining the
     inferences drawn from the evidence. A good report relies on solid documentation, notes,
     photographs, and tool-generated content.

     Reporting occurs once the data has been thoroughly searched and relevant items bookmarked.
     Many forensic tools come with a built-in reporting facility that usually follows predefined
     templates and may allow customization of the report structure. Permitted customizations
     include allowing for organization logos and report headers and selection of styles and structure
     to provide a more professional look tailored to the organization’s needs. Reports generated by
     a forensic tool typically include items from the case file, such as the specialist’s name, a case
     number, a date and title, the categories of evidence, and the relevant evidence found. Report
     generation typically either outputs all of the data obtained or allows examiners to select
     relevant data (i.e., bookmarked items) for the final report. Including only relevant findings in
     the report minimizes its size and lessens confusion for the reader.

     The software-generated contents are only one part of the overall report. The final report
     contains the software-generated contents along with data accumulated throughout the
     investigation that summarizes the actions taken, the analysis done, and the relevance of the
     evidence uncovered. Ideally, the supporting documentation is in electronic form and able to be
     incorporated directly into the report.

     Reporting facilities vary significantly across mobile device acquisition applications. Report
     generation typically can render a complete report in one of several common formats (e.g., .txt,
     .rtf, .csv, .doc, .html) or at least provide a means to export out individual data items to compose
     a report manually. A few tools include no means of report generation or data export and
     instead require examiners to capture individual screenshots of the tool interface for later
     assembly into a report format. Regardless of how reports are generated, checking that the
     finalized report is consistent with the data presented in the user interface representation is vital
     to identify and eliminate any possible inconsistencies that may appear [Aye05, Jan06, Aye07].

     The ability to modify a pre-existing report and incorporate data (e.g., images, video stills)
     captured by alternative means is advantageous. Auxiliary acquisition techniques are sometime
     required to recover specific data types, as mentioned earlier. For example, video recording a
     manual examination documents the recovery of evidence that the automated forensic tool did
     not acquire. Video editing software allows still images to be captured for inclusion into the
     report. Snapshots could also be taken of the manual exam using a digital camera, though the
     process is less efficient and does not document the entire process, nor allows the entire
     procedure to be viewed if questions arise.

     The type of data determines whether it is presentable in a hard-copy format. Today, many
     popular cellular devices are capable of capturing video and audio. Such evidentiary data (e.g.,
     audio, video) cannot be presented in a printed format and instead should be included with the
     finalized report on removable media (e.g., CD-ROM, DVD-ROM, or thumb drive) along with
     the appropriate application for proper display.

Reports of forensic examination results should include all the information necessary to identify
the case and its source, outline the test results and findings, and bear the signature of the
individual responsible for its contents. In general, the report may include the following
information [DOJ04]:

       Identity of the reporting agency

       Case identifier or submission number

       Case investigator

       Identity of the submitter

       Date of receipt

       Date of report

       Descriptive list of items submitted for examination, including serial number, make,
        and model

       Identity and signature of the examiner

       The equipment and set up used in the examination

       Brief description of steps taken during examination, such as string searches, graphics
        image searches, and recovering erased files.

       Supporting materials such as printouts of particular items of evidence, digital copies of
        evidence, and chain of custody documentation

       Details of findings:

            Specific files related to the request

            Other files, including deleted files, that support the findings

            String searches, keyword searches, and text string searches

            Internet-related evidence, such as Web site traffic analysis, chat logs, cache files,
             e-mail, and news group activity

            Graphic image analysis

            Indicators of ownership, which could include program registration data

            Data analysis

            Description of relevant programs on the examined items

            Techniques used to hide or mask data, such as encryption, steganography, hidden
             attributes, hidden partitions, and file name anomalies

       Report conclusions

Digital evidence, as well as the tools, techniques and methodologies used in an examination, is
subject to being challenged in a court of law or other formal proceedings. Proper
documentation is essential in providing individuals the ability to re-create the process from
beginning to end. As part of the reporting process, making a copy of the software used and
including it with the output produced is advisable. This is especially pertinent for custom
tools, since confusion about the version of the software used to create the output is eliminated,
should it become necessary to reproduce forensic processing results at a later time. The same
practice applies to commercial software tools, which could be upgraded after an examination is
completed [NTI].

Appendix C. Generic Acquisition Overview

      This appendix gives an overview of the acquisition of a mobile phone and (U)SIM. Most tools
      have an acquisition wizard that guides one successfully through the process. An idealized
      explanation of the steps involved is outlined below, illustrated using excerpts of screen shots
      taken from a number of different tools.

C.1 Connection Identification

      The initial step is identifying the type of connection to use. The three choices often offered are
      connecting via a cable, an infrared interface, or a Bluetooth interface, as shown in Figure 7.
      Generally, the order listed is the preferred order of selection. However, other forensic issues
      may exist for the connection type when used with a particular device. The tool manufacturer’s
      user guide and Web site or an independent tool guidance database can sometimes be checked
      for clarification.




                                    Figure 7: Connection Identification

C.2 Device Identification

      Once the type of connection being used is determined, the device can be identified. Often this
      is done through the manufacturer name and device model number. Some tools may attempt to
      identify the device automatically. Note that some toolkits, such as the one shown in Figure 8,
      support both phone and (U)SIM acquisition and offer both choices.

C.3 Data Selection

      Most tools offer a choice of recovering a subset of the data expected to be recovered, such as
      that illustrated in Figure 9. That option might be useful if the reporting capabilities of the tool
      automatically generate a report of all items acquired. Alternatively, performing a complete
      acquisition may be reasonable if the reporting capabilities of the tool allow the selected items
      of interest to be selectively reported. One side benefit with this approach is that the case file
      can be maintained and referenced later, if additional types of information are needed.

      Note that the recoverable items listed can differ among mobile phones, depending on the
      phone’s capabilities. Note too that forensic issues may exist that might oblige one to skip
      recovery of a particular item.

                                         Figure 9: Data Selection

C.4 Acquisition

      After the data to recover is selected, acquisition begins. Acquisition may proceed quietly with
      a progress bar or more informatively with a viewable log of the progress. The latter is
      illustrated in Figure 10, which shows a summary of the different protocols being attempted
      (i.e., AT commands defined in a GSM standard and proprietary FBUS commands) and the
      status of the attempts made.

      While high level logs are informative, some tools can also capture a detailed log of the entire
      acquisition. Detailed logs can be useful in a number of ways: they may provide information to
      the tool manufacturer if the tool fails; they can confirm that the protocol commands were of a
      read-only nature; and they may occasionally contain useful forensic data not reported by the
      tool.

                                       Figure 10: Acquisition

     Upon completion of the acquisition, some arrangement of the recovered data is made available
     for selection. The items for selection are commonly presented in the form of tabbed displays
     or a hierarchical tree structure.

C.5 Phonebook Entries

     Phonebook entries may contain more than just names and phone numbers, including such
     things as email and postal addresses, as shown in Figure 11. Some camera phones can also
     store and display a photo of individuals along with their contact information.

C.6 Call Log Entries

      Phone logs capture the set of recent calls attempted from the phone, received by the phone, and
      missed by the phone, as illustrated in Figure 12.

C.7 Message Entries

     Message entries include both text and multimedia messages received and sent by the phone.
     Figure 13 illustrates some simple text message entries, while Figure 14 illustrates some
     multimedia message entries.

C.8 Calendar Entries

      Calendar entries are sometimes known as appointment books. Similar to a paper agenda
      carried by individuals, calendar entries provide an electronic counterpart, maintaining the date
      and time of some scheduled event. Figure 15 illustrates a calendar page containing active
      entries.

C.9 (U)SIM Data

     (U)SIM data may be acquired in two ways: indirectly through commands sent to the phone
     and passed on to the (U)SIM or directly through commands sent to a (U)SIM reader into
     which the (U)SIM is placed. Figure 16 illustrates the latter. This presumes, of course, that the
     device identification selection made for the acquisition was a GSM SIM card instead of a
     mobile phone.

      contents of highlighted item selected in the tree structure (i.e., SMS text messages) are shown
      at the upper right and also in the window below.

C.10 Picture Entries

      Many mobile phones have a built-in camera and are capable of receiving messages containing
      photos. The photos taken can reside in the memory of the phone or in removable memory
      cards present in the device. Figure 17 illustrates a gallery of the images found on a mobile
      phone collected together for examination and displayed as thumbnail images.

C.11 Searching

      Searching for a specific name or number within a body of digital evidence can be aided with a
      search facility. Figure 18 illustrates a simple name search. A tool may be able to control the
      scope of a search to include the current case file, a portion of the case file, or a set of case files.




                                           Figure 18: Search Facility

C.12 Reporting

      Reporting allows the generation of a report in a variety of formats, as shown in Figure 19.
      Other formats that may be supported by a tool’s report facility include XML and Microsoft
      Word. The report facility may also support tailoring of the report output to include laboratory
      names and logos and information acquired elsewhere, such as photos of the device at seizure
      or at receipt by the laboratory.

Appendix D. Standardized Call Records

     The European Telecommunications Standards Institute specification for GSM event and call
     data provides detailed definitions for a variety of records needed in the administration of
     subscriber related event and call data. Table 7 gives the record structure for a mobile-
     originated call attempt, identifying and describing the name of the various fields involved and
     an indication of whether the field is mandatory (M), conditional (C), or optional (O).

     Other record definitions also appear in the standard. The reader is asked to consult the
     standard directly for a more detailed explanation of the use of each field given in Table 7 and a
     better understanding of the range of records and data involved in network administration.
