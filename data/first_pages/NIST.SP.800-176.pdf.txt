COMPUTER SECURITY DIVISION ANNUAL REPORT | 2014
                                                     WE LCOME LE T T E R
                          The Computer Security Division (CSD), a component of the Information Technology Laboratory at the
                    National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is responsible for developing standards, guidelines,
                    tests, and metrics for protection of non-national security federal information systems. NIST standards and
                    guidelines are developed in an open, transparent, and collaborative manner that enlists broad expertise
                    from around the world. While developed for federal agency use, these resources are voluntarily adopted by
                    other organizations because they are effective and accepted globally.
                          The need for cybersecurity standards and best practices that address interoperability, usability and
                     privacy continues to be critical for the Nation. CSD continues to align its resources to enable greater
                     C  YERSECURITY OF CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS |CPS
                     development and application of practical, innovative security technologies and methodologies that
enhance our ability to address current and future computer and information security challenges. Our foundational research and
applied cybersecurity programs continue to advance in many areas including cryptography, roots of trust, identity and access
management, advanced security testing and measurement, cyber-physical systems, and public safety networks.
         Trust is crucial to the broad adoption of our standards and guidelines, including our cryptographic standards and
guidelines. To ensure that our cryptography resources have been developed according the highest standard of inclusiveness,
transparency and security, NIST initiated a formal review of our cryptographic standards development efforts in 2014. We
documented and solicited public comment on the principles and rigorous processes we use to engage stakeholders and experts
in industry, academia, and government to develop and revise these standards. We anticipate a final report in 2015 that will serve
as a basis for our future standards development and revision efforts.
         Increasing the trustworthiness and resilience of the IT infrastructure is a significant undertaking that requires a
substantial investment in the architectural design and development of our systems and networks. A disciplined and structured
set of systems security engineering processes that starts with and builds on well-established international standards provides an
important starting point. Draft Special Publication 800-160, Systems Security Engineering: An Integrated Approach to Building
Trustworthy Resilient Systems, issued in May 2014, helps organizations to develop a more defensible and survivable information
technology infrastructure. This resource, coupled with other NIST standards and guidelines, contributes to systems that are
more resilient in the face of cyber attacks and other threats.
         Strong partnerships with diverse stakeholders are vital to the success of our technical programs. In February 2014,
NIST issued the Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity as directed in Executive Order 13636. The
Framework, created through collaboration between industry and government, consists of standards, guidelines, and practices
to promote the protection of critical infrastructure. Its approach helps owners and operators of critical infrastructure to manage
cybersecurity-related risk. Collaborations continue as NIST works with stakeholders from across the country and around
the world. Working closely with standards developing organizations, industry and interagency partners, we are evolving
and expanding security automation capabilities to help organizations manage and measure the security of systems and
technologies.
         Active engagement with diverse stakeholders continues to be critical to our success. In the federal space, this
interaction is most prominent in our strengthened collaborations with the Department of Defense, the Intelligence Community,
and the Committee on National Security Systems to establish a common foundation for information security across the federal
government. Our cybersecurity awareness, training, and education programs also exemplify the importance of engagements
with academic institutions, federal agencies, small and medium businesses and others to increase awareness and enhance the
overall cybersecurity posture of the Nation.
         For many years, CSD, in collaboration with our global partners across industry, academia, and government, has made
great contributions to help secure the nation’s critical information and infrastructure. We look forward to strengthening these
relationships as we lead the development and practical application of scalable and sustainable information security standards
and practices.

quality and security assurance of cryptographic algorithm
implementations and modules. The latest set of statistics,
which are collected quarterly from each of the testing

necessary for preparing products for SCAP 1.2 validation.
Resources include documentation, a list of Frequently

and tools for validating and processing SCAP data streams.
The SCAP validation-test content should be used by vendors
for quality assurance testing prior to entering formal SCAP
testing with an NVLAP accredited laboratory. The open-

SCAP content authors for testing SCAP source content. The
SCAP Content Validation Tool (SCAPVal) may be used to
determine if the content conforms to the SCAP specification.

     Most research on AC model or policy verification
techniques are focused on one particular model, and almost
all of the research is in applied methods, which require the
completed AC policies as the input for verification or test
processes to generate fault reports. Even though correct
verification is achieved, and counterexamples may be
generated when faults were found, those methods provide
no information about the source of faults that might allow
conflicts in privilege assignment, leakage of privileges, or
conflict of interest permissions. The difficulty in finding the
source of faults is increased, especially when the AC rules
are intricately covering duplicated variables to a degree of
complexity. The complexity is due to the fact that a fault
might not be caused by one particular rule. Thus, it requires
manually analyzing each rule in the policy in order to find the
correct solution for the fault.

     Meanwhile, the draft guideline is being used as the
basis for an effort with the National Cybersecurity Center of
Excellence (NCCoE) to encourage the adoption of stronger
security technologies in mobile devices. Using draft SP
800-164 as a foundational document, the NCCoE and
CSD developed the Mobile Device Security for Enterprises
building block, which will demonstrate commercially
available technologies that provide protection to both
organization-issued and personally owned mobile platforms.
The NCCoE will invite mobile device, operating system,
and management software vendors, as well as application
developers, to participate in this building block activity and
demonstrate how their technologies could be used together
to meet existing security requirements.
     The CSD also continued its work to protect platform
firmware in FY 2014. Boot firmware, commonly known as
the Basic Input/Output System (BIOS), is a critical firmware
component, due to its unique and privileged position within
modern computing architectures. CSD has been working
with key members of the computer industry on the use of
roots of trust to improve the security of BIOS. In order to

      innovative methods for security, testing, and evaluation of hardware and software to securely deploy off-
      the-shelf smartphones and applications in military field operations. NIST introduced software assurance
      methods, power and reliability analysis techniques, and standards-based cryptographic solutions that
      empowered the USG to securely deploy modified commercial solutions, reduce development costs,
      enhance the combat capability of U.S. troops, and save U.S. soldiers’ lives.

The group is recognized for technical leadership and innovation in the development and execution
of the USGv6 Program that enabled the U.S. Government to meet aggressive OMB milestones for the
adoption of IPv6 technologies. The team developed the critical standards, acquisition profiles, accredi-
tation and testing programs, test suites, procurement guides, security guides, and operational test and
measurement tools necessary to significantly improve the maturity of commercial IPv6 products and to
guide the USG in their acquisition, deployment, and secure use. The NIST USGv6 Program provided a
vital catalyst to the Internet industry and established the USG as a world leader in ensuring the contin-
ued growth and continuity of the Internet.

of authentication strength for each of the use cases is often
based on: (a) the total number of three common orthogonal
authentication factors – What You Know, What You Have and
What You are, and (b) the entropy associated with each factor
chosen. The objective of this paper is to analyze the limitation
of this approach and present a methodology for assigning
authentication strengths based on the strength of pair wise
bindings between the five entities involved in smart card
based authentications – the card (token), the token secret,
the card holder, the card issuer, and the person identifier
stored in the card. The rationale for the methodology is based
on the following three observations: (a) The form factor of
the smart identity token introduces some threats of misuse;
(b) the common set of credentials objects provisioned to a
smart card embody bindings to address those threats and (c)
the strength of an authentication use case should therefore
be based on the number and type of binding verifications
that are performed in the constituent authentication
mechanisms. The use of the methodology for developing
an authentication assurance level taxonomy for two real
world smart identity token deployments is also illustrated.
