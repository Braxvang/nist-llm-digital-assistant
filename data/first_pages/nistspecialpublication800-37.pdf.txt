                               EXECUTIVE SUMMARY


T
      he purpose of this publication is to provide guidelines for the security certification and
      accreditation of information systems supporting the executive agencies of the federal
      government. The guidelines have been developed to help achieve more secure information
systems within the federal government by:
•   Enabling more consistent, comparable, and repeatable assessments of security controls in
    federal information systems;
•   Promoting a better understanding of agency-related mission risks resulting from the operation
    of information systems; and
•   Creating more complete, reliable, and trustworthy information for authorizing officials—to
    facilitate more informed security accreditation decisions.

Security certification and accreditation are important activities that support a risk management
         process and are an integral part of an agency’s information security program.

Security accreditation is the official management decision given by a senior agency official to
authorize operation of an information system and to explicitly accept the risk to agency
operations, agency assets, or individuals based on the implementation of an agreed-upon set of
security controls. Required by OMB Circular A-130, Appendix III, security accreditation
provides a form of quality control and challenges managers and technical staffs at all levels to
implement the most effective security controls possible in an information system, given mission
requirements, technical constraints, operational constraints, and cost/schedule constraints. By
accrediting an information system, an agency official accepts responsibility for the security of the
system and is fully accountable for any adverse impacts to the agency if a breach of security
occurs. Thus, responsibility and accountability are core principles that characterize security
accreditation.

It is essential that agency officials have the most complete, accurate, and trustworthy information
possible on the security status of their information systems in order to make timely, credible, risk-
based decisions on whether to authorize operation of those systems. The information and
supporting evidence needed for security accreditation is developed during a detailed security
review of an information system, typically referred to as security certification. Security
certification is a comprehensive assessment of the management, operational, and technical
security controls in an information system, made in support of security accreditation, to determine
the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing
the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the system. The results
of a security certification are used to reassess the risks and update the system security plan, thus
providing the factual basis for an authorizing official to render a security accreditation decision.

The security certification and accreditation process consists of four distinct phases:
•   Initiation Phase;
•   Security Certification Phase;
•   Security Accreditation Phase; and
•   Continuous Monitoring Phase.

Special Publication 800-37     Guide for the Security Certification and Accreditation of Federal Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________


Each phase in the security certification and accreditation process consists of a set of well-defined
tasks and subtasks that are to be carried out, as indicated, by responsible individuals (e.g., the
Chief Information Officer, authorizing official, authorizing official’s designated representative,
senior agency information security officer, information system owner, information owner,
information system security officer, certification agent, and user representatives).
The Initiation Phase consists of three tasks: (i) preparation; (ii) notification and resource
identification; and (iii) system security plan analysis, update, and acceptance. The purpose of this
phase is to ensure that the authorizing official and senior agency information security officer are
in agreement with the contents of the system security plan, including the system’s documented
security requirements, before the certification agent begins the assessment of the security controls
in the information system.

The Security Certification Phase consists of two tasks: (i) security control assessment; and (ii)
security certification documentation. The purpose of this phase is to determine the extent to
which the security controls in the information system are implemented correctly, operating as
intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements
for the system. This phase also addresses specific actions taken or planned to correct deficiencies
in the security controls and to reduce or eliminate known vulnerabilities in the information
system. Upon successful completion of this phase, the authorizing official will have the
information needed from the security certification to determine the risk to agency operations,
agency assets, or individuals—and thus, will be able to render an appropriate security
accreditation decision for the information system.

The Security Accreditation Phase consists of two tasks: (i) security accreditation decision; and
(ii) security accreditation documentation. The purpose of this phase is to determine if the
remaining known vulnerabilities in the information system (after the implementation of an
agreed-upon set of security controls) pose an acceptable level of risk to agency operations,
agency assets, or individuals. Upon successful completion of this phase, the information system
owner will have: (i) authorization to operate the information system; (ii) an interim authorization
to operate the information system under specific terms and conditions; or (iii) denial of
authorization to operate the information system.

The Continuous Monitoring Phase consists of three tasks: (i) configuration management and
control; (ii) security control monitoring; and (iii) status reporting and documentation. The
purpose of this phase is to provide oversight and monitoring of the security controls in the
information system on an ongoing basis and to inform the authorizing official when changes
occur that may impact on the security of the system. The activities in this phase are performed
continuously throughout the life cycle of the information system.

Completing a security accreditation ensures that an information system will be operated with
appropriate management review, that there is ongoing monitoring of security controls, and that
reaccreditation occurs periodically in accordance with federal or agency policy and whenever
there is a significant change to the system or its operational environment.

CHAPTER ONE

INTRODUCTION
THE NEED FOR SECURITY CERTIFICATION AND ACCREDITATION




T     he E-Government Act (Public Law 107-347) passed by the one hundred and seventh
      Congress and signed into law by the President in December 2002 recognized the
      importance of information security1 to the economic and national security interests of the
United States. Title III of the E-Government Act, entitled the Federal Information Security
Management Act (FISMA), requires each federal agency to develop, document, and implement
an agency-wide information security program to provide information security for the information
and information systems2 that support the operations3 and assets of the agency, including those
provided or managed by another agency, contractor, or other source. The information security
program must include:
•      Periodic assessments of risk, including the magnitude of harm that could result from the
       unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of information
       and information systems that support the operations and assets of the agency;
•      Policies and procedures that are based on risk assessments, cost-effectively reduce
       information security risks to an acceptable level, and ensure that information security is
       addressed throughout the life cycle of each agency information system;
•      Subordinate plans for providing adequate information security for networks, facilities,
       information systems, or groups of information systems, as appropriate;
•      Security awareness training to inform personnel (including contractors and other users of
       information systems that support the operations and assets of the agency) of the information
       security risks associated with their activities and their responsibilities in complying with
       agency policies and procedures designed to reduce these risks;
•      Periodic testing and evaluation of the effectiveness of information security policies,
       procedures, practices, and security controls4 to be performed with a frequency depending on
       risk, but no less than annually;
•      A process for planning, implementing, evaluating, and documenting remedial actions to
       address any deficiencies in the information security policies, procedures, and practices of the
       agency;
•      Procedures for detecting, reporting, and responding to security incidents; and
•      Plans and procedures to ensure continuity of operations for information systems that support
       the operations and assets of the agency.


1
 Information security is the protection of information and information systems from unauthorized access, use,
disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction in order to provide confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
2
 An information system is a discrete set of information resources organized expressly for the collection, processing,
maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of information.
3
    Agency operations include such things as mission, functions, image, and reputation.
4
  Security controls are the management, operational, and technical controls (i.e., safeguards or countermeasures)
prescribed for an information system to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system and its
information.

________________________________________________________________________________________________


FISMA, the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, and the Information Technology Management
Reform Act of 1996 (Clinger-Cohen Act), explicitly emphasize a risk-based policy for cost-
effective security. In support of and reinforcing this legislation, the Office of Management and
Budget (OMB) through Circular A-130, Appendix III, Security of Federal Automated
Information Resources, requires executive agencies5 within the federal government to:
•      Plan for security;
•      Ensure that appropriate officials are assigned security responsibility;
•      Review the security controls in their information systems; and
•      Authorize system processing prior to operations and periodically thereafter.

These management responsibilities presume that responsible agency officials understand the risks
and other factors that could adversely affect their missions. Moreover, these officials must
understand the current status of their security programs and the security controls planned or in
place to protect their information and information systems in order to make informed judgments
and investments that appropriately mitigate risk to an acceptable level. The ultimate objective is
to conduct the day-to-day operations of the agency and to accomplish the agency’s stated
missions with what OMB Circular A-130, Appendix III, defines as adequate security, or security
commensurate with risk, including the magnitude of harm resulting from the unauthorized access,
use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of information.

Security accreditation 6 is the official management decision given by a senior agency official to
authorize operation of an information system and to explicitly accept the risk to agency
operations, agency assets, or individuals7 based on the implementation of an agreed-upon set of
security controls. The senior agency official should have the authority to oversee the budget and
business operations of the information system. Required by OMB Circular A-130, Appendix III,
security accreditation provides a form of quality control and challenges managers and technical
staffs at all levels to implement the most effective security controls possible in an information
system, given mission requirements, technical constraints, operational constraints, and
cost/schedule constraints. By accrediting an information system, an agency official accepts
responsibility for the security of the system and is fully accountable for any adverse impacts to
the agency if a breach of security occurs. Thus, responsibility and accountability are core
principles that characterize security accreditation.

The assessment of risk and the development of system security plans are two important activities
in an agency’s information security program that directly support security accreditation and are
required by FISMA and OMB Circular A-130, Appendix III. Risk assessments influence the
development of the security controls for information systems and generate much of the
information needed for the associated system security plans. Risk assessments can be
accomplished in a variety of ways depending on the specific needs of the agency. Some agencies
may choose to assess risk informally. Other agencies may choose to employ a more formal and
structured approach. In either case, the assessment of risk is a process that should be incorporated

5
  An executive agency is: (i) an Executive Department specified in 5 U.S.C., Section 101; (ii) a Military Department
specified in 5 U.S.C., Section 102; (iii) an independent establishment as defined in 5 U.S.C., Section 104(1); and (iv) a
wholly owned government corporation fully subject to the provisions of 31 U.S.C., Chapter 91.
6
 Security accreditation is synonymous with security authorization; the terms are used interchangeably in this special
publication.
7
    Risks to individuals may include, but are not limited to, loss of the privacy to which individuals are entitled under law.



                                                            PAGE 4

into the system development life cycle. At a minimum, documentation should be produced that
describes the process employed and the results obtained. System security plans provide an
overview of the information security requirements and describe the security controls in place or
planned for meeting those requirements. System security plans can include as references or
attachments, other important security-related documents (e.g., risk assessments, contingency
plans, incident response plans, security awareness and training plans, information system rules of
behavior, configuration management plans, security configuration checklists, privacy impact
assessments, system interconnection agreements) produced as part of an agency’s information
security program.8

In addition to risk assessments and system security plans, security assessments play an important
role in security accreditation. It is essential that agency officials have the most complete,
accurate, and trustworthy information possible on the security status of their information systems
in order to make timely, credible, risk-based decisions on whether to authorize operation of those
systems. The information and supporting evidence needed for security accreditation is developed
during a detailed security review of an information system, typically referred to as security
certification. Security certification is a comprehensive assessment of the management,
operational, and technical security controls9 in an information system, made in support of security
accreditation, to determine the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating
as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements
for the system. The results of a security certification are used to reassess the risks and update the
system security plan, thus providing the factual basis for an authorizing official to render a
security accreditation decision.

By accrediting an information system, an agency official accepts the risks associated with
operating the system and the associated implications on agency operations, agency assets, or
individuals. Completing a security accreditation ensures that an information system will be
operated with appropriate management review, that there is ongoing monitoring of security
controls, and that reaccreditation occurs periodically in accordance with federal or agency policy
and whenever there is a significant change to the system or its operational environment.10

1.1 PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY
The purpose of this publication is to provide guidelines for the security certification and
accreditation of information systems supporting the executive agencies of the federal government.
The guidelines have been developed to help achieve more secure information systems within the
federal government by:

8
  NIST Special Publications 800-18, 800-30, 800-34, 800-47, 800-50, 800-61, and 800-70 respectively, provide
guidance on system security plans, risk management and risk assessments, contingency planning, information system
interconnections, security awareness and training, incident response planning, and security configuration checklists.
9
 Management controls are the safeguards or countermeasures that focus on the management of risk and the
management of information system security. Operational controls are the safeguards or countermeasures that primarily
are implemented and executed by people (as opposed to systems). Technical controls are the safeguards or
countermeasures that are primarily implemented and executed by the information system through mechanisms
contained in the hardware, software, or firmware components of the system.
10
   Examples of significant changes to an information system that should be reviewed for possible reaccreditation
include but are not limited to: (i) installation of a new or upgraded operating system, middleware component, or
application; (ii) modifications to system ports, protocols, or services; (iii) installation of a new or upgraded hardware
platform or firmware component; or (iv) modifications to cryptographic modules or services. Changes in laws,
directives, policies, or regulations, while not always directly related to the information system, can also potentially
affect the security of the system and trigger a reaccreditation action.

The guidelines provided in this special publication are applicable to all federal information
systems other than those systems designated as national security systems as defined in 44 U.S.C.,
Section 3542.11 The guidelines have been broadly developed from a technical perspective so as
to be complementary to similar guidelines for national security systems. This publication
provides augmented, updated security certification and accreditation information to federal
agencies and will functionally replace Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 102,

rescinded. State, local, and tribal governments, as well as private sector organizations comprising
the critical infrastructure of the United States, are encouraged to consider the use of these
guidelines, as appropriate.

1.2 SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE
All federal information systems, including operational systems, systems under development, and
systems undergoing some form of modification or upgrade, are in some phase of what is
commonly referred to as the system development life cycle.12 There are many activities occurring
during the life cycle of an information system dealing with the issues of cost, schedule, and
performance. In addition to the functional requirements levied on an information system, security
requirements must also be considered. When fully implemented, the information system must be
able to meet its functional requirements and do so in a manner that is secure enough to protect
agency operations, agency assets, and individuals.

In accordance with the provisions of FISMA, agencies are required to have an agency-wide
information security program and that program should be effectively integrated into the system
development life cycle. For new information systems (or major upgrades to information
systems), the security certification and accreditation tasks begin early in the system development
life cycle during the initiation, development, and acquisition phases and are important in shaping
and influencing the security capabilities of the system. For operational systems and older legacy
systems, the certification and accreditation tasks may, by necessity, begin later in the system
development life cycle during the operations and maintenance phase and be more costly to
implement. In either situation, all of the tasks should be completed to ensure that:
•    The information system has received the necessary attention with regard to security; and
•    The authorizing official explicitly accepts the risk to agency operations, agency assets, or
     individuals based on the implementation of an agreed-upon set of security controls.


11
  NIST Special Publication 800-59 provides guidance for identifying an information system as a national security
system.
12
   There are typically five phases in the system development life cycle of an information system: (i) system initiation;
(ii) system development and acquisition; (iii) system implementation; (iv) system operations and maintenance; and (v)
system disposal. NIST Special Publication 800-64 provides guidance on the security considerations in the information
system development life cycle.

CHAPTER TWO

THE FUNDAMENTALS
BASIC CONCEPTS ASSOCIATED WITH SECURITY CERTIFICATION AND ACCREDITATION




T       he purpose of this chapter is to describe the fundamentals of security certification and
        accreditation to include: (i) agency-level activities that can promote more cost-effective
        certification and accreditation processes; (ii) roles and responsibilities of key participants;
(iii) approaches for determining accreditation boundaries; (iv) partitioning of security controls to
facilitate reuse of assessment results; (v) types of security accreditation decisions; (vi) necessary
documentation and supporting materials; and (vii) ongoing activities employed to monitor the
effectiveness of security controls.

2.1 SECURITY CERTIFICATION AND ACCREDITATION
While security certification and accreditation are very closely related, they are indeed very
distinct activities. Security accreditation is about the acceptance and management of risk—the
risk to agency operations, agency assets, or individuals that results from the operation of an
information system. Authorizing officials must be able to determine the risk to operations, assets,
or individuals and the acceptability of such risk given the mission or business needs of their
agencies. Authorizing officials must weigh the appropriate factors and decide to either accept or
reject the risk to their respective agencies. To ensure that authorizing officials make credible,
risk-based decisions, the following questions must be answered during the security certification
and accreditation process:
•      Does the potential risk to agency operations, agency assets, or individuals described in the
       system security plan (or risk assessment) prior to security certification appear to be correct,
       and if so, would this risk be acceptable?
•      Are the security controls in the information system effective in achieving the desired level of
       protection as defined by the security requirements for the system?
•      What specific actions have been taken or are planned to correct any deficiencies in the
       security controls for the information system and to reduce or eliminate known
       vulnerabilities—and have resources been allocated to accomplish those actions?
•      How do the results of security certification translate into actual agency-level risk and is this
       risk acceptable?

Security certification directly supports security accreditation by providing authorizing officials
with important information necessary to make credible, risk-based decisions on whether to place
information systems into operation or continue their current operation. This information is
produced by assessing the security controls in the information system to determine the extent to
which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired
outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the system. Security certification
can include a variety of assessment methods (e.g., interviewing, inspecting, studying, testing,
demonstrating, and analyzing) and associated assessment procedures depending on the depth and
breadth of assessment required by the agency.13



13
     NIST Special Publication 800-53A provides guidance for assessing the security controls in an information system.

________________________________________________________________________________________________


The determination as to whether the security controls selected are in fact adequate to meet the
security requirements for the information system is made during the initiation phase of the system
development life cycle. It is in this phase of the life cycle that security requirements are
established, security controls selected, and the authorizing official and senior agency information
security officer approve the system security plan.14 For legacy information systems (i.e., systems
that are currently in the operations and maintenance phase of the system development life cycle),
the determination of security control adequacy is, once again, accomplished prior to security
certification when the system security plan is approved.

Security certification does not include the determination of risk to agency operations, agency
assets, or individuals. The determination of program-level or agency-level risk generally requires
a broader, more strategic view of the agency than can be obtained from the more technically
focused, system-level view of the information system that results from security certification.
Authorizing officials or their designated representatives are better positioned to make mission risk
determinations based on the known vulnerabilities remaining in the information system after the
implementation of an agreed-upon set of security controls. The ultimate decision on the
acceptability of such risk is the responsibility of the authorizing official. Authorizing officials or
their designated representatives may, when needed, consult other individuals within the agency
(e.g., senior agency information security officers, information system owners, information system
security officers, or certification agents), at any phase in the certification and accreditation
process to obtain advice on the security of the information system. Figure 2.1 illustrates the
relationship between information system vulnerabilities and program/agency-level, mission risk.

                       FIGURE 2.1 INFORMATION SYSTEM VULNERABILITIES AND MISSION RISK


Security accreditation is part of a dynamic, ongoing risk management process. An information
system is authorized for operation at a specific point in time reflecting the current security state of
the system. The inevitable changes to the information system (including hardware, firmware,

14
   Security certification and accreditation activities should be closely linked to and be a part of the system development
life cycle for the information system. This linkage and integration into the life cycle will ensure that important
security-related considerations are included in the design, development, implementation, and operation of the
information system.




                                                          PAGE 9

software and people) and the potential impact those changes may have on agency operations,
agency assets, or individuals, require a structured and disciplined process capable of monitoring
the effectiveness of the security controls in the information system on an ongoing basis. Thus,
the initial security accreditation must be supplemented and reinforced by a continuous monitoring
process that: (i) tracks the changes to the information system; (ii) analyzes the security impact of
those changes; (iii) makes appropriate adjustments to the security controls and the system security
plan; and (iv) reports the security status of the system to appropriate agency officials. The
following questions should be answered during the continuous monitoring process:
•    Could any of the changes to the information system affect the current, identified
     vulnerabilities in the system or introduce new vulnerabilities into the system?
•    If so, would the resulting risk to agency operations, agency assets, or individuals be
     unacceptable?
•    When will the information system need to be reaccredited in accordance with federal or
     agency policy?

The successful completion of the security certification and accreditation process provides agency
officials with the necessary confidence that the information system has adequate security
controls, that any vulnerabilities in the system have been considered in the risk-based decision to
authorize processing, and that appropriate plans and funds have been identified to correct any
deficiencies in the information system.

An Agency-wide Perspective
When considering the prospect of accrediting agency information systems, it is important to put
these activities into perspective with respect to the agency’s mission and operational
responsibilities. Employing more secure information systems is critical to the success of an
agency in carrying out its mission and conducting its day-to-day functions. However, security is
only one of many factors that must be considered by agency officials in the design, development,
acquisition, operation, and maintenance of information systems. In the end, agencies must have
systems that provide a high degree of functionality and adequate security so as not to place their
respective missions at unacceptable levels of risk.
The increasing costs required to adequately protect agency information systems necessitates an
agency-wide view of security to make the costs more manageable.15 Agencies must consider their
entire inventory of information systems when developing appropriate strategies and programs for
protecting those systems and managing agency-level risks. The cost of accrediting large numbers
of information systems with varying degrees of complexity is a critical issue facing agencies
today. The solution to this problem can be found in part, by creating and maintaining an agency-
wide information security program that promotes the reuse and sharing of security control
development, implementation, and assessment-related information including:
•    Employment of standardized security controls and methods for assessing those controls;
•    Development of standardized assessment plans, methods and procedures to be used in
     security certifications and accreditations;
•    Adoption, specification, and promulgation of standardized policies, procedures, and
     documentation for common security program areas (e.g., rules of behavior, system

15
  Some agencies may choose to establish an authorization advocate or security certification and authorization
organization that manages, coordinates, and oversees all security authorization activities, agency-wide—working with
the senior agency information security officer, authorizing officials, and information system owners.

     administration, auditing, system monitoring, vulnerability scanning, management of user
     accounts, configuration management, incident response, contingency planning, and system
     maintenance);
•    Refinement of policies, procedures, and documentation on a system-by-system basis, as
     needed, by preparing amendments or adding system-specific appendices;
•    Adoption, publication, and distribution (preferably in an online database) of agency
     prescribed or developed security implementation guidance;
•    Establishment of a protected central repository, preferably online, for all certification and
     accreditation documentation, acquisition-related information, risk and vulnerability
     assessments, compliance surveys, security incident reporting and remediation results, external
     security audits, and making these easily accessible by appropriate agency personnel; and
•    Procurement of agency-wide licenses for automated tools such as vulnerability scanners,
     online security monitoring tools, audit reduction tools, and certification and accreditation
     support tools.

Since the cost of security certification and accreditation can be substantial, it is important to
leverage the results of previous assessments and audits that have been conducted on an agency’s
information system or the particular components comprising that system. Several potential
sources for consideration include: (i) commercial product testing and evaluation programs;16 (ii)
privacy impact assessments; (iii) physical security assessments; (iv) self-assessments;17 and (v)
internal and external audits.18 These assessments and audits can support the security certification
and accreditation process in two important ways. First, the assessment and audit results can be
used to gauge the preparedness of an information system for security certification and
accreditation by examining the status of key security controls in the system. Second, the results
produced during these assessments and audits can be considered and potentially reused, when
appropriate, during the security certification and accreditation process.19 Bringing in assessment
and audit results from multiple sources that the security controls in an information system are
implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to
meeting the security requirements for the system, not only reduces the potential cost of security
certification and accreditation but also increases the overall confidence in the final results.

Reuse and sharing of security control development, implementation, and assessment-related
information can significantly reduce agency security costs in new acquisitions, certifications and

Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP) Common Criteria Evaluation and Validation Scheme (CCEVS)
(http://niap.nist.gov/cc-scheme), respectively, in accordance with federal and international security standards.

  The Office of the Inspector General typically conducts internal audits on federal agencies. The General Accounting
Office conducts external audits on agency information systems using the Federal Information System Controls Audit
Manual (http://www.gao.gov).
19
   Previous assessment and audit results should always be reviewed and/or analyzed to determine the extent to which
those results are still applicable and accurately reflect the current security state of the information system. Where
previous results are deemed not fully applicable or less than current, those areas should be reassessed or the differences
so noted for consideration in the final security assessment report.

accreditations of similar information systems, and reaccreditations of existing systems—and can
ultimately result in a more consistent application of security solutions, agency-wide.

2.2 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
The following sections describe the roles and responsibilities of key participants involved in an
agency’s security certification and accreditation process.20 Recognizing that agencies have
widely varying missions and organizational structures, there may be differences in naming
conventions for certification and accreditation-related roles and how the associated
responsibilities are allocated among agency personnel (e.g., multiple individuals filling a single
role or one individual filling multiple roles21). However, the basic functions remain the same.
The security certification and accreditation process described in this special publication is
flexible, allowing agencies to effectively accomplish the intent of the specific tasks within their
respective organizational structures to best manage the risks to agency operations, agency assets,
or individuals.

Chief Information Officer
The Chief Information Officer 22 is the agency official responsible for: (i) designating a senior
agency information security officer; (ii) developing and maintaining information security
policies, procedures, and control techniques to address all applicable requirements; (iii) training
and overseeing personnel with significant responsibilities for information security; (iv) assisting
senior agency officials concerning their security responsibilities; and (v) in coordination with
other senior agency officials, reporting annually to the agency head on the effectiveness of the
agency information security program, including progress of remedial actions. The Chief
Information Officer, with the support of the senior agency information security officer, works
closely with authorizing officials and their designated representatives to ensure that an agency-
wide security program is effectively implemented, that the certifications and accreditations
required across the agency are accomplished in a timely and cost-effective manner, and that there
is centralized reporting of all security-related activities.

To achieve a high degree of cost effectiveness with regard to security, the Chief Information
Officer encourages the maximum reuse and sharing of security-related information including: (i)
threat and vulnerability assessments; (ii) risk assessments; (iii) results from common security
control assessments; and (iv) any other general information that may be of assistance to
information system owners and their supporting security staffs. In addition to the above duties,
the Chief Information Officer and authorizing officials determine the appropriate allocation of
resources dedicated to the protection of the agency’s information systems based on organizational
priorities. In certain instances, the Chief Information Officer may be designated as the
authorizing official for agency-wide general support systems or as a co-authorizing official with
other senior officials for selected agency information systems.


20
   Agencies may define other significant roles (e.g., systems administrators, facilities managers, system security
engineers, and operations managers) to support the security certification and accreditation process. The Office of the
Inspector General may also become involved and take on the role of independent auditor in assessing the quality of
security certification and accreditation processes.
21
   Caution should be exercised when one individual fills multiples roles in the security certification and accreditation
process to ensure that the individual retains an appropriate level of independence and remains free from conflicts of
interest.
22
  When an agency has not designated a formal Chief Information Officer position, FISMA requires the associated
responsibilities to be handled by a comparable agency official.

________________________________________________________________________________________________


Authorizing Official
The authorizing official (or designated approving/accrediting authority as referred to by some
agencies) is a senior management official or executive with the authority to formally assume
responsibility for operating an information system at an acceptable level of risk to agency
operations, agency assets, or individuals.23 Through security accreditation, the authorizing official
assumes responsibility and is accountable for the risks associated with operating an information
system. The authorizing official should have the authority to oversee the budget and business
operations of the information system within the agency and is often called upon to approve
system security requirements, system security plans, and memorandums of agreement and/or
memorandums of understanding. In addition to authorizing operation of an information system,
the authorizing official can also: (i) issue an interim authorization to operate the information
system under specific terms and conditions; or (ii) deny authorization to operate the information
system (or if the system is already operational, halt operations) if unacceptable security risks
exist. With the increasing complexities of agency missions and organizations, it is possible that a
particular information system may involve multiple authorizing officials. If so, agreements
should be established among the authorizing officials and documented in the system security
plan. In most cases, it will be advantageous to agree to a lead authorizing official to represent the
interests of the other authorizing officials. The authorizing official has inherent U.S. government
authority and, as such, must be a government employee.

Authorizing Official Designated Representative
Due to the breadth of organizational responsibilities and significant demands on time, an
authorizing official cannot always be expected to participate directly in the planning and technical
meetings that occur during the security certification and accreditation process. The authorizing
official’s designated representative is an individual acting on the authorizing official’s behalf in
coordinating and carrying out the necessary activities required during the security certification
and accreditation of an information system. The authorizing official’s designated representative
interacts with the senior agency information security officer, information system owner,
information system security officer, certification agent, user representative(s), and other
interested parties during the security certification and accreditation process. The designated
representative can be empowered by the authorizing official to make certain decisions with regard
to the planning and resourcing of the security certification and accreditation activities, the
acceptance of the system security plan, and the determination of risk to agency operations, agency
assets, and individuals. The designated representative may also be called upon to prepare the
final security accreditation package, obtain the authorizing official’s signature on the security
accreditation decision letter, and transmit the accreditation package to the appropriate agency
officials. The only activity that cannot be delegated by the authorizing official is the security
accreditation decision and the signing of the associated accreditation decision letter (i.e., the
acceptability of risk to the agency). If a designated representative is not selected, the authorizing
official is responsible for carrying out the activities described above.

Senior Agency Information Security Officer
The senior agency information security officer is the agency official responsible for: (i) carrying
out the Chief Information Officer responsibilities under FISMA; (ii) possessing professional
qualifications, including training and experience, required to administer the information security
program functions; (iii) having information security duties as that official’s primary duty; and (iv)

23
   In some agencies, the senior official and the Chief Information Officer may be co-authorizing officials. In this
situation, the senior official approves the operation of the information system prior to the Chief Information Officer.

heading an office with the mission and resources to assist in ensuring agency compliance with
FISMA. The senior agency information security officer (or supporting staff member) may also
serve as the authorizing official's designated representative. The senior agency information
security officer serves as the Chief Information Officer’s primary liaison to the agency’s
authorizing officials, information system owners, and information system security officers.

Information System Owner
The information system owner24 is an agency official responsible for the overall procurement,
development, integration, modification, or operation and maintenance of an information system.
The information system owner is responsible for the development and maintenance of the system
security plan and ensures the system is deployed and operated according to the agreed-upon
security requirements. The information system owner is also responsible for deciding who has
access to the information system (and with what types of privileges or access rights) and ensures
that system users and support personnel receive the requisite security training (e.g., instruction in
rules of behavior). The information system owner informs key agency officials of the need to
conduct a security certification and accreditation of the information system, ensures that
appropriate resources are available for the effort, and provides the necessary system-related
documentation to the certification agent.25 The information system owner receives the security
assessment results from the certification agent. After taking appropriate steps to reduce or
eliminate vulnerabilities, the information system owner assembles the security accreditation
package and submits the package to the authorizing official or the authorizing official’s
designated representative for adjudication.26

Information Owner
The information owner is an agency official with statutory or operational authority for specified
information and responsibility for establishing the controls for its generation, collection,
processing, dissemination, and disposal. The information owner is responsible for establishing
the rules for appropriate use and protection of the subject information (e.g., rules of behavior) and
retains that responsibility even when the information is shared with other organizations. The
owner of the information stored within, processed by, or transmitted by an information system
may or may not be the same as the information system owner. Also, a single information system
may utilize information from multiple information owners. Information owners should provide
input to information system owners regarding the security requirements and security controls for
the information systems where the information resides.

Information System Security Officer
The information system security officer is the individual responsible to the authorizing official,
information system owner, or the senior agency information security officer for ensuring the

24
   The role of information system owner can be interpreted in a variety of ways depending on the particular agency and
the system development life cycle phase of the information system. Some agencies may refer to information system
owners as program managers or business/asset/mission owners.
25
   In some situations, the notification of the need to conduct a security certification and accreditation may come from
the senior agency information security officer or authorizing official as they endeavor to ensure compliance with
federal or agency policy. The responsibility for ensuring appropriate resources are allocated to the security certification
and accreditation effort depends on whether the agency uses a centralized or decentralized funding mechanism.
26
   Depending on how the agency has organized and structured its security certification and accreditation activities, the
authorizing official may choose to designate an individual other than the information system owner to compile and
assemble the information for the accreditation package. In this situation, the designated individual must coordinate the
compilation and assembly activities with the information system owner.

appropriate operational security posture is maintained for an information system or program. The
information system security officer also serves as the principal advisor to the authorizing official,
information system owner, or senior agency information security officer on all matters (technical
and otherwise) involving the security of the information system. The information system security
officer typically has the detailed knowledge and expertise required to manage the security aspects
of the information system and, in many agencies, is assigned responsibility for the day-to-day
security operations of the system. This responsibility may also include, but is not limited to,
physical security, personnel security, incident handling, and security training and awareness. The
information system security officer may be called upon to assist in the development of the system
security policy and to ensure compliance with that policy on a routine basis. In close
coordination with the information system owner, the information system security officer often
plays an active role in developing and updating the system security plan as well as in managing
and controlling changes to the system and assessing the security impact of those changes.

Certification Agent
The certification agent is an individual, group, or organization responsible for conducting a
security certification, or comprehensive assessment of the management, operational, and
technical security controls in an information system to determine the extent to which the controls
are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect
to meeting the security requirements for the system. The certification agent also provides
recommended corrective actions to reduce or eliminate vulnerabilities in the information system.
Prior to initiating the security assessment activities that are a part of the certification process, the
certification agent provides an independent assessment of the system security plan to ensure the
plan provides a set of security controls for the information system that is adequate to meet all
applicable security requirements.

To preserve the impartial and unbiased nature of the security certification, the certification agent
should be in a position that is independent from the persons directly responsible for the
development of the information system and the day-to-day operation of the system. The
certification agent should also be independent of those individuals responsible for correcting
security deficiencies identified during the security certification. The independence of the
certification agent is an important factor in assessing the credibility of the security assessment
results and ensuring the authorizing official receives the most objective information possible in
order to make an informed, risk-based, accreditation decision. The security category of the
information system as defined in FIPS 199 should guide the degree of independence of the
certification agent. When the potential impact on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals
is low, a self-assessment activity may be reasonable and appropriate and not require an
independent certification agent. When the potential agency-level impact is moderate or high,
certification agent independence is needed and justified.

User Representatives
Users are found at all levels of an agency. Users are responsible for the identification of
mission/operational requirements and for complying with the security requirements and security
controls described in the system security plan. User representatives are individuals that represent
the operational interests of the user community and serve as liaisons for that community
throughout the system development life cycle of the information system. The user representatives
assist in the security certification and accreditation process, when needed, to ensure mission
requirements are satisfied while meeting the security requirements and employing the security
controls defined in the system security plan.

________________________________________________________________________________________________


Delegation of Roles
At the discretion of senior agency officials, certain security certification and accreditation roles
may be delegated and if so, appropriately documented. Agency officials may appoint
appropriately qualified individuals, to include contractors, to perform the activities associated
with any security certification and accreditation role with the exception of the Chief Information
Officer and authorizing official. The Chief Information Officer and authorizing official have
inherent United States Government authority, and those roles should be assigned to government
personnel only. Individuals serving in delegated roles are able to operate with the authority of
agency officials within the limits defined for the specific certification and accreditation activities.
Agency officials retain ultimate responsibility, however, for the results of actions performed by
individuals serving in delegated roles.

2.3 ACCREDITATION BOUNDARIES
One of the most difficult and challenging problems for authorizing officials and senior agency
information security officers is identifying appropriate security accreditation boundaries for
agency information systems. Accreditation boundaries for agency information systems need to
be established before the conduct of initial risk assessments and development of system security
plans. Boundaries that are unnecessarily expansive (i.e., including too many hardware, software,
and firmware components) make the security certification and accreditation process extremely
unwieldy and complex. Boundaries that are unnecessarily limited (i.e., including too few
hardware, software, and firmware components) increase the number of security certifications and
accreditations that must be conducted and thus drive up the total security costs for the agency.
The guidelines in the following sections are provided to assist agencies in defining information
system boundaries to strike a balance between the costs and benefits of security certification and
accreditation.

Establishing Information System Boundaries
The process of uniquely assigning information resources27 to an information system defines the
security accreditation boundary for that system. Agencies have great flexibility in determining
what constitutes an information system (i.e., major application or general support system) and the
resulting security accreditation boundary that is associated with that system. If a set of
information resources is identified as an information system, the resources should generally be
under the same direct management control.28 Direct management control does not necessarily
imply that there is no intervening management. It is quite possible for multiple information
systems to be validly considered subsystems29 of a single, larger system provided all of these
subsystems fall under the same higher management authority. This situation may arise in many
agencies when other than major applications (i.e., minor applications) are coalesced for purposes
of security certification and accreditation into a general support system. In addition to the

27
   Information resources consist of information and related resources, such as personnel, equipment, funds, and
information technology.
28
  Direct management control typically involves budgetary, programmatic, or operational authority and associated
responsibility. For new information systems, management control can be interpreted as having budgetary/programmatic
authority and responsibility for the development and deployment of the information systems. For information systems
currently in the federal inventory, management control can be interpreted as having budgetary/operational authority for
the day-to-day operations and maintenance of the information systems.
29
  A subsystem is a major subdivision or component of an information system consisting of information, information
technology, and personnel that performs one or more specific functions.




                                                       PAGE 16
Special Publication 800-37           Guide for the Security Certification and Accreditation of Federal Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________


consideration of direct management control, it may also be helpful for agencies to consider if the
information resources being identified as an information system:
•    Have the same function or mission objective and essentially the same operating
     characteristics and security needs; and
•    Reside in the same general operating environment (or in the case of a distributed information
     system, reside in various locations with similar operating environments).

While the above considerations may be useful to agencies in determining information system
boundaries for purposes of security accreditation, they should not be viewed as limiting the
agency’s flexibility in establishing common sense boundaries that promote effective information
security within the available resources of the agency. Authorizing officials and senior agency
information security officers should consult with prospective information system owners when
establishing information system and security accreditation boundaries. The process of
establishing boundaries for agency information systems and the associated security certification
and accreditation implications, is an agency-level activity that should include careful negotiation
among all key participants—taking into account the mission/business requirements of the agency,
the technical considerations with respect to information security, and the programmatic costs to
the agency.

Supplementing the above considerations, FIPS 199, Standards for Security Categorization of
Federal Information and Information Systems, defines security categories for information
systems based on potential impact on organizations or individuals should there be a breach of
security—that is, a loss of confidentiality, integrity (including authenticity and non-repudiation),
or availability.30 FIPS 199 security categories can play an important part in defining accreditation
boundaries by partitioning the agency’s information systems according to the criticality or
sensitivity of the systems and the importance of those systems in accomplishing the agency’s
mission. The partitioning process facilitates the cost-effective application of security controls to
achieve adequate security commensurate with the mission/business functions being supported by
the respective information systems.

Boundaries for Large and Complex Information Systems
The application of security controls within large and complex information systems, even when
using FIPS 199 to categorize those systems, may be cost-prohibitive and technically infeasible for
the agency. Accordingly, any attempt to assess the security controls in such systems may also be
cost-prohibitive and unrealistic. To make this problem more manageable, authorizing officials
should examine the nature of the information systems being considered for security certification
and accreditation and the feasibility of decomposing the systems into more manageable
components. The decomposition of large and complex systems into multiple components, or
subsystems, facilitates the application of the security certification and accreditation process in a
more cost-effective manner.


30
   Based on the definitions provided in OMB Circular A-130, Appendix III, agencies can associate the different types
of information systems and applications with the security categories and impact levels defined in FIPS 199. For
example, a major application could be expected to have a potential impact level of moderate or high in its security
categorization. A minor application could be expected to have a potential impact level of low or moderate in its security
categorization. A general support system could be expected to have a potential impact level of low, moderate, or high
in its security categorization depending on the criticality or sensitivity of the system, potential impact of loss, and
whether the system is supporting (i.e., hosting) any major applications. Minor applications are typically included (or
bundled) within a general support system.



                                                       PAGE 17
Special Publication 800-37         Guide for the Security Certification and Accreditation of Federal Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________


For large and complex information systems, the authorizing official and senior agency
information security officer may define subsystem components with established subsystem
boundaries. The decomposition into subsystem components should be reflected in the system
security plan for that large and complex information system. Each subsystem component is fully
described in the system security plan, an appropriate security category assigned in accordance
with FIPS 199, and an appropriate set of security controls identified. The extent to which the
security controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired
outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the information system, can be
determined by combining security assessments at the subsystem level and adding system-level
considerations. This facilitates a more cost-effective certification and accreditation process by
enabling scaling of the effort at the subsystem level in accordance with that subsystem’s security
category and allowing for reuse of certification results at the system level.

To illustrate a simple example of system decomposition and the resulting subsystems, consider a
general support system that contains a system guard that monitors the flow of information
between two local area networks. The general support system, in this case, can be partitioned
into three subsystem components: (i) local area network Alpha; (ii) local area network Bravo; and
(iii) the system guard separating the two networks.31 When all subsystems within the information
system have completed the security certification process, an additional certification is performed
on the system-level security controls not covered by the individual subsystem certifications, and
the results are bundled together into the accreditation package and presented as evidence to the
authorizing official. Figure 2.2 illustrates the concept of information system decomposition and
the security certification and accreditation process for a large and complex system.

  Each subsystem component within the information system can be assigned a security categorization in accordance
with FIPS 199. The overall security categorization of the information system can be determined by taking the high
water mark of the security categorizations of the individual subsystem components.

________________________________________________________________________________________________


2.4 COMMON SECURITY CONTROLS
An agency-wide view of the security program facilitates the identification of common security
controls that can be applied to one or more agency information systems. Common security controls
can apply to: (i) all agency information systems; (ii) a group of information systems at a specific site
(sometimes associated with the terms site certification/accreditation); or (iii) common information
systems, subsystems, or applications (i.e., common hardware, software, and/or firmware) deployed at
multiple operational sites (sometimes associated with the terms type certification/accreditation).
Common security controls, typically identified during a collaborative agency-wide process with the
involvement of the Chief Information Officer, senior agency information security officer, authorizing
officials, information system owners, and information system security officers (and by developmental
program managers in the case of common security controls for common hardware, software, and/or
firmware) have the following properties:
•   The development, implementation, and assessment of common security controls can be assigned
    to responsible agency officials or organizational elements (other than the information system
    owners whose systems will implement or use those common security controls); and
•   The results from the assessment of the common security controls can be used to support the
    security certification and accreditation processes of agency information systems where those
    controls have been applied.

Many of the management and operational controls (e.g., contingency planning controls, incident
response controls, security training and awareness controls, personnel security controls, and
physical security controls) needed to protect an information system may be excellent candidates
for common security control status. The objective is to reduce security costs by centrally
managing the development, implementation, and assessment of the common security controls
designated by the agency—and subsequently, sharing assessment results with the owners of
information systems where those common security controls are applied. Security controls not
designated as common controls are considered system-specific controls and are the responsibility
of the information system owner. System security plans should clearly identify which security
controls have been designated as common security controls and which controls have been
designated as system-specific controls.

2.5 ACCREDITATION DECISIONS
Security accreditation decisions resulting from security certification and accreditation processes
should be conveyed to information system owners. To ensure the agency’s business and
operational needs are fully considered, the authorizing official should meet with the information
system owner prior to issuing the security accreditation decision to discuss the security
certification findings and the terms and conditions of the authorization. There are three types of
accreditation decisions that can be rendered by authorizing officials:
•   Authorization to operate;
•   Interim authorization to operate; and
•   Denial of authorization to operate.

Authorization to Operate
If, after assessing the results of the security certification, the authorizing official deems that the
risk to agency operations, agency assets, or individuals is acceptable, an authorization to operate
is issued for the information system. The information system is authorized without any
significant restrictions or limitations on its operation. Although not affecting the security



                                                  PAGE 19
Special Publication 800-37            Guide for the Security Certification and Accreditation of Federal Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________


accreditation decision, authorizing officials should take specific actions to reduce or eliminate
identified vulnerabilities, where it is cost-effective to do so. The information system owner
should establish a disciplined and structured process to monitor the effectiveness of the security
controls in the information system and the progress of any corrective actions on a continuous
basis. Security reaccreditation occurs at the discretion of the authorizing official when significant
changes have taken place in the information system or when a specified time period has elapsed
in accordance with federal or agency policy.

Interim Authorization to Operate
If, after assessing the results of the security certification, the authorizing official deems that the
risk to agency operations, agency assets, or individuals is unacceptable, but there is an
overarching mission necessity to place the information system into operation or continue its
operation, an interim authorization to operate may be issued. An interim authorization to operate
is rendered when the identified security vulnerabilities in the information system resulting from
deficiencies in the planned or implemented security controls are significant but can be addressed
in a timely manner.32 An interim authorization provides a limited authorization to operate the
information system under specific terms and conditions and acknowledges greater risk to the
agency for a specified period of time. The terms and conditions, established by the authorizing
official, convey limitations on information system operations.

In accordance with OMB policy, an information system is not accredited during the period of
limited authorization to operate. The duration established for an interim authorization to operate
should be commensurate with the risk to agency operations, agency assets, or individuals
associated with the operation of the information system. When the security-related deficiencies
have been adequately addressed, the interim authorization should be lifted and the information
system authorized to operate. Security reaccreditation occurs at the discretion of the authorizing
official when significant changes have taken place in the information system or when a specified
time period has elapsed in accordance with federal or agency policy. The time period for
reaccreditation is calculated from the date the information system receives its authorization to
operate.

The plan of action and milestones submitted by the information system owner is used by the
authorizing official to monitor the progress in correcting deficiencies noted during the security
certification. In addition to executing the plan of action and milestones, information system
owners should also establish a disciplined and structured process to monitor the effectiveness of
the security controls in the information system during the period of limited authorization to
operate. Monitoring activities should focus on the specific vulnerabilities in the information
system identified during the security certification. Significant changes in the security state of the
information system that occur during the period of limited authorization to operate should be
reported immediately to the authorizing official.




32
   Since information system owners are involved in the planning process that establishes timeframes for conducting
security certification and accreditation activities, they are in a good position to address security-related deficiencies in a
timely manner before the certification and accreditation process begins. Mitigating security vulnerabilities in the
information system as soon as possible before the vulnerabilities rise to higher levels of significance or seriousness
ensures that the interim authorization to operate remains a viable option. Information systems, especially mission-
critical or high-impact systems as described in FIPS 199, should not be operating with significant security
vulnerabilities requiring extended remediation time.



                                                          PAGE 20
Special Publication 800-37           Guide for the Security Certification and Accreditation of Federal Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________


Denial of Authorization to Operate
If, after assessing the results of the security certification, the authorizing official deems that the
risk to agency operations, agency assets, or individuals is unacceptable, the authorization to
operate the information system is denied. The information system is not accredited and should
not be placed into operation. If the information system is currently in operation, all activity
should be halted. Failure to receive authorization to operate, or an interim authorization to
operate, usually indicates that there are major deficiencies in the security controls in the
information system. The authorizing official or designated representative should work with the
information system owner to revise the plan of action and milestones to ensure that proactive
measures are taken to correct the security deficiencies in the information system.

Previous Authorizations
In the event that a new authorizing official is assigned responsibility for the information system,
the newly assigned authorizing official should review the current security accreditation package
(i.e., accreditation decision, decision rationale, and terms and conditions) and the current status
reports from the continuous monitoring process to determine if a reaccreditation action is
warranted. If the new authorizing official is willing to accept the currently documented risk, then
reaccreditation occurs only when there is a significant change to the information system or when
a specified time period has elapsed in accordance with federal or agency policy.

2.6 SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION
The security accreditation package documents the results of the security certification and
provides the authorizing official with the essential information needed to make a credible, risk-
based decision on whether to authorize operation of the information system. Unless specifically
designated otherwise by the Chief Information Officer or authorizing official, the information
system owner is responsible for the assembly, compilation, and submission of the security
accreditation package. The information system owner receives inputs from the information
system security officer, certification agent, and senior agency information security officer during
the preparation of the security accreditation package. The security accreditation package contains
the following documents:
•    Approved system security plan;33
•    Security assessment report; and
•    Plan of action and milestones.

The system security plan, prepared by the information system owner and previously approved by
the authorizing official and/or senior agency information security officer, provides an overview of
the security requirements for the information system and describes the security controls in place
or planned for meeting those requirements. The plan can also contain as supporting appendices
or as references, other key security-related documents for the information system such as the risk
assessment, privacy impact assessment, contingency plan, incident response plan, configuration
management plan, security configuration checklists, and any system interconnection agreements.

The security assessment report, prepared by the certification agent, provides the results of
assessing the security controls in the information system to determine the extent to which the
controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome
33
  The initial risk assessment, included as an appendix to the system security plan or referenced in the plan, is updated
by the information system owner prior to the final assembly of the security accreditation package.

________________________________________________________________________________________________


with respect to meeting the system security requirements. The security assessment report can
also contain a list of recommended corrective actions.

The plan of action and milestones, which is prepared by the information system owner, describes
the measures that have been implemented or planned: (i) to correct any deficiencies noted during
the assessment of the security controls; and (ii) to reduce or eliminate known vulnerabilities in the
information system. The information system owner submits the final security accreditation
package to the authorizing official or designated representative.34 Figure 2.3 illustrates the key
sections of the security accreditation package.

The security accreditation decision letter transmits the security accreditation decision from the
authorizing official to the information system owner. The authorizing official’s designated
representative prepares the final security accreditation decision letter for the authorizing official
with authorization recommendations, as appropriate. The security accreditation decision letter
contains the following information:
•    Security accreditation decision;
•    Supporting rationale for the decision; and
•    Terms and conditions for the authorization.

The security accreditation decision letter indicates to the information system owner whether the
system is: (i) authorized to operate; (ii) authorized to operate on an interim basis under strict
terms and conditions; or (iii) not authorized to operate. The supporting rationale provides the
information system owner with the justification for the authorizing official’s decision. The terms
and conditions for the authorization provide a description of any limitations or restrictions placed
on the operation of the information system that must be adhered to by the information system
owner. The security accreditation decision letter is attached to the original accreditation package
and returned to the information system owner.

Upon receipt of the security accreditation decision letter and accreditation package, the
information system owner accepts the terms and conditions of the authorization. The information

34
  Security accreditation packages can be submitted in either paper or electronic format. Appropriate measures should
be employed to protect the information contained in accreditation packages (electronic or paper format) in accordance
with agency policy.

system owner keeps the original security accreditation decision letter and accreditation package
on file. The authorizing official and senior agency information security officer also retain copies
of the security accreditation decision letter and accreditation package. The contents of security
certification and accreditation-related documentation (especially information dealing with
information system vulnerabilities) should be: (i) marked and protected appropriately in
accordance with agency policy; and (ii) retained in accordance with the agency’s record retention
policy.

2.7 CONTINUOUS MONITORING
A critical aspect of the security certification and accreditation process is the post-accreditation
period involving the continuous monitoring of security controls in the information system over
time. An effective continuous monitoring program requires:
•      Configuration management and configuration control processes;
•      Security impact analyses on changes to the information system; and
•      Assessment of selected security controls in the information system and security status
       reporting to appropriate agency officials.35

With regard to configuration management and control, it is important to document the proposed
or actual changes to the information system and to subsequently determine the impact of those
proposed or actual changes on the security of the system. Information systems will typically be
in a constant state of migration with upgrades to hardware, software, or firmware and possible
modifications to the surrounding environment where the system resides. Documenting
information system changes and assessing the potential impact those changes may have on the
security of the system is an essential aspect of continuous monitoring and maintaining the
security accreditation.

Realizing that it is not feasible or cost-effective to monitor all of the security controls in an
information system on a continuous basis, the information system owner should select an
appropriate subset of those controls for periodic assessment.36 The criteria established by the
information system owner for selecting which security controls will be monitored and for
determining the frequency of such monitoring activity should reflect the agency’s priorities and
importance of the information system to agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.37 The
authorizing official and the senior agency information security officer should approve the set of
security controls that are to be monitored on a continuous basis as well as the monitoring
frequency.

The results of continuous monitoring should be documented and reported to the authorizing
official and senior agency information security officer on a regular basis. The continuous
monitoring results should also be considered with respect to any necessary updates to the system
security plan and to the plan of action and milestones, since the authorizing official, senior
agency information security officer, information system owner, and certification agent will be
using these plans to guide future security certification and accreditation activities. The plan of

action and milestones should: (i) report progress made on the current outstanding items listed in
the plan; (ii) address vulnerabilities in the information system discovered during the security
impact analysis or security control monitoring; and (iii) describe how the information system
owner intends to address those vulnerabilities (i.e., reduce, eliminate, or accept the identified
vulnerabilities). The monitoring of security controls in the information system continues
throughout the system development life cycle. Reaccreditation occurs when there are significant
changes to the information system affecting the security of the system or when a specified time
period has elapsed in accordance with federal or agency policy.

CHAPTER THREE

THE PROCESS
PHASES AND TASKS ASSOCIATED WITH SECURITY CERTIFICATION AND ACCREDITATION




T
        he security certification and accreditation process consists of four distinct phases: (i) an
        Initiation Phase; (ii) a Security Certification Phase; (iii) a Security Accreditation Phase;
        and (iv) a Continuous Monitoring Phase. Each phase consists of a set of well-defined
tasks and subtasks that are to be carried out, as indicated, by responsible individuals (e.g., the
Chief Information Officer, authorizing official, authorizing official’s designated representative,
senior agency information security officer, information system owner, information owner,
information system security officer, certification agent, and user representatives). The security
certification and accreditation activities can be applied to an information system at appropriate
phases in the system development life cycle. Additionally, the activities can be tailored to apply a
level of effort and rigor that is most suitable for the information system undergoing security
certification and accreditation. Figure 3.1 provides a high-level view of the security certification
and accreditation process including the tasks associated with each phase in the process. A
summary table of all security certification and accreditation tasks and subtasks and the
individuals responsible for accomplishing those tasks and subtasks is provided in Appendix D.

Scalability of the Security Certification and Accreditation Process
There is a general expectation that the level of effort for security certification and accreditation
(expressed in terms of degree of rigor and formality) should be scalable to the FIPS 199 security
category of the information system. The concept is straightforward—the agency information




                                                  PAGE 25
Special Publication 800-37            Guide for the Security Certification and Accreditation of Federal Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________


systems with greater sensitivity and/or criticality have greater potential for adversely affecting
agency operations, agency assets, or individuals and therefore demand:
•    Greater protection through the application of stronger security controls; and
•    Greater scrutiny with regard to the assessment of those security controls to determine the
     extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing
     the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the system.

The FIPS 199 security category of an information system influences the initial selection of
security controls from NIST Special Publication 800-53 and the initial selection of assessment
methods and procedures from NIST Special Publication 800-53A. The level of effort applied to
the security certification and accreditation tasks and subtasks should be commensurate with the
strength of the security controls selected and the rigor and formality of the assessment methods
and procedures selected. The tasks outlined in this chapter apply to all FIPS 199 security
categories. However, the scalability of the security certification and accreditation process can be
applied to low-impact information systems. As stated in FIPS 199:

“For a low-impact information system, the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability could be
expected to have a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals. A limited
adverse effect means that, for example, the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability might: (i) cause
a degradation in mission capability to an extent and duration that the organization is able to perform its
primary functions, but the effectiveness of the functions is noticeably reduced; (ii) result in minor damage
to organizational assets; (iii) result in minor financial loss; or (iv) result in minor harm to individuals.”

Since the agency-level risk in operating a low-impact information system is minimal, by
definition, the level of effort applied to the security certification and accreditation of that system
should be commensurate with that level of risk. While all of the certification and accreditation
tasks apply to low-impact information systems, supplemental guidance is provided in the subtasks
to address the appropriate level of effort (i.e., degree of rigor and formality) for the certification
and accreditation process.38 The scalability of the certification and accreditation process for low-
impact systems results in the elimination of the independent certification agent, the incorporation
of self-assessment activities, and a reduction in the associated level of supporting documentation.

3.1 INITIATION PHASE
The Initiation Phase consists of three tasks: (i) preparation; (ii) notification and resource
identification; and (iii) system security plan analysis, update, and acceptance. The purpose of this
phase is to ensure that the authorizing official and senior agency information security officer are
in agreement with the contents of the system security plan, including the system’s documented
security requirements, before the certification agent begins the assessment of the security controls
in the information system. The early involvement of the authorizing official and senior agency
information security officer, with key participants such as the information system owner,
information owner, information system security officer, certification agent, and user
representatives, is paramount to the success of the security certification and accreditation effort.
A significant portion of the information needed for the Initiation Phase should have been
previously generated by the information system owner during: (i) the initial risk assessment; (ii)

38
  Supplemental guidance is not provided for all subtasks in the certification and accreditation process. Guidance for
scaling the level of effort applied to the development of system security plans, the selection of security controls, and the
conduct of risk assessments is beyond the scope of this publication.

the development of the system security plan; and (iii) the conduct of previous assessments (e.g.,
security testing and evaluation, independent verification and validation, independent audits). For
new information systems or systems undergoing major upgrades, this information is typically
produced during the initiation phase of the system development life cycle when system
requirements are established. For legacy systems currently in the operations and maintenance
phase of the system development life cycle, this information is obtained from the most recent
system security plans and risk assessments. In most cases, risk assessments and system security
plans have been previously reviewed and approved by agency officials. Thus, the subtasks in
Task 1 (preparation task) should not require any additional work on the part of the information
system owner above and beyond what has already been accomplished as part of the system
development life cycle. Rather, the Initiation Phase of the security certification and accreditation
process serves as a checkpoint to confirm that the system security plan and risk assessment have
been completed. If an information system owner has not completed a risk assessment and a
system security plan, those activities should be completed prior to proceeding with the security
certification and accreditation process.

TASK 1: PREPARATION
The objective of the preparation task is to prepare for security certification and accreditation by
reviewing the system security plan and confirming that the contents of the plan are consistent
with an initial assessment of risk.

INFORMATION SYSTEM DESCRIPTION


SUBTASK 1.1:        Confirm that the information system has been fully described and documented in the
                    system security plan or an equivalent document.
                                                                          39
                    RESPONSIBILITY: Information System Owner.

                    GUIDANCE: A typical system description includes: (i) the name of the information
                    system; (ii) a unique identifier for the information system; (iii) the status of the
                    information system with respect to the system development life cycle; (iv) the name
                    and location of the organization responsible for the information system; (v) contact
                    information for the information system owner or other individuals knowledgeable
                    about the information system; (vi) contact information for the individual(s)
                    responsible for the security of the information system; (vii) the purpose, functions,
                    and capabilities of the information system; (viii) the types of information processed,
                    stored, and transmitted by the information system; (ix) the boundary of the
                    information system for operational authorization (or security accreditation); (x) the
                    functional requirements of the information system; (xi) the applicable laws,
                    directives, policies, regulations, or standards affecting the security of the information
                    and the information system; (xii) the individuals who use and support the information
                    system (including their organizational affiliations, access rights, privileges, and
                    citizenship, if applicable); (xiii) the architecture of the information system; (xiv)
                    hardware and firmware devices (including wireless); (xv) system and applications
                    software (including mobile code); (xvi) hardware, software, and system interfaces
                    (internal and external); (xvii) information flows (i.e., inputs and outputs); (xviii) the

39
   Agencies have significant flexibility in assigning security certification and accreditation responsibilities. Some
agencies may employ a shared model of responsibility with the senior agency information security officer called upon
to assist the information system owner in carrying out security certification and accreditation tasks/subtasks. The
delineation and assignment of specific security certification and accreditation responsibilities is handled by agencies on
a case-by-case basis in accordance with their organizational structures.

                   network topology; (xix) network connection rules for communicating with external
                   information systems; (xx) interconnected information systems and unique identifiers
                   for those systems; (xxi) encryption techniques used for information processing,
                   transmission, and storage; (xxii) public key infrastructures, certificate authorities, and
                   certificate practice statements; (xxiii) the physical environment in which the
                   information system operates; and (xxiv) web protocols and distributed, collaborative
                   computing environments (processes, and applications). The level of detail provided
                   in the system security plan depends on the availability of information to the
                   organization preparing the plan and is also commensurate with the FIPS 199 security
                   category of the information system (i.e., the level of detail in the system security plan
                   increases as the potential impact on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals
                   increases). Descriptive information about the information system is typically
                   documented in the system identification section of the system security plan or in
                   some cases, included in attachments to the plan. System identification information
                   can also be provided by reference.

SECURITY CATEGORIZATION


SUBTASK 1.2:       Confirm that the security category of the information system has been determined
                   and documented in the system security plan or an equivalent document.
                   RESPONSIBILITY: Information System Owner.

                   GUIDANCE: Consult NIST Special Publication 800-59 to confirm that the information
                   system is other than a national security system. For other than national security
                   systems, FIPS 199 establishes three potential impact levels (low, moderate, and high)
                   for each of the stated security objectives (confidentiality, integrity, and availability)
                   relevant to securing federal information systems. These impact levels focus on the
                   potential impact and magnitude of harm that the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or
                   availability would have on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals. It is
                   recognized that an information system may contain more than one type of
                   information (e.g., privacy information, medical information, proprietary information,
                   financial information, contractor sensitive information, system security information),
                   each of which is subject to security categorization. The security category of an
                   information system that processes, stores, or transmits multiple types of information
                   should be at least the highest impact level that has been determined for each type of
                   information for each security objective of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
                   The FIPS 199 security category should be considered during the risk assessment to
                   help guide the information system owner’s selection of security controls for the
                   information system. Security categorization information is typically documented in
                   the system identification section of the system security plan or included as an
                   attachment to the plan.

THREAT IDENTIFICATION


SUBTASK 1.3:       Confirm that potential threats that could exploit information system flaws or
                   weaknesses have been identified and documented in the system security plan, risk
                   assessment, or an equivalent document.
                   RESPONSIBILITY: Information System Owner.

                   GUIDANCE: It is important to consider all potential threats that could cause harm to an
                   information system, ultimately affecting the confidentiality, integrity, or availability
                   of the system. Threats can be natural (floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, landslides,
                   avalanches, electrical storms), human (events that are either enabled by or caused by
                   human beings), or environmental (long-term power failures, pollution, chemicals,
                   liquid leakage). It should be noted that all possible threats that might be encountered
                   in the environment need not be listed—only those that are relevant to the security of
                   the information system. Threat information (including capabilities, intentions, and
                   resources of potential adversaries) for a specific information system is generally
                   nonspecific or incomplete at best. Recognizing the highly networked nature of the
                   current federal computing environment, there exists an acknowledged set of baseline
                   threats to all information systems. In other words, in today's interconnected and
                   interdependent information systems environment, which encompasses many common
                   platforms and technologies, there is a high likelihood of a variety of threats (both
                   intentional and unintentional) acting to compromise the security of agency
                   information systems. In addition to this generalized assumption about threats,
                   specific threat information, if available, should be used during the risk assessment to
                   help guide the selection of security controls for the information system. Threat
                   information should be coordinated with the senior agency information security
                   officer and authorizing official to facilitate reuse and sharing with other information
                   system owners, agency-wide. The level of effort (i.e., degree of rigor and formality)
                   applied to the threat identification process should be commensurate with the FIPS
                   199 security category of the information system (i.e., the level of effort increases as
                   the potential impact on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals increases).
                   Threat identification information is typically documented in the risk assessment,
                   which should be included in the system security plan either by reference or as an
                   attachment.

VULNERABILITY IDENTIFICATION


SUBTASK 1.4:       Confirm that flaws or weaknesses in the information system that could be exploited
                   by potential threat sources have been identified and documented in the system
                   security plan, risk assessment, or an equivalent document.
                   RESPONSIBILITY: Information System Owner.

                   GUIDANCE: Flaws or weaknesses in an information system that could be exploited by
                   potential threats determine the potential vulnerabilities in that system. Vulnerability
                   identification can be conducted at any phase in the system development life cycle. If
                   the system is under development, the search for vulnerabilities focuses on the
                   organization’s security policies, planned security procedures, system requirement
                   definitions, and developer security product analyses. If the system is being
                   implemented, the identification of vulnerabilities is expanded to include more
                   specific information, such as the planned security features described in the security



                                                   PAGE 29

________________________________________________________________________________________________


                   design documentation and the results of the developmental security test and
                   evaluation. If the system is operational, the process of identifying vulnerabilities
                   includes an analysis of the system security controls employed to protect the system.
                   The identification of vulnerabilities can be accomplished in a variety of ways using
                   questionnaires, on-site interviews, document reviews, and automated scanning tools.
                   Vulnerability sources include, for example: (i) previous risk assessment
                   documentation; (ii) audit reports; (iii) system anomaly reports; (iv) security reviews;
                   (v) self assessments; (vi) results of vulnerability scans and penetration tests; (vii)
                   security test and evaluation reports; (viii) previous assessment reports from security
                   certifications; (ix) vulnerability lists; (x) security advisories; (xi) vendor advisories;
                   (xii) commercial computer incident/emergency response teams and post lists; (xiii)
                   information security vulnerability alerts and bulletins; and (xiv) hardware, software,
                   or firmware security analyses. Vulnerability information associated with system-
                   specific and common security controls should be coordinated with the senior agency
                   information security officer and authorizing officials to facilitate reuse and sharing
                   with other information system owners agency-wide. The level of effort (i.e., degree
                   of rigor and formality) applied to the vulnerability identification process should be
                   commensurate with the FIPS 199 security category of the information system (i.e.,
                   the level of effort increases as the potential impact on agency operations, agency
                   assets, or individuals increases). Vulnerability identification information is typically
                   documented in the risk assessment report, which should be included in the system
                   security plan either by reference or as an attachment.

SECURITY CONTROL IDENTIFICATION


SUBTASK 1.5:       Confirm that the security controls (either planned or implemented) for the
                   information system have been identified and documented in the system security plan
                   or an equivalent document.
                   RESPONSIBILITY: Information System Owner.

                   GUIDANCE: Security controls for information systems are listed in NIST Special
                   Publication 800-53, Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information
                   Systems. These predefined sets of security controls (targeted to the security
                   categories defined in FIPS 199) provide a baseline or starting point for agencies in
                   addressing the necessary safeguards and countermeasures required for their
                   information systems. Common security controls should be identified during a
                   collaborative agency-wide process with the involvement of the senior agency
                   information security officer, authorizing officials, information system owners, and
                   information system security officers (or by the developmental program manager in
                   the case of common security controls for common hardware software and/or
                   firmware). Agencies should perform additional analyses to determine if adjustments
                   to the baseline set of security controls are needed. These adjustments to the baseline
                   set of security controls should be based on specific threat and vulnerability
                   information generated during the risk assessment for the information system and the
                   agency's determination of acceptable risk. Adjustments to the baseline set of security
                   controls should be reasonable, appropriate, and fully documented in the system
                   security plan with supporting rationale. Upon completion of the security control
                   identification process, the agreed-upon set of controls should adequately protect the
                   confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system and its information. The level
                   of effort (i.e., degree of rigor and formality) applied to the security control selection

                   process should be commensurate with the FIPS 199 security category of the
                   information system (i.e., the level of effort increases as the potential impact on
                   agency operations, agency assets, or individuals increases). Security controls are
                   typically documented in the system security plan.

INITIAL RISK DETERMINATION


SUBTASK 1.6:       Confirm that the risk to agency operations, agency assets, or individuals has been
                   determined and documented in the system security plan, risk assessment, or an
                   equivalent document.
                   RESPONSIBILITY: Information System Owner.

                   GUIDANCE: FISMA and OMB Circular A-130, Appendix III, require risk assessments
                   as part of a risk-based approach to determining adequate, cost-effective security for
                   an information system. The methods used to assess risk should include consideration
                   of the major factors in risk management including: (i) threats to and vulnerabilities in
                   the information system; (ii) potential impact and magnitude of harm to agency
                   operations, agency assets, or individuals that could result from the unauthorized
                   access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of information and
                   the information system; and (iii) the effectiveness of current or proposed security
                   controls. It is impractical, in most cases, to plan for or implement security controls
                   that address all potential vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities resulting from the absence of
                   security controls or the ineffectiveness of controls (i.e., controls not implemented
                   correctly, not operating as intended, or not producing the desired outcome with
                   respect to meeting system security requirements) provide the basis for determining
                   the agency-level risk posed by the operation of the information system. The level of
                   effort (i.e., degree of rigor and formality) applied to the risk assessment should be
                   commensurate with the FIPS 199 security category of the information system (i.e.,
                   the level of effort increases as the potential impact on agency operations, agency
                   assets, or individuals increases). Assessing agency-level risk should be an ongoing
                   activity to ensure that as new threats and vulnerabilities are identified, adequate
                   security controls are implemented. Agency-level risk is typically documented in the
                   risk assessment, which should be included in the system security plan either by
                   reference or as an attachment.

                   Publication 800-30, or equivalent.

TASK 2: NOTIFICATION AND RESOURCE IDENTIFICATION
The objective of the notification and resource identification task is to: (i) provide notification to
all concerned agency officials as to the impending security certification and accreditation of the
information system; (ii) determine the resources needed to carry out the effort; and (iii) prepare a
plan of execution for the certification and accreditation activities indicating the proposed schedule
and key milestones.

NOTIFICATION


SUBTASK 2.1:       Inform the senior agency information security officer, authorizing official,
                   certification agent, user representatives, and other interested agency officials that the
                   information system requires security certification and accreditation support.
                   RESPONSIBILITY: Information System Owner.

                   GUIDANCE: The initial notification of key agency officials is an important activity to
                   establish the security certification and accreditation process as an integral part of the
                   system development life cycle. The notification also serves as an early warning to
                   help prepare potential participants for the upcoming tasks that will be necessary to
                   plan, organize, and conduct the security certification and accreditation. In some
                   instances, the authorizing official or senior agency information security officer
                   provides the initial notification to the information system owner and other key
                   agency officials. This typically occurs when a specified time period has elapsed and
                   the information system must undergo reaccreditation in accordance with federal or
                   agency policy.
                   Supplemental Guidance for Low-Impact Systems: For low-impact systems, a simplified
                   notification procedure is recommended. The information system owner notifies the
                   authorizing official and senior agency information security officer that a self-assessment
                   of the information system security controls is planned and provides an estimated
                   completion date.
                   REFERENCE: OMB Circular A-130, Appendix III.

PLANNING AND RESOURCES


SUBTASK 2.2:       Determine the level of effort and resources required for the security certification and
                   accreditation of the information system (including organizations involved) and
                   prepare a plan of execution.
                   RESPONSIBILITY: Authorizing Official; Senior Agency Information Security Officer;
                   Information System Owner; Certification Agent.
                   GUIDANCE: The level of effort required for security certification depends on: (i) the
                   size and complexity of the information system; (ii) the FIPS 199 security category of
                   the system; (iii) the security controls employed to protect the system; and (iv) the
                   specific methods and procedures used to assess the security controls in the system to
                   determine the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as
                   intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security
                   requirements for the system. Identifying appropriate resources (e.g., supporting
                   organizations, funding, and individuals with critical skills) needed for the security
                   certification effort is an essential aspect of the initial preparation activities and is
                   typically integrated within the system development life cycle and capital planning
                   and budgeting processes. Once a certification agent is selected (or certification
                   services procured), an execution plan for conducting the security certification and
                   accreditation is prepared by the certification agent and approved by the information
                   system owner, authorizing official, and senior agency information security officer.
                   The execution plan contains specific tasks, milestones, and delivery schedule. This
                   information can be included in a system development/change plan during the
                   initiation phase of the system development life cycle and need not be repeated in a
                   separate plan of execution.
                   Supplemental Guidance for Low-Impact Systems: For low-impact systems, a simplified
                   planning procedure is recommended. The information system owner estimates the level of

                   effort required for a self-assessment of the information system security controls. The
                   authorizing official, senior agency information security officer, and independent
                   certification agent are not required to participate in the process.
                   REFERENCE: OMB Circular A-130, Appendix III.

TASK 3: SYSTEM SECURITY PLAN ANALYSIS, UPDATE, AND ACCEPTANCE
The objective of the system security plan analysis, update, and acceptance task is to: (i) perform
an independent review of the FIPS 199 security categorization; (ii) obtain an independent analysis
of the system security plan; (iii) update the system security plan as needed based on the results of
the independent analysis; and (iv) obtain acceptance of the system security plan by the
authorizing official and senior agency information security officer prior to conducting an
assessment of the security controls in the information system. The completion of this task
concludes the Initiation Phase of the security certification and accreditation process.

SECURITY CATEGORIZATION REVIEW


SUBTASK 3.1:       Review the FIPS 199 security categorization described in the system security plan to
                   determine if the assigned impact values with respect to the potential loss of
                   confidentiality, integrity, and availability are consistent with agency’s actual mission
                   requirements.
                   RESPONSIBILITY: Authorizing Official; Senior Agency Information Security Officer;
                   Certification Agent.
                   GUIDANCE: FIPS 199 is used as part of an agency’s risk management program to help
                   ensure that appropriate security controls are applied to each information system and
                   that the controls are adequately assessed to determine the extent to which the controls
                   are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome
                   with respect to meeting the system security requirements. The review of the security
                   categorization ensures that the information system owner has adequately reflected the
                   importance (including criticality and sensitivity) of the information system in
                   supporting the operations and assets of the agency. Independent review of the
                   security categorization by the certification agent, authorizing official, and senior
                   agency information security officer is performed as needed to ensure appropriate
                   categorization.
                   Supplemental Guidance for Low-Impact Systems: For low-impact systems, an independent
                   certification agent is not required to participate in the process.
                   REFERENCES: FIPS 199; NIST Special Publication 800-60, or equivalent.

SYSTEM SECURITY PLAN ANALYSIS

SUBTASK 3.2:       Analyze the system security plan to determine if the vulnerabilities in the information
                   system and the resulting risk to agency operations, agency assets, or individuals are
                   actually what the plan would produce, if implemented.
                   RESPONSIBILITY: Authorizing Official; Senior Agency Information Security Officer;
                   Certification Agent.
                   GUIDANCE: The system security plan provides an overview of the information system
                   security requirements and describes the security controls in place or planned for
                   meeting those requirements. The independent review of the system security plan by
                   the certification agent, authorizing official, and senior agency information security
                   officer determines if the plan is complete and consistent with the requirements

________________________________________________________________________________________________


                   document for the information system. The certification agent, authorizing official,
                   and senior agency information security officer also determine, at the level of analysis
                   possible only with available planning or operational documents and information from
                   the risk assessment, if the vulnerabilities in the information system and resulting
                   agency-level risk appear to be correct and reasonable. Based on the results of this
                   independent review and analysis, the certification agent, authorizing official and
                   senior agency information security officer may recommend changes to the system
                   security plan. Whenever possible, these changes should be reflected in the
                   requirements document for the information system.
                   Supplemental Guidance for Low-Impact Systems: For low-impact systems, a simplified
                   review process is recommended. The authorizing official and senior agency information
                   security officer conduct a limited review of the system security plan to determine the
                   validity of the plan. Minimal analysis is required. An independent certification agent is
                   not required to participate in the process.
                   REFERENCE: NIST Special Publication 800-18, or equivalent.

SYSTEM SECURITY PLAN UPDATE

SUBTASK 3.3:       Update the system security plan based on the results of the independent analysis and
                   recommendations of the certification agent, authorizing official, and senior agency
                   information security officer.
                   RESPONSIBILITY: Information System Owner.

                   GUIDANCE: The information system owner reviews the changes recommended by the
                   certification agent, authorizing official, and senior agency information security
                   officer and consults with other agency representatives (e.g., information owner,
                   information system security officer, or user representatives) prior to making any final
                   modifications to the system security plan. The modifications to the system security
                   plan may include any of the areas described in Task 1 (e.g., adjusting security
                   controls, changing vulnerabilities, or modifying the agency-level risk).
                   Supplemental Guidance for Low-Impact Systems: For low-impact systems, an independent
                   certification agent is not required to participate in the process.
                   REFERENCE: NIST Special Publication 800-18, or equivalent.

SYSTEM SECURITY PLAN ACCEPTANCE


SUBTASK 3.4:       Review the system security plan to determine if the risk to agency operations, agency
                   assets, or individuals is acceptable.
                   RESPONSIBILITY: Authorizing Official; Senior Agency Information Security Officer.

                   GUIDANCE: If the agency-level risk described in the system security plan (or risk
                   assessment) is deemed unacceptable, the authorizing official and senior agency
                   information security officer send the plan back to the information system owner for
                   appropriate action. If the agency-level risk described in the system security plan (or
                   risk assessment) is deemed acceptable, the authorizing official and senior agency
                   information security officer accept the plan. The acceptance of the system security
                   plan and agency-level risk assessment represents an important milestone in the
                   security certification and accreditation of the information system. The authorizing
                   official and senior agency information security officer, by accepting the system
                   security plan, are agreeing to the set of security controls proposed to meet the
                   security requirements for the information system. This agency-level agreement
                   allows the security certification and accreditation process to advance to the next

________________________________________________________________________________________________


                      phase (i.e., the actual assessment of the security controls). The acceptance of the
                      system security plan also approves the level of effort and resources required to
                      successfully complete the associated security certification and accreditation
                      activities.
                      Supplemental Guidance for Low-Impact Systems: For low-impact systems, a simplified
                      review process is recommended. The authorizing official and senior agency information
                      security officer conduct a limited review of the system security plan to determine the
                      acceptability of agency-level risk. Minimal analysis is required.
                      REFERENCE: NIST Special Publication 800-30, or equivalent.



     Key Milestone:
     The following questions should be answered before proceeding to the Security Certification Phase—
     −   Does the FIPS 199 security category of the information system described in the system
         security plan appear to be correct?
     −   Have the resources required to successfully complete the security certification and
         accreditation of the information system been identified and allocated?
     −   Does the risk to agency operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation),
         agency assets, or individuals described in the system security plan appear to be correct?
     −   Having decided that the agency-level risk appears to be correct, would this risk be
         acceptable?




3.2 SECURITY CERTIFICATION PHASE
The Security Certification Phase consists of two tasks: (i) security control assessment; and (ii)
security certification documentation. The purpose of this phase is to determine the extent to
which the security controls in the information system are implemented correctly, operating as
intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements
for the system. This phase also addresses specific actions taken or planned to correct deficiencies
in the security controls and to reduce or eliminate known vulnerabilities in the information
system. Upon successful completion of this phase, the authorizing official will have the
information needed from the security certification to determine the risk to agency operations,
agency assets, or individuals—and thus will be able to render an appropriate security
accreditation decision for the information system.

TASK 4: SECURITY CONTROL ASSESSMENT
The objective of the security control assessment task is to: (i) prepare for the assessment of the
security controls in the information system; (ii) conduct the assessment of the security controls;
and (iii) document the results of the assessment. Preparation for security assessment involves
gathering appropriate planning and supporting materials, system requirements and design
documentation, security control implementation evidence, and results from previous security
assessments, security reviews, or audits. Preparation also involves developing specific methods
and procedures to assess the security controls in the information system. The certification agent,40
at the completion of this task, will be able to determine the extent to which the security controls

40
  The information system owner may assume the role of the independent certification agent when a self-assessment of
the information system security controls is appropriate. The information system owner may also seek the assistance of
other designated individuals (including contractors) in carrying out self-assessment activities.

in the information system are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the
desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the information system.
The certification agent will also be in a position to make recommendations on corrective actions
for security control deficiencies and offer advice to the information system owner and authorizing
official on how the known vulnerabilities in the system translate into agency-level risk.

DOCUMENTATION AND SUPPORTING MATERIALS


SUBTASK 4.1:       Assemble any documentation and supporting materials necessary for the assessment
                   of the security controls in the information system; if these documents include
                   previous assessments of security controls, review the findings, results, and evidence.
                   RESPONSIBILITY: Information System Owner; Certification Agent.

                   GUIDANCE: The information system owner should assist the certification agent in
                   gathering all relevant documents and supporting materials from the agency that will
                   be required during the assessment of the security controls. Descriptive information
                   about the information system is typically documented in the system identification
                   section of the system security plan or in some cases, included by reference or as
                   attachments to the plan. Supporting materials such as procedures, reports, logs, and
                   records showing evidence of security control implementation should be identified as
                   well. Assessing the security controls in an information system can be a very costly
                   and time-consuming process. In order to make the security certification and
                   accreditation process as timely and cost-effective as possible, the reuse of previous
                   evaluation results, when reasonable and appropriate, is strongly recommended. For
                   example, a recent audit of an information system may have produced important
                   information about the effectiveness of selected security controls. Another
                   opportunity, as appropriate, to reuse previous assessment results comes from
                   programs that test and evaluate the security features of commercial information
                   technology products. And finally, if prior assessment results from the system
                   developer are available, the certification agent, under appropriate circumstances may
                   incorporate those results into the security certification. Certification agents should
                   maximize the use of previous assessment results in determining the extent to which
                   the security controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing
                   the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the system.

                   system owner may employ the services of the information system security officer or other
                   designated individuals (including contractors) to assist in: (i) the assembly of
                   documentation and supporting materials necessary for a self-assessment of the
                   information system security controls; and (ii) the review of findings, results, and evidence
                   from previous assessments of the security controls. An independent certification agent is
                   not required to participate in the process.

                   GUIDANCE: In lieu of developing unique or specialized methods and procedures to
                   assess the security controls in the information system, certification agents should
                   consult NIST Special Publication 800-53A, which provides standardized methods
                   and procedures for assessing the security controls listed in NIST Special Publication
                   800-53. The certification agent, if so directed by the information system owner,
                   authorizing official, or senior agency information security officer, can supplement
                   these assessment methods and procedures. Assessment methods and procedures may
                   need to be created for those security controls employed by the agency that are not
                   contained in NIST Special Publication 800-53. Additionally, assessment methods
                   and procedures may need to be tailored for specific system implementations.
                   Supplemental Guidance for Low-Impact Systems: For low-impact systems, the information
                   system owner may employ the services of the information system security officer or other
                   designated individuals (including contractors) to select or develop when needed, the
                   appropriate methods and procedures necessary to conduct a self-assessment of the
                   information system security controls. An independent certification agent is not required
                   to participate in the process.

SECURITY ASSESSMENT


SUBTASK 4.3:       Assess the management, operational, and technical security controls in the
                   information system using methods and procedures selected or developed.
                   RESPONSIBILITY: Certification Agent.

                   GUIDANCE: Security assessment determines the extent to which the security controls
                   are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome
                   with respect to meeting the security requirements for the system. The results of the
                   security assessment, including recommendations for correcting any deficiencies in
                   the security controls, are documented in the security assessment report.
                   Supplemental Guidance for Low-Impact Systems: For low-impact systems, the information
                   system owner may employ the services of the information system security officer or other
                   designated individuals (including contractors) to conduct a self-assessment of the
                   information system security controls. An independent certification agent is not required
                   to participate in the process.
                   REFERENCE: NIST Special Publication 800-53A, or equivalent.

SECURITY ASSESSMENT REPORT


SUBTASK 4.4:       Prepare the final security assessment report.
                   RESPONSIBILITY: Certification Agent.

                   GUIDANCE: The security assessment report contains: (i) the results of the security
                   assessment (i.e., the determination of the extent to which the security controls are
                   implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome
                   with respect to meeting the security requirements for the system); and (ii)
                   recommendations for correcting deficiencies in the security controls and reducing or
                   eliminating identified vulnerabilities. The security assessment report is part of the
                   final accreditation package along with the updated system security plan and plan of
                   action and milestones. The security assessment report is the certification agent’s
                   statement regarding the security status of the information system.

                   Supplemental Guidance for Low-Impact Systems: For low-impact systems, the information
                   system owner may employ the services of the information system security officer or other
                   designated individuals (including contractors) to prepare the security assessment report
                   containing the results of the self-assessment of the information system security controls.
                   The security assessment report can be a short and concise document synopsizing the self-
                   assessment results and highlighting those areas that need further attention. An
                   independent certification agent is not required to participate in the process.
                   REFERENCE: NIST Special Publication 800-53A, or equivalent.

TASK 5: SECURITY CERTIFICATION DOCUMENTATION
The objective of the security certification documentation task is to: (i) provide the certification
findings and recommendations to the information system owner; (ii) update the system security
plan as needed; (iii) prepare the plan of action and milestones; and (iv) assemble the accreditation
package. The information system owner has an opportunity to reduce or eliminate vulnerabilities
in the information system prior to the assembly and compilation of the accreditation package and
submission to the authorizing official. This is accomplished by implementing corrective actions
recommended by the certification agent. The certification agent should assess any security
controls modified, enhanced, or added during this process. The completion of this task concludes
the Security Certification Phase.

FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS


SUBTASK 5.1:       Provide the information system owner with the security assessment report.
                   RESPONSIBILITY: Certification Agent.

                   GUIDANCE: The information system owner relies on the security expertise and the
                   technical judgment of the certification agent to: (i) assess the security controls in the
                   information system; and (ii) provide specific recommendations on how to correct
                   deficiencies in the controls and reduce or eliminate identified vulnerabilities. The
                   information system owner may choose to act on selected recommendations of the
                   certification agent before the accreditation package is finalized if there are specific
                   opportunities to correct deficiencies in security controls and reduce or eliminate
                   vulnerabilities in the information system. To ensure effective allocation of resources
                   agency-wide, any actions taken by the information system owner prior to the final
                   accreditation decision should be coordinated with the authorizing official and senior
                   agency information security officer. The certification agent assesses any changes
                   made to the security controls in response to corrective actions by the information
                   system owner and updates the assessment report, as appropriate.
                   Supplemental Guidance for Low-Impact Systems: For low-impact systems, the information
                   system security officer or other designated individuals (including contractors) provide
                   the information system owner with the security assessment report containing the
                   summarized results of the self-assessment of the information system security controls. An
                   independent certification agent is not required to participate in the process.
                   REFERENCE: NIST Special Publication 800-30, or equivalent.

SYSTEM SECURITY PLAN UPDATE


SUBTASK 5.2:       Update the system security plan (and risk assessment) based on the results of the
                   security assessment and any modifications to the security controls in the information
                   system.
                   RESPONSIBILITY: Information System Owner.

Special Publication 800-37        Guide for the Security Certification and Accreditation of Federal Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________


                   GUIDANCE: The system security plan should reflect the actual state of the security
                   controls after the security assessment and any modifications by the information
                   system owner in addressing the recommendations for corrective actions from the
                   certification agent. At the completion of the Security Certification Phase, the security
                   plan and risk assessment should contain an accurate list and description of the
                   security controls implemented and a list of identified vulnerabilities (i.e., controls not
                   implemented).
                   Supplemental Guidance for Low-Impact Systems: For low-impact systems, an independent
                   certification agent is not required to participate in the process.
                   REFERENCE: NIST Special Publication 800-18, or equivalent.

PLAN OF ACTION AND MILESTONES PREPARATION


SUBTASK 5.3:       Prepare the plan of action and milestones based on the results of the security
                   assessment.
                   RESPONSIBILITY: Information System Owner.

                   GUIDANCE: The plan of action and milestones document, one of the three key
                   documents in the security accreditation package, describes actions taken or planned
                   by the information system owner to correct deficiencies in the security controls and
                   to address remaining vulnerabilities in the information system (i.e., reduce, eliminate,
                   or accept the vulnerabilities). The plan of actions and milestones document
                   identifies: (i) the tasks needing to be accomplished; (ii) the resources required to
                   accomplish the elements of the plan; (iii) any milestones in meeting the tasks; and
                   (iv) scheduled completion dates for the milestones.
                   Supplemental Guidance for Low-Impact Systems: None.

                   REFERENCE: OMB Memorandum 02-01.

ACCREDITATION PACKAGE ASSEMBLY


SUBTASK 5.4:       Assemble the final security accreditation package and submit to authorizing official.
                   RESPONSIBILITY: Information System Owner.

                   GUIDANCE: The information system owner is responsible for the assembly and
                   compilation of the final security accreditation package with inputs from the
                   information system security officer and the certification agent. The accreditation
                   package contains: (i) the security assessment report from the certification agent
                   providing the results of the independent assessment of the security controls and
                   recommendations for corrective actions; (ii) the plan of action and milestones from
                   the information system owner indicating actions taken or planned to correct
                   deficiencies in the controls and to reduce or eliminate vulnerabilities in the
                   information system; and (iii) the updated system security plan with the latest copy of
                   the risk assessment. Certification agent input to the final accreditation package
                   provides an unbiased and independent view of the extent to which the security
                   controls in the information system are implemented correctly, operating as intended,
                   and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the system security
                   requirements. The information system owner may also wish to consult with other key
                   agency participants (e.g., the user representatives) prior to submitting the final
                   accreditation package to the authorizing official. The authorizing official will use this
                   information during the Security Accreditation Phase to determine the risk to agency
                   operations, agency assets, or individuals. The accreditation package can be submitted



                                                    PAGE 39

________________________________________________________________________________________________


                   in either paper or electronic form. The contents of the accreditation package should
                   be protected appropriately in accordance with agency policy.
                   Supplemental Guidance for Low-Impact Systems: For low-impact systems, the security
                   accreditation package consists of: (i) the updated system security plan; (ii) an
                   abbreviated security assessment report (i.e., a brief summary of the self-assessment
                   results); and (iii) a plan of action and milestones.
                   REFERENCE: OMB Circular A-130, Appendix III.



 Key Milestone:
 The following questions should be answered before proceeding to the Security Accreditation Phase—
 −    To what extent are the security controls in the information system implemented correctly,
      operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the
      security requirements for the system?

 −    What specific actions have been taken or are planned to correct deficiencies in the security
      controls and to reduce or eliminate known vulnerabilities in the information system?




3.3 SECURITY ACCREDITATION PHASE
The Security Accreditation Phase consists of two tasks: (i) security accreditation decision; and (ii)
security accreditation documentation. The purpose of this phase is to determine if the remaining
known vulnerabilities in the information system (after the implementation of an agreed-upon set
of security controls) pose an acceptable level of risk to agency operations, agency assets, or
individuals. Upon successful completion of this phase, the information system owner will have:
(i) authorization to operate the information system; (ii) an interim authorization to operate the
information system under specific terms and conditions; or (iii) denial of authorization to operate
the information system.

TASK 6: SECURITY ACCREDITATION DECISION
The objective of the security accreditation decision task is to: (i) determine the risk to agency
operations, agency assets, or individuals; and (ii) determine if the agency-level risk is acceptable.
The authorizing official, working with information from the information system owner,
information system security officer, and certification agent produced during the previous phase,
has independent confirmation of the identified vulnerabilities in the information system and a list
of planned or completed corrective actions to reduce or eliminate those vulnerabilities. It is this
information that is used to determine the final risk to the agency and the acceptability of that risk.

FINAL RISK DETERMINATION


SUBTASK 6.1:       Determine the risk to agency operations, agency assets, or individuals based on the
                   vulnerabilities in the information system and any planned or completed corrective
                   actions to reduce or eliminate those vulnerabilities.
                   RESPONSIBILITY: Authorizing Official.

                   GUIDANCE: The authorizing official receives the final security accreditation package
                   from the information system owner. The vulnerabilities in the information system
                   confirmed by the certification agent should be assessed to determine how those
                   particular vulnerabilities translate into risk to agency operations, agency assets, or
                   individuals. The authorizing official or designated representative should judge which



                                                    PAGE 40
Special Publication 800-37        Guide for the Security Certification and Accreditation of Federal Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________


                   information system vulnerabilities are of greatest concern to the agency and which
                   vulnerabilities can be tolerated without creating unreasonable agency-level risk. The
                   plan of action and milestones (i.e., actions taken or planned to correct deficiencies in
                   the security controls and reduce or eliminate vulnerabilities) submitted by the
                   information system owner should also be considered in determining the risk to the
                   agency. The authorizing official may consult the information system owner,
                   certification agent, or other agency officials before making the final risk
                   determination.
                   Supplemental Guidance for Low-Impact Systems: For low-impact systems, a simplified
                   process for risk determination is recommended. The level of effort by the authorizing
                   official in determining risk should be minimal since the potential impact on agency
                   operations, agency assets, and/or individuals has already been determined to be low. An
                   independent certification agent is not required to participate in the process.
                   REFERENCE: NIST Special Publication 800-30, or equivalent.

RISK ACCEPTABILITY


SUBTASK 6.2:       Determine if the risk to agency operations, agency assets, or individuals is acceptable
                   and prepare the final security accreditation decision letter.
                   RESPONSIBILITY: Authorizing Official.

                   GUIDANCE: The authorizing official should consider many factors when deciding if
                   the risk to agency operations, agency assets, or individuals is acceptable. Balancing
                   security considerations with mission and operational needs is paramount to achieving
                   an acceptable accreditation decision. The authorizing official renders an accreditation
                   decision for the information system after reviewing all of the relevant information
                   and, where appropriate, consulting with key agency officials.
                   If, after assessing the results of the security certification, the authorizing official
                   deems that the agency-level risk is acceptable, an authorization to operate is issued.
                   The information system is accredited without any restrictions or limitations on its
                   operation.
                   If, after assessing the results of the security certification, the authorizing official
                   deems that the agency-level risk is unacceptable, but there is an important mission-
                   related need to place the information system into operation, an interim authorization
                   to operate may be issued. The interim authorization to operate is a limited
                   authorization under specific terms and conditions including corrective actions to be
                   taken by the information system owner and a required timeframe for completion of
                   those actions. A detailed plan of action and milestones should be submitted by the
                   information system owner and approved by the authorizing official prior to the
                   interim authorization to operate taking effect. The information system is not
                   accredited during the period of limited authorization to operate. The information
                   system owner is responsible for completing the corrective actions identified in the
                   plan of action and milestones and resubmitting an updated security accreditation
                   package upon completion of those actions.
                   If, after assessing the results of the security certification, the authorizing official
                   deems that the agency-level risk is unacceptable, the information system is not
                   authorized for operation and thus is not accredited.
                   The authorizing official’s designated representative or administrative staff prepares
                   the final security accreditation decision letter. The letter includes the accreditation
                   decision, the rationale for the decision, the terms and conditions for information

________________________________________________________________________________________________


                   system operation, and required corrective actions, if appropriate. The accreditation
                   decision letter indicates to the information system owner whether the system is: (i)
                   authorized to operate; (ii) authorized to operate on an interim basis under strict terms
                   and conditions; or (iii) not authorized to operate. The supporting rationale provides
                   the information system owner with the justification for the authorizing official’s
                   decision. The terms and conditions for the authorization provide a description of any
                   limitations or restrictions placed on the operation of the information system that must
                   be adhered to by the information system owner. The security accreditation letter is
                   included in the final accreditation package. The contents of the accreditation package
                   should be protected appropriately in accordance with agency policy.
                   Supplemental Guidance for Low-Impact Systems: For low-impact systems, a simplified
                   process for the determination of risk acceptability is recommended. The level of effort by
                   the authorizing official in determining risk acceptability should be minimal since the
                   potential impact on agency operations, agency assets, and/or individuals has already
                   been determined to be low.

TASK 7: SECURITY ACCREDITATION DOCUMENTATION
The objective of the security accreditation documentation task is to: (i) transmit the final security
accreditation package to the appropriate individuals and organizations; and (ii) update the system
security plan with the latest information from the accreditation decision. The completion of this
task concludes the Security Accreditation Phase of the security certification and accreditation
process.

SECURITY ACCREDITATION PACKAGE TRANSMISSION


SUBTASK 7.1:       Provide copies of the final security accreditation package including the accreditation
                   decision letter (in either paper or electronic form), to the information system owner
                   and any other agency officials having an interest (i.e., need to know) in the security
                   of the information system.
                   RESPONSIBILITY: Authorizing Official.

                   GUIDANCE: The security accreditation package including the accreditation decision
                   letter is returned to the information system owner. Upon receipt of the security
                   accreditation decision letter and accreditation package, the information system owner
                   accepts the terms and conditions of the authorization. The original accreditation
                   package is kept on file by the information system owner. The authorizing official and
                   senior agency information security officer also retain copies of the decision letter and
                   accreditation package. The accreditation package contains important documents and
                   as such, should be appropriately safeguarded and stored, whenever possible, in a
                   centralized agency filing system to ensure accessibility. The accreditation package
                   should also be readily available to auditors and oversight agencies upon request. The
                   accreditation package including all supporting documents, should be retained in
                   accordance with the agency’s records retention policy.

SYSTEM SECURITY PLAN UPDATE


SUBTASK 7.2:       Update the system security plan based on the final determination of risk to agency
                   operations, agency assets, or individuals.

________________________________________________________________________________________________


                   RESPONSIBILITY: Information System Owner.

                   GUIDANCE: The system security plan should be updated to reflect any changes in the
                   information system resulting from the Security Accreditation Phase. Any conditions
                   set forth in the accreditation decision should also be noted in the plan. It is expected
                   that the changes to the system security plan at this phase in the security certification
                   and accreditation process would be minimal.
                   Supplemental Guidance for Low-Impact Systems: None.

                   REFERENCE: NIST Special Publication 800-18, or equivalent.



  Key Milestone:
  The following questions should be answered before proceeding to the Continuous Monitoring Phase—
  −    How do the known vulnerabilities in the information system translate into agency-level risk—
       that is, risk to agency operations, agency assets, or individuals?
  −    Is this agency-level risk acceptable?




3.4 CONTINOUS MONITORING PHASE
The Continuous Monitoring Phase consists of three tasks: (i) configuration management and
control; (ii) security control monitoring; and (iii) status reporting and documentation. The
purpose of this phase is to provide oversight and monitoring of the security controls in the
information system on an ongoing basis and to inform the authorizing official when changes
occur that may impact on the security of the system. The activities in this phase are performed
continuously throughout the life cycle of the information system. Reaccreditation may be
required because of specific changes to the information system or because federal or agency
policies require periodic reaccreditation of the information system.

TASK 8: CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL
The objective of the configuration management and control task is to: (i) document the proposed
or actual changes to the information system; and (ii) determine the impact of proposed or actual
changes on the security of the system. An information system will typically be in a constant state
of migration with upgrades to hardware, software, or firmware and possible modifications to the
system environment. Documenting information system changes and assessing the potential
impact on the security of the system on an ongoing basis is an essential aspect of maintaining the
security accreditation.

DOCUMENTATION OF INFORMATION SYSTEM CHANGES


SUBTASK 8.1:       Using established agency configuration management and control procedures,
                   document proposed or actual changes to the information system (including hardware,
                   software, firmware, and surrounding environment).
                   RESPONSIBILITY: Information System Owner.

                   GUIDANCE: An orderly and disciplined approach to managing, controlling, and
                   documenting changes to an information system is critical to the continuous
                   assessment of the security controls that protect the system. It is important to record
                   any relevant information about the specific proposed or actual changes to the
                   hardware, firmware, or software such as version or release numbers, descriptions of



                                                    PAGE 43

________________________________________________________________________________________________


                   new or modified features or capabilities, and security implementation guidance. It is
                   also important to record any changes to the information system environment such as
                   modifications to the physical plant. The information system owner and information
                   system security officer should use this information in assessing the potential security
                   impact of the proposed or actual changes to the information system. Significant
                   changes to the information system should not be undertaken prior to assessing the
                   security impact of such changes.
                   Supplemental Guidance for Low-Impact Systems: None.

                   REFERENCES: Agency policies/procedures on configuration management and control.

SECURITY IMPACT ANALYSIS

SUBTASK 8.2:       Analyze the proposed or actual changes to the information system (including
                   hardware, software, firmware, and surrounding environment) to determine the
                   security impact of such changes.
                   RESPONSIBILITY: Information System Owner.

                   GUIDANCE: Changes to the information system may affect the security controls
                   currently in place, produce new vulnerabilities in the system, or generate
                   requirements for new security controls that were not needed previously. If the results
                   of the security impact analysis indicate that the proposed or actual changes to the
                   information system will affect or have affected the security of the information
                   system, corrective actions should be initiated and the plan of action and milestones
                   revised. The information system owner or information system security officer may
                   wish to consult with the user representatives or other agency officials prior to
                   implementing any security-related changes to the information system. Conducting a
                   security impact analysis is part of the ongoing assessment of risk within the agency.
                   The level of effort (i.e., degree of rigor and formality) applied to the security impact
                   analysis should be commensurate with the FIPS 199 security category of the
                   information system (i.e., the level of effort increases as the potential impact on
                   agency operations, agency assets, or individuals increases).
                   Supplemental Guidance for Low-Impact Systems: None.

                   REFERENCE: NIST Special Publication 800-30, or equivalent.

TASK 9: SECURITY CONTROL MONITORING
The objective of the security control monitoring task is to: (i) select an appropriate set of security
controls in the information system to be monitored; and (ii) assess the designated controls using
methods and procedures selected by the information system owner. The continuous monitoring of
security controls helps to identify potential security-related problems in the information system
that are not identified during the security impact analysis conducted as part of the configuration
management and control process.

SECURITY CONTROL SELECTION

SUBTASK 9.1:       Select the security controls in the information system to be monitored on a
                   continuous basis.
                   RESPONSIBILITY: Information System Owner.

                   GUIDANCE: The criteria established by the information system owner for selecting
                   which security controls will be monitored should reflect the agency’s priorities and
                   importance of the information system to the agency. For example, certain security


                                                   PAGE 44
Special Publication 800-37       Guide for the Security Certification and Accreditation of Federal Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________


                   controls may be considered more critical than other controls because of the potential
                   impact on the information system if those controls were subverted or found to be
                   ineffective. The security controls being monitored should be reviewed over time to
                   ensure that a representative sample of controls is included in the ongoing security
                   assessments. The authorizing official and information system owner should agree on
                   the subset of security controls in the information system that should be monitored as
                   well as the frequency of such monitoring activity. The level of effort (i.e., degree of
                   rigor and formality) applied to the security control selection process should be
                   commensurate with the FIPS 199 security category of the information system (i.e.,
                   the level of effort increases as the potential impact on agency operations, agency
                   assets, or individuals increases).

                   Publication 800-53.

SELECTED SECURITY CONTROL ASSESSMENT

SUBTASK 9.2:       Assess an agreed-upon set of security controls in the information system to determine
                   the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended,
                   and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements
                   for the system.
                   RESPONSIBILITY: Information System Owner.

                   GUIDANCE: The continuous monitoring of security controls can be accomplished in a
                   variety of ways including security reviews, self-assessments, security testing and
                   evaluation, or audits. The methods and procedures employed to assess the security
                   controls during the monitoring process are at the discretion of the information system
                   owner. In lieu of developing unique or specialized methods and procedures to assess
                   the security controls in the information system, information system owners should
                   consult NIST Special Publication 800-53A, which provides standardized assessment
                   methods and procedures for the security controls listed in NIST Special Publication
                   800-53. The monitoring process should be documented and available for review by
                   the authorizing official or senior agency information security officer, upon request. If
                   the results of the security assessment indicate that selected controls are less than
                   effective in their application and are affecting the security of the information system,
                   corrective actions should be initiated and the plan of action and milestones updated.
                   The level of effort (i.e., degree of rigor and formality) applied to the assessment of
                   security controls should be commensurate with the FIPS 199 security category of the
                   information system (i.e., the level of effort increases as the potential impact on
                   agency operations, agency assets, or individuals increases).

                   Publication 800-53A.

TASK 10: STATUS REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION
The objective of the status reporting and documentation task is to: (i) update the system security
plan to reflect the proposed or actual changes to the information system; (ii) update the plan of
action and milestones based on the activities carried out during the continuous monitoring phase;
and (iii) report the security status of the information system to the authorizing official and senior
agency information security officer. The information in the security status reports (typically



                                                   PAGE 45
Special Publication 800-37       Guide for the Security Certification and Accreditation of Federal Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________


conveyed through updated plans of action and milestones) should be used to determine the need
for security reaccreditation and to satisfy FISMA reporting requirements.

SYSTEM SECURITY PLAN UPDATE

SUBTASK 10.1:      Update the system security plan based on the documented changes to the information
                   system (including hardware, software, firmware, and surrounding environment) and
                   the results of the continuous monitoring process.
                   RESPONSIBILITY: Information System Owner.

                   GUIDANCE: The system security plan should contain the most up-to-date information
                   about the information system. Changes to the information system should be reflected
                   in the system security plan. The frequency of system security plan updates is at the
                   discretion of the information system owner. The updates should occur at appropriate
                   intervals to capture significant changes to the information system, but not so
                   frequently as to generate unnecessary paperwork. The Chief Information Officer,
                   senior agency information security officer, authorizing official, information system
                   owner, information system security officer, and certification agent will be using the
                   system security plan to guide any future security certification and accreditation
                   activities, when required.
                   Supplemental Guidance for Low-Impact Systems: None.

                   REFERENCE: NIST Special Publication 800-18, or equivalent.

PLAN OF ACTION AND MILESTONES UPDATE


SUBTASK 10.2:      Update the plan of action and milestones based on the documented changes to the
                   information system (including hardware, software, firmware, and surrounding
                   environment) and the results of the continuous monitoring process.
                   RESPONSIBILITY: Information System Owner.

                   GUIDANCE: The plan of action and milestones is used by the authorizing official to
                   monitor the progress in correcting deficiencies noted during the security certification.
                   The plan of action and milestones should: (i) report progress made on the current
                   outstanding items listed in the plan; (ii) address vulnerabilities in the information
                   system discovered during the security impact analysis or security control monitoring;
                   and (iii) describe how the information system owner intends to address those
                   vulnerabilities (i.e., reduce, eliminate, or accept the identified vulnerabilities). The
                   frequency of the plan of action and milestones updates is at the discretion of the
                   information system owner. The updates should occur at appropriate intervals to
                   capture significant changes to the information system, but not so frequently as to
                   generate unnecessary paperwork. The Chief Information Officer, senior agency
                   information security officer, authorizing official, information system owner,
                   information system security officer, and certification agent will be using the plan of
                   action and milestones to guide any future security certification and accreditation
                   activities, when required.
                   Supplemental Guidance for Low-Impact Systems: None.

STATUS REPORTING


SUBTASK 10.3:      Report the security status of the information system to the authorizing official and
                   senior agency information security officer.
                   RESPONSIBILITY: Information System Owner.

                   GUIDANCE: The security status report (which can be submitted in the form of an
                   updated plan of action and milestones) should describe the continuous monitoring
                   activities employed by the information system owner. The security status report
                   addresses vulnerabilities in the information system discovered during the security
                   certification, security impact analysis, and security control monitoring and how the
                   information system owner intends to address those vulnerabilities (i.e., reduce,
                   eliminate, or accept the vulnerabilities). The frequency of security status reports is at
                   the discretion of the agency. The status reports should occur at appropriate intervals
                   to transmit significant security-related information about the system, but not so
                   frequently as to generate unnecessary paperwork. The authorizing official and the
                   senior agency information system security officer should use the security status
                   reports to determine if a security reaccreditation is necessary. The authorizing official
                   should notify the information system owner if there is a decision to require a
                   reaccreditation of the information system. A decision to reaccredit the information
                   system should begin, as in the original security accreditation, with the Initiation
                   Phase. The security status report should be marked and handled in accordance with
                   agency policy. At the discretion of the agency, the security status reports on agency
                   information systems can be used to help satisfy the FISMA reporting requirement for
                   documenting remedial actions for any security-related deficiencies.

  Key Milestone:
  The following questions should be answered before reinitiating the certification and accreditation process—
  −    Have any changes to the information system affected the security controls in the system or
       introduced new vulnerabilities into the system?
  −    If so, has the agency-level risk—that is, the risk to agency operations, agency assets, or
       individuals been affected? or
  −    Has a specified time period passed requiring the information system to be reauthorized in
       accordance with federal or agency policy?

                              involves equipment that is an integral part of a weapon or
                              weapons system; or is critical to the direct fulfillment of military
                              or intelligence missions (excluding a system that is to be used for
                              routine administrative and business applications, for example,
                              payroll, finance, logistics, and personnel management
                              applications); or, (ii) is protected at all times by procedures
                              established for information that have been specifically authorized
                              under criteria established by an Executive Order or an Act of
                              Congress to be kept classified in the interest of national defense
                              or foreign policy.

 Non-repudiation              Assurance that the sender of information is provided with proof
 [CNSS Inst. 4009]            of delivery and the recipient is provided with proof of the
                              sender’s identity, so neither can later deny having processed the
                              information.

 Operational Controls         The security controls (i.e., safeguards or countermeasures) for an
 [NIST SP 800-18]             information system that primarily are implemented and executed
                              by people (as opposed to systems).

Subject: Security Accreditation Package for [INFORMATION SYSTEM]

A security certification of the [INFORMATION SYSTEM] and its constituent subsystem-level
components (if applicable) located at [LOCATION] has been conducted in accordance with Office of
Management and Budget Circular A-130, Appendix III, Security of Federal Automated
Information Resources; NIST Special Publication 800-37, Guide for the Security Certification
and Accreditation of Federal Information Systems; and the [AGENCY] policy on security
accreditation. The attached security accreditation package contains: (i) current system security
plan; (ii) security assessment report; and (iii) plan of action and milestones.

The security controls listed in the system security plan have been assessed by [CERTIFICATION
AGENT] using the assessment methods and procedures described in the security assessment report
to determine the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended,
and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the
system. The plan of action and milestones describes the corrective measures that have been
implemented or are planned to address any deficiencies in the security controls for the
information system and to reduce or eliminate known vulnerabilities.

To: Information System Owner

Subject: Security Accreditation Decision for [INFORMATION SYSTEM]

After reviewing the results of the security certification of the [INFORMATION SYSTEM] and its
constituent system-level components (if applicable) located at [LOCATION] and the supporting
evidence provided in the associated security accreditation package (including the current system
security plan, the security assessment report, and the plan of action and milestones), I have
determined that the risk to agency operations, agency assets, or individuals resulting from the
operation of the information system is acceptable. Accordingly, I am issuing an authorization to
operate the information system in its existing operating environment. The information system is
accredited without any significant restrictions or limitations. This security accreditation is my
formal declaration that adequate security controls have been implemented in the information
system and that a satisfactory level of security is present in the system.

The security accreditation of the information system will remain in effect as long as: (i) the
required security status reports for the system are submitted to this office every [TIME PERIOD]; (ii)
the vulnerabilities reported during the continuous monitoring process do not result in additional
agency-level risk which is deemed unacceptable; and (iii) the system has not exceeded the
maximum allowable time period between security accreditations in accordance with federal or
agency policy.

A copy of this letter with all supporting security certification and accreditation documentation
should be retained in accordance with the agency’s record retention schedule.

Security Accreditation Decision Letter (Interim Authorization to Operate)

From: Authorizing Official                                                Date:
Thru: Senior Agency Information Security Officer
To: Information System Owner

Subject: Security Accreditation Decision for [INFORMATION SYSTEM]

After reviewing the results of the security certification of the [INFORMATION SYSTEM] and its
constituent system-level components (if applicable) located at [LOCATION] and the supporting
evidence provided in the associated security accreditation package (including the current system
security plan, the security assessment report, and the plan of action and milestones), I have
determined that the risk to agency operations, agency assets, or individuals resulting from the
operation of the information system is not acceptable. However, I have also determined that there
is an overarching need to place the information system into operation or continue its operation
due to mission necessity. Accordingly, I am issuing an interim authorization to operate the
information system in its existing operating environment. An interim authorization is a limited
authorization to operate the information system under specific terms and conditions and
acknowledges greater agency-level risk for a limited period of time. The information system is
not considered accredited during the period of limited authorization to operate. The terms and
conditions of this limited authorization are described in Attachment A.

A process must be established immediately to monitor the effectiveness of the security controls in
the information system during the period of limited authorization. Monitoring activities should
focus on the specific areas of concern identified during the security certification. Significant
changes in the security state of the information system during the period of limited authorization
should be reported immediately.

This interim authorization to operate the information system is valid for [TIME PERIOD]. The
limited authorization will remain in effect during that time period as long as: (i) the required
security status reports for the system are submitted to this office every [TIME PERIOD]; (ii) the
vulnerabilities reported during the continuous monitoring process do not result in additional
agency-level risk which is deemed unacceptable; and (iii) continued progress is being made in
reducing or eliminating vulnerabilities in the information system in accordance with the plan of
action and milestones. At the end of the period of limited authorization, the information system
must be either authorized to operate or the authorization for further operation will be denied.
Renewals or extensions to this interim authorization to operate will be granted only under the
most extenuating of circumstances. This office will monitor the plan of action and milestones
submitted with the accreditation package during the period of limited authorization.

A copy of this letter with all supporting security certification and accreditation documentation
should be retained in accordance with the agency’s record retention schedule.

Security Accreditation Decision Letter (Denial of Authorization to Operate)

From: Authorizing Official                                                 Date:
Thru: Senior Agency Information Security Officer
To: Information System Owner

Subject: Security Accreditation Decision for [INFORMATION SYSTEM]

After reviewing the results of the security certification of the [INFORMATION SYSTEM] and its
constituent system-level components (if applicable) located at [LOCATION] and the supporting
evidence provided in the associated security accreditation package (including the current system
security plan, the security assessment report, and the plan of action and milestones), I have
determined that the risk to agency operations, agency assets, or individuals resulting from the
operation of the information system is unacceptable. Accordingly, I am issuing a denial of
authorization to operate the information system in its existing operating environment. The
information system is not accredited and [MAY NOT BE PLACED INTO OPERATION or ALL CURRENT
OPERATIONS MUST BE HALTED]. Failure to receive an authorization to operate the information
system indicates that there are major deficiencies in the security controls in the system and that a
satisfactory level of security is not present in the system at this time.

The plan of action and milestones should be revised immediately to ensure that proactive
measures are taken to correct the security deficiencies in the information system. The security
certification should be repeated at the earliest opportunity to determine the effectiveness of the
security controls in the information system after the reduction or elimination of identified
vulnerabilities.

A copy of this letter with all supporting security certification and accreditation documentation
should be retained in accordance with the agency’s record retention schedule.
