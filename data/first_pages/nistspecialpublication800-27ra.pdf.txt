1.1    Authority

This document has been developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) in furtherance of its statutory responsibilities under the Federal Information Security
Management Act (FISMA) of 2002, Public Law 107-347.

NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements,
for providing adequate information security for all agency operations and assets, but such
standards and guidelines shall not apply to national security systems. This guideline is consistent
with the requirements of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Section
8b(3), Securing Agency Information Systems, as analyzed in A-130, Appendix IV: Analysis of
Key Sections. Supplemental information is provided A-130, Appendix III.

This guideline has been prepared for use by federal agencies. It may be used by
nongovernmental organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright. (Attribution
would be appreciated by NIST.)

Nothing in this document should be taken to contradict standards and guidelines made
mandatory and binding on federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory
authority. Nor should these guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing
authorities of the Secretary of Commerce, Director of the OMB, or any other federal official.

1.2    Purpose
                                                   Principle n. – A rule or standard,
The purpose of the Engineering Principles for
                                                   especially of good behavior.
Information Technology (IT) Security (EP-ITS)
is to present a list of system-level security             American Heritage Dictionary
principles to be considered in the design,
development, and operation of an information system.

Ideally, the principles presented here would be used from the onset of a program—at the
beginning of, or during the initiation phase—and then employed throughout the system’s life-
cycle. However, these principles are also helpful in affirming and confirming the security
posture of already deployed information systems. The principles are short and concise and can
be used by organizations to develop their system life-cycle policies.

2.0    BACKGROUND

Private businesses and government agencies, both foreign and domestic, are becoming
increasingly reliant on information technology to fulfill many basic functions. Businesses are
making changes simply to remain competitive in the changing global marketplace. Likewise,
government agencies are seeking to provide better service to their citizens.

Regardless of the reason, the move to a digital economy has caused information and information
technology to become valuable business assets that need to be protected. With this development
has come the recognition that fulfilling these basic functions requires as a matter of course
comprehensive, well-designed, and reliable information system security programs.

Information system security program standards, guidance, and implementation strategies have
been, or are being, developed by public and private sector organizations in the United States and
abroad. These wide-ranging efforts are designed to address many aspects of information security
at many levels of detail. They address technology aspects such as public key infrastructure
(PKI) and certification and accreditation (C&A) processes, and more operational aspects such as
organizational good practices.

Seeking to support and guide these many efforts, several private and public organizations have
developed a number of explicit and implicit information system security principles. These
security principles, in turn, have the potential to become common fundamentals for users,
designers, and engineers to consider in designing information system security programs.

This document seeks to compile and present many of these security principles into one, easy-to-
use document for those concerned with information system security. In contrast to other
organization-level efforts, the principles presented in this document are structured around a
system-level, engineering approach.

2.1   Generally Accepted Principles and Practices for Securing Information Technology
Systems (SP 800-14)

SP 800-14 (available at http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/index.html) provides a
foundation upon which organizations can establish and review information technology security
programs. The eight Generally Accepted System Security Principles in SP 800-14 are designed
to provide the public or private sector audience with an organization-level perspective when
creating new systems, practices, or policies.

While derived primarily from concepts found in the eight principles and 14 practices identified
in the SP 800-14, the EP-ITS principles provide a system-level (versus organizational-level)
perspective for information technology security.

It should be noted the EP-ITS principles are not ordered under the same headings used in SP
800-14. This is due to the different focus for the two documents and is akin to the loose
relationship between principles and practices that exists in SP 800-14.



SP 800-27 Rev A                                 3
2.2    Common Criteria

The Common Criteria (CC, available at http://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/) provides a
structured methodology for documenting security requirements, documenting and validating
security capabilities, and promoting international cooperation in the area of IT security.

Use of Common Criteria "protection profiles" and "security targets" greatly aids the
development of products (and to some extent systems) that have IT security functions. The rigor
and repeatability of the Common Criteria methodology provides for thorough definition of user
security needs. Security targets provide system integrators with key information needed in the
procurement of components and implementation of secure IT systems. The approach of this
document meshes with the Common Criteria methodology; EP-ITS provides system-level, broad
principles and the CC provides a catalog of detailed, primarily product-level requirements.

2.3    Layered Protections

Securing information and systems against the full spectrum of threats requires the use of
multiple, overlapping protection approaches addressing the people, technology, and operational
aspects of information systems. This is due to the highly interactive nature of the various
systems and networks, and the fact that any single system cannot be adequately secured unless
all interconnecting systems are also secured.

By using multiple, overlapping protection approaches, the failure or circumvention of any
individual protection approach will not leave the system unprotected. Through user training and
awareness, well-crafted policies and procedures, and redundancy of protection mechanisms,
layered protections enable effective protection of information technology for the purpose of
achieving mission objectives.

For example, this fundamental need for layered protections is captured in the “Defense-in-
Depth” strategy being used by DoD for protecting information systems. A source of information
on implementing layered protections is the Information Assurance Technical Framework (IATF,
http://www.iatf.net/). The IATF advocates the use of multiple information technology protection
methods or approaches following the DoD “Defense-in-Depth” strategy to establish a composite
security posture adequately addressing threats.

Federal agencies may find useful information in the IATF documents.

3.0        SECURITY PRINCIPLES

3.1        Introduction

To aid in designing a secure information system, NIST compiled a set of engineering principles
for system security. These principles provide a foundation upon which a more consistent and
structured approach to the design, development, and implementation of IT security capabilities
can be constructed.

While the primary focus of these principles is the implementation of technical controls, these
principles highlight the fact that, to be effective, a system security design should also consider
non-technical issues, such as policy, operational procedures, and user education and training.

The principles described here do not apply to all systems at all times. Yet, each principle should
be carefully considered throughout the life-cycle of every system. Moreover, because of the
constantly changing information system security environment, the principles identified are not
considered to be a static, all-inclusive list. Instead, this document is an attempt to present in a
logical fashion fundamental security principles that can be used in today’s operational
environments. As technology improves and security techniques are refined, additions, deletions,
and refinement of these security principles will be required.

Each principle has two components. The first is a table that indicates where the principle should
be applied during the system life-cycle. The second is an explanatory narrative further
amplifying the principle.

The five life-cycle planning phases used are defined in the Generally Accepted Principles and
Practices for Securing Information Technology Systems, SP 800-14:

          Initiation Phase
          Development/Acquisition Phase
          Implementation Phase
          Operation/Maintenance Phase
          Disposal Phase.

In an effort to associate each principle with the relevant life-cycle planning phase(s), a table
similar to the example table below, Table 3-1, has been developed for each principle. The table
identifies each life-cycle phase, and “check marks” are used to indicate if the principle should be
considered or applied during the specified phase. One check “9” signifies the principle can be
used to support the life-cycle phase, and two checks “99” signifies the principle is key to
successful completion of the life-cycle phase.

                          Table 3-1 Example Life-cycle Applicability Table
                             Initiation   Devel/Acquis   Implement      Oper/Maint       Disposal
          Principle X          99             9                             9



SP 800-27 Rev A                                    5
For example, the table above indicates that Principle No. X must be considered and is key to the
successful completion of the Initiation phase. Additionally, Principle No. X, should be
considered and applied in support of the Development/Acquisition and the
Operation/Maintenance phases.

3.2      System Life-Cycle Description

The following brief descriptions of each of the five phases of the system life-cycle are taken
from Generally Accepted Principles and Practices for Securing Information Technology
Systems, SP 800-14.
     Initiation: During the initiation phase, the need for a system is expressed and the purpose of
      the system is documented. Activities include conducting an impact assessment in accordance
      with FIPS-199 (http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips199/FIPS-PUB-199-final.pdf).
     Development/Acquisition: During this phase, the system is designed, purchased,
      programmed, developed, or otherwise constructed. This phase often consists of other defined
      cycles, such as the system development cycle or the acquisition cycle. Activities include
      determining security requirements, incorporating security requirements into specifications,
      and obtaining the system.
     Implementation: During implementation, the system is tested and installed or fielded.
      Activities include installing/turning on controls, security testing, certification, and
      accreditation.
     Operation/Maintenance: During this phase, the system performs its work. Typically, the
      system is also being modified by the addition of hardware and software and by numerous
      other events. Activities include security operations and administration, operational
      assurance, and audits and monitoring.
     Disposal: The disposal phase of the IT system life-cycle involves the disposition of
      information, hardware, and software. Activities include moving, archiving, discarding or
      destroying information and sanitizing the media.

3.3      IT Security Principles

The 33 IT security principles are grouped into the following 6 categories: Security Foundation,
Risk Based, Ease of Use, Increase Resilience, Reduce Vulnerabilities, and Design with Network
in Mind. This grouping has resulted in a renumbering of the principles with respect to the
original version of SP 800-27. The previous numbering is indicated to assist those familiar with
the principles using the previous numbering.


3.3.1 Security Foundation


Principle 1.      Establish a sound security policy as the “foundation” for design.




SP 800-27 Rev A                                    6
                             Initiation   Devel/Acquis     Implement      Oper/Maint     Disposal
     Applicability             99              9               9              9            9

Discussion: A security policy is an important document to develop while designing an
information system. The security policy begins with the organization’s basic commitment to
information security formulated as a general policy statement. The policy is then applied to all
aspects of the system design or security solution. The policy identifies security goals (e.g.,
confidentiality, integrity, availability, accountability, and assurance) the system should support,
and these goals guide the procedures, standards and controls used in the IT security architecture
design. The policy also should require definition of critical assets, the perceived threat, and
security-related roles and responsibilities.


Principle 2.      Treat security as an integral part of the overall system design.


                             Initiation   Devel/Acquis     Implement      Oper/Maint     Disposal
     Applicability             99             99              99             99            9

Discussion: Security must be considered in information system design. Experience has shown it
to be both difficult and costly to implement security measures properly and successfully after a
system has been developed, so it should be integrated fully into the system life-cycle process.
This includes establishing security policies, understanding the resulting security requirements,
participating in the evaluation of security products, and finally in the engineering, design,
implementation, and disposal of the system.


Principle 3.      Clearly delineate the physical and logical security boundaries governed by
                  associated security policies.


                             Initiation   Devel/Acquis     Implement      Oper/Maint     Disposal
     Applicability             99             99               9              9

Discussion: Information technology exists in physical and logical locations, and boundaries exist
between these locations. An understanding of what is to be protected from external factors can
help ensure adequate protective measures are applied where they will be most effective.
Sometimes a boundary is defined by people, information, and information technology associated
with one physical location. But this ignores the reality that, within a single location, many
different security policies may be in place, some covering publicly accessible information and
some covering sensitive unclassified information. Other times a boundary is defined by a
security policy that governs a specific set of information and information technology that can
cross physical boundaries. Further complicating the matter is that, many times, a single machine
or server may house both public-access and sensitive unclassified information. As a result,


SP 800-27 Rev A                                     7
multiple security policies may apply to a single machine or within a single system. Therefore,
when developing an information system, security boundaries must be considered and
communicated in relevant system documentation and security policies.


Principle 4 (formerly 33).      Ensure that developers are trained in how to develop secure
                                software.


                             Initiation   Devel/Acquis    Implement     Oper/Maint      Disposal
     Applicability             99             99              9

Discussion: It is unwise to assume that developers know how to develop secure software.
Therefore, ensure that developers are adequately trained in the development of secure software
before developing the system. This includes application of engineering disciplines to design,
development, configuration control, and integration and testing.


3.3.2 Risk Based


Principle 5 (formerly 4).       Reduce risk to an acceptable level.


                             Initiation   Devel/Acquis    Implement     Oper/Maint      Disposal
     Applicability             99             99             99              99           99

Discussion: Risk is defined as the combination of (1) the likelihood that a particular threat
source will exercise (intentionally exploit or unintentionally trigger) a particular information
system vulnerability and (2) the resulting adverse impact on organizational operations,
organizational assets, or individuals should this occur. Previously, risk avoidance was a
common IT security goal. That changed as the nature of the risk became better understood.
Today, it is recognized that elimination of all risk is not cost-effective. A cost-benefit analysis
should be conducted for each proposed control. In some cases, the benefits of a more secure
system may not justify the direct and indirect costs. Benefits include more than just prevention
of monetary loss; for example, controls may be essential for maintaining public trust and
confidence. Direct costs include the cost of purchasing and installing a given technology;
indirect costs include decreased system performance and additional training. The goal is to
enhance mission/business capabilities by mitigating mission/business risk to an acceptable level.
(Related Principle: 6)


Principle 6 (formerly 5).       Assume that external systems are insecure.




SP 800-27 Rev A                                    8
                            Initiation   Devel/Acquis    Implement      Oper/Maint      Disposal
     Applicability            99            99             99             99              9

Discussion: The term information domain arises from the practice of partitioning information
resources according to access control, need, and levels of protection required. Organizations
implement specific measures to enforce this partitioning and to provide for the deliberate flow of
authorized information between information domains. The boundary of an information domain
represents the security perimeter for that domain.

An external domain is one that is not under your control. In general, external systems should be
considered insecure. Until an external domain has been deemed “trusted,” system engineers,
architects, and IT specialists should presume the security measures of an external system are
different than those of a trusted internal system and design the system security features
accordingly.



Principle 7 (formerly 6).      Identify potential trade-offs between reducing risk and increased
                               costs and decrease in other aspects of operational effectiveness.


                            Initiation   Devel/Acquis    Implement      Oper/Maint      Disposal
     Applicability            99            99                            99

Discussion: To meet stated security requirements, a systems designer, architect, or security
practitioner will need to identify and address all competing operational needs. It may be
necessary to modify or adjust (i.e., trade-off) security goals due to other operational
requirements. In modifying or adjusting security goals, an acceptance of greater risk and cost
may be inevitable. By identifying and addressing these trade-offs as early as possible, decision
makers will have greater latitude and be able to achieve more effective systems. (Related
Principle: 4)




SP 800-27 Rev A                                   9
Principle 8.      Implement tailored system security measures to meet organizational security
                  goals.


                             Initiation   Devel/Acquis    Implement     Oper/Maint       Disposal
     Applicability              9            99              9             99              9

Discussion: In general, IT security measures are tailored according to an organization’s unique
needs. While numerous factors, such as the overriding mission requirements, and guidance, are
to be considered, the fundamental issue is the protection of the mission or business from IT
security-related, negative impacts. Because IT security needs are not uniform, system designers
and security practitioners should consider the level of trust when connecting to other external
networks and internal sub-domains. Recognizing the uniqueness of each system allows a layered
security strategy to be used – implementing lower assurance solutions with lower costs to protect
less critical systems and higher assurance solutions only at the most critical areas.


Principle 9 (formerly 26).      Protect information while being processed, in transit, and in
                                storage.


                             Initiation   Devel/Acquis    Implement     Oper/Maint       Disposal
     Applicability              9            99              9             99              9

Discussion: The risk of unauthorized modification or destruction of data, disclosure of
information, and denial of access to data while in transit should be considered along with the
risks associated with data that is in storage or being processed. Therefore, system engineers,
architects, and IT specialists should implement security measures to preserve, as needed, the
integrity, confidentiality, and availability of data, including application software, while the
information is being processed, in transit, and in storage.


Principle 10 (formerly 29). Consider custom products to achieve adequate security.


                             Initiation   Devel/Acquis    Implement     Oper/Maint       Disposal
     Applicability              9            99              9              9

Discussion: Designers should recognize that in some instances it will not be possible to meet
security goals with systems constructed entirely from COTS products. In such instances, it will
be necessary to augment COTS with non-COTS mechanisms.




SP 800-27 Rev A                                   10
Principle 11 (formerly 31). Protect against all likely classes of “attacks.”


                          Initiation   Devel/Acquis     Implement      Oper/Maint      Disposal
     Applicability           9             99               9              9              9

Discussion: In designing the security controls, multiple classes of “attacks” need to be
considered. Those classes that result in unacceptable risk need to be mitigated. Examples of
“attack” classes are: Passive monitoring, active network attacks, exploitation by insiders, attacks
requiring physical access or proximity, and the insertion of backdoors and malicious code during
software development and/or distribution.


3.3.3 Ease of Use


Principle 12 (formerly 18). Where possible, base security on open standards for portability and
                            interoperability.


                          Initiation   Devel/Acquis     Implement      Oper/Maint      Disposal
     Applicability           9             99               9

Discussion: Most organizations depend significantly on distributed information systems to
perform their mission or business. These systems distribute information both across their own
organization and to other organizations. For security capabilities to be effective in such
environments, security program designers should make every effort to incorporate
interoperability and portability into all security measures, including hardware and software, and
implementation practices.


Principle 13 (formerly 19). Use common language in developing security requirements.


                          Initiation   Devel/Acquis     Implement      Oper/Maint      Disposal
     Applicability          99             99                             99

Discussion: The use of a common language when developing security requirements permits
organizations to evaluate and compare security products and features evaluated in a common test
environment. When a “common” evaluation process is based upon common requirements or
criteria, a level of confidence can be established that ensures product security functions conform
to an organization’s security requirements. The Common Criteria provides a source of common
expressions for common needs and supports a common assessment methodology.




SP 800-27 Rev A                                 11
Principle 14 (formerly 21). Design security to allow for regular adoption of new technology,
                            including a secure and logical technology upgrade process.


                          Initiation    Devel/Acquis    Implement      Oper/Maint       Disposal
     Applicability                          99              9             99

Discussion: As mission and business processes and the threat environment change, security
requirements and technical protection methods must be updated. IT-related risks to the
mission/business vary over time and undergo periodic assessment. Periodic assessment should
be performed to enable system designers and managers to make informed risk management
decisions on whether to accept or mitigate identified risks with changes or updates to the security
capability. The lack of timely identification through consistent security solution re-evaluation
and correction of evolving, applicable IT vulnerabilities results in false trust and increased risk.

Each security mechanism should be able to support migration to new technology or upgrade of
new features without requiring an entire system redesign. The security design should be
modular so that individual parts of the security design can be upgraded without the requirement
to modify the entire system.


Principle 15 (formerly 27). Strive for operational ease of use.


                          Initiation    Devel/Acquis    Implement      Oper/Maint       Disposal
     Applicability           9              99              9             99

Discussion: The more difficult it is to maintain and operate a security control, the less effective
that control is likely to be. Therefore, security controls should be designed to be consistent with
the concept of operations and with ease-of-use as an important consideration. The experience
and expertise of administrators and users should be appropriate and proportional to the operation
of the security control. An organization must invest the resources necessary to ensure system
administrators and users are properly trained. Moreover, administrator and user training costs
along with the life-cycle operational costs should be considered when determining the cost-
effectiveness of the security control.




SP 800-27 Rev A                                  12
3.3.4 Increase Resilience


Principle 16 (formerly 7).      Implement layered security (Ensure no single point of vulerability).


                             Initiation   Devel/Acquis    Implement      Oper/Maint      Disposal
     Applicability              9             99              9             99              9

Discussion: Security designs should consider a layered approach to address or protect against a
specific threat or to reduce vulnerability. For example, the use of a packet-filtering router in
conjunction with an application gateway and an intrusion detection system combine to increase
the work-factor an attacker must expend to successfully attack the system. Adding good
password controls and adequate user training improves the system’s security posture even more.

The need for layered protections is especially important when commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS)
products are used. Practical experience has shown that the current state-of-the-art for security
quality in COTS products does not provide a high degree of protection against sophisticated
attacks. It is possible to help mitigate this situation by placing several controls in series,
requiring additional work by attackers to accomplish their goals.


Principle 17 (formerly 10). Design and operate an IT system to limit damage and to be
                            resilient in response.


                             Initiation   Devel/Acquis    Implement      Oper/Maint      Disposal
     Applicability              9             99                            99

Discussion: Information systems should be resistant to attack, should limit damage, and should
recover rapidly when attacks do occur. The principle suggested here recognizes the need for
adequate protection technologies at all levels to ensure that any potential cyber attack will be
countered effectively. There are vulnerabilities that cannot be fixed, those that have not yet been
fixed, those that are not known, and those that could be fixed but are not (e.g., risky services
allowed through firewalls) to allow increased operational capabilities. In addition to achieving a
secure initial state, secure systems should have a well-defined status after failure, either to a
secure failure state or via a recovery procedure to a known secure state. Organizations should
establish detect and respond capabilities, manage single points of failure in their systems, and
implement a reporting and response strategy. (Related Principle: 14)




SP 800-27 Rev A                                    13
Principle 18 (formerly 13). Provide assurance that the system is, and continues to be, resilient
                            in the face of expected threats.


                          Initiation   Devel/Acquis    Implement      Oper/Maint      Disposal
     Applicability           9             99              9             99              9

Discussion: Assurance is the grounds for confidence that a system meets its security
expectations. These expectations can typically be summarized as providing sufficient resistance
to both direct penetration and attempts to circumvent security controls. Good understanding of
the threat environment, evaluation of requirement sets, hardware and software engineering
disciplines, and product and system evaluations are primary measures used to achieve assurance.
Additionally, the documentation of the specific and evolving threats is important in making
timely adjustments in applied security and strategically supporting incremental security
enhancements.


Principle 19 (formerly 14). Limit or contain vulnerabilities.


                          Initiation   Devel/Acquis    Implement      Oper/Maint      Disposal
     Applicability                         99              9              9

Discussion: Design systems to limit or contain vulnerabilities. If a vulnerability does exist,
damage can be limited or contained, allowing other information system elements to function
properly. Limiting and containing insecurities also helps to focus response and reconstitution
efforts to information system areas most in need. (Related Principle: 10)




SP 800-27 Rev A                                 14
Principle 20 (formerly 16). Isolate public access systems from mission critical resources (e.g.,
                            data, processes, etc.).


                           Initiation   Devel/Acquis     Implement       Oper/Maint       Disposal
       Applicability          9             99               9               9

Discussion: While the trend toward shared infrastructure has considerable merit in many cases,
it is not universally applicable. In cases where the sensitivity or criticality of the information is
high, organizations may want to limit the number of systems on which that data is stored and
isolate them, either physically or logically. Physical isolation may include ensuring that no
physical connection exists between an organization’s public access information resources and an
organization’s critical information. When implementing logical isolation solutions, layers of
security services and mechanisms should be established between public systems and secure
systems responsible for protecting mission critical resources. Security layers may include using
network architecture designs such as demilitarized zones and screened subnets. Finally, system
designers and administrators should enforce organizational security policies and procedures
regarding use of public access systems.


Principle 21 (formerly 17). Use boundary mechanisms to separate computing systems and
                            network infrastructures.


                           Initiation   Devel/Acquis     Implement       Oper/Maint       Disposal
       Applicability                        99               9              99

Discussion: To control the flow of information and access across network boundaries in
computing and communications infrastructures, and to enforce the proper separation of user
groups, a suite of access control devices and accompanying access control policies should be
used.

Determine the following for communications across network boundaries:
   •     What external interfaces are required
   •     Whether information is pushed or pulled
   •     What ports, protocols, and network services are required
   •     What requirements exist for system information exchanges; for example, trust
         relationships, database replication services, and domain name resolution processes.




SP 800-27 Rev A                                  15
Principle 22 (formerly 20). Design and implement audit mechanisms to detect unauthorized use
                            and to support incident investigations.


                          Initiation   Devel/Acquis     Implement      Oper/Maint      Disposal
     Applicability           9             99             99               9

Discussion: Organizations should monitor, record, and periodically review audit logs to identify
unauthorized use and to ensure system resources are functioning properly. In some cases,
organizations may be required to disclose information obtained through auditing mechanisms to
appropriate third parties, including law enforcement authorities or Freedom of Information Act
(FOIA) applicants. Many organizations have implemented consent to monitor policies which
state that evidence of unauthorized use (e.g., audit trails) may be used to support administrative
or criminal investigations.


Principle 23 (formerly 28). Develop and exercise contingency or disaster recovery procedures
                            to ensure appropriate availability.


                          Initiation   Devel/Acquis     Implement      Oper/Maint      Disposal
     Applicability           9              9              9              99

Discussion: Continuity of operations plans or disaster recovery procedures address continuance
of an organization’s operation in the event of a disaster or prolonged service interruption that
affects the organization’s mission. Such plans should address an emergency response phase, a
recovery phase, and a return to normal operation phase. Personnel responsibilities during an
incident and available resources should be identified. In reality, contingency and disaster
recovery plans do not address every possible scenario or assumption. Rather, it focuses on the
events most likely to occur and identifies an acceptable method of recovery. Periodically, the
plans and procedures should be exercised to ensure that they are effective and well understood.

3.3.5 Reduce Vulnerabilities


Principle 24 (formerly 9).      Strive for simplicity.


                             Initiation   Devel/Acquis   Implement      Oper/Maint      Disposal
     Applicability              9              99           9              99

Discussion: The more complex the mechanism, the more likely it may possess exploitable flaws.
Simple mechanisms tend to have fewer exploitable flaws and require less maintenance. Further,
because configuration management issues are simplified, updating or replacing a simple
mechanism becomes a less intensive process.


Principle 25 (formerly 11). Minimize the system elements to be trusted.

Discussion: Security measures include people, operations, and technology. Where technology is
used, hardware, firmware, and software should be designed and implemented so that a minimum
number of system elements need to be trusted in order to maintain protection. Further, to ensure
cost-effective and timely certification of system security features, it is important to minimize the
amount of software and hardware expected to provide the most secure functions for the system.

Principle 26 (formerly 24). Implement least privilege.

     Applicability            9              9              9              99

Discussion:
The concept of limiting access, or "least privilege," is simply to provide no more authorizations
than necessary to perform required functions. This is perhaps most often applied in the
administration of the system. Its goal is to reduce risk by limiting the number of people with
access to critical system security controls; i.e., controlling who is allowed to enable or disable
system security features or change the privileges of users or programs. Best practice suggests it
is better to have several administrators with limited access to security resources rather than one
person with "super user" permissions. .

Consideration should be given to implementing role-based access controls for various aspects of
system use, not only administration. The system security policy can identify and define the
various roles of users or processes. Each role is assigned those permissions needed to perform
its functions. Each permission specifies a permitted access to a particular resource (such as
"read" and "write" access to a specified file or directory, "connect" access to a given host and
port, etc.). Unless a permission is granted explicitly, the user or process should not be able to
access the protected resource. Additionally, identify the roles/responsibilities that, for security
purposes, should remain separate, this is commonly termed “separation of duties”.


Principle 27 (formerly 25). Do not implement unnecessary security mechanisms.


                           Initiation   Devel/Acquis     Implement      Oper/Maint       Disposal
     Applicability            9             99             99               9              9

Discussion: Every security mechanism should support a security service or set of services, and
every security service should support one or more security goals. Extra measures should not be
implemented if they do not support a recognized service or security goal. Such mechanisms
could add unneeded complexity to the system and are potential sources of additional
vulnerabilities.

An example is file encryption supporting the access control service that in turn supports the
goals of confidentiality and integrity by preventing unauthorized file access. If file encryption is
a necessary part of accomplishing the goals, then the mechanism is appropriate. However, if
these security goals are adequately supported without inclusion of file encryption, then that
mechanism would be an unneeded system complexity.

Discussion: Although a system may be powered down, critical information still resides on the
system and could be retrieved by an unauthorized user or organization. Access to critical
information systems must be controlled at all times.

At the end of a system’s life-cycle, system designers should develop procedures to dispose of an
information system’s assets in a proper and secure fashion. Procedures must be implemented to
ensure system hard drives, volatile memory, and other media are purged to an acceptable level
and do not retain residual information.



Principle 29 (formerly 32). Identify and prevent common errors and vulnerabilities.


                          Initiation    Devel/Acquis     Implement      Oper/Maint      Disposal

Discussion: Many errors reoccur with disturbing regularity - errors such as buffer overflows,
race conditions, format string errors, failing to check input for validity, and programs being
given excessive privileges. Learning from the past will improve future results.


3.3.6 Design with Network in Mind


Principle 30 (formerly 12). Implement security through a combination of measures distributed
                            physically and logically.

Discussion: Often, a single security service is achieved by cooperating elements existing on
separate machines. For example, system authentication is typically accomplished using elements
ranging from the user-interface on a workstation through the networking elements to an
application on an authentication server. It is important to associate all elements with the security
service they provide. These components are likely to be shared across systems to achieve
security as infrastructure resources come under more senior budget and operational control.

Principle 31 (formerly 15). Formulate security measures to address multiple overlapping
                            information domains.


                          Initiation    Devel/Acquis    Implement      Oper/Maint       Disposal
     Applicability           9              99              9              9

Discussion: An information domain is a set of active entities (person, process, or devices) and
their data objects. A single information domain may be subject to multiple security policies. A
single security policy may span multiple information domains. An efficient and cost effective
security capability should be able to enforce multiple security policies to protect multiple
information domains without the need to separate physically the information and respective
information systems processing the data. This principle argues for moving away from the
traditional practice of creating separate LANs and infrastructures for various sensitivity levels
(e.g., security classification or business function such as proposal development) and moving
toward solutions that enable the use of common, shared, infrastructures with appropriate
protections at the operating system, application, and workstation level.

Moreover, to accomplish missions and protect critical functions, government and private sector
organizations have many types of information to safeguard. With this principle in mind, system
engineers, architects, and IT specialists should develop a security capability that allows
organizations with multiple levels of information sensitivity to achieve the basic security goals in
an efficient manner.


Principle 32 (formerly 22). Authenticate users and processes to ensure appropriate access
                            control decisions both within and across domains.

     Applicability           9               9              9             99

Discussion: Authentication is the process where a system establishes the validity of a
transmission, message, or a means of verifying the eligibility of an individual, process, or
machine to carry out a desired action, thereby ensuring that security is not compromised by an
untrusted source. It is essential that adequate authentication be achieved in order to implement
security policies and achieve security goals. Additionally, level of trust is always an issue when
dealing with cross-domain interactions. The solution is to establish an authentication policy and
apply it to cross-domain interactions as required. Note: A user may have rights to use more than
one name in multiple domains. Further, rights may differ among the domains, potentially
leading to security policy violations.

Discussion: An identity may represent an actual user or a process with its own identity, e.g., a
program making a remote access. Unique identities are a required element in order to be able to:

•     Maintain accountability and traceability of a user or process
•     Assign specific rights to an individual user or process
•     Provide for non-repudiation
•     Enforce access control decisions
•     Establish the identity of a peer in a secure communications path
•     Prevent unauthorized users from masquerading as an authorized user.

4.0    SUMMARY

Now, more than ever, IT security is a critical element in the system life-cycle. Security must be
incorporated and addressed from the initial planning and design phases to disposal of the system.
Without proper attention to security, an organization’s information technology can become a
source of significant mission risks. With careful planning from the earliest stages, however,
security becomes an enabler, supporting and helping to achieve the organization’s mission.

As security awareness becomes a way of life within an organization, people at all levels, and
roles in the system life-cycle, should have access to easily understood guidance. From users to
system administrators and program managers, everyone should have a basic understanding of the
security principles governing the system they are using, maintaining, or designing and
developing.

This document provides a starting point. The principles contained herein are derived from a
number of national and international documents, as well as from the experience of the scientists
at NIST. It is hoped that these principles will contribute to improved IT security in any
organization.

Term                Definition

access control      Enable authorized use of a resource while preventing unauthorized use or
                    use in an unauthorized manner.

accountability      The security goal that generates the requirement for actions of an entity to
                    be traced uniquely to that entity. This supports non-repudiation,
                    deterrence, fault isolation, intrusion detection and prevention, and after-
                    action recovery and legal action.

assurance           Grounds for confidence that the other four security goals (integrity,
                    availability, confidentiality, and accountability) have been adequately met
                    by a specific implementation. “Adequately met” includes (1)
                    functionality that performs correctly, (2) sufficient protection against
                    unintentional errors (by users or software), and (3) sufficient resistance to
                    intentional penetration or by-pass.

authentication      Verifying the identity of a user, process, or device, often as a prerequisite
                    to allowing access to resources in a system.

authorization       The granting or denying of access rights to a user, program, or process.

availability        The security goal that generates the requirement for protection against
                    intentional or accidental attempts to (1) perform unauthorized deletion of
                    data or (2) otherwise cause a denial of service or data.

confidentiality     The security goal that generates the requirement for protection from
                    intentional or accidental attempts to perform unauthorized data reads.
                    Confidentiality covers data in storage, during processing, and while in
                    transit.

data integrity      The property that data has not been altered in an unauthorized manner.
                    Data integrity covers data in storage, during processing, and while in
                    transit.

denial of service   The prevention of authorized access to resources or the delaying of time-
                    critical operations. (Time-critical may be milliseconds or it may be
                    hours, depending upon the service provided.)

domain              See security domain.

entity             Either a subject (an active element that operates on information or the
                   system state) or an object (a passive element that contains or receives
                   information).

general support    An interconnected information resource under the same direct
system             management control that shares common functionality. It normally
                   includes hardware, software, information, data, applications,
                   communications, facilities, and people and provides support for a variety
                   of users and/or applications. Individual applications support different
                   mission-related functions. Users may be from the same or different
                   organizations.


integrity          The security goal that generates the requirement for protection against
                   either intentional or accidental attempts to violate data integrity (the
                   property that data has not been altered in an unauthorized manner) or
                   system integrity (the quality that a system has when it performs its
                   intended function in an unimpaired manner, free from unauthorized
                   manipulation).

identity           Information that is unique within a security domain and which is
                   recognized as denoting a particular entity within that domain.


IT-related risk    The net mission/business impact considering (1) the likelihood that a
                   particular threat source will exploit, or trigger, a particular information
                   system vulnerability and (2) the resulting impact if this should occur. IT-
                   related risks arise from legal liability or mission/business loss due to, but
                   not limited to:
                   1. Unauthorized (malicious, non-malicious, or accidental) disclosure,
                       modification, or destruction of information.
                   2. Non-malicious errors and omissions.
                   3. IT disruptions due to natural or man-made disasters.
                   4. Failure to exercise due care and diligence in the implementation and
                       operation of the IT.

IT security        A description of security principles and an overall approach for
architecture       complying with the principles that drive the system design; i.e.,
                   guidelines on the placement and implementation of specific security
                   services within various distributed computing environments.

major application   An application that requires special attention to security due to the risk
                    and magnitude of the harm resulting from the loss, misuse, or
                    unauthorized access to, or modification of, the information in the
                    application. A breach in a major application might comprise many
                    individual application programs and hardware, software, and
                    telecommunications components. Major applications can be either major
                    software applications or a combination of hardware/software where the
                    only purpose of the system is to support a specific mission-related
                    function.

object              A passive entity that contains or receives information. Note that access to
                    an object potentially implies access to the information it contains.

risk                Within this document, synonymous with “IT-related risk.”

risk analysis       The process of identifying the risks to system security and determining
                    the likelihood of occurrence, the resulting impact, and the additional
                    safeguards that mitigate this impact. Part of risk management and
                    synonymous with risk assessment.

risk assessment     See risk analysis.

risk management     The ongoing process of assessing the risk to mission/business as part of a
                    risk-based approach used to determine adequate security for a system by
                    analyzing the threats and vulnerabilities and selecting appropriate, cost-
                    effective controls to achieve and maintain an acceptable level or risk.

security            Security is a system property. Security is much more than a set of
                    functions and mechanisms. IT security is a system characteristic as well
                    as a set of mechanisms that span the system both logically and physically.

security domain     A set of subjects, their information objects, and a common security
                    policy.

security policy     The statement of required protection of the information objects.

security goals      The five security goals are confidentiality, availability, integrity,
                    accountability, and assurance.

security service    A capability that supports one, or many, of the security goals. Examples
                    of security services are key management, access control, and
                    authentication.

subject             An active entity, generally in the form of a person, process, or device, that
                    causes information to flow among objects or changes the system state.

system integrity   The quality that a system has when it performs its intended function in an
                   unimpaired manner, free from unauthorized manipulation of the system,
                   whether intentional or accidental.

threat             Any circumstance or event with the potential to harm an information
                   system through unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure, modification
                   of data, and/or denial of service. Threats arise from human actions and
                   natural events.

threat source      Either (1) intent and method targeted at the intentional exploitation of a
                   vulnerability or (2) the situation and method that may accidentally trigger
                   a vulnerability.

threat analysis    The examination of threat sources against system vulnerabilities to
                   determine the threats for a particular system in a particular operational
                   environment.

vulnerability      A weakness in system security requirements, design, implementation, or
                   operation, that could be accidentally triggered or intentionally exploited
                   and result in a violation of the system’s security policy.
