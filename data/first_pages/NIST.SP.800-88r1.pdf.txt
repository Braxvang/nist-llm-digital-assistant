Executive Summary

The modern storage environment is rapidly evolving. Data may pass through multiple
organizations, systems, and storage media in its lifetime. The pervasive nature of data
propagation is only increasing as the Internet and data storage systems move towards a
distributed cloud-based architecture. As a result, more parties than ever are responsible for
effectively sanitizing media and the potential is substantial for sensitive data to be collected and
retained on the media. This responsibility is not limited to those organizations that are the
originators or final resting places of sensitive data, but also intermediaries who transiently store
or process the information along the way. The efficient and effective management of information
from inception through disposition is the responsibility of all those who have handled the data.

The application of sophisticated access controls and encryption help reduce the likelihood that an
attacker can gain direct access to sensitive information. As a result, parties attempting to obtain
sensitive information may seek to focus their efforts on alternative access means such as
retrieving residual data on media that has left an organization without sufficient sanitization
effort having been applied. Consequently, the application of effective sanitization techniques and
tracking of storage media are critical aspects of ensuring that sensitive data is effectively
protected by an organization against unauthorized disclosure. Protection of information is
paramount. That information may be on paper, optical, electronic or magnetic media.

An organization may choose to dispose of media by charitable donation, internal or external
transfer, or by recycling it in accordance with applicable laws and regulations if the media is
obsolete or no longer usable. Even internal transfers require increased scrutiny, as legal and
ethical obligations make it more important than ever to protect data such as Personally
Identifiable Information (PII). No matter what the final intended destination of the media is, it is
important that the organization ensure that no easily re-constructible residual representation of
the data is stored on the media after it has left the control of the organization or is no longer
going to be protected at the confidentiality categorization of the data stored on the media.

Sanitization refers to a process that renders access to target data on the media infeasible for a
given level of effort. This guide will assist organizations and system owners in making practical
sanitization decisions based on the categorization of confidentiality of their information. It does
not, and cannot, specifically address all known types of media; however, the described
sanitization decision process can be applied universally.

1        Introduction

    1.1 Purpose and Scope

The information security concern regarding information disposal and media sanitization resides
not in the media but in the recorded information. The issue of media disposal and sanitization is
driven by the information placed intentionally or unintentionally on the media. Electronic media
used on a system should be assumed to contain information commensurate with the security
categorization of the system’s confidentiality. If not handled properly, release of these media
could lead to an occurrence of unauthorized disclosure of information. Categorization of an
information technology (IT) system in accordance with Federal Information Processing Standard
(FIPS) 199, Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information
Systems 1, is the critical first step in understanding and managing system information and media.

Based on the results of categorization, the system owner should refer to NIST Special
Publication (SP) 800-53 Revision 4, Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information
Systems and Organizations 2, which specifies that “the organization sanitizes information system
digital media using approved equipment, techniques, and procedures. The organization tracks,
documents, and verifies media sanitization and destruction actions and periodically tests
sanitization equipment/procedures to ensure correct performance. The organization sanitizes or
destroys information system digital media before its disposal or release for reuse outside the
organization, to prevent unauthorized individuals from gaining access to and using the
information contained on the media.”

This document will assist organizations in implementing a media sanitization program with
proper and applicable techniques and controls for sanitization and disposal decisions, considering
the security categorization of the associated system’s confidentiality.

The objective of this special publication is to assist with decision making when media require
disposal, reuse, or will be leaving the effective control of an organization. Organizations should
develop and use local policies and procedures in conjunction with this guide to make effective,
risk-based decisions on the ultimate sanitization and/or disposition of media and information.

The information in this guide is best applied in the context of current technology and
applications. It also provides guidance for information disposition, sanitization, and control
decisions to be made throughout the system life cycle. Forms of media exist that are not
addressed by this guide, and media are yet to be developed and deployed that are not covered by
this guide. In those cases, the intent of this guide outlined in the procedures section applies to all
forms of media based on the evaluated security categorization of the system’s confidentiality
according to FIPS 199.

                                                                1
NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1                                                               Guidelines for Media Sanitization


Before any media are sanitized, system owners are strongly advised to consult with designated
officials with privacy responsibilities (e.g., Privacy Officers), Freedom of Information Act
(FOIA) officers, and the local records retention office. This consultation is to ensure compliance
with record retention regulations and requirements in the Federal Records Act. In addition,
organizational management should also be consulted to ensure that historical information is
captured and maintained where required by business needs. This should be ongoing, as controls
may have to be adjusted as the system and its environment changes.

 1.2 Audience

Protecting the confidentiality of information should be a concern for everyone, from federal
agencies and businesses to home users. Recognizing that interconnections and information
exchange are critical in the delivery of government services, this guide can be used to assist in
deciding what processes to use for sanitization or disposal.

 1.3 Assumptions

The premise of this guide is that organizations are able to correctly identify the appropriate
information categories, confidentiality impact levels, and location of the information. Ideally,
this activity is accomplished in the earliest phase of the system life cycle. 3 This critical initial
step is outside the scope of this document, but without this identification, the organization will,
in all likelihood, lose control of some media containing sensitive information.

This guide does not claim to cover all possible media that an organization could use to store
information, nor does it attempt to forecast the future media that may be developed during the
effective life of this guide. Users are expected to make sanitization and disposal decisions based
on the security categorization of the information contained on the media.

 1.4 Relationship to Other NIST Documents

The following NIST documents, including FIPS and Special Publications, are directly related to
this document:

        FIPS 199 and NIST SP 800-60 Revision 1, Guide for Mapping Types of Information and
         Information Systems to Security Categories 4, provide guidance for establishing the
         security categorization for a system’s confidentiality. This categorization will impact the
         level of assurance an organization should require in making sanitization decisions.

2           Background

Information disposition and sanitization decisions occur throughout the information system life
cycle. Critical factors affecting information disposition and media sanitization are decided at the
start of a system’s development. The initial system requirements should include hardware and
software specifications as well as interconnections and data flow documents that will assist the
system owner in identifying the types of media used in the system. Some storage devices support
enhanced commands for sanitization, which may make sanitization easier, faster, and/or more
effective. The decision may be even more fundamental, because effective sanitization procedures
may not yet have been determined for emerging media types. Without an effective command or
interface-based sanitization technique, the only option left may be to destroy the media. In that
event, the media cannot be reused by other organizations that might otherwise have been able to
benefit from receiving the repurposed storage device.

A determination should be made during the requirements phase about what other types of media
will be used to create, capture, or transfer information used by the system. This analysis,
balancing business needs and risk to confidentiality, will formalize the media that will be
considered for the system to conform to FIPS 200.

Media sanitization and information disposition activity is usually most intense during the
disposal phase of the system life cycle. However, throughout the life of an information system,
many types of media, containing data, will be transferred outside the positive control of the
organization. This activity may be for maintenance reasons, system upgrades, or during a
configuration update.

    2.1 Need for Proper Media Sanitization and Information Disposition

Media sanitization is one key element in assuring confidentiality. Confidentiality is defined as
“preserving authorized restrictions on information access and disclosure, including means for
protecting personal privacy and proprietary information…” 10 Additionally, “a loss of
confidentiality is the unauthorized disclosure of information.” 11

In order for organizations to have appropriate controls on the information they are responsible
for safeguarding, they must properly safeguard used media. An often rich source of illicit
information collection is either through dumpster diving for improperly disposed hard copy
media, acquisition of improperly sanitized electronic media, or through keyboard and laboratory
reconstruction of media sanitized in a manner not commensurate with the confidentiality of its
information. Media flows in and out of organizational control through recycle bins in paper form,
out to vendors for equipment repairs, and hot swapped into other systems in response to
hardware or software failures. This potential vulnerability can be mitigated through proper
understanding of where information is located, what that information is, and how to protect it.

 2.2 Types of Media

There are two primary types of media in common use:

      Hard Copy. Hard copy media are physical representations of information, most often
       associated with paper printouts. However, printer and facsimile ribbons, drums, and
       platens are all examples of hard copy media. The supplies associated with producing
       paper printouts are often the most uncontrolled. Hard copy materials containing sensitive
       data that leave an organization without effective sanitization expose a significant
       vulnerability to “dumpster divers” and overcurious employees, risking unwanted
       information disclosures.

      Electronic (i.e., “soft copy”). Electronic media are devices containing bits and bytes
       such as hard drives, random access memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM), disks,
       flash memory, memory devices, phones, mobile computing devices, networking devices,
       office equipment, and many other types listed in Appendix A.

In the future, organizations will be using media types not specifically addressed by this guide.
The processes described in this document should guide media sanitization decision making
regardless of the type of media in use. To effectively use this guide for all media types,
organizations and individuals should focus on the information that could possibly have been
recorded on the media, rather than on the media itself.

 2.3 Trends in Data Storage Media

Historical efforts to sanitize magnetic media have benefitted from the wide use of a single
common type of storage medium implemented relatively similarly across vendors and models.
The storage capacity of magnetic media has increased at a relatively constant rate and vendors
have modified the technology as necessary to achieve higher capacities. As the technology
approaches the superparamagnetic limit, or the limit at which magnetic state can be changed with
existing media and recording approaches, additional new approaches and technologies will be
necessary in order for storage vendors to produce higher capacity devices.

Alternative technologies such as flash memory-based storage devices, or Solid State Drives
(SSDs), have also become prevalent due to falling costs, higher performance, and shock
resistance. SSDs have already begun changing the norm in storage technology, and—at least
from a sanitization perspective—the change is revolutionary (as opposed to evolutionary).
Degaussing, a fundamental way to sanitize magnetic media, no longer applies in most cases for
flash memory-based devices. Evolutionary changes in magnetic media will also have potential
impacts on sanitization. New storage technologies, and even variations of magnetic storage, that
are dramatically different from legacy magnetic media will clearly require sanitization research
and require a reinvestigation of sanitization procedures to ensure efficacy.

Both revolutionary and evolutionary changes make sanitization decisions more difficult, as the
storage device may not clearly indicate what type of media is used for data storage. The burden
falls on the user to accurately determine the media type and apply the associated sanitization
procedure.

                                                 6
NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1                                                  Guidelines for Media Sanitization


 2.4 Trends in Sanitization

For storage devices containing magnetic media, a single overwrite pass with a fixed pattern such
as binary zeros typically hinders recovery of data even if state of the art laboratory techniques are
applied to attempt to retrieve the data. One major drawback of relying solely upon the native
Read and Write interface for performing the overwrite procedure is that areas not currently
mapped to active Logical Block Addressing (LBA) addresses (e.g., defect areas and currently
unallocated space) are not addressed. Dedicated sanitize commands support addressing these
areas more effectively. The use of such commands results in a tradeoff because although they
should more thoroughly address all areas of the media, using these commands also requires trust
and assurance from the vendor that the commands have been implemented as expected.

Users who have become accustomed to relying upon overwrite techniques on magnetic media
and who have continued to apply these techniques as media types evolved (such as to flash
memory-based devices) may be exposing their data to increased risk of unintentional disclosure.
Although the host interface (e.g. Advanced Technology Attachment (ATA) or Small Computer
System Interface (SCSI)) may be the same (or very similar) across devices with varying
underlying media types, it is critical that the sanitization techniques are carefully matched to the
media.

Destructive techniques for some media types may become more difficult or impossible to apply
in the future. Traditional techniques such as degaussing (for magnetic media) become more
complicated as magnetic media evolves, because some emerging variations of magnetic
recording technologies incorporate media with higher coercivity (magnetic force). As a result,
existing degaussers may not have sufficient force to effectively degauss such media.

Applying destructive techniques to electronic storage media (e.g., flash memory) is also
becoming more challenging, as the necessary particle size for commonly applied grinding
techniques goes down proportionally to any increases in flash memory storage density. Flash
memory chips already present challenges with occasional damage to grinders due to the hardness
of the component materials, and this problem will get worse as grinders attempt to grind the
chips into even smaller pieces.

Cryptographic Erase (CE), as described in Section 2.6, is an emerging sanitization technique that
can be used in some situations when data is encrypted as it is stored on media. With CE, media
sanitization is performed by sanitizing the cryptographic keys used to encrypt the data, as
opposed to sanitizing the storage locations on media containing the encrypted data itself. CE
techniques are typically capable of sanitizing media very quickly and could support partial
sanitization, a technique where a subset of storage media is sanitization. Partial sanitization,
sometimes referred to as selective sanitization, has potential applications in cloud computing and
mobile devices. However, operational use of CE today presents some challenges. In some cases,
it may be difficult to verify that CE has effectively sanitized media. This challenge, and possible
approaches, is described in Section 4.7.3. If verification cannot be performed, organizations
should use alternative sanitization methods that can be verified, or use CE in combination with a
sanitization technique that can be verified.

A list of device-specific characteristics of interest for the application of sanitization techniques is

                                                   7
NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1                                                Guidelines for Media Sanitization


included in Appendix E. These characteristics can be used to drive the types of questions that
media users should ask vendors, but ideally this information would be made readily available by
vendors so that it can be easily retrieved by users to facilitate informed risk based sanitization
decisions. For example, knowing the coercivity of the media can help a user decide whether or
not the available degausser(s) can effectively degauss the media.

 2.5 Types of Sanitization

Regarding sanitization, the principal concern is ensuring that data is not unintentionally released.
Data is stored on media, which is connected to a system. This guidance focuses on the media
sanitization component, which is simply data sanitization applied to a representation of the data
as stored on a specific media type. Other potential concern areas exist as part of the system, such
as for monitors, which may have sensitive data burned into the screen. Sensitive data stored in
areas of the system other than storage media (such as on monitor screens) are not addressed by
this document.

When media is repurposed or reaches end of life, the organization executes the system life cycle
sanitization decision for the information on the media. For example, a mass-produced
commercial software program contained on a DVD in an unopened package is unlikely to
contain confidential data. Therefore, the decision may be made to simply dispose of the media
without applying any sanitization technique. Alternatively, an organization is substantially more
likely to decide that a hard drive from a system that processed PII needs sanitization prior to
Disposal.

Disposal without sanitization should be considered only if information disclosure would have no
impact on organizational mission, would not result in damage to organizational assets, and would
not result in financial loss or harm to any individuals.

The security categorization of the information, along with internal environmental factors, should
drive the decisions on how to deal with the media. The key is to first think in terms of
information confidentiality, then apply considerations based on media type.

In organizations, information exists that is not associated with any categorized system. This
information is often hard copy internal communications such as memoranda, white papers, and
presentations. Sometimes this information may be considered sensitive. Examples may include
internal disciplinary letters, financial or salary negotiations, or strategy meeting minutes.
Organizations should label these media with their internal operating confidentiality levels and
associate a type of sanitization described in this publication.

Sanitization is a process to render access to target data (the data subject to the sanitization
technique) on the media infeasible for a given level of recovery effort. The level of effort applied
when attempting to retrieve data may range widely. For example, a party may attempt simple
keyboard attacks without the use of specialized tools, skills, or knowledge of the media
characteristics. On the other end of the spectrum, a party may have extensive capabilities and be
able to apply state of the art laboratory techniques.

NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1                                                Guidelines for Media Sanitization


Clear, Purge, and Destroy are actions that can be taken to sanitize media. The categories of
sanitization are defined as follows:

      Clear applies logical techniques to sanitize data in all user-addressable storage locations
       for protection against simple non-invasive data recovery techniques; typically applied
       through the standard Read and Write commands to the storage device, such as by
       rewriting with a new value or using a menu option to reset the device to the factory state
       (where rewriting is not supported).

      Purge applies physical or logical techniques that render Target Data recovery infeasible
       using state of the art laboratory techniques.

      Destroy renders Target Data recovery infeasible using state of the art laboratory
       techniques and results in the subsequent inability to use the media for storage of data.

A more detailed summary of sanitization techniques is provided in Section 5. Sanitization
requirements for specific media/device types are provided in Appendix A.

It is suggested that the user of this guide categorize the information, assess the nature of the
medium on which it is recorded, assess the risk to confidentiality, and determine the future plans
for the media. Then, the organization can choose the appropriate type(s) of sanitization. The
selected type(s) should be assessed as to cost, environmental impact, etc., and a decision should
be made that best mitigates the risk to confidentiality and best satisfies other constraints imposed
on the process.

 2.6 Use of Cryptography and Cryptographic Erase

Many storage manufacturers have released storage devices with integrated encryption and access
control capabilities, also known as Self-Encrypting Drives (SEDs). SEDs feature always-on
encryption that substantially reduces the likelihood that unencrypted data is inadvertently
retained on the device. The end user cannot turn off the encryption capabilitieswhich ensures that
all data in the designated areas are encrypted. A significant additional benefit of SEDs is the
opportunity to tightly couple the controller and storage media so that the device can directly
address the location where any cryptographic keys are stored, whereas solutions that depend only
on the abstracted user access interface through software may not be able to directly address those
areas.

SEDs typically encrypt all of the user-addressable area, with the potential exception of certain
clearly identified areas, such as those dedicated to the storage of pre-boot applications and
associated data.

Cryptographic Erase (CE) leverages the encryption of target data by enabling sanitization of the
target data’s encryption key. This leaves only the ciphertext remaining on the media, effectively
sanitizing the data by preventing read-access.

Without the encryption key used to encrypt the target data, the data is unrecoverable. The level
of effort needed to decrypt this information without the encryption key then is the lesser of the

                                                 9
NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1                                                                Guidelines for Media Sanitization


strength of the cryptographic key or the strength of the cryptographic algorithm and mode of
operation used to encrypt the data.

If strong cryptography is used, sanitization of the target data is reduced to sanitization of the
encryption key(s) used to encrypt the target data. Thus, with CE, sanitization may be performed
with high assurance much faster than with other sanitization techniques. The encryption itself
acts to sanitize the data, subject to constraints identified in this guidelines document. Federal
agencies must use FIPS 140 validated encryption modules 12 in order to have assurance that the
conditions stated above have been verified for the SED.

Typically, CE can be executed in a fraction of a second. This is especially important as storage
devices get larger resulting in other sanitization methods take more time. CE can also be used as
a supplement or addition to other sanitization approaches.

      2.6.1 When Not To Use CE To Purge Media

         Do not use CE to purge media if the encryption was enabled after sensitive data was
          stored on the device without having been sanitized first.

         Do not use CE if it is unknown whether sensitive data was stored on the device without
          being sanitized prior to encryption.

      2.6.2 When to Consider Using CE

         Consider using CE when all data intended for CE is encrypted prior to storage on the
          media (including the data, as well as virtualized copies).

         Consider using CE when we know the location(s) on the media where the encryption key
          is stored (be it the target data's encryption key or an associated wrapping key) and can
          sanitize those areas using the appropriate media-specific sanitization technique, ensuring
          the actual location on media where the key is stored is addressed.

         Consider using CE when we can know that all copies of the encryption keys used to
          encrypt the target data are sanitized

         Consider using CE when the target data's encryption keys are, themselves, encrypted with
          one or more wrapping keys and we are confident that we can sanitize the corresponding
          wrapping keys.

         Consider using CE when we are confident of the ability of the user to clearly identifyand
          use the commands provided by the device to perform the CE operation.

    2.6.3 Additional CE Considerations

    If the encryption key exists outside of the storage device (typically due to backup or
    escrow), there is a possibility that the key could be used in the future to recover data stored
    on the encrypted media.

    CE should only be used as a sanitization method when the organization has confidence that
    the encryption keys used to encrypt the Target Data have been appropriately protected.
    Such assurances can be difficult to obtain with software cryptographic modules, such as
    those used with software-based full disk encryption solutions, as these products typically
    store cryptographic keys in the file system or other locations on media which are accessible
    to software. While there may be situations where use of CE with software cryptographic
    modules is both appropriate and advantageous, such as performing a quick remote wipe on a
    lost mobile device, unless the organization has confidence in both the protection of the
    encryption keys, and the destruction of all copies of those keys in the sanitization process,
    CE should be used in combination with another appropriate sanitization method.

    Sanitization using CE should not be trusted on devices that have been backed-up or
    escrowed the key(s) unless the organization has a high level of confidence about how and
    where the keys were stored and managed outside the device. Such back-up or escrowed
    copies of data, credentials, or keys should be the subject of a separate device sanitization
    policy. That policy should address backups or escrowed copies within the scope of the
    devices on which they are actually stored.

    A list of applicable considerations, and a sample for how vendors could report the
    mechanisms implemented, is included in Appendix E. Users seeking to implement CE
    should seek reasonable assurance from the vendor (such as the vendor’s report as described
    in Appendix E) that the considerations identified here have been addressed and only use
    FIPS 140 validated cryptographic modules.

 2.7 Factors Influencing Sanitization and Disposal Decisions

Several factors should be considered along with the security categorization of the system
confidentiality when making sanitization decisions. The cost versus benefit tradeoff of a
sanitization process should be understood prior to a final decision. For instance, it may not be
cost-effective to degauss inexpensive media such as diskettes. Even though Clear or Purge may
be the recommended solution, it may be more cost-effective (considering training, tracking, and
verification, etc.) to destroy media rather than use one of the other options. Organizations retain
the ability increase the level of sanitization applied if that is reasonable and indicated by an
assessment of the existing risk.

Organizations should consider environmental factors including (but not limited to):

      What types (e.g., optical non-rewritable, magnetic) and size (e.g., megabyte, gigabyte,
       and terabyte) of media storage does the organization require to be sanitized?

      What is the confidentiality requirement for the data stored on the media?

NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1                                                              Guidelines for Media Sanitization


         Will the media be processed in a controlled area?

         Should the sanitization process be conducted within the organization or outsourced?

         What is the anticipated volume of media to be sanitized by type of media? 13

         What is the availability of sanitization equipment and tools?

         What is the level of training of personnel with sanitization equipment/tools?

         How long will sanitization take?

         What is the cost of sanitization when considering tools, training, verification, and re-
          entering media into the supply stream?

 2.8 Sanitization Scope

For most sanitization operations, the target of the operation is all data stored on the media by the
user. However, in some cases, there may be a desire or need to sanitize a subset of the media.
Partial sanitization comes with some risk, as it may be difficult to verify that sensitive data stored
on a portion of the media did not spill over into other areas of the media (e.g., remapped bad
blocks). In addition, the dedicated interfaces provided by storage device vendors for sanitization
typically operate at the device level, and are not able to be applied to a subset of the media. As a
result, partial sanitization usually depends on the typical read and write commands available to
the user, which may not be able to bypass any interface abstraction that may be present in order
to directly address the media area of concern.

On some storage devices featuring integrated encryption capabilities, CE provides a unique
mechanism for supporting some forms of partial sanitization. Some of these devices support the
ability to encrypt portions of the data with different encryption keys (e.g., encrypting different
partitions with different encryption keys). When the interface supports sanitizing only a subset of
the encryption keys, partial sanitization via CE is possible. As with any other sanitization
technique applied to media, the level of assurance depends both upon vendor implementation and
on the level of assurance that data was stored only in the areas that are able to be reliably
sanitized. Data may be stored outside these regions either because the user or software on the
system moved data outside of the designated area on the media, or because the storage device
stored data to the media in a manner not fully understood by the user.

Due to the difficulty in reliably ensuring that partial sanitization effectively addresses all
sensitive data, sanitization of the whole device is preferred to partial sanitization whenever
possible. Organizations should understand the potential risks to this approach and make
appropriate decisions on this technique balancing the factors described earlier in this sectionas

well as their business missions and specific use cases. For example, a drive in a datacenter may
contain customer data from multiple customers. When one customer discontinues service and
another begins storing data on the same media, the organization may choose to apply partial
sanitization in order to retain the data of other customers that is also stored on the same storage
device on other areas of the media. The organization may choose to apply partial sanitization
because the drive remains in the physical possession of the organization, access by the customer
is limited to the interface commands, and the organization has trust in the partial sanitization
mechanism available for that specific piece of media. In cases where the alternative to partial
sanitization is not performing sanitization at all, partial sanitization provides benefits that should
be considered.

3        Roles and Responsibilities

    3.1 Program Managers/Agency Heads

“Ultimately, responsibility for the success of an organization lies with its senior managers.” 14 By
establishing an effective information security governance structure, they establish the
organization’s computer security program and its overall program goals, objectives, and
priorities in order to support the mission of the organization. Ultimately, the head of the
organization is responsible for ensuring that adequate resources are applied to the program and
for ensuring program success. Senior management is responsible for ensuring that the resources
are allocated to correctly identify types and locations of information and to ensure that resources
are allocated to properly sanitize the information.

The other responsibilities in the remainder of this section are for illustrative purposes and the
intent is to ensure that organizations think through the different responsibilities for sanitizing
media and assign those responsibilities appropriately.

The CIO 15 is charged with promulgating information security policy. A component of this policy
is information disposition and media sanitization. The CIO, as the information custodian, is
responsible for ensuring that organizational or local sanitization requirements follow the
guidelines of this document.

    3.3 Information System Owner

The information system owner 16 should ensure that maintenance or contractual agreements are in
place and are sufficient in protecting the confidentiality of the system media and information
commensurate with the impact of disclosure of such information on the organization.

    3.4 Information Owner/Steward

The information owner should ensure that appropriate supervision of onsite media maintenance by
service providers occurs, when necessary. The information owner is also responsible for ensuring that
they fully understand the sensitivity of the information under their control and that the users of the
information are aware of its confidentiality and the basic requirements for media sanitization.

     Per the Information Technology Management Reform Act of 1996 (“Clinger-Cohen Act”; P.L. 104-106 (Division E) 10 Feb.
    1996), when an agency has not designated a formal CIO position, FISMA requires the associated responsibilities to be handled
    by a comparable agency official.

    16
       The role of the information system owner can be interpreted in a variety of ways depending on the particular agency and the
    system development life-cycle phase of the information system. Some agencies may refer to the information system owners as
    “program managers” or “business/asset/mission owners”.


                                                                 14

 3.5 Senior Agency Information Security Officer (SAISO)

The SAISO is responsible for ensuring that the requirements of the information security policy
with regard to information disposition and media sanitization are implemented and exercised in a
timely and appropriate manner throughout the organization. The SAISO also requires access to
the technical basis/personnel to understand and properly implement the sanitization procedures.

 3.6 System Security Manager/Officer

Often assisting system management officials in this effort is a system security manager/officer
responsible for day-today security implementation/administration duties. Although not normally
part of the computer security program management office, this person is responsible for
coordinating the security efforts of a particular system(s). This role is sometimes referred to as
the Computer System Security Officer or the Information System Security Officer.

 3.7 Property Management Officer

The property management officer is responsible for ensuring that sanitized media and devices
that are redistributed within the organization, donated to external entities or destroyed are
properly accounted for.

 3.8 Records Management Officer

The records management officer is responsible for advising the system and/or data owner or
custodian of retention requirements that must be met so the sanitization of media will not destroy
records that should be preserved.

 3.9 Privacy Officer

The privacy officer is responsible for providing advice regarding the privacy issues surrounding
the disposition of privacy information and the media upon which it is recorded.

 3.10 Users

Users have the responsibility for knowing and understanding the confidentiality of the
information they are using to accomplish their assigned work and ensure proper handling of
information.

4     Information Sanitization and Disposition Decision Making

An organization may maintain storage devices with differing levels of confidentiality, and it is
important to understand what types of data may be stored on the device in order to apply the
techniques that best balance efficiency and efficacy to maintain the confidentiality of the data.
Data confidentiality level should be identified using procedures described in FIPS 199.
Additional information is available on mapping information types to security categories in SP
800-60 Revision 1.

While most devices support some form of Clear, not all devices have a reliable Purge
mechanism. For moderate confidentiality data, the media owner may choose to accept the risk of
applying Clear techniques to the media, acknowledging that some data may be able to be
retrieved by someone with the time, knowledge, and skills to do so.

Purge (and Clear, where applicable) may be more appropriate than Destroy when factoring in
environmental concerns, the desire to reuse the media (either within the organization or by
selling or donating the media), the cost of a media or media device, or difficulties in physically
Destroying some types of media.

The risk decision should include the potential consequence of disclosure of information
retrievable from the media, the cost of information retrieval and its efficacy, and the cost of
sanitization and its efficacy. Additionally, the length of time the data will remain sensitive should
also be considered. These values may vary between different environments.

Organizations can use Figure 4-1 with the descriptions in this section to assist them in making
sanitization decisions that are commensurate with the security categorization of the
confidentiality of information contained on their media. The decision process is based on the
confidentiality of the information, not the type of media. Once organizations decide what type of
sanitization is best for their individual case, then the media type will influence the technique used
to achieve this sanitization goal.

 4.1 Information Decisions in the System Life Cycle

The need for, and methods to conduct, media sanitization should be identified and developed
before arriving at the Disposal phase in the system life cycle. At the start of system development,
when the initial system security plan is developed 17, media sanitization controls are developed,
documented, and deployed. One of the key decisions that will affect the ability to conduct
sanitization is choosing what media are going to be used within the system. Although this is

 17
      NIST SP 800-18 Revision 1, p.19.


                                                         17
NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1                                                              Guidelines for Media Sanitization


mostly a business decision, system owners must understand early on that this decision affects the
types of resources needed for sanitization throughout the rest of the system life cycle.

An organization may ask a product vendor for assistance in identifying storage media that may
contain sensitive data. This information is typically documented in a ‘statement of volatility’.
The statement may be used to support decisions about which equipment to purchase, based on
the ease or difficulty of sanitization. While volatility statements are useful, caution should be
applied in comparing statements across vendors because vendors may state volatility details
differently.

Organizations should take care in identifying media for sanitization. Many items used will
contain multiple forms of media that may require different methods of sanitization. For example,
a desktop computer may contain a hard drive, motherboard, RAM, and ROM, and mobile
devices contain on-board volatile memory as well as nonvolatile removable memory.

The increasing availability of rapidly applicable techniques, such as Cryptographic Erase,
provides opportunities for organizations to reduce the risk of inadvertent disclosure by
combining sanitization technologies and techniques. For example, an organization could choose
to apply Cryptographic Erase at a user’s desktop before removing the media to send it to be
‘formally’ sanitized at the sanitization facility, in order to reduce risk and exposure.

 4.2 Determination of Security Categorization

Early in the system life cycle, a system is categorized using the guidance found in FIPS 199,
NIST SP 800-60 Rev. 1, or CNSSI 1253 18, including the security categorization for the system’s
confidentiality. This security categorization is revisited at least every three years (or when
significant change occurs within the system) and revalidated throughout the system’s life, and
any necessary changes to the confidentiality category can be made. Once the security
categorization is completed, the system owner can then design a sanitization process that will
ensure adequate protection of the system’s information.

Much information is not associated with a specific system but is associated with internal business
communications, usually on paper. Organizations should label these media with their internal
operating confidentiality levels and associate a type of sanitization described in this publication.

 4.3 Reuse of Media

A key decision on sanitization is whether the media are planned for reuse or recycle. Some forms
of media are often reused to conserve an organization’s resources.

If media are not intended for reuse either within or outside an organization due to damage or
other reason, the simplest and most cost-effective method of control may be Destroy.

 4.4 Control of Media

A factor influencing an organizational sanitization decision is who has control and access to the
media. This aspect must be considered when media leaves organizational control. Media control may
be transferred when media are returned from a leasing agreement or are being donated or resold to be
reused outside the organization. The following are examples of media control:
Under Organization Control:

      Media being turned over for maintenance are still considered under organization control
       if contractual agreements are in place with the organization and the maintenance provider
       specifically provides for the confidentiality of the information.

      Maintenance being performed on an organization’s site, under the organization’s
       supervision, by a maintenance provider is also considered under the control of the
       organization.

Not Under Organization Control (External Control):

      Media that are being exchanged for warranty, cost rebate, or other purposes and where
       the specific media will not be returned to the organization are considered to be out of
       organizational control.

 4.5 Data Protection Level

Even within an organization, varying data protection policies may be established. For instance, a
company may have an engineering department and a sales department. The sales personnel may
not have a need for access to the detailed proprietary technical data such as source code and
schematics, and the engineers may not have a need to access the PII of the company’s customers.
Both might be within the same confidentiality categorization, but contextually different and with
different internal and external rules regarding necessary controls. As such, data protection level
is a complementary consideration to organizational control. When identifying whether
sanitization is necessary, both the organizational control and data protection level should be
considered.

 4.6 Sanitization and Disposal Decision

Once an organization completes an assessment of its system confidentiality, determines the need
for information sanitization, determines appropriate time frames for sanitization, and determines
the types of media used and the media disposition, an effective, risk-based decision can be made
on the appropriate and needed level of sanitization. Again, environmental factors and media type
might cause the level of sanitization to change. For example, purging paper copies generally does
not make sense, so destroying them would be an acceptable alternative.

Upon completion of sanitization decision making, the organization should record the decision
and ensure that a process and proper resources are in place to support these decisions. This
process is often the most difficult piece of the media sanitization process because it includes not
only the act of sanitization but also the verification: capturing decisions and actions, identifying
resources, and having critical interfaces with key officials.

                                                 19
NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1                                                Guidelines for Media Sanitization


 4.7 Verify Methods

Verifying the selected information sanitization and disposal process is an essential step in
maintaining confidentiality. Two types of verification should be considered. The first is
verification every time sanitization is applied (where applicable, as most Destroy techniques do
not support practical verification for each sanitized piece of media). The second is a
representative sampling verification, applied to a selected subset of the media. If possible, the
sampling should be executed by personnel who were not part of the original sanitization action.
If sampling is done after full verification in cases of low risk tolerance then a different
verification tool than the one used in the original verification should be used.

    4.7.1 Verification of Equipment

    Verification of the sanitization process is not the only assurance required by the
    organization. If the organization is using sanitization tools (e.g., a degausser or a dedicated
    workstation), then equipment calibration, as well as equipment testing, and scheduled
    maintenance, is also needed.

    4.7.2 Verification of Personnel Competencies

    Another key element is the potential training needs and current expertise of personnel
    conducting the sanitization. Organizations should ensure that equipment operators are
    competent to perform sanitization functions.

    4.7.3 Verification of Sanitization Results

    The goal of sanitization verification is to ensure that the target data was effectively sanitized.
    When supported by the device interface (such as an ATA or SCSI storage device or solid
    state drive), the highest level of assurance of effective sanitization (outside of a laboratory)
    is typically achieved by a full reading of all accessible areas to verify that the expected
    sanitized value is in all addressable locations. A full verification should be performed if time
    and external factors permit. This manner of verification typically only applies where the
    device is in an operational state following sanitization so that data can be read and written
    through the native interface.

    If an organization chooses representative sampling then there are three main goals applied to
    electronic media sanitization verification:

        1. Select pseudorandom locations on the media each time the analysis tool is applied.
           This reduces the likelihood that a sanitization tool that only sanitizes a subset of the
           media will result in verification success in a situation where sensitive data still
           remains.

        2. Select locations across the addressable space (user addressable and reserved areas).
           For instance, conceptually break the media up into equally sized subsections. Select
           a large enough number of subsections so that the media is well-covered. The number
           of practical subsections depends on the device and addressing scheme. The
           suggested minimum number of subsections for a storage device leveraging LBA

                                                 20
NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1                                                Guidelines for Media Sanitization


           addressing is one thousand. Select at least two non-overlapping pseudorandom
           locations from within each subsection. For example, if one thousand conceptual
           subsections are chosen, at least two pseudorandom locations in the first thousandth
           of the media addressing space would be read and verified, at least two pseudorandom
           locations in the second thousandth of the media addressing space would be read and
           verified, and so on.

               a. In addition to the locations already identified, include the first and last
                  addressable location on the storage device.

       3. Each consecutive sample location (except the ones for the first and last addressable
          location) should cover at least 5 % of the subsection and not overlap the other sample
          in the subsection. Given two non-overlapping samples, the resulting verification
          should cover at least 10 % of the media once all subsections have had two samples
          taken.

    Cryptographic Erase has different verification considerations than procedures such as
    rewriting or block erasing, because the contents of the physical media following
    Cryptographic Erase may not be known and therefore cannot be compared to a given value.
    When Cryptographic Erase is leveraged, there are multiple options for verification, and each
    uses a quick review of a subset of the media. Each involves a selection of pseudorandom
    locations to be sampled from across the media.

    The first option is to read the pseudorandom locations prior to Cryptographic Erase, and
    then again following Cryptographic Erase to compare the results. This is likely the most
    effective verification technique. Another option is to search for strings across the media or
    looking for files that are in known locations, such as operating system files likely to be
    stored in a specific area.

    The number of locations and size of each sample should take into consideration the risks in
    transferring the Target Data to the storage media of the machine hosting the sanitization
    application. As a result, the proportion of the media covered by verification for the
    Cryptographic Erase technique may be relatively small (or at least lower than the above
    guidance of 10 % for verification of non-cryptographic sanitization techniques), but should
    still be applied across a wide range of the addressable area.

    However, these techniques may not always be available because the individual performing
    the sanitization may not have the authentication token needed to access and read the data
    stored on the drive. If an organization cannot verify that CE effectively sanitized storage
    media, organizations should employ an alternative sanitization method that can be verified,
    either in combination with CE or in place of CE.

    As part of the sanitization process, in addition to the verification performed on each piece of
    media following the sanitization operation, a subset of media items should be selected at
    random for secondary verification using a different verification tool. The secondary
    verification tool should be from a separate developer. For the secondary verification, a full
    verification should be performed. At least 20 % of sanitized media (by number of media

                                                21
NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1                                                Guidelines for Media Sanitization


    items sanitized) should be verified. The secondary verification provides assurance that the
    primary operation is working as expected.

 4.8 Documentation

Following sanitization, a certificate of media disposition should be completed for each piece of
electronic media that has been sanitized. A certification of media disposition may be a piece of
paper or an electronic record of the action taken. For example, most modern hard drives include
bar codes on the label for values such as model and serial numbers. The person performing the
sanitization might simply enter the details into a tracking application and scan each bar code as
the media is sanitized. Automatic documentation can be important as some systems make
physical access to the media very difficult.

The decision regarding whether to complete a certificate of media disposition and how much
data to record depends on the confidentiality level of the data on the media. For a large number
of devices with data of very low confidentiality, an organization may choose not to complete the
certificate.

When fully completed, the certificate should record at least the following details:

      Manufacturer

      Model

      Serial Number

      Organizationally Assigned Media or Property Number (if applicable)

      Media Type (i.e., magnetic, flash memory, hybrid, etc.)

      Media Source (i.e., user or computer the media came from)

      Pre-Sanitization Confidentiality Categorization (optional)

      Sanitization Description (i.e., Clear, Purge, Destroy)

      Method Used (i.e., degauss, overwrite, block erase, crypto erase, etc.)

      Tool Used (including version)

      Verification Method (i.e., full, quick sampling, etc.)

      Post-Sanitization Confidentiality Categorization (optional)

      Post-Sanitization Destination (if known)

      For Both Sanitization and Verification:

           o Name of Person

                                                 22
NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1                                                Guidelines for Media Sanitization


           o Position/Title of Person

           o Date

           o Location

           o Phone or Other Contact Information

           o Signature

Optionally, an organization may choose to record the following (if known):

      Data Backup (i.e., if data was backed up, and if so, where)

A sample certificate is included in Appendix G.

If the storage device has been successfully verified and the sanitization results in a lower
confidentiality level of the storage device, all markings on the device indicating the previous
confidentiality level should be removed. A new marking indicating the updated confidentiality
level should be applied, unless the device is leaving the organization and is stored in a location
where access is carefully controlled until the device leaves the organization to prevent
reintroduction of sensitive data.

The value of a certification of media disposition depends on the organization’s handling of
storage media over the media’s lifecycle. If records are maintained when the media is introduced
to the environment, when the media leaves the place it was last used, and when it reaches the
sanitization destination, the organization can most effectively identify how well media
sanitization is being applied across the enterprise. If there is a breakdown in tracking at locations
other than the sanitization destination, the sanitization records only show that specific media was
sanitized and not whether the organization is effectively sanitizing all media that has been
introduced into the operating environment.

5     Summary of Sanitization Methods

Several different methods can be used to sanitize media. Four of the most common are presented
in this section. Users of this guide should categorize the information to be disposed of, assess the
nature of the medium on which it is recorded, assess the risk to confidentiality, and determine the
future plans for the media. Then, using information in Table 5-1, decide on the appropriate
method for sanitization. The selected method should be assessed as to cost, environmental
impact, etc., and a decision should be made that best mitigates the risks to an unauthorized
disclosure of information.


                                         Table 5-1: Sanitization Methods


     Method                                                     Description



      Clear     One method to sanitize media is to use software or hardware products to overwrite user-
                addressable storage space on the media with non-sensitive data, using the standard read
                and write commands for the device. This process may include overwriting not only the logical
                storage location of a file(s) (e.g., file allocation table) but also should include all user-
                addressable locations. The security goal of the overwriting process is to replace Target Data
                with non-sensitive data. Overwriting cannot be used for media that are damaged or not
                rewriteable, and may not address all areas of the device where sensitive data may be
                retained. The media type and size may also influence whether overwriting is a suitable
                sanitization method. For example, flash memory-based storage devices may contain spare
                cells and perform wear levelling, making it infeasible for a user to sanitize all previous data
                using this approach because the device may not support directly addressing all areas where
                sensitive data has been stored using the native read and write interface.
                The Clear operation may vary contextually for media other than dedicated storage devices, where
                the device (such as a basic cell phone or a piece of office equipment) only provides the ability to
                return the device to factory state (typically by simply deleting the file pointers) and does not directly
                support the ability to rewrite or apply media-specific techniques to the non-volatile storage contents.
                Where rewriting is not supported, manufacturer resets and procedures that do not include rewriting
                might be the only option to Clear the device and associated media. These still meet the definition
                for Clear as long as the device interface available to the user does not facilitate retrieval of the
                Cleared data.


      Purge     Some methods of purging (which vary by media and must be applied with considerations
                described further throughout this document) include overwrite, block erase, and
                Cryptographic Erase, through the use of dedicated, standardized device sanitize commands
                that apply media-specific techniques to bypass the abstraction inherent in typical read and
                write commands.
                Destructive techniques also render the device Purged when effectively applied to the
                appropriate media type, including incineration, shredding, disintegrating, degaussing, and
                pulverizing. The common benefit across all these approaches is assurance that the data is
                infeasible to recover using state of the art laboratory techniques. However, Bending, Cutting,
                and the use of some emergency procedures (such as using a firearm to shoot a hole through
                a storage device) may only damage the media as portions of the media may remain
                undamaged and therefore accessible using advanced laboratory techniques.
                Degaussing renders a Legacy Magnetic Device Purged when the strength of the degausser is
                carefully matched to the media coercivity. Coercivity may be difficult to determine based only on
                information provided on the label. Therefore, refer to the device manufacturer for coercivity details.
                Degaussing should never be solely relied upon for flash memory-based storage devices or for
                magnetic storage devices that also contain non-volatile non-magnetic storage. Degaussing

               technique).


     Destroy   There are many different types, techniques, and procedures for media Destruction. While
               some techniques may render the Target Data infeasible to retrieve through the device
               interface and unable to be used for subsequent storage of data, the device is not considered
               Destroyed unless Target Data retrieval is infeasible using state of the art laboratory
               techniques.

                   •    Disintegrate, Pulverize, Melt, and Incinerate. These sanitization methods are
                        designed to completely Destroy the media. They are typically carried out at an
                        outsourced metal Destruction or licensed incineration facility with the specific
                        capabilities to perform these activities effectively, securely, and safely.
                   •    Shred. Paper shredders can be used to Destroy flexible media such as diskettes
                        once the media are physically removed from their outer containers. The shred size
                        of the refuse should be small enough that there is reasonable assurance in
                        proportion to the data confidentiality that the data cannot be reconstructed. To
                        make reconstructing the data even more difficult, the shredded material can be
                        mixed with non-sensitive material of the same type (e.g., shredded paper or
                        shredded flexible media).
               The application of Destructive techniques may be the only option when the media fails and other
               Clear or Purge techniques cannot be effectively applied to the media, or when the verification of
               Clear or Purge methods fails (for known or unknown reasons).

Appendix A—Minimum Sanitization Recommendations

Once a decision is made based on factors such as those described in Section 4, and after applying
relevant organizational environmental factors, then the tables in this Appendix can be used to
determine recommended sanitization of specific media. That recommendation should reflect the
FIPS 199 security categorization of the system confidentiality to reduce the impact of harm of
unauthorized disclosure of information from the media.

Although use of the tables in this Appendix is recommended here, other methods exist to satisfy
the intent of Clear, Purge, and Destroy. Methods not specified in this table may be suitable as
long as they are verified and found satisfactory by the organization. Not all types of available
media are specified in this table. If your media are not included in this guide, organizations are
urged to identify and use processes that will fulfill the intent to Clear, Purge, or Destroy their
media.

When an organization or agency has a sanitization technology, method and/or tool that they trust
and have tested, they are strongly encouraged to share this information through public forums,
such as the Federal Agency Security Practices (FASP) website 19. The FASP effort was initiated
as a result of the success of the Federal Chief Information Officer (CIO) Council’s Federal Best
Security Practices (BSP) pilot effort to identify, evaluate, and disseminate best practices for
critical infrastructure protection (CIP) and security.

The proper initial configuration of each type of device helps ensure that the sanitization
operation is as effective as possible. While called out for some specific items below, users are
encouraged to check manufacturer recommendations and guides such as the DISA Security
Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs) 20 for additional information about recommended
settings for any other items in this list as well.

If a mobile device has nonvolatile removable memory, it may contain additional information that
may or may not be addressed by the sanitization process identified in Table A-3. Contact the
manufacturer and/or cellular provider to determine what types of data are stored on the
removable memory and identify whether any additional sanitization is required for the removable
memory. Additional details about such removable memory and associated data recovery
capabilities are available in NIST SP 800-101 Revision 1 21. If a mobile device does not have
sufficient built-in sanitization appropriate for the sensitivity or impact level of the data it
contains, then rather than destroy the device (to protect the information) consider contacting
businesses providing sanitization services to determine if their services meet your needs.

Many internal storage devices (as opposed to removable media, such as an SD card) as well as
storage subsystems that incorporate installed media, support dedicated sanitize commands. The

availability of these commands is impacted in some cases by system (i.e., BIOS/UEFI—Basic
Input-Output System/Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) characteristics, such as how and
when freeze lock commands are issued to a device. The use of a dedicated computer or
equipment to perform sanitization that facilitates leveraging these commands (such as a PC or
workstation, with an external drive bay that facilitates safely connecting a drive after the system
has been powered on) can help address this issue. The behavior and methods to bypass freeze
lock or other limitations on command availability vary between computers, so refer to the
computer manufacturer for details about the behavior of specific models. Alternative approaches
exist for addressing the issue, and will vary depending on the hardware, software, and firmware
of the computer. University of California San Diego (UCSD)’s Center for Magnetic Recording
Research (CMRR) has also developed some tools and documentation about work-arounds for
this issue (see Appendix C for details).

Some sanitization procedures feature additional optional methods. The choice regarding whether
to apply the optional components depends on the level of confidentiality of the data and
assurance of correct implementation of the non-optional portion of the sanitization procedure.
For example, an organization might decide that for PII, for example, that any method applied
with an available optional component should execute that optional component. The choice may
also be based on the time factor, as some procedures, including the optional method, can be
executed in a total of a matter of minutes. In that case, the organization might decide to include
the optional component even if the data is not in a higher confidentiality category.

   Purge:         N/A, see Destroy

   Destroy:       Destroy paper using cross cut shredders which produce particles that are 1 mm x 5 mm
                  (0.04 in. x 0.2 in.) in size (or smaller), or pulverize/disintegrate paper materials using
                  disintegrator devices equipped with a 3/32 in. (2.4 mm) security screen.

                  Destroy microforms (microfilm, microfiche, or other reduced image photo negatives) by
                  burning.


   Notes:         When material is burned, residue must be reduced to white ash.

   Purge:         See Destroy. Most routers and switches only offer capabilities to Clear (and not Purge) the
                  data contents. A router or switch may offer Purge capabilities, but these capabilities are
                  specific to the hardware and firmware of the device and should be applied with caution.
                  Refer to the device manufacturer to identify whether the device has a Purge capability that
                  applies media-dependent techniques (such as rewriting or block erasing) to ensure that
                  data recovery is infeasible, and that the device does not simply remove the file pointers.


   Destroy:       Shred, Disintegrate, Pulverize, or Incinerate by burning the device in a licensed incinerator.


   Notes:         For both Clear and (if applicable) Purge, refer to the manufacturer for additional information on
                  the proper Sanitization procedure.
                  Network Devices may contain removable storage. The removable media must be removed and
                  sanitized using media-specific techniques.

   Mobile Devices
   (If a device has removable storage – first check for encryption and unencrypt if so – then
   remove the removable storage prior to sanitization)

   Apple iPhone and iPad (current generation and future iPhones and iPads)

   Clear:         Select the full sanitize option (typically in the ‘Settings > General > Reset > Erase All Content and
                  Settings’ menu). (The sanitization operation should take only minutes as Cryptographic Erase is
                  supported. This assumes that encryption is on and that all data has been encrypted.) Sanitization
                  performed via a remote wipe should be treated as a Clear operation, and it is not possible to
                  verify the sanitization results.

   Purge:         Select the full sanitize option (typically in the ‘Settings > General > Reset > Erase All Content and
                  Settings’ menu). (The sanitization operation should take only minutes with Cryptographic Erase
                  being supported. This assumes that encryption is on and that all data has been encrypted.)

   Destroy:       Shred, Disintegrate, Pulverize, or Incinerate by burning the device in a licensed incinerator.


   Notes:         Following the Clear/Purge operation, manually navigate to multiple areas of the device (such as
                  browser history, files, photos, etc.) to verify that no personal information has been retained on the
                  device. Before sanitizing the device, ensure that the data is backed up to a safe place.
                  Current iPhones have hardware encryption – turned on by default.

   Blackberry     (back up data on device before sanitization)

   Clear:         BB OS 7.x/6.x - Select Options > Security Options > Security Wipe , making sure to select all
                  subcategories of data types for sanitization. Then type “blackberry” in the text field, then click on
                  “Wipe” (“Wipe Data” in BB OS 6.x) BB OS 10.x (Decrypt media card before continuing) Select
                  Settings, Security and Privacy, Security Wipe . Type “blackberry” in the text field, then click on
                  “Delete Data”. The sanitization operation may take as long as several hours depending on the
                  media size. Sanitization performed via a remote wipe should be treated as a Clear operation,
                  and it is not possible to verify the sanitization results.

                 sanitization operation may take as long as several hours depending on the media size.

   Destroy:      Shred, Disintegrate, Pulverize, or Incinerate by burning the device in a licensed incinerator.


   Notes:        Following the Clear/Purge operation, manually navigate to multiple areas of the device (such as
                 browser history, files, photos, etc.) to verify that no personal information has been retained on the
                 device. Centralized management (BES) allows for device encryption.
                 Refer to the manufacturer for additional information on the proper sanitization procedure, and for
                 details about implementation differences between device versions and OS versions. Proper
                 initial configuration using guides such as the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA)
                 Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs) (http://iase.disa.mil/stigs/) helps ensure that
                 the level of data protection and sanitization assurance is as robust as possible. If the device
                 contains removable storage media, ensure that the media is sanitized using appropriate media-
                 dependent procedures.

   Devices running the Google Android OS              (connect to power before starting encryption)

   Clear:        Perform a factory reset through the device’s settings menu. For example, on Samsung
                 Galaxy S5 running Android 4.4.2, select settings, then, under User and Backup, select
                 Backup and reset, then select Factory data reset. For other versions of Android and other
                 mobile phone devices, refer to the user manual. Sanitization performed via a remote wipe
                 should be treated as a Clear operation, and it is not possible to verify the sanitization
                 results.

   Purge:        The capabilities of Android devices are determined by device manufacturers and service
                 providers. As such, the level of assurance provided by the factory data reset option may depend
                 on architectural and implementation details of a particular device. Devices seeking to use a
                 factory data reset to purge media should use the eMMC Secure Erase or Secure Trim
                 command, or some other equivalent method (which may depend on the device’s storage media).
                 Some versions of Android support encryption, and may support Cryptographic Erase.
                 Refer to the device manufacturer (or service provider, if applicable) to identify whether the
                 device has a Purge capability that applies media-dependent sanitization techniques or
                 Cryptographic Erase to ensure that data recovery is infeasible, and that the device does
                 not simply remove the file pointers.
   Destroy:      Shred, Disintegrate, Pulverize, or Incinerate by burning the device in a licensed incinerator.

                 ensure that the level of data protection and sanitization assurance is as robust as possible.
                 Following the Clear or (if applicable) Purge operation, manually navigate to multiple areas of the
                 device (such as browser history, files, photos, etc.) to verify that no personal information has
                 been retained on the device. When in doubt, check device manual or call tech support.
                 For both Clear and Purge, refer to the manufacturer for additional information on the proper
                 sanitization procedure.

   Windows Phone OS 7.1/8/8.x         (Centralized management may be needed for encryption)

   Clear:        Select the Settings option (little gear symbol) from the live tile or from the app list. On the
                 “Settings” page, scroll to the bottom of the page and select the “About” button. In the about page,
                 there will be a reset your phone button at the bottom of the page. Click on this button to
                 continue. Choose Yes when you see the warning messages. Please note that after the process
                 is completed, all your personal content will disappear. Sanitization performed via a remote
                 wipe should be treated as a Clear operation, and it is not possible to verify the sanitization
                 results.

                    the device’s storage media).
                    In some environments, Windows Phone devices may support encryption, and may support
                    Cryptographic Erase. Refer to the device manufacturer (or service provider, if applicable)
                    to identify whether the device has a Purge capability that applies media-dependent
                    sanitization techniques or Cryptographic Erase to ensure that data recovery is infeasible,
                    and that the device does not simply remove the file pointers.

                    and sanitization assurance is as robust as possible.

   All other mobile devices This includes cell phones, smart phones, PDAs, tablets, and other devices not
   covered in the preceding mobile categories.

   Clear:           Manually delete all information, then perform a full manufacturer’s reset to reset the mobile
                    device to factory state. Sanitization performed via a remote wipe should be treated as a
                    Clear operation, and it is not possible to verify the sanitization results.

   Purge:           See Destroy. Many mobile devices only offer capabilities to Clear (and not Purge) the data
                    contents. A mobile device may offer Purge capabilities, but these capabilities are specific to the
                    hardware and software of the device and should be applied with caution. The device
                    manufacturer should be referred to in order to identify whether the device has a Purge capability
                    that applies media-dependent techniques (such as rewriting or block erasing) or Cryptographic
                    Erase to ensure that data recovery is infeasible, and that the device does not simply remove the
                    file pointers.

   Destroy:         Shred, Disintegrate, Pulverize, or Incinerate by burning the device in a licensed incinerator.


   Notes:           Following the Clear or (if applicable) Purge operation, manually navigate to multiple areas of the
                    device (such as call history, browser history, files, photos, etc.) to verify that no personal
                    information has been retained on the device.

   Clear:           Perform a full manufacturer’s reset to reset the office equipment to its factory default settings.

   Purge:           See Destroy. Most office equipment only offers capabilities to Clear (and not Purge) the
                    data contents. Office equipment may offer Purge capabilities, but these capabilities are
                    specific to the hardware and firmware of the device and should be applied with caution.
                    Refer to the device manufacturer to identify whether the device has a Purge capability that
                    applies media-dependent techniques (such as rewriting or block erasing) or Cryptographic
                    Erase to ensure that data recovery is infeasible, and that the device does not simply
                    remove the file pointers. Office equipment may have removable storage media, and if so,
                    media-dependent sanitization techniques may be applied to the associated storage device.


   Destroy:         Shred, Disintegrate, Pulverize, or Incinerate by burning the device in a licensed incinerator.


   Notes:           For both Clear and (if applicable) Purge, manually navigate to multiple areas of the device (such
                    as stored fax numbers, network configuration information, etc.) to verify that no personal
                    information has been retained on the device.
                    For both Clearing and (if applicable) Purge, the ink, toner, and associated supplies (drum, fuser,
                    etc.) should be removed and destroyed or disposed of in accordance with applicable law,
                    environmental, and health considerations. Some of these supplies may retain impressions of
                    data printed by the machine and therefore could pose a risk of data exposure, and should be
                    handled accordingly. If the device is functional, one way to reduce the associated risk is to print a
                    blank page, then an all-black page, then another blank page. For devices with dedicated color
                    components (such as cyan, magenta, and yellow toners and related supplies), one page of each
                    color should also be printed between blank pages. The resulting sheets should be handled at
                    the confidentiality of the Office Equipment (prior to sanitization). Note that these procedures do
                    not apply to supplies such as ink/toner on a one-time use roll, as they are typically not used again
                    and therefore will not be addressed by sending additional pages through the equipment. They
                    will, however, still need to be removed and destroyed. Office Equipment supplies may also pose
                    health risks, and should be handled using appropriate procedures to minimize exposure to the
                    print components and toner.
                    For both Clear and (if applicable) Purge, refer to the manufacturer for additional information on
                    the proper sanitization procedure.



                                        Table A-5: Magnetic Media Sanitization


   Magnetic Media

   Floppies

   Clear:           Overwrite media by using organizationally approved software and perform verification on the
                    overwritten data. The Clear pattern should be at least a single write pass with a fixed data value,
                    such as all zeros. Multiple write passes or more complex values may optionally be used.

   Purge:           Degauss in an organizationally approved degausser rated at a minimum for the media.


   Destroy:         Incinerate floppy disks and diskettes by burning in a licensed incinerator or Shred.


   Magnetic Disks (flexible or fixed)

   Clear:           Overwrite media by using organizationally approved software and perform verification on the
                    overwritten data. The Clear pattern should be at least a single write pass with a fixed data value,
                    such as all zeros. Multiple write passes or more complex values may optionally be used.

   Purge:          Degauss in an organizationally approved degausser rated at a minimum for the media.

   Destroy:        Incinerate disks and diskettes by burning in a licensed incinerator or Shred.


   Notes:          Degaussing magnetic disks typically renders the disk permanently unusable.

   Reel and Cassette Format Magnetic Tapes

   Clear:          Re-record (overwrite) all data on the tape using an organizationally approved pattern, using a
                   system with similar characteristics to the one that originally recorded the data. For example,
                   overwrite previously recorded sensitive VHS format video signals on a comparable VHS format
                   recorder. All portions of the magnetic tape should be overwritten one time with known non-
                   sensitive signals. Clearing a magnetic tape by re-recording (overwriting) may be impractical for
                   most applications since the process occupies the tape transport for excessive time periods.

   Purge:          Degauss the magnetic tape in an organizationally approved degausser rated at a minimum for
                   the media.

   Destroy:        Incinerate by burning the tapes in a licensed incinerator or Shred.


   Notes:          Preparatory steps for Destruction, such as removing the tape from the reel or cassette prior to
                   Destruction, are unnecessary. However, segregation of components (tape and reels or
                   cassettes) may be necessary to comply with the requirements of a Destruction facility or for
                   recycling measures.

   ATA Hard Disk Drives This includes PATA, SATA, eSATA, etc

   Clear:          Overwrite media by using organizationally approved and validated overwriting
                   technologies/methods/tools. The Clear pattern should be at least a single write pass with a fixed
                   data value, such as all zeros. Multiple write passes or more complex values may optionally be
                   used.

   Purge:          Four options are available:
                       1. Use one of the ATA Sanitize Device feature set commands, if supported, to perform a
                             Sanitize operation. One or both of the following options may be available:
                                  a. The overwrite EXT command. Apply one write pass of a fixed pattern across
                                       the media surface. Some examples of fixed patterns include all zeros or a
                                       pseudorandom pattern. A single write pass should suffice to Purge the
                                       media.
                                       Optionally: Instead of one write pass, use three total write passes of a
                                       pseudorandom pattern, leveraging the invert option so that the second write
                                       pass is the inverted version of the pattern specified.
                                  b. If the device supports encryption and the technical specifications described in
                                       this document have been satisfied, the Cryptographic Erase (also known as
                                       CRYPTO SCRAMBLE EXT) command.
                                       Optionally: After Cryptographic Erase is successfully applied to a device, use
                                       the overwrite command (if supported) to write one pass of zeros or a
                                       pseudorandom pattern across the media. If the overwrite command is not
                                       supported, the Secure Erase or the Clear procedure could alternatively be
                                       applied following Cryptographic Erase.
                       2. Use the ATA Security feature set’s SECURE ERASE UNIT command, if support, in
                             Enhanced Erase mode. The ATA Sanitize Device feature set commands are preferred
                             over the over the ATA Security feature set SECURITY ERASE UNIT command when
                             supported by the ATA device.
                       3. Cryptographic Erase through the Trusted Computing Group (TCG) Opal Security
                             Subsystem Class (SSC) or Enterprise SSC interface by issuing commands as


                                                         32
NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1                                                                Guidelines for Media Sanitization


                             necessary to cause all MEKs to be changed (if the requirements described in this
                             document have been satisfied). Refer to the TCG and device manufacturers for more
                             information.
                             Optionally: After Cryptographic Erase is successfully applied to a device, use the
                             overwrite command (if supported) to write one pass of zeros or a pseudorandom
                             pattern across the media. If the overwrite command is not supported, the Secure
                             Erase or the Clear procedure could alternatively be applied following Cryptographic
                             Erase.
                        4.   Degauss in an organizationally approved automatic degausser or disassemble the hard
                             disk drive and Purge the enclosed platters with an organizationally approved
                             degaussing wand.

   Destroy:         Shred, Disintegrate, Pulverize, or Incinerate by burning the device in a licensed incinerator.


   Notes:           Verification must be performed for each technique within Clear and Purge, except degaussing.
                    The assurance provided by degaussing depends on selecting an effective degausser, applying it
                    appropriately and periodically spot checking the results to ensure it is working as expected.
                    When using the three pass ATA sanitize overwrite procedure with the invert option, the
                    verification process would simply search for the original pattern (which would have been written
                    again during the third pass).
                    The storage device may support configuration capabilities that artificially restrict the ability to
                    access portions of the media as defined in the ATA standard, such as a Host Protected Area
                    (HPA), Device Configuration Overlay (DCO), or Accessible Max Address. Even when a
                    dedicated sanitization command addresses these areas, their presence may affect the ability to
                    reliably verify the effectiveness of the sanitization procedure if left in place. Any configuration
                    options limiting the ability to access the entire addressable area of the storage media should be
                    reset prior to applying the sanitization technique. Recovery data, such as an OEM-provided
                    restoration image may have been stored in this manner, and sanitization may therefore impact
                    the ability to recover the system unless reinstallation media is also available.
                    When Cryptographic Erase is applied, verification must be performed prior to additional
                    sanitization techniques (if applicable), such as a Clear or Purge technique applied following
                    Cryptographic Erase, to ensure that the cryptographic operation completed successfully. A quick
                    sampling verification as described in section 4.7 should also be performed after any additional
                    techniques are applied following Cryptographic Erase.
                    Not all implementations of encryption are necessarily suitable for reliance upon Cryptographic
                    Erase as a Purge mechanism. The decision regarding whether to use Cryptographic Erase
                    depends upon verification of attributes previously identified in this guidance and in Appendix D.
                    Given the variability in implementation of the ATA Security feature set SECURITY ERASE UNIT
                    command, use of this command is not recommended without first consulting with the
                    manufacturer to verify that the storage device’s model-specific implementation meets the needs
                    of the organization.
                    This guidance applies to Legacy Magnetic media only, and it is critical to verify the media type
                    prior to sanitization. Note that emerging media types, such as HAMR media or hybrid drives may
                    not be easily identifiable by the label. Refer to the manufacturer for details about the media type
                    in a storage device.
                    Degaussing the media in a storage device typically renders the device unusable.

   SCSI Hard Disk Drives This includes Parallel SCSI,Serial Attached SCSI (SAS), Fibre Channel, USB Attached
   Storage (UAS), and SCSI Express Partial sanitization is not supported in this section.

   Clear:           Overwrite media by using organizationally approved and validated overwriting
                    technologies/methods/tools. The Clear procedure should consist of at least one pass of writes
                    with a fixed data value, such as all zeros. Multiple passes or more complex values may
                    optionally be used.

   Purge:           Four options are available:
                        1. Apply the SCSI SANITIZE command, if supported. One or both of the following options

                             may be available:
                                  a. The OVERWRITE service action. Apply one write pass of a fixed pattern
                                       across the media surface. Some examples of fixed patterns include all zeros
                                       or a pseudorandom pattern. A single write pass should suffice to Purge the
                                       media.
                                       Optionally: Instead of one write pass, use three total write passes of a
                                       pseudorandom pattern, leveraging the invert option so that the second write
                                       pass is the inverted version of the pattern specified.
                                  b. If the device supports encryption, the CRYPTOGRAPHIC ERASE service
                                       action.
                                       Optionally: After Cryptographic Erase is successfully applied to a device, use
                                       the overwrite command (if supported) to write one pass of zeros or a
                                       pseudorandom pattern across the media. If the overwrite command is not
                                       supported, the Clear procedure could alternatively be applied.
                        2.   Cryptographic Erase through the TCG Opal SSC or Enterprise SSC interface by
                             issuing commands as necessary to cause all MEKs to be changed. Refer to the TCG
                             and vendors shipping TCG Opal or Enterprise storage devices for more information.
                             Optionally: After Cryptographic Erase is successfully applied to a device, use the
                             overwrite command (if supported) to write one pass of zeros or a pseudorandom
                             pattern across the media. If the overwrite command is not supported, the Clear
                             procedure could alternatively be applied.
                        3.   Degauss in an organizationally approved automatic degausser or disassemble the hard
                             disk drive and Purge the enclosed platters with an organizationally approved
                             degaussing wand. The degausser/wand should be rated sufficient for the media.

   Destroy:      Shred, Disintegrate, Pulverize, or Incinerate by burning the device in a licensed incinerator.


   Notes:        Verification must be performed for each technique within Clear and Purge as described in the
                 Verify Methods subsection, except degaussing. The assurance provided by degaussing
                 depends on selecting an effective degausser, applying it appropriately and periodically spot
                 checking the results to ensure it is working as expected.
                 When using the three pass SCSI sanitize overwrite procedure with the invert (also known as
                 complement) option, the verification process would simply search for the original pattern (which
                 would have been written again during the third pass). While it is widely accepted that one pass
                 of overwriting should be sufficient for Purging the data, the availability of a dedicated command
                 that incorporates the ability to invert the data pattern allows an efficient and effective approach
                 that mitigates any residual risk associated with variations in implementations of magnetic
                 recording features across device manufacturers.
                 The storage device may support configuration capabilities that artificially restrict the ability to
                 access portions of the media, such as “SCSI mode parameter block descriptor’s NUMBER OF
                 LOGICAL BLOCKS field (accessible with the SCSI MODE SENSE and MODE SELECT
                 commands”. Even when a dedicated sanitization command addresses these areas, their
                 presence may affect the ability to reliably verify the effectiveness of the sanitization procedure if
                 left in place. Any configuration options limiting the ability to access the entire addressable area of
                 the storage media should be reset prior to applying the sanitization technique.
                 When Cryptographic Erase is applied, verification must be performed prior to additional
                 sanitization techniques (if applicable), such as a Clear or Purge technique applied following
                 Cryptographic Erase, to ensure that the cryptographic operation completed successfully. A quick
                 sampling verification as described in the Verify Methods subsection should also be performed
                 after any additional techniques are applied following Cryptographic Erase.
                 Not all implementations of encryption are necessarily suitable for reliance upon Cryptographic
                 Erase as a Purge mechanism. The decision regarding whether to use Cryptographic Erase

                 not be easily identifiable by the label. Refer to the manufacturer for details about the media type
                 in a storage device.

   Peripherally Attached Storage

   External Locally Attached Hard Drives This includes, USB, Firewire, etc. (Treat eSATA as ATA
   Hard drive.)

   Clear:          Overwrite media by using organizationally approved and tested overwriting
                   technologies/methods/tools. The Clear pattern should be at least a single pass with a fixed data
                   value, such as all zeros. Multiple passes or more complex values may alternatively be used.

   Purge:          The implementation of External Locally Attached Hard Drives varies sufficiently across models
                   and vendors that the issuance of any specific command to the device may not reasonably and
                   consistently assure the desired sanitization result.
                   When the external drive bay contains an ATA or SCSI hard drive, if the commands can be
                   delivered natively to the device, the device may be sanitized based on the associated media-
                   specific guidance. However, the drive could be configured in a vendor-specific manner that
                   precludes sanitization when removed from the enclosure. Additionally, if sanitization techniques
                   are applied, the hard drive may not work as expected when reinstalled in the enclosure.
                   Refer to the device manufacturer to identify whether the device has a Purge capability that
                   applies media-dependent techniques (such as rewriting, block erasing, Cryptographic Erase,
                   etc.) to ensure that data recovery is infeasible, and that the device does not simply remove the
                   file pointers.

   Destroy:        Shred, Disintegrate, Pulverize, or Incinerate by burning the device in a licensed incinerator.


   Notes:          Verification as described in the Verify Methods subsection must be performed for each technique
                   within Clear and Purge.
                   Some external locally attached hard drives, especially those featuring security or encryption
                   features, may also have hidden storage areas that might not be addressed even when the drive
                   is removed from the enclosure. The device vendor may leverage proprietary commands to
                   interact with the security subsystem. Please refer to the manufacturer to identify whether any
                   reserved areas exist on the media and whether any tools are available to remove or sanitize
                   them, if present.

   Destroy:      Destroy in order of recommendations:

                        1.   Removing the information-bearing layers of CD media using a commercial optical

                             media
                        2.   Incinerate optical disk media (reduce to ash) using a licensed facility.
                        3.   Use optical disk media shredders or disintegrator devices to reduce to particles
                                                                                                            2

                        Table A-8: Flash Memory-Based Storage Device Sanitization


   Flash Memory-Based Storage Devices

   ATA Solid State Drives (SSDs) This includes PATA, SATA, eSATA, etc.

   Clear:               1.   Overwrite media by using organizationally approved and tested overwriting
                             technologies/methods/tools. The Clear procedure should consist of at least one pass
                             of writes with a fixed data value, such as all zeros. Multiple passes or more complex
                             values may alternatively be used.
                             Note: It is important to note that overwrite on flash-based media may significantly
                             reduce the effective lifetime of the media and it may not sanitize the data in unmapped
                             physical media (i.e., the old data may still remain on the media).
                        2.   Use the ATA Security feature set’s SECURITY ERASE UNIT command, if supported.

   Purge:        Three options are available:
                     1. Apply the ATA sanitize command, if supported. One or both of the following options
                          may be available:
                               a. The block erase command.
                                    Optionally: After the block erase command is successfully applied to a
                                    device, write binary 1s across the user addressable area of the storage media
                                    and then perform a second block erase.
                               b. If the device supports encryption, the Cryptographic Erase (also known as
                                    sanitize crypto scramble) command.
                                    Optionally: After Cryptographic Erase is successfully applied to a device, use
                                    the block erase command (if supported) to block erase the media. If the block
                                    erase command is not supported, Secure Erase or the Clear procedure could
                                    alternatively be applied.
                     2. Cryptographic Erase through the TCG Opal SSC or Enterprise SSC interface by
                          issuing commands as necessary to cause all MEKs to be changed. Refer to the TCG
                          and vendors shipping TCG Opal or Enterprise storage devices for more information.
                          Optionally: After Cryptographic Erase is successfully applied to a device, use the block
                          erase command (if supported) to block erase the media. If the block erase command is
                          not supported, Secure Erase or the Clear procedure could alternatively be applied.

   Destroy:      Shred, Disintegrate, Pulverize, or Incinerate by burning the device in a licensed incinerator.


   Notes:        Verification must be performed for each technique within Clear and Purge as described in the
                 Verify Methods subsection.
                 When Cryptographic Erase is applied, verification must be performed prior to additional
                 sanitization techniques (if applicable), such as a Clear or Purge technique applied following
                 Cryptographic Erase, to ensure that the cryptographic operation completed successfully. A quick
                 sampling verification as described in the Verify Methods subsection should also be performed
                 after any additional techniques are applied following Cryptographic Erase.

NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1                                                               Guidelines for Media Sanitization


                  The storage device may support configuration capabilities that artificially restrict the ability to
                  access portions of the media as defined in the ATA standard, such as a Host Protected Area
                  (HPA), Device Configuration Overlay (DCO), or Accessible Max Address. Even when a
                  dedicated sanitization command addresses these areas, their presence may affect the ability to
                  reliably verify the effectiveness of the sanitization procedure if left in place. Any configuration
                  options limiting the ability to access the entire addressable area of the storage media should be
                  reset prior to applying the sanitization technique. Recovery data, such as an OEM-provided
                  restoration image may have been stored in this manner, and sanitization may therefore impact
                  the ability to recover the system unless reinstallation media is also available.
                  Not all implementations of encryption are necessarily suitable for reliance upon Cryptographic
                  Erase as a Purge mechanism. The decision regarding whether to use Cryptographic Erase
                  depends upon verification of attributes previously identified in this guidance and in Appendix D.
                  Given the variability in implementation of the Enhanced Secure Erase feature, use of this
                  command is not recommended without first referring the manufacturer to identify that the storage
                  device’s model-specific implementation meets the needs of the organization.
                  Whereas ATA Secure Erase was a Purge mechanism for magnetic media, it is only a Clear
                  mechanism for flash memory due to variability in implementation and the possibility that sensitive
                  data may remain in areas such as spare cells that have been rotated out of use.
                  Degaussing must not be solely relied upon as a sanitization technique on flash memory-based
                  storage devices or on hybrid devices that contain non-volatile flash memory storage media.
                  Degaussing may be used when non-volatile flash memory media is present if the flash memory
                  components are sanitized using media-dependent techniques.

   SCSI Solid State Drives (SSSDs) This includes Parallel SCSI, Serial Attached SCSI (SAS), Fibre
   Channel, USB Attached Storage (UAS), and SCSI Express.

   Clear:         Overwrite media by using organizationally approved and tested overwriting
                  technologies/methods/tools. The Clear procedure should consist of at least one pass of writes
                  with a fixed data value, such as all zeros. Multiple passes or more complex values may
                  alternatively be used.
                  Note: It is important to note that overwrite on flash-based media may significantly reduce the
                  effective lifetime of the media and it may not sanitize the data in unmapped physical media (i.e.,
                  the old data may still remain on the media).

   Purge:         Two options are available:
                      1. Apply the SCSI SANITIZE command, if supported. One or both of the following options
                           may be available:
                                a. The BLOCK ERASE service action.
                                b. If the device supports encryption, the CRYPTOGRAPHIC ERASE service
                                     action.
                                     Optionally: After Cryptographic Erase is successfully applied to a device, use
                                     the block erase command (if supported) to block erase the media. If the block
                                     erase command is not supported, the Clear procedure could alternatively be
                                     applied.
                      2. Cryptographic Erase through the TCG Opal SSC or Enterprise SSC interface by
                           issuing commands as necessary to cause all MEKs to be changed. Refer to the TCG
                           and vendors shipping TCG Opal or Enterprise storage devices for more information.
                           Optionally: After Cryptographic Erase is successfully applied to a device, use the block
                           erase command (if supported) to block erase the media. If the block erase command is
                           not supported, the Clear procedure is an acceptable alternative.

   Destroy:       Shred, Disintegrate, Pulverize, or Incinerate by burning the device in a licensed incinerator.

                 command addresses these areas, their presence may affect the ability to reliably verify the
                 effectiveness of the sanitization procedure if left in place. Any configuration options limiting the

   NVM Express SSDs

   Clear:        Overwrite media by using organizationally approved and tested overwriting
                 technologies/methods/tools. The Clear procedure should consist of at least one pass of writes
                 with a fixed data value, such as all zeros. Multiple passes or more complex values may
                 alternatively be used.

   Purge:        Two options are available:
                     1. Apply the NVM Express Format command, if supported. One or both of the following
                          options may be available:
                               a. The User Data Erase command.
                               b. If the device supports encryption, the Cryptographic Erase command.
                                    Optionally: After Cryptographic Erase is successfully applied to a device, use
                                    the User Data Erase command (if supported) to erase the media. If the User
                                    Data Erase command is not supported, the Clear procedure could

                 technologies/methods/tools. The Clear pattern should be at least two passes, to include a
                 pattern in the first pass and its complement in the second pass. Additional passes may be used.

   Purge:        Most USB removable media does not support sanitize commands, or if supported, the interfaces
                 are not supported in a standardized way across these devices. Refer to the manufacturer for
                 details about the availability and functionality of any available sanitization features and
                 commands.

   Destroy:      Shred, Disintegrate, Pulverize, or Incinerate by burning the device in a licensed incinerator.


   Notes:        For most cases where Purging is desired, USB removable media should be Destroyed.

   Memory Cards This includes SD, SDHC, MMC, Compact Flash Memory, Microdrive, MemoryStick,
   etc.

   Clear:        Overwrite media by using organizationally approved and tested overwriting
                 technologies/methods/tools. The Clear pattern should be at least two passes, to include a
                 pattern in the first pass and its complement in the second pass. Additional passes may be used.

   Purge:        N/A

   Destroy:      Shred, Disintegrate, Pulverize, or Incinerate by burning the device in a licensed incinerator.


   Notes:        None.

   Embedded Flash Memory on Boards and Devices This includes motherboards and peripheral
   cards such as network adapters or any other adapter containing non-volatile flash memory.

   Clear:        If supported by the device, reset the state to original factory settings.

   Purge:        N/A If the flash memory can be easily identified and removed from the board, the flash memory
                 may be Destroyed independently from the disposal of the board that contained the flash memory.
                 Otherwise, the whole board should be Destroyed.

   Destroy:      Shred, Disintegrate, Pulverize, or Incinerate by burning the device in a licensed incinerator.


   Notes:        While Embedded flash memory has traditionally not been specifically addressed in media
                 sanitization guidelines, the increasing complexity of systems and associated use of flash memory
                 has complementarily increased the likelihood that sensitive data may be present. For example,
                 remote management capabilities integrated into a modern motherboard may necessitate storing
                 IP addresses, hostnames, usernames and passwords, certificates, or other data that may be
                 considered sensitive. As a result, for Clearing, it may be necessary to interact with multiple
                 interfaces to fully reset the device state. When this concept is applied to the example, this might
                 include the BIOS/UEFI interface as well as the remote management interface.
                 As with other types of media, the choice of sanitization technique is based on environment-
                 specific considerations. While the choice might be made to neither Clear nor Purge embedded
                 flash memory, it is important to recognize and accept the potential risk and continue to reevaluate
                 the risk as the environment changes.

                        simple non-invasive data recovery techniques using the same
                        interface available to the user; typically applied through the standard
                        read and write commands to the storage device, such as by rewriting
                        with a new value or using a menu option to reset the device to the
                        factory state (where rewriting is not supported).

CD                      A Compact Disc (CD) is a class of media from which data are read
                        by optical means.

CMRR                    The Center for Magnetic Recording Research, located at the
                        University of California, San Diego, advances the state-of-the-art in
                        magnetic storage and trains graduate students and postdoctoral
                        professionals (CMRR homepage: http://cmrr.ucsd.edu/).

Cut                     The use of a tool or physical technique to cause a break in the
                        surface of the electronic storage media, potentially breaking the
                        media into two or more pieces and making it difficult or infeasible to
                        recover the data using state of the art laboratory techniques.

Cryptographic Erase     A method of Sanitization in which the Media Encryption Key
                        (MEK) for the encrypted Target Data (or the Key Encryption Key –
                        KEK) is sanitized, making recovery of the decrypted Target Data
                        infeasible.

Data                    Pieces of information from which “understandable information” is
                        derived.

Degauss                 To reduce the magnetic flux to virtual zero by applying a reverse
                        magnetizing field. Degaussing any current generation hard disk
                        (including but not limited to IDE, EIDE, ATA, SCSI and Jaz) will
                        render the drive permanently unusable since these drives store track
                        location information on the hard drive.

                        Also called “demagnetizing.”

Destroy                 A method of Sanitization that renders Target Data recovery
                        infeasible using state of the art laboratory techniques and results in
                        the subsequent inability to use the media for storage of data.

Digital                 The coding scheme generally used in computer technology to
                        represent data.

Disintegration          A physically Destructive method of sanitizing media; the act of
                        separating into component parts.

Disposal                Disposal is a release outcome following the decision that media does
                        not contain sensitive data. This occurs either because the media
                        never contained sensitive data or because Sanitization techniques
                        were applied and the media no longer contains sensitive data.

DVD                     A Digital Video Disc (DVD) has the same shape and size as a CD,
                        but with a higher density that gives the option for data to be double-
                        sided and/or double-layered.

DVD-RW                  A rewritable (re-recordable) DVD for both movies and data from the
                        DVD Forum.

DVD+RW                  A rewritable (re-recordable) DVD for both movies and data from the
                        DVD+RW Alliance.

DVD+R                   A write-once (read only) version of the DVD+RW from the
                        DVD+RW Alliance.

DVD-R                   A write-once (read only) DVD for both movies and data endorsed by
                        the DVD Forum.

Electronic Media        General term that refers to media on which data are recorded via an
                        electrically based process.

Erasure                 Process intended to render magnetically stored information
                        irretrievable by normal means.

Hard Disk               A rigid magnetic disk fixed permanently within a drive unit and used
                        for storing data. It could also be a removable cartridge containing
                        one or more magnetic disks.

                        persistent storage, without the assistance of heat (ie. heat assisted
                        magnetic recording (HAMR)) or the additional use of other
                        persistent storage media such as flash memory-based media.

Media                   Plural of medium.

Media Sanitization      A general term referring to the actions taken to render data written
                        on media unrecoverable by both ordinary and extraordinary means.

Medium                  Material on which data are or may be recorded, such as paper,
                        punched cards, magnetic tape, magnetic disks, solid state devices, or
                        optical discs.

                        grinding to a powder or dust.

Purge                   A method of Sanitization by applying physical or logical techniques
                        that renders Target Data recovery infeasible using state of the art
                        laboratory techniques.

Read                    Fundamental process in an information system that results only in
                        the flow of information from storage media to a requester.

Read-Only Memory        ROM is a pre-recorded storage medium that can only be read from


                                         43
NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1                                        Guidelines for Media Sanitization


                        and not written to.

Remanence               Residual information remaining on storage media.

ROM                     See Read-Only Memory.

Sanitize                A process to render access to Target Data on the media infeasible for
                        a given level of effort. Clear, Purge, and Destroy are actions that can
                        be taken to sanitize media.

SANITIZE Command        A command in the ATA and SCSI standards that leverages a
                        firmware-based process to perform a Sanitization action. If a device
                        supports the sanitize command, the device must support at least one
                        of three options: overwrite, block erase (usually for flash memory-
                        based media), or crypto scramble (Cryptographic Erase). These
                        commands typically execute substantially faster than attempting to
                        rewrite through the native read and write interface. The ATA
                        standard clearly identifies that the Sanitization operations must
                        address user data areas, user data areas not currently allocated
                        (including “previously allocated areas and physical sectors that have
                        become inaccessible”), and user data caches. The resulting media
                        contents vary based on the command used. The overwrite command
                        allows the user to specify the data pattern applied to the media, so
                        that pattern (or the inverse of that pattern, if chosen) will be written
                        to the media (although the actual contents of the media may vary due
                        to encoding). The result of the block erase command is vendor
                        unique, but will likely be 0s or 1s. The result of the crypto scramble
                        command is vendor unique, but will likely be cryptographically
                        scrambled data (except for areas that were not encrypted, which are
                        set to the value the vendor defines).

SCSI                    A magnetic media interface specification. Small Computer System
                        Interface.

Secure Erase Command    An overwrite command in the ATA standard (as ‘Security Erase
                        Unit’) that leverages a firmware-based process to overwrite the
                        media. This command typically executes substantially faster than
                        attempting to rewrite through the native read and write interface.
                        There are up to two options, ‘normal erase’ and ‘enhanced erase’.
                        The normal erase, as defined in the standard, is only required to
                        address data in the contents of LBA 0 through the greater of READ
                        NATIVE MAX or READ NATIVE MAX EXT, and replaces the
                        contents with 0s or 1s. The enhanced erase command specifies that,
                        “…all previously written user data shall be overwritten, including

                                         44
NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1                                        Guidelines for Media Sanitization


                        sectors that are no longer in use due to reallocation” and the
                        contents of the media following Sanitization are vendor unique. The
                        actual action performed by an enhanced erase varies by vendor and
                        model, and could include a variety of actions that have varying
                        levels of effectiveness. The secure erase command is not defined in
                        the SCSI standard, so it does not apply to media with a SCSI
                        interface.

Shred                   A method of sanitizing media; the act of cutting or tearing into small
                        particles.

SSD                     A Solid State Drive (SSD) is a storage device that uses solid state
                        memory to store persistent data.

Storage                 Retrievable retention of data. Electronic, electrostatic, or electrical
                        hardware or other elements (media) into which data may be entered,
                        and from which data may be retrieved.

Target Data             The information subject to a given process, typically including most
                        or all information on a piece of storage media.

Validate                The step in the media sanitization process flowchart which involves
                        testing the media to ensure the information cannot be read.

Verification            The process of testing the media to ensure the information cannot be
                        read.

WORM                    Write-Once Read Many.

Appendix C—Tools and Resources

Many different government, U.S. military, and academic institutions have conducted extensive
research in sanitization tools, techniques, and procedures in order to verify them to a certain level
of assurance. NIST does not conduct an evaluation of any tool set to verify its ability to Clear,
Purge, or Destroy information contained on any specific medium.

Organizations are encouraged to seek products that they can evaluate on their own. They can use
a trusted service or other federal organizations’ evaluation of tools and products, and they should
continually monitor and verify the effectiveness of their selected sanitization tools as they are
used.

If an organization has a product that they trust and have tested, then they are strongly encouraged
to share this information through public forums, such as the Federal Computer Security
Managers’ Forum 22.

C.1        NSA Media Destruction Guidance

This guide also recommends that the user consider the National Security Agency (NSA) devices
posted in the Media Destruction Guidance area of the public NSA website 23. NSA states that
“the products on these lists meet specific NSA performance requirements for sanitizing,
destroying, or disposing of media containing sensitive or classified information. Inclusion on a
list does not constitute an endorsement by NSA or the U.S. Government.” The evaluated
products lists provided on NSA’s website cover:

          Crosscut paper shredders,

          Optical media,

          Degaussers,

          Storage devices, and

          Disintegrators.

C.2        Open Source Tools

There are a variety of open source tools available that support leveraging the sanitize commands
based on standardized interfaces. As with any sanitization tool, independent validation should be
performed to ensure the desired functionality is provided. However, the availability of open
source tools helps organizations understand how the commands work and allows testing of
sanitize commands on a drive, as well as supporting the ability of home users to apply
sanitization to their personal media.

For example, one open source project is hdparm, which is available on SourceForge 24.

C.3        EPA Information on Electronic Recycling (e-Cycling)

Organizations and individuals wishing to donate used electronic equipment or seeking guidance
on disposal of residual materials after sanitization should consult the Environmental Protection
Agency’s (EPA) electronic recycling and electronic waste information website at
http://www.epa.gov/e-Cycling/. This site offers advice, regulations, and standard publications
related to sanitization, disposal, and donations. It also provides external links to other
sanitization tool resources.

C.4        Outsourcing Media Sanitization and Destruction

Organizations can outsource media sanitization and Destruction if business and security
management decide that this would be the most reasonable option for them to maintain
confidentiality while optimizing available resources. When exercising this option, this guide
recommends that organizations exercise “due diligence” when entering into a contract with
another party engaged in media sanitization. Due diligence for this case is accepted as outlined
in 16 CFR 682 which states “due diligence could include reviewing an independent audit of the
disposal company’s operations and/or its compliance with this rule [guide], obtaining
information about the disposal company from several references or other reliable sources,
requiring that the disposal company be certified by a recognized trade association or similar third
party, reviewing and evaluating the disposal company’s information security policies or
procedures, or taking other appropriate measures to determine the competency and integrity of
the potential disposal company.’ 25

Appendix D—Cryptographic Erase Device Guidelines

The determination of whether to use Cryptographic Erase on a given device depends on an
organization’s sanitization requirements. It also depends on the end user’s ability to determine
whether the implementation offers sufficient assurance against future recovery of the data. The
level of assurance depends in large part on the factors described in Table D-1.

                                   strength of the CE operation.



Before relying on Cryptographic Erase for media sanitization, users should identify the
mechanisms implemented by the storage device to address these areas:

   1. Make/Model/Version/Media Type: The product and versions the statement applies to,
      and the type of media the device uses (ie. magnetic, SSD, hybrid, other).

        Many devices store the Target Data in several different media - e.g. a DRAM (Dynamic
        Random Access Memory) cache in addition to rotating platters. It is important to identify
        the storage locations and how each is sanitized.

    A list of validated Deterministic Random Bit Generators (DRBGs) is available at:
 http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cavp/documents/drbg/drbgval.html.

 27
    Conformance testing for FIPS 140-2 is conducted within the framework of the Cryptographic Module Validation Program
 (CMVP), http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp/, and the Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP),
 http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cavp/.


                                                             49
NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1                                                        Guidelines for Media Sanitization


      2. Key Generation: Identify whether a Deterministic Random Bit Generator (DRBG), such
         as one of those listed in SP 800-90, 28 was used, and whether it was validated.

      3. Media Encryption: Identify the algorithm, key strength, mode of operation, and any
         applicable validation(s).

      4. Key Level and Wrapping: Identify if the MEK (either wrapped with another value or
         not wrapped) is directly sanitized, or if a key that wraps the MEK (a key encryption key,
         or KEK) is sanitized. A description of the wrapping techniques only applies where a
         KEK (and not the MEK) is sanitized. Wrapping details, when provided, should include
         the algorithm used, strength, and (if applicable) mode of operation.

      5. Data Areas Addressed: Describe which areas are encrypted and which areas are not
         encrypted. For any unencrypted areas, describe how sanitization is performed.

      6. Key Life Cycle Management: The key(s) on a device may have multiple wrapping
         activities (wrapping, unwrapping, and rewrapping) throughout the device’s lifecycle.
         Identify how the key(s) being sanitized are handled during wrapping activities that are
         not directly part of the Cryptographic Erase operation. For example, a user may have
         received an SED that was always encrypting, and simply turned on the authentication
         interface. Identify how the previous instance of the MEK was sanitized when it was
         wrapped with the user’s authentication credentials.

      7. Key Sanitization Technique: Describe the media-dependent sanitization method for the
         key being sanitized. Some examples might include one or more inverted overwrite passes
         if the media is magnetic, a block erase for an SSD, or other media-specific techniques for
         other types of media.

      8. Key Escrow or Backup: Identify whether the device supports key escrow or backup.
         Identify whether the device supports discovery of whether any key(s) at or below the
         level of the key escrowed has/have ever been escrowed from or injected into the device.If
         the MEK is directly sanitized and only a KEK can be escrowed, clearly identify that fact.

      9. Error Condition Handling: Identify how the device handles error conditions that
         prevent the Cryptographic Erase operation from fully completing. For example, if the
         location where the key was stored cannot be sanitized, does the Cryptographic Erase
         operation report success or failure to the user?

      10. Interface Clarity: Identify which interface commands support the features described in
          the statement. If the device supports the use of multiple MEKs, identify whether all
          MEKs are changed using the interface commands available and any additional commands
          or actions necessary to ensure all MEKs are changed. Note that under certain conditions,
          not all MEKs have to be cleared (e.g., partial sanitization of target data).

D.1      Example Statement of Cryptographic Erase Features

The following statements should be placed by the storage device vendor in an area accessible to
potential users of a device, such as on the vendor’s website or in product literature that is widely
available. Information of a proprietary nature may not be available in published product
information.

      1. Make/Model/Version/Media Type: Acme hard drive model abc12345 version 1+.
         Media type is Legacy Magnetic media.

      2. Key Generation: A DRBG is used as specified in SP 800-90, with validation [number].

      3. Media Encryption: Media is encrypted with AES-256 media encryption in Cipher Block
         Chaining (CBC) mode as described in SP 800-38A. This device is FIPS 140 validated
         with certificate [number].

      4. Key Level and Wrapping: The media encryption key is sanitized directly during
         Cryptographic Erase.

      5. Data Areas Addressed: The device encrypts all data stored in the LBA-addressable
         space except for a preboot authentication and variable area and the device logs. Device
         log data is retained by the device following Cryptographic Erase.

      6. Key Lifecycle Management: As the MEK moves between wrapped, unwrapped, and re-
         wrapped states, the previous instance is sanitized using three inverted overwrite passes.

      7. Key Sanitization Technique: Three passes with a pattern that is inverted between
         passes.

      8. Key Escrow or Injection: The device does not support escrow or injection of the keys at
         or below the level of the sanitization operation.

      9. Error Condition Handling: If the storage device encounters a defect in a location where
         a key is stored, the device attempts to rewrite the location and the Cryptographic Erase
         operations continues, reporting success to the user if the operation is otherwise
         successful.

      10. Interface Clarity: The device has an ATA interface and supports the ATA Sanitize
          Device feature set CRYPTO SCRAMBLE EXT command and a TCG Opal interface
          with the ability to sanitize the device by cryptographically erasing the contents. Both of
          these commands apply the functionality described in this statement.

NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1                                               Guidelines for Media Sanitization


Appendix E—Device-Specific Characteristics of Interest

Storage vendors implement a range of devices and media types that leverage the same
standardized command sets. Some examples of command sets include ATA, SCSI, and NVM
Express. There are likely to be differences in implementation between, for example, the
enhanced Security Erase command for ATA devices from different vendors. Some vendors may
have implementations ‘under the hood’ that apply techniques such as Cryptographic Erase, block
erase (for flash memory devices), or other techniques. It may be difficult or impossible for users
to know for sure how the sanitization action is being implemented.

In order to support informed decision making by users, vendors may choose to provide
information about how a specific device implements any dedicated sanitize commands supported
by the device. When reported by vendors, this information also helps purchasing authorities
make informed decisions about which storage devices to acquire based on the availability of
suitable sanitization functions and approaches. This vendor-reported information should address
the following:

      The media type (i.e., Legacy Magnetic, HAMR, magnetic shingle, SLC/MLC/TLC Flash
       Memory, Hybrid, etc.)

           o If the device contains magnetic media, the coercivity of the magnetic media (to
             support an informed decision about whether to attempt to degauss the media)

      Which sanitize commands are supported (if any)

      For each sanitize command supported:

           o A list of any areas not addressed by the sanitization command

           o The estimated time necessary for the command to successfully complete

           o The results of any validation testing, if applicable

Appendix G—Sample “Certificate of Sanitization” Form

This certificate is simply an example to demonstrate the types of information that should be
collected and how a certificate might be formatted. An organization could alternatively choose
to electronically record sanitization details, either through a native application or by using a
form such as this one with an automated data transfer utility (such as a PDF form with a button
to send the data to a database or email address). In the event that the records need to be
referenced in the future, electronic records will likely provide the fastest search capabilities and
best likelihood that the records are reliably retained.
