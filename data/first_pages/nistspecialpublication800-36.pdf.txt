                                      Executive Summary

The selection of IT security products is an integral part of the design, development and
maintenance of an IT security infrastructure that ensures confidentiality, integrity, and availability
of mission critical information. This guide, NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-36, Guide to
Selecting Information Technology (IT) Security Products, first defines broad security product
categories and specifies product types within those categories. It then provides a list of
characteristics and pertinent questions an organization should ask when selecting a product from
within these categories.

The selection of IT security products, and the implementation of the security program within
which these products are used, follows the risk management process of identifying the most
effective mix of management, operational, and technical controls. The specific blend of security
controls an organization employs is tied to the mission of the organization and the role of the
system within the organization as it supports that mission. Risk management is the process used
to identify an effective mixture of controls. Once the necessary controls are identified, IT
security products can then be identified to provide for these controls using the considerations and
questions discussed in this document.

The guide seeks to assist in choosing IT security products that meet an organization’s
requirements. It should be used with other NIST publications to develop a comprehensive
approach to managing, satisfying, and verifying an organization’s IT security and information
assurance requirements. Related publications include the following:

 NIST SP 800-30, Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems
 NIST SP 800-27, Engineering Principles for Information Technology Security: A Baseline
  for Achieving Security
 NIST SP 800-23, Guidelines to Federal Organizations on Security Assurance and
  Acquisition/Use of Test/Evaluated Products
 NIST SP 800-53, Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems
 NIST SP 800-64, Security Considerations in the Information System Development Life
  Cycle.
Depending on the product category, other NIST SPs may be relevant:

 NIST SP 800-41, An Introduction to Firewalls and Firewall Policy
 NIST SP 800-32, Introduction to Public Key Technology and the Federal PKI Infrastructure
 NIST SP 800-31, Intrusion Detection Systems
 NIST SP 800-33, Underlying Technical Models for Information Technology Security.
The following IT security product categories are covered in this document, with a discussion of
the types of products, product characteristics, and environment considerations for each category:

                                                                     NIST SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-36



 Identification and Authentication
 Access Control
 Intrusion Detection
 Firewall
 Public Key Infrastructure
 Malicious Code Protection
 Vulnerability Scanners
 Forensics
 Media Sanitizing.

In addition to a specific discussion of these product categories, the document recommends the
following general considerations when selecting IT security products:
 Organizational considerations should include identifying the user community; the
  relationship between the security product and organization’s mission; the sensitivity of the
  data; the organization’s security requirements, policies, and procedures; and operational
  issues such as daily operation, maintenance, and training.
 Product considerations should include total life-cycle costs (including acquisition and
  support), ease-of-use, scalability, and interoperability requirements; test requirements; known
  vulnerabilities; implementation requirements for relevant patches; requirements and methods
  for reviewing product specifications against existing and planned organizational programs,
  policies, procedures, and standards; security critical dependencies with other products; and
  interactions with the existing infrastructure.
 Vendor considerations should include whether the selection of a particular product will limit
  future security choices; vendor experience with the product; and vendor history in responding
  to security flaws in its products.

1.            Introduction

1.1       Authority
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed this document in
furtherance of its statutory responsibilities under the Federal Information Security Management
Act (FISMA) of 2002, Public Law 107-347.

NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements,
for providing adequate information security for all agency operations and assets, but such
standards and guidelines shall not apply to national security systems. This guideline is consistent
with the requirements of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Section
8b(3), Securing Agency Information Systems, as analyzed in A-130, Appendix IV: Analysis of
Key Sections. Supplemental information is provided A-130, Appendix III.

This guideline has been prepared for use by federal agencies. It may be used by nongovernmental
organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright though attribution is desired.

Nothing in this document should be taken to contradict standards and guidelines made mandatory
and binding on federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory authority. Nor
should these guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the
Secretary of Commerce, Director of the OMB, or any other federal official.

1.2       Purpose and Limitations

A secure information infrastructure ensures confidentiality, integrity, and availability of mission
critical information. Information technology (IT) security products are an integral component in
the design, development, and maintenance of this secure infrastructure. It is important that IT
security products operate as they were intended to provide a foundation for this secure
infrastructure.

Objective grounds for confidence that security products work as intended are the basis for the
concept of security assurance. Varying degrees of product assurance are supported through
methods such as conformance testing, security evaluation, and trusted development
methodologies. Assurance is not, however, a guarantee that the products work as intended in an
operational (i.e. installed) environment. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
Special Publication 800-23, Guidelines to Federal Organizations on Security Assurance and
Acquisition/Use of Tested/Evaluated Products, provides guidance to organizations that process
sensitive information for the acquisition and use of security-related IT products.

This guide builds upon Special Publication 800-23 by describing the characteristics of several
categories of IT security products. It also provides a set of questions that should be considered
when procuring these products. This guide does not provide an exhaustive list of all IT security
product categories as the commercial marketplace for IT security products is constantly changing.
However, the questions provided in this guide can easily be modified for an organization’s
particular needs as the requirements and product environments evolve.

This guide should also be used in conjunction with Special Publication 800-30, Risk Management
Guide for Information Technology Systems, in developing a comprehensive set of security
controls necessary for an organization to protect and secure its infrastructure.

Many IT security products are readily available for purchase in the commercial market. This
guide will assist the reader in choosing IT security products that meet their organization’s
requirements.

This guide seeks to help organizations make informed decisions when selecting IT security
products. The categories of products listed here include operational controls such as intrusion
detection and technical controls such as firewalls. This guide should be used with other NIST
publications to develop a comprehensive approach to the management of an organization’s IT
security and requirements. The guide first defines broad security product categories and then
specifies product types within those categories. This guide explains and provides a list of
characteristics and pertinent questions an organization should ask during the selection process.

1.3       Scope

This guide covers the selection of IT security products to be used as operational or technical
security controls. It should be used after a risk assessment has been performed and the need for
security controls established. This guide does not discuss how an organization should develop its
overall IT security program or the optimal set of products that should be implemented. This
guide covers many IT security product categories, but it is not exhaustive in its coverage. For
instance, the issue of obsolescence is not addressed. Issues concerning one IT security product
category may also be applicable to other product categories not described in this document.
While covering broad IT security product categories, this guide does not attempt to be exhaustive
in either coverage or depth of the many and varied products in the market place.

For information on the overall system security requirements analysis process and methods for
incorporating security into IT procurements, see NIST Special Publication 800-64, Security
Considerations in the Information System Development Life Cycle. For information on
performing a risk assessment, see NIST Special Publication 800-30. For information on IT
security engineering principles and concepts for an IT system, see NIST Special Publication 800-
27, Engineering Principles for Information Technology Security: A Baseline for Achieving
Security and NIST SP 800-33, Underlying Technical Models for Information Technology
Security. For information regarding the acquisition of IT security services, see NIST SP800-35,
Guide to IT Security Services. Finally, various security controls are described in NIST SP 800-
53, Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems.

1.4       Audience

This guide is written to help an organization during the various stages of the IT security product
life cycle. It can be used as a tool by—
 IT Security Officers in gathering the necessary information for the IT risk assessment and
  building the business case for the procurement of IT security products
 Chief Information Officers (CIO) and Chief Technology Officers (CTO) in
  establishing product procurement policy and ensuring that security has been appropriately
  considered in the selection process
 IT directors, program managers, and system owners in understanding the types of available
  security products, what they should consider when making a selection decision, and what
  factors they should use for evaluating a security product.

2.        Roles and Responsibilities

Product selection involves numerous people throughout an organization. Each person involved in
the process, whether on an individual or group level, should understand the importance of
security in the organization’s information infrastructure. Each organization may involve several
subordinate organizations during the IT product selection process. The following roles are listed
as a guide. Depending on the organization’s needs, a person may be assigned one of the roles
listed below or a combination of roles relevant to IT security needs. In some small organizations,
a single individual may hold multiple roles.
2.1       IT Security Program Manager

The IT Security Program Manager is responsible for developing enterprise standards for IT
security. This individual plays a leading role in introducing an appropriate, structured
methodology to help identify, evaluate, and minimize IT security risks to the organization. IT
security program managers coordinate and perform system risk analyses, analyze risk mitigation
alternatives, and build the business case for the acquisition of appropriate security solutions that
help ensure mission accomplishment in the face of real-world threats. They also support senior
management in ensuring that security management activities are conducted as required to meet
the organization’s needs.

2.2       Chief Information Officer

The CIO is responsible for the organization’s IT planning, budgeting, investment, performance
and acquisition. As such, the CIO provides advice and assistance to senior organization personnel
in acquiring the most efficient and effective security product to fit the IT security architecture.

2.3       IT Investment Board (or equivalent)

The IT investment board (or its equivalent) is responsible for managing the capital planning and
investment control process defined by the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 (section 5). This board can
set the investment criteria for security product selection in a qualitative and quantitative
environment. The board can review benefits and risks for procuring a particular product and can
be involved in examining alternative approaches.

2.4       Program Manager (owner of data) / Acquisition Initiator

The program manager represents programmatic interests during the security product acquisition
process. Program managers play an essential role in security product selection because of their
involvement in strategic planning initiatives and are intimately aware of functional system
requirements.

2.5       Acquisition Team

The acquisition team is normally composed of representatives from program, technical, and
contracting areas of the organization. It provides a balanced perspective of cost and schedule
considerations. Further, the team ensures that security performance and investment objectives
have been created and met successfully. Long- and short-term security needs must be considered
during the security product selection. Information technology and information resource
management personnel provide technical expertise to program management and contracting

officers involved in security product selection. They ensure that performance and engineering
measures are met.

2.6         Contracting Officer1

The contracting officer is the person with the authority to enter into, administer, and/or terminate
contracts and make related determinations and findings.

2.7         Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative

The Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) is a qualified Government employee
appointed by the Contracting Officer to act as their technical representative in managing the
technical aspects of a particular contract.

2.8         IT System Security Officer

The IT System Security Officer is responsible for ensuring the security of an information system
throughout its life cycle.

2.9         Other Participants

The list of roles in an IT acquisition can grow with the complexity involved in acquiring and
managing IT systems. It is vital that all members of the acquisition team work together to ensure
that a successful acquisition is achieved. Since the system certifier and accreditor must make
critical decisions throughout the acquisition process, they could be included early in the
acquisition process. System users may assist in the acquisition by helping the program manager to
determine the need, refine the requirements, and inspect and accept the delivered system.
Participants may also include personnel who represent information technology, configuration
management, design/engineering, and facilities groups.

3.        Selecting Proper Security Controls

A security program, whether at the organization or system level, should include an appropriate
mixture of security controls: management, operational, and technical as described in NIST
Special Publication 800-12, An Introduction to Computer Security: The NIST Handbook. A
minimum set of system level controls may be found in the (draft) NIST Special Publication 800-
53, Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems. Management controls are
techniques that are normally addressed by management in the organization’s IT security program
— focusing on managing the IT security program and risk. Operational controls are those
controls that are operated by people, as opposed to a technology or to systems. Operational
controls often rely on technical expertise, management controls, and technical controls. Technical
controls emphasize the security controls that the computer system executes. These controls
should be consistent with the operational context and management controls.

Reliance on technical controls alone will be insufficient without complementary management and
operational controls. For example, an organization can install a robust firewall; however, if it
allows unrestricted dialup access directly to the network, the organization will have significant
vulnerabilities.

The number and type of appropriate security controls and their corresponding IT security
products may vary throughout a particular system’s development and procurement life cycles.
The relative maturity of an organization’s security architecture may influence the types of
appropriate security controls. The blend of security controls is tied to the mission of the
organization and the role of the system within the organization as it supports that mission.

Risk management is the process used to identify an effective mix of management, operational,
and technical security controls to mitigate risk to a level acceptable to the responsible senior
official. Although it may be tempting to simply pick a product off the shelf, using a risk
management process to choose the most effective blend of controls enhances an organization’s
security posture. A risk management process, as described in NIST Special Publication 800-30,
comprises three main phases: risk assessment, risk mitigation, and evaluation and assessment.

In the risk assessment phase, an organization analyzes identified threats and vulnerabilities in
terms of likelihood of occurrence and expected loss, and determines the impact on its ability to
fulfill its mission and/or business objectives. The outcome of this action will be a statement of the
anticipated type and amount of damage that a threat could cause if a vulnerability were to be
exploited successfully. This ensures that security requirements are prioritized and specific to the
architecture.

In the risk mitigation phase, the organization identifies the types of controls that could be
employed to reduce the level of risk to an acceptable level, as determined in the risk assessment.
As mentioned above, these solutions may include management, operational, and/or technical
controls. These controls may require the use of an IT security product. For instance, firewall and
intrusion detection products are necessary elements of technical controls employed to limit the
threats that can impact an organization’s IT infrastructure. Once an organization has decided to
implement a security technology, it should evaluate existing products in the context of its own
security architecture to determine the best option.

Once the necessary controls are identified, specific IT security products can then be identified to
provide for these controls. In addition, it is important to perform a cost-benefit analysis when
selecting security products.2 As part of the cost-benefit analysis, a life-cycle cost (LCC) estimate
for the status quo and each alternative identified should be developed. In addition to LCC
estimates, benefits associated with each alternative should be identified and, to the extent
practicable, quantified in terms of dollar savings or cost avoidance.

Once all options are weighed in the cost-benefit analysis, the security product selection is made,
and implementation of the product can follow.




        2
            As with all aspects of risk management, analysis is performed at a level of rigor appropriate for the specific
             situation. For example, where the cost of a product is relatively low or the benefit is somewhat obvious a
             less rigorous analysis is likely to be appropriate. A typical example of such a situation is the use of an anti-
             virus product.

4.          General Considerations

In addition to the topics discussed in the previous chapters, some other important factors should
be considered by organizations when acquiring security products. Independent, third-party
testing and evaluation of IT products gives consumers greater confidence that the security
features in those products work as advertised by the vendor. Testing and evaluation also provides
a way to demonstrate product compliance with organization security requirements and security
standards. NIST Special Publication 800-23 provides guidance on security assurance and the use
of tested/evaluated products, and should be consulted by organizations selecting security products
for their IT systems and networks.

Two prominent security testing and evaluation programs are now in place to assess the security
features and assurances of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) products: (1) Common Criteria
evaluation by the National Information Assurance Partnership1 (NIAP) Common Criteria (CC)
Evaluation and Validation Scheme (CCEVS) or a foreign evaluation scheme with the results
recognized by CCEVS under the Arrangement on the Mutual Recognition of Common Criteria
Certificates in the Field of IT Security (CCRA) and (2) NIST Cryptographic Module Validation
Program2 (CMVP). The NIAP CCEVS employs a network of private sector, accredited testing
laboratories to independently evaluate commercial security products in a variety of key
technology areas against a set of security requirements and specifications from the international
standard, International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical
Commission (ISO/IEC) 15408, Common Criteria for IT Security Evaluation. The CMVP, also
using independent, accredited, private-sector laboratories, focuses on security testing of
cryptographic modules for conformance to Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-
2, Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules, and related federal cryptographic algorithm
standards. In both programs, a government body validates the results of the testing and
evaluation processes to ensure that the security standards are being applied correctly and
consistently.

In addition to gaining confidence from acquiring security products tested and evaluated under the
NIAP CCEVS, a recognized foreign CC scheme, and NIST CMVP, consumers also benefit in
another way. The evidence produced during the product testing and evaluation process (available
in different forms depending on the program) can be used by systems integrators to build more
secure systems and networks. System certifiers can also use this evidence to more effectively
assess the security of an IT system in its operational environment in support of system
accreditation.

As stated in NIST Special Publication 800-23, particular attention should be given to products
that provide the needed security capabilities and that have been evaluated under either the
CCEVS or CMVP program. The following sets of questions are product-independent and should
be considered when forming a decision and selecting any product. These questions are organized
into three categories: those that apply to the organization, those that apply to the product or its
operation, and those that apply to the vendor. It should be noted, however, that these questions
are neither exhaustive nor relevant in all circumstances. Depending on a person’s role or
perspective on the security product, a question may be more appropriately organized under
another category. Organizations should use these questions as a guide and edit them as necessary
for their unique circumstances. Furthermore, additional questions and considerations are needed

to guide decisions that are consistent with the organization’s architecture and a well-established
business case.

Organizational Questions

These questions are applicable to all information systems (for example, identification of all
components, impact on system of emerging technologies, and use of appropriate contract
language).
 Is the product necessary to adequately mitigate risk?
 Is the anticipated user community identified? How many and what type of users does the
  organization anticipate will use the security product?
 Is the relationship between this security product and the organization’s mission performance
  understood and documented?
 Has the organization determined the sensitivity of the data to be protected?
 Are the organization security requirements supported by the security plan, policies and
  procedures?
 Have security requirements been identified and compared against product specifications?
 When selecting products, organizations need to consider the threat environment and the
  security functions needed to cost-effectively mitigate the risks to an acceptable level.
  Organizations should give consideration to acquisition and deployment of IT security
  products that have been evaluated and tested by independent accredited laboratories against
  appropriate security specifications and requirements. Examples of these specifications include
  protection profiles based on ISO/IEC 15408, the Common Criteria for IT Security
  Evaluation. However, agencies should consider their overall requirements and select
  products accordingly. In the case of cryptographic modules, when agencies have determined
  the need to protect information via cryptographic means, they may only select CMVP
  validated cryptographic modules. See http://csrc.nist.gov/cryptval/ for a validation list for
  cryptographic standards.
 Is communication required across a domain boundary (implies the need for a boundary
  controller; e.g., sub-system of firewall, intrusion detection system, and/or routers)?
 Is the security product consistent with physical security and other policy requirements?
 Has the impact on the enterprise operational environment where this product will operate
  been considered?
 Have security reviews included requirements for support, plug-in components, or
  middleware?

Product Considerations

These questions are applicable to all information systems (for example, total life-cycle cost and
acceptance testing).
 If the product has been evaluated under a CC scheme, validation test reports can be examined
  to avoid duplication of tests already performed as part of the independent evaluation process.



                                                                                                     9
                                                                                      NIST SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-36



 Have known product vulnerabilities been addressed by reviewing the relevant vulnerabilities
  of a product? Known vulnerabilities for many products can be found using the NIST ICAT
  Vulnerability Search Engine (http://icat.nist.gov).3
 Have all relevant patches been tested and implemented?
 Have relevant existing CC protection profiles (PP) been reviewed (for example,
  http://niap.nist.gov/cc-scheme/PPRegistry.html and
  http://www.commoncriteria.org/protection_profiles/pp.html), to identify PPs that express
  security requirements applicable to the organization’s needs in the anticipated threat
  environment? If existing protection profiles are not adequate, organizations should consider
  the usefulness of similar protection profiles as a starting point for examining products that
  might satisfy requirements applicable to the new environment.
 Have the lists of validated products (for example, http://niap.nist.gov/cc-
  scheme/ValidatedProducts.html) been reviewed? Products independently tested and
  validated under NIAP-CCEVS (or mutually recognized) provide some level of security
  assurance that the security functions of the product work as specified. In general, third party
  testing and evaluation can provide a significantly greater basis for customer confidence than
  is available from unevaluated products. Note, however, that purchasing an evaluated product
  simply because it is evaluated and without due consideration of applicable functional and
  assurance requirements and vendor reliability, may be neither useful nor cost effective.
  Organizations should consider their overall requirements and select the best products
  accordingly.
 Has the list of CMVP validated products been reviewed? Validated products are mandatory
  and binding on federal agencies where they have determined information must be protected
  via cryptographic means. This applies to all IT products irrespective of whether the product
  is a security product or whether the cryptographic module is embedded within another
  product (e.g. a database).
 Has the vendor's policy or stance on re-validation of products when new releases of the
  product are issued been considered?
 Have product specifications been reviewed with respect to existing and planned
  organizational programs, policies, procedures, and standards? Examples include an
  organization’s:

   –   Web policy

   –   Public key infrastructure (PKI) program and policy

   –   Smart card program

   –   Network interconnection and approval policy.
 Does the product have any security critical dependencies on other products? For example, an
  operating system (OS) or cryptographic module?

           ICAT is a search engine for an industry standard set of known vulnerabilities (http://cve.mitre.org)

 Does interfacing the new product with the existing infrastructure introduce new
  vulnerabilities or interdependencies?
 What is the frequency of product failures and adequacy of corrective actions?

Vendor Considerations

These questions are applicable to all information system vendors (for example, long-term
viability).
 Will the selection of a particular product limit the future choices of other IT security
  modifications and improvements? (Note: The change and pace of technology may make it
  difficult to estimate the impact to an organization’s future security architecture.)
 Does the vendor have experience in producing high quality IT security products?
 What is the vendor’s “track-record” in responding to security flaws in its products?
 How does the vendor handle software and hardware maintenance, end user support, and
  maintenance agreements?
 Does the vendor have an associated security or configuration guide for the product? Does the
  vendor use or make reference to NIST, consortia, or other consensus-based checklists,
  security configurations/settings or benchmarks.

5.        IT Security Products

The following categories of security products represent common technological elements helpful
in securing IT systems and supporting infrastructure. This list is not all-inclusive and will change
over time. New products are introduced, and obsolete products are removed from the market
constantly.

Each security product category discussion consists of four sections. The first is a general
discussion of the security capability that this product category provides. The second describes the
types of products that are available. Next, general product characteristics are provided. Finally,
environmental questions are listed to help further refine the product requirements and assist in
product selection.

Specific product vendors or products are not listed. These guidelines are vendor independent and
not a review of specific products.

5.1       Identification and Authentication

NIST Special Publication 800-12 defines identification as the means by which a user provides a
claimed identity to the system. Authentication is the means of establishing the validity of this
claim. Authorization is the process of defining and maintaining the allowed actions. Identification
and authentication establishes the basis for accountability and the combination of all three enables
the enforcement of identity-based access control.

The user’s identity can be authenticated using the following mechanisms:
 Requiring the user to provide something they have (e.g., token)
 Requiring the user to provide something they alone know (e.g., password)
 Sampling a personal characteristic (e.g., fingerprint).
The principal forms of authentication include static, dynamic, and multiple factor.
Static. Static authentication reuses a specific authenticator (e.g., static password). This type of
authentication only provides protection against attacks in which an imposter cannot obtain the
authenticator. The strength of the authentication process is highly dependent on the difficulty of
guessing or decrypting the authenticator values and therefore how well they are protected in
transit and while stored on the system.

Dynamic. Dynamic authentication uses cryptography or other techniques to create one per-
session authenticator. A dynamic authenticator changes with each authentication session between
the claimant and verifier.

Multiple Factor. Multiple-factor authentication requires two or more types of authentication
techniques. Multiple factor authentication can include both static and dynamic authentication
mechanisms. One example is the use of a password along with a smart card token.

Authorization mechanisms fall into four major categories:




                                                 12
                                                                       NIST SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-36



Local: Local authorization is performed for each application and machine to which a user
requires access. The mechanisms of the local operating system and applications are employed to
setup and maintain the authorizations for that machine or application.

Network: Authorization is performed at a central, authorization server, providing access to a
user’s account from one or more workstations on the network. The key here is that the access is
to a single user account. If the user requires multiple accounts, then each is a separate
authorization and handled in like manner to multiple users.

Single Sign-on: Single sign-on employs a central authorization server to enable a user to
authenticate one time in order to achieve access to multiple applications, machines, and domains
operating with a variety of authentication mechanisms (for example, a Kerberos implementation
within a heterogeneous Windows 2000 and Unix network). The central server contains
identifier/authenticator pairs for each domain that the user needs to access and performs an
authentication on behalf of the user for each resource that the user is authorized to access. The
central server establishes and maintains, as individual actions, the authorizations at each
application, machine, or domain that the user is allowed to access.

Single Log-on: Single log-on is similar to single sign-on with the exception that the central
server authentication mechanism is the mechanism used by all the applications, machine, and
domains with which the user needs to interact. Rather than store identifier/authenticator pairs for
each verification, the one-time verification is accepted by all resources as the only verification
needed. Additionally, the authorizations are maintained at the central server and the individual
applications, machines, and domains query the central location to determine whether a specific
access is authorized. Single log-on eliminates the need for authorization at each resource and for
individual authentications to each resource.

5.1.1      Types of Products

Some examples of authentication products are provided below. These categories of authentication
products are not mutually exclusive (e.g., some products may include one or more of the
categories).
Security Tokens. Security tokens are used to allow access first to a computer and then to a
network. Tokens come in various forms - for example, Personal Computer Memory Card
International Association (PCMCIA) cards, flash memory, USB tokens, smart cards, and
software.

    •   PCMCIA Security Tokens. These tokens offer a full suite of security services in
        portable format on a small card. PCMCIA cards can protect secret values adequately in
        most cases while still leaving room for additional physical tamper protection
        mechanisms. Disadvantages include a requirement for a PCMCIA card reader. Although
        common on laptop computers, PCMCIA card readers are not common in desktop
        computers. This imposes a significant added cost factor. The added expense of
        purchasing a card reader for every desktop workstation may be cost prohibitive especially
        in organizations with large numbers of desktop computers.

    •   Smart Card Tokens. Smart cards are replacing PCMCIA cards in many security token
        applications. Smart cards are credit-card size plastic cards with an embedded computer
        chip. The chip can be either a microprocessor with internal memory or a memory chip




                                                                                                   13
                                                                          NIST SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-36



        with nonprogrammable logic. The chip connection is made by either direct physical
        contact or remotely via a contactless electromagnetic interface.

Certificates. The public key certificate associates a certificate holder’s identity with his public
key. (See Section 5.5, Public Key Infrastructure, for further details)
Authentication Protocols. These protocols are used to determine who is accessing a resource.
Examples include the following:
 RADIUS. Using the Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) protocol, a
  remote client can exchange authentication, access control, accounting, and device
  configuration information with a RADIUS server. The RADIUS server can authenticate a
  user or a device from its database or user I&A parameters.
 TACACS+. Terminal Access Controller Access Control System + (TACACS+) protocol
  enables a network resource to offload the user administration to a central server.

Biometrics. Biometrics are used for physical access control, electronic access control, and
monitoring devices. An organization’s choice of biometric control depends on the security level
required, user acceptance, enrollment speed, and costs incurred.

Biometrics technology is used to identify and authenticate an individual based on personal
characteristics. Examples of personal characteristics include fingerprints, face, retina, iris, speech,
handwriting, hand geometry, and wrist veins.

Biometrics can also be combined with passwords, personal identification numbers (PIN), and
cards to further increase accuracy and security.

5.1.2       Identification and Authentication Product Characteristics
Desired characteristics of effective identification and authentication products (including systems
developed around key identification and authentication mechanisms) are:

 Capable of requiring users to identify themselves uniquely before being allowed to perform
  any actions on the system unless user anonymity or other factors dictate otherwise.
 Capable of internally maintaining the identity of all active users and as necessary be able to
  link defined security-relevant actions to specific users.
 Capable of supporting organization password policies, including length, complexity, and
  lifetime.
 Have advanced capabilities, such as antispoofing and allowing the use of tokens such as
  smart cards.
 Provide for efficient identification (ID) of users and password or token management.
 Have a secure I&A management capability that stores and transmits I&A data in encrypted
  form.
 Have an ability to log defined security events and sends alerts messages to the appropriate
  security administrators.

5.1.3       Environment Questions

Smart Card Specific 4

Organizational Considerations
 How many individuals in the organization will use the product?
 How will the organization issue the cards?
 Will the organization use an automated database system to enter user-specific information
  onto the cards, or will manual processes be applied? Where will the database reside?
 Who will control the cards?
 Will readers be distributed to ensure that the implementation will be effective?
 Does the organization plan to use the card as the sole means of authentication?
 Does the organization have procedures in place to quickly deactivate lost or stolen cards?
 Are the cards interoperable among other authentication products and mechanisms across the
  organization?

Product Considerations5
 What major functions will the card be expected to perform?
 What kind of data will the card be used to store?
 What are the memory requirements for the card?

Biometric Specific

Organizational Considerations
 How many individuals does the organization expect to use the product and what is the
  distribution of biometric characteristics in the enrolled population?
 What areas does the organization plan to protect with the product—physical access,
  electronic access, or as a monitoring device?
 Is the organization more concerned with false positives (incorrectly admitting an
  unauthorized person) or false negatives (incorrectly denying access to an authorized person),
  and how much error is tolerable?

Product Considerations
 How well does the product automate enrollment, verification, and identification?
        4
          These questions should be addressed by organizations that are considering deployment of storage and/or
           processor card-based technologies to support identification and authentication functions. Answers to these
           questions will help the organization to establish required technical characteristics, infrastructure
           requirements, organizational responsibilities and coordination requirements, and infrastructure and
           recurring cost parameters.

 Is the enrolled template stored locally on a card or in the reader, or is the enrolled template
  stored remotely in a central database?
 Are the communication paths between the offered template and enrolled template protected?
 Does either the enrolled template or threshold change with each successful verification?
 Does the system log accepted and failed attempts?
 Can end users enroll themselves?
 Does the application support remote enrollment?
 Does the application support remote access?
 Is the application interoperable with smart cards?
 Is the relation between Type I and Type II errors selectable and is there a ratio supported by
  the product that will meet both the security and operational requirements of the organization
  in the intended operational environment of the product?

5.2         Access Control

Access control ensures that only authorized access to resources occurs. Access control helps
protect confidentiality, integrity, and availability and supports the principles of legitimate use,
least privilege, and separation of duties. Access control simplifies the task of maintaining
enterprise network security by reducing the number of paths that attackers might use to penetrate
system or network defenses.

Access control systems6 grant access to information system resources to authorized users,
programs, processes, or other systems. Access control may be managed solely by the application,
or it may use controls on files. The system may put classes of information into files with different
access privileges. Controlling access can be based on any or a combination of the following:
 User identity
 Role memberships
 Group membership
 Other information known to the system.

By controlling who can use an application, database record, or file, an organization can help to
protect that data. It is particularly important to control who is allowed to enable or disable the
security features or to change user privileges.

Users need to ensure that secure applications sufficiently manage access to data that they
maintain. Access control includes any or all of the following: knowing who is attempting access,
mediating access according to some processing rules, and managing where or how data is sent.



        6
            Access control systems are in many cases, not standalone systems, but capabilities of a larger system, like
             an operating system. This section addresses the characteristics and questions for access control systems,
             capabilities, and functions.

Identity-based Access Control. A security policy based on comparing the identity of the subject
(user, group of users, role, process, or device) requesting access and the authorizations for this
identity associated with the object (system resource) being accessed.

Information Flow Control. Information flow policies dictate whether information with a
particular characteristic can move from one controlled entity (container or subject) to another.
Information flow control is based on some fundamental characteristic of the information (not the
container), and might not involve an identifiable subject.

5.2.1       Types of Products

Access Control Lists. Access control data can reside either in (a) the resource to be protected or
(b) a central location based on a model. An example of a data structure used for resource-centric
storage of access control information is the Access Control List (ACL). An example of a
specification of access control information centrally based on a model is the role-based access
control (RBAC) database.

ACLs in routers and other network devices can be used to implement the following forms of
access enforcement:

Traffic Filters. Access controls can be enforced effectively at the data packet layer. A filter can
block any packet that does not conform to security policy rules. Filters can be assigned to
incoming or outgoing traffic. Filtering can be based on source and destination addresses, protocol
types, and information from other fields within the packets unless the content is encrypted.

Policy Filters. Policy filters can be used to set up access control policies on routers. Policy filters,
which operate to and from routing tables, can be used to specify the routers or networks from
which updates will be accepted.

Role-Based Access Control. RBAC has emerged as a promising feature of many database
management, security management and network operating system products. The essential
advantage of RBAC products is that they allow system administrators to assign individual users
into roles. The role identifies users as members of a specific group, based on their capabilities,
work requirements, and responsibilities in the organization. Access rights, or security privileges,
are then established for each role; a user may belong to multiple roles, which provide the
appropriate level of access for their requirements. Thus, the RBAC structure empowers
administrators with a tool to regulate which users are given access to certain data or resources,
without having to explicitly authorize each user to each resource.

5.2.2       Access Control Product Characteristics
Desired characteristics of access control products are that they can:

 Support granularity of control (e.g., at the element and attribute level for XML documents)
 Allow simultaneous profile/rule assignment to a list of user accounts
 Define access privileges for each user
 Prevent unauthorized forwarding of sensitive information

 Provide for a central administration console for management and enforcement of security
  policies across distributed systems, if the product will be managed centrally
 Self-protect against outside attack

 Track any type of security related event through the log file
 Generate checksums to ensure the integrity of log files.

5.2.3     Environment Questions

Organizational Considerations
 The organization should use risk management techniques to determine (a) what system assets
  must be protected and to what level (e.g., applications, databases, “legacy” systems, devices,
  and connections) and (b) which remote user connections must be restricted. If a network is
  involved, what is its operational paradigm—that is, unicast (point-to-point network, such as
  Ethernet), multicast, or broadcast? An organization’s answer will determine the type of
  access control product.
 What is the current infrastructure? Some products require the purchase of third-party
  applications, such as Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) (for storage of
  security databases) and Java server pages. The cost and complexity of the setup may be
  higher if these third-party applications are not already present.
 Role-based access control is most effective when roles closely reflect the actual hierarchy of
  the organization for which it will be used. For example, a senior human resources
  administrator may require assignment to multiple roles, whereas a clerk might only need the
  access associated with a single role. The cost and effort to engineer the roles should also be
  considered.
 Should sensitive security data, such as user access scripts, password data, etc., be stored and
  transmitted in the clear or encrypted form?
 What is the sensitivity of the protected network versus external network(s)? Is a trusted
  OS/trusted guard suggested?
 What is the direction of flow for which access control is required? Is it inbound/outbound or
  only inbound?
 Is there a single “super administrator” or support for delegation of authority to
  “subadministrators” with limited responsibility (e.g., user subsets or resource subsets)?
 What is the impact on the training and level of effort needed to identify and define roles, the
  organizational impact of implementing roles, and the responsibility for role maintenance?
 What are the procedures for adding and deleting users and adding/removing
  applications/resources in the organization?

5.3         Intrusion Detection
Intrusion detection is the process of monitoring events occurring in a computer system or network
and analyzing them for signs of intrusions, defined as attempts to perform unauthorized actions,
or to bypass the security mechanisms of a computer or network. Intrusions are caused by any of
the following: attackers who access systems from the Internet, authorized system users who
attempt to gain additional privileges for which they are not authorized, and authorized users who
misuse the privileges given them. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) are software or hardware
products that assist in the intrusion monitoring and analysis process.

The implementation of an IDS might be valuable for the following reasons:

 Prevent problem behaviors by increasing risk of discovery and punishment for system
  intruders
 Detect attacks and other security violations that are not prevented by other security measures
 Detect preambles to attacks (network probes and other tests for existing vulnerabilities)
 Document the existing threat to the organization
 Quality control for security design and administration
 Provide useful information about methods used in intrusions.
There are two different approaches to analyzing events to detect attacks: signature-based
detection and anomaly detection. Either or both of the approaches could be used in an IDS
product.
Signature-Based Detection7. This approach identifies events or sets of events that match with a
predefined pattern of events that describe a known attack. These patterns are called signatures.
Signatures may include system states, or accessing system areas that have been explicitly
identified as “off-limits.”

Anomaly Detection. Anomaly detection assumes that all intrusive activities deviate from the
norm. These tools typically establish a normal activity profile and then maintain a current activity
profile of a system. When the two profiles vary by statistically significant amounts, an intrusion
attempt is assumed.

NIST Special Publication 800-31, Intrusion Detection Systems, provides a more complete
description and discussion of the important issues that should be considered when acquiring an
IDS.


        7
            Signature-based detection is sometimes referred to as misuse detection. Misuse detection is more explicitly
             defined as detecting insiders who abuse privileges given them.

5.3.1      Types of Products

Three common types of IDS products are network based, host based, and application based. Each
type of product may optionally offer intrusion prevention capabilities.

Network-Based IDS. These IDSs detect attacks by capturing and analyzing network packets.
Listening on a network segment or switch, one network-based IDS can monitor the network
traffic affecting multiple hosts that are connected to the network segment.

Network-based IDSs often consist of a set of single-purpose sensors or hosts placed at various
points in a network. These units monitor network traffic, performing local analysis of that traffic
and reporting attacks to a central management console. Because the sensors are limited to running
the IDS, they can be more easily secured against attack. Many of these sensors are designed to
run in “stealth” mode, making it more difficult for an attacker to determine their presence and
location.

Host-Based IDS. Host-based IDSs operate on information collected from within an individual
computer system. This vantage point allows host-based IDSs to determine exactly which
processes and user accounts are involved in a particular attack on the OS. Furthermore, unlike
network-based IDSs, host-based IDSs can more readily “see” the intended outcome of an
attempted attack, because they can directly access and monitor the data files and system processes
usually targeted by attacks.

Host-based IDSs normally use information sources of two types: operating system audit trails,
and system logs. Operating system audit trails are usually generated at the innermost (kernel)
level of the operating system; therefore these trails are more detailed and better protected than
system logs. Some host-based IDSs are designed to support a centralized IDS management and
reporting infrastructure that can allow a single management console to track many hosts. Others
generate messages in formats that are compatible with network management systems.

Application-Based IDS. Application-based IDSs are a special subset of host-based IDSs that
analyze the events transpiring within a software application. The most common information
sources used by application-based IDSs are the application’s transaction log files.

The ability to interface with the application directly, with significant domain or application-
specific knowledge included in the analysis engine, allows application-based IDSs to detect
suspicious behavior due to authorized users attempting to exceed their authorization. This is
because such problems are more likely to appear in the interaction among the user, the data, and
the application.

Intrusion Prevention. Intrusion detection systems often have intrusion prevention capabilities.
This means that not only can they detect an intrusive activity, but they can also attempt to stop the
activity, ideally before it reaches its targets. Intrusion prevention is much more valuable than
intrusion detection because intrusion detection simply observes events without making any effort
to stop them. Unfortunately, intrusion prevention can also cause operational issues because if the
detection of incidents is not accurate, then it may block legitimate activities that are incorrectly
classified as malicious. Any organization that wants to utilize intrusion prevention should pay
particular attention to detection accuracy when selecting a product.

Another consideration involving intrusion prevention is architecture-related. IDS products may be
simply monitoring activity, or they may actually be “in-line”, which means that activity must pass


                                                 22

through them. Examples include a network-based IDS that is integrated with a firewall and a
host-based IDS that is integrated into the kernel of the operating system. An in-line intrusion
detection system has the ability to block all detected attacks. If an IDS product is not in-line, its
ability to block attacks may be limited.

5.4         Firewall
Firewalls are devices or systems that control the flow of network traffic between networks or
between a host and a network. A firewall acts as a protective barrier because it is the single point
through which communications pass. Internal information that is being sent can be forced to pass
through a firewall as it leaves a network or host. Incoming data can enter only through the
firewall. This section is drawn from NIST Special Publication 800-41, Guidelines on Firewalls

and Firewall Policy. This publication provides details of firewalls and firewall product selection
that are beyond the scope of this document.

While firewalls and firewall environments are often discussed in the context of Internet
connectivity, firewalls have applicability in network environments beyond Internet connectivity.
For example, many corporate enterprise intranets employ firewalls to restrict connectivity to and
from internal networks servicing more sensitive functions, such as the accounting or personnel
department. By employing firewalls to control connectivity to these areas, an organization can
prevent unauthorized access to the respective systems and resources within the more sensitive
areas. The inclusion of an internal firewall environment can therefore provide an additional layer
of security that would not otherwise be available.

Although firewalls afford protection of certain resources within an organization, there are some
threats that firewalls cannot protect against: connections that bypass the firewall, new threats that
have not yet been identified, and viruses that have been injected into the internal network. It is
important to remember these shortcomings because considerations will have to be made in
addition to the firewall in order to counter these additional threats and provide a more
comprehensive security solution.
5.4.1           Types of Products

NIST Special Publication 800-41 describes eight kinds of firewall platforms: packet filter
firewalls, stateful inspection firewalls, application proxy gateway firewalls, dedicated proxy
firewalls, hybrid firewall technologies, network address translation, host based firewalls, and
personal firewalls/personal firewall appliances.

Packet Filter Firewalls. The most basic firewall is called a packet filter. Packet filter firewalls
are routing devices that include access control functionality for system addresses and
communication sessions. The access control functionality of a packet filter firewall is governed
by a set of directives collectively referred to as a ruleset.

Packet filter firewalls have two main strengths: speed and flexibility. Packet filter firewalls can be
used to secure nearly any type of network communication or protocol. This simplicity allows
packet filter firewalls to be deployed into nearly any enterprise network infrastructure. Note that
their speed, flexibility, and capability to block denial-of-service and related attacks make them
ideal for placement at the outermost boundary with an untrusted network.

Packet filter firewalls possess several weaknesses:
     Because packet filter firewalls do not examine upper-layer data,8 they cannot prevent attacks
      that employ application-specific vulnerabilities or functions.
     Because of the limited information available to the firewall, the logging functionality present
      in packet filter firewalls is limited. Packet filter logs normally contain the same information
      used to make access control decisions (source address, destination address, and traffic type).
     A firewall relying solely on packet filtering would not support advanced user authentication
      schemes.

                                                                                                                    25

 They are vulnerable to attacks and exploits that take advantage of flaws within the TCP/IP
  specification and protocol stack, such as network layer address spoofing.


Consequently, packet filter firewalls are very suitable for high-speed environments where logging
and user authentication with network resources are not important.
An example of a packet-filter firewall is a network router employing filter rules to screen network
traffic.

Stateful Inspection Firewalls. Stateful inspection evolved from the need to accommodate certain
features of the TCP/IP protocol suite. When an application uses a TCP (connection-oriented
transport) to create a session with a remote host system, a port is also created on the source
system. This port receives network traffic from the destination system. Packet filter firewalls must
permit inbound network traffic on all return packets from the destination system for connection-
oriented transport to occur. Opening this many ports creates an immense risk of intrusion by
unauthorized users who may employ a variety of techniques to abuse the expected conventions.
Stateful inspection firewalls solve this problem by creating a directory of outbound TCP
connections, along with each session’s corresponding client port. This “state table” is then used to
validate any inbound traffic. The stateful inspection solution is more secure because the firewall
tracks client ports individually rather than opening all inbound ports for external access.

Stateful inspection firewalls share the strengths and weaknesses of packet filter firewalls, but
because of the state table implementation, stateful inspection firewalls are generally considered to
be more secure than packet filter firewalls.

Stateful inspection firewalls can accommodate other network protocols in the same manner as
packet filters, but the actual stateful inspection technology is relevant only to TCP/IP. For this
reason, many texts classify stateful inspection firewalls as representing a superset of packet filter
firewall functionality.

Application-Proxy Gateway Firewalls. Application proxy gateway firewalls provide additional
protection by inserting the application in the communications path, looking like the end-point of
the communications to both sides of the firewall. For example, a web-proxy receives requests
for external, web access from inside the firewall and relays them to the exterior web page as
though the firewall was the requesting web client. The external web page responds to the firewall
and the firewall forwards the response to the inside client as though the firewall was the web
server. No through TCP/IP connection is ever made from inside client to external web server.

Application-proxy gateway firewalls have numerous advantages over packet filter firewalls and
stateful inspection packet filter firewalls. First, application-proxy gateway firewalls usually have
more extensive logging capabilities resulting from the firewall being able to examine the entire
network packet rather than only the network addresses and ports.

Another advantage is that application-proxy gateway firewalls allow security administrators to
enforce whatever type of user authentication is considered appropriate for a given enterprise
infrastructure. Application-proxy gateways can authenticate users directly, as opposed to packet
filter firewalls and stateful inspection packet filter firewalls, which normally authenticate users
based on the network layer address of the system on which they reside (i.e., source, destination,
and type). Given that network layer addresses can be easily spoofed, the authentication
capabilities inherent in application-proxy gateway architecture are superior to those found in
packet filter or stateful inspection packet filter firewalls.

The advanced functionality of application-proxy gateway firewalls also fosters several
disadvantages when compared with packet filter or stateful inspection packet filter firewalls.
First, because of the “full packet awareness” found in application-proxy gateways, the firewall is
forced to spend significant time reading and interpreting each packet. Therefore, application-
proxy gateway firewalls are not generally well suited to high-bandwidth or real-time applications.
To reduce the load on the firewall, a dedicated proxy server can be used to secure less time-
sensitive services, such as e-mail and most Web traffic. Another disadvantage is that application-
proxy gateway firewalls are often limited in terms of support for new network applications and
protocols. An individual, application-specific proxy agent is required for each type of network
traffic that needs to transit a firewall. Most application-proxy gateway firewall vendors provide
generic proxy agents to support undefined network protocols or applications. However, those
generic agents tend to negate many of the strengths of the application-proxy gateway architecture,
and they simply allow traffic to “tunnel” through the firewall.
Dedicated Proxy Firewalls. Dedicated proxy servers differ from application-proxy gateway
firewalls in that they retain proxy control of traffic, but they do not contain firewall capability.
They are typically deployed behind traditional firewall platforms for this reason. In typical use, a
main firewall might accept inbound traffic, determine which application is being targeted, and
then hand off the traffic to the appropriate proxy server (e.g., an e-mail proxy server). The proxy
server typically would perform filtering or logging operations on the traffic and then forward it to
internal systems. A proxy server could also accept outbound traffic directly from internal
systems, filter or log the traffic, and then pass it to the firewall for outbound delivery.

Dedicated proxies allow an organization to enforce user authentication requirements and other
filtering and logging on any traffic that traverses the proxy server. The implications are that an
organization can restrict outbound traffic to certain locations or could examine all outbound e-
mail for viruses or restrict internal users from writing to the organization’s Web server. Security
experts have stated that most security problems occur from within an organization; proxy servers
can assist in foiling internally based attacks or malicious behavior. Simultaneously, filtering
outbound traffic will place a heavier load on the firewall and increase administration costs. Many
organizations enable the caching of frequently used Web pages on the proxy, thereby reducing
firewall traffic. In addition to authentication and logging functionality, dedicated proxy servers
are useful for Web and electronic mail (e-mail) content scanning.

Hybrid Firewall Technologies. Recent advances in network infrastructure engineering and
information security have resulted in a “blurring of the lines” that differentiates the various
firewall platforms discussed earlier. As a result, firewall products currently incorporate
functionality from several different classifications of firewall platforms. For example, many
packet filter or stateful inspection packet filter firewall vendors have implemented basic
application-proxy functionality to offset some of the weaknesses associated with their firewall
platform. In most cases, packet filter or stateful inspection packet filter firewall vendors
implement application proxies to provide improved network traffic logging and user
authentication in their firewalls. Nearly all major firewall vendors have introduced hybridization
into their products in some manner; therefore it is not always a simple matter to decide which
specific firewall product is the most suitable for a given application or enterprise infrastructure.
Hybridization of firewall platforms makes the prepurchase product evaluation phase of a firewall
project important. Supported feature sets, rather than firewall product classification, should drive
the product selection.

Network Address Translation. Network address translation (NAT) technology was developed
in response to two major issues in network engineering and security. Network address translation


                                                                                                    27
                                                                         NIST SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-36



is an effective tool for “hiding” the network-addressing schema present behind a firewall
environment. In essence, NAT allows an organization to deploy an addressing schema of its
choosing behind a firewall, while still maintaining an ability to connect to external resources
through the firewall. Network address translation is accomplished by one of three methods: static,
hiding, and port.

In static NAT, each internal system on the private network has a corresponding external, routable
IP address associated with it. This particular technique is seldom used because of the scarcity of
available IP address resources.

With hiding NAT, all systems behind a firewall share the same external, routable IP address.
Thus, with a hiding NAT system, many systems behind a firewall will still appear as only one
system. With port address translation, it is possible to place resources behind a firewall system
and still make them selectively accessible to external users.

In terms of strengths and weaknesses, each type of NAT has applicability in certain situations,
with the variable being the amount of design flexibility offered by each type. Static NAT offers
the most flexibility, but as stated earlier, static NAT is not always practical given the shortage of
IP version 4 addresses. Hiding NAT technology was an interim step in the development of NAT
technology, but it is seldom used because port address translation offers additional features
beyond those present in hiding NAT while maintaining the same basic design and engineering
considerations. Port address translation is often the most convenient and secure solution.

Host-based Firewalls. Firewall packages are available in some OSs or as add-ons; they can be
used to secure only the individual host. Internal servers should be protected and should not be
assumed to be safe from attack because they are behind a main firewall. Host-based firewall
packages typically provide access-control capability for restricting traffic to and from servers
running on the host, and logging is usually available. A disadvantage to host-based firewalls is
that they must be administered separately and maintaining security becomes more difficult as the
number of devices to be configured increases.

Personal Firewalls/Personal Firewall Appliances. Securing personal computers (PC) at home
or remote locations is now as important as securing them at the office; many personnel
telecommute or work at home and operate on organization- or agency-proprietary data. Home
users dialing an Internet service provider (ISP) may have limited firewall protections available to
them because the ISP has to accommodate potentially many different security policies. Therefore,
personal firewalls have been developed to provide protection for remote systems and to perform
many of the same functions as larger firewalls. These products are typically implemented in one
of two configurations.

The first configuration is a personal firewall, which is installed on the system it is meant to
protect; personal firewalls usually do not offer protection to other systems or resources. Likewise,
personal firewalls do not typically provide controls over network traffic that is traversing a
computer network — they protect only the computer system on which they are installed.

The second configuration is a personal firewall appliance, which is in concept similar to a
traditional firewall. In most cases, personal firewall appliances are designed to protect small
networks such as networks that might be found in home offices. These appliances usually run on
specialized hardware and integrate some other form of network infrastructure components in
addition to the firewall itself, including the following: broadband modem wide area network



                                                  28
                                                                        NIST SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-36



(WAN) routing, LAN routing (dynamic routing support), network hub, network switch, Dynamic
Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server, Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
agent, and application-proxy agents.

In terms of deployment strategies, personal firewalls and personal firewall appliances normally
address connectivity concerns associated with telecommuters or branch offices. However, some
organizations employ these devices on the organizational intranet, practicing a layered defense
strategy.

Management of the device or application is an important factor when evaluating or choosing a
personal firewall or personal firewall appliance. Ideally, a personal firewall or personal firewall
appliance should enable the organization or agency to enforce its defined security posture on all
systems that connect to its networks and systems. In the case of telecommuters, this means that a
personal firewall or personal firewall appliance should enforce a policy at least as restrictive as
end-users would experience if they were behind the corporate or agency firewall in the office.

Centrally Managed Distributed Firewalls. The goals for host-based firewalls and personal
firewalls/appliances can also be achieved using centrally managed distributed firewall products.
All of these firewall types provide firewall capability in every protected computer. Centrally
managed distributed firewalls are centrally controlled but locally enforced. A security
administrator defines and maintains security policies, not the end-users. This places the
responsibility and capability of defining security policies in the hands of a security professional
who can properly lock down the target systems. A centrally managed system is scalable because
each system does not have to be administered separately. A properly executed distributed firewall
system includes exception logging. More advanced systems include location intelligence so that
the appropriate policy is enforced depending on the context of the connection.

Centrally managed distributed firewalls can be either software- or hardware-based firewalls.
Centrally managed distributed software firewalls are similar in function and features to host-
based or personal firewalls, but the security policies are centrally defined and managed. Software
distributed firewalls have the benefit of unified corporate oversight of firewall implementation on
individual machines, however they remain vulnerable to attacks on the host operating system
from the networks, as well as intentional or unintentional tampering by users logging into the
system being protected.

Centrally managed distributed hardware firewalls combine the filtering capability of a firewall
with the connectivity capability of a traditional connection. Filtering the data on the firewall
hardware rather than the host system can make this system less vulnerable than software-based
distributed firewalls. Hardware distributed firewalls can be designed to be unaffected by local or
network attacks via the host operating systems. Performance and throughput of a hardware
system is generally higher than software systems.
5.4.2       Firewall Product Characteristics
 A firewall environment should be employed to perform the following general functions:

   -       Perform NAT

   -       Log traffic denied by the firewall
 The firewall should be able to filter packets based on the following characteristics:

   -       Protocol (e.g., IP, Internet Control Message Protocol [ICMP])

   -       Source and destination IP addresses

   -       Source and destination ports (which identify the applications in use)

   -       Interface of the firewall that the packet entered
 The proxy operations should, at a minimum, be operable on the content of Simple Mail
  Transfer Protocol (SMTP), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), and Hypertext Transfer Protocol
  (HTTP) traffic.

5.4.3      Environment Questions

Organization Considerations
 Organizations should use firewalls to secure their Internet connections and their connections
  to other networks. At remote locations, users should use personal firewalls or firewall
  appliances to secure their connections to the Internet and ISPs.
 Organizations should view firewalls as their first line of defense from external threats.
 Organizations must monitor incident response team reports and security Web sites for
  information about current attacks and vulnerabilities. The firewall policy should be updated
  as necessary. A formal process should be used for managing the addition and deletion of
  firewall rules.
 Organizations should recognize that all systems administration, especially firewall
  administration, requires significant time and training. Organizations should ensure that their
  administrators receive regular training to stay current with threats and vulnerabilities.
 Organizations should consider protecting individual systems that have a high risk of being
  attacked or becoming a launch point for an attack, or that house very sensitive or valuable
  data. Systems with public or outsider access, shared workstations, human resource and
  finance servers, and servers in a “demilitarized zone” fall into this category.
 Firewalls should run on a machine dedicated to that purpose.

Product Considerations
 What protocols are supported and/or filtered? Do they include the network-layer
  (packet/protocol filtering with ACLs), the application-layer (protocol/content filtering [virus
  checking, active code blocking]), or both?
 Is the organization currently reliant on products that employ protocols that are incompatible
  with firewall design and implementation (e.g., use of user datagram protocol [UDP] in a
  distributed database management system [DBMS])?

 What type of advanced access control is supported?
 What authentication servers and mechanisms are supported? Do they include
  TACACS/TACACS+/Extended TACACS, RADIUS, or other?
 How vulnerable is the firewall to attacks via the ne]twork against the firewall itself?
  If the firewall runs on an individual host for which all users are not trusted system
  administrators, how vulnerable is it to tampering by a user logged into the operating system
  running on the protected hosts?
 Does the system require end-users to configure and maintain security policies, security
  professionals to individually manage policies per host, or is the configuration centrally
  managed?

      -   If centrally managed, how is this function secured?

      -   If centrally managed, are remote systems with VPN connections covered by this feature?
 Can the firewall support hot-standby/failover/clustering?

  performance)?

 Is there event logging and auditing?
 Is there router and firewall encryption?
 Is Internet Protocol security (IPSec) support available?
 If SNMP is addressable, does protection exist from an unauthorized administrator?
 Is the product SNMPv3 capable?

5.5         Public Key Infrastructure

The interconnectivity of networks and the Internet support opportunities for government and
business to conduct electronic transactions. To enable these paperless business activities, it is
critical to assure that the auditability and legal standing of these electronic transactions are
comparable to the paper formats. One method of meeting this requirement is the use of public key
technologies and a PKI.




                                                                                                     31

A PKI can be quite complex. Similarly, the strategies for implementing a PKI may range from
complete outsourcing of all functionality to building a homegrown PKI from COTS products.
The nuances and details of PKI implementation strategies are well beyond the scope of this
document. For a detailed treatment of the subject, the following references are highly
recommended:
 NIST Special Publication 800-25, Federal Agency Use of Public Key Technology for Digital
  Signatures and Authentication
 NIST Special Publication 800-32, Introduction to Public Key Introduction to Public Key
  Technology and the Federal PKI Infrastructure
 The Federal Public Key Infrastructure Steering Committee Web site at
  http://www.cio.gov/fpkisc
 PKI information can be found at http://csrc.nist.gov/pki.
Discussion of the service aspects of PKI support is addressed in NIST Special Publication 800-
35, Guide to Information Technology Security Services. This section briefly defines the key
concepts of PKI and identifies key criteria for decision making to provide a means for developing
an initial purchasing and implementation strategy.

PKI Terms and Introduction. Public key cryptography relies on the concept of a key pair,
composed of a private key, which must be kept a secret, and a mathematically related public key.
Common functions of public key cryptography are as follows:

 Digital Signatures. A key holder signs a digital document with a secret private key, and a
  relying party can verify that signature with the public key and know that the document has
  not been altered in any way since it was signed and that it was signed with the unique private
  key corresponding to the verification public key.
 Exchange of Certificates. Certificates containing access permissions and/or security
  attributes can be distributed using public key cryptography.

 Exchange of Cryptographic Keys. A relying party can use a public key to encrypt or agree
  to a secret symmetric key to be shared with the private key holder and used in a subsequent
  message or protocol to encrypt data.
PKI is a systematic means of managing key pairs and associating the names of key holders with
their public keys. In a PKI, a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) issues public key certificates to
subscribers (e.g., people, organizational entities, or even network devices), typically binding the
subscriber's public key to the subscriber’s name and security and identity attributes. The
certificate is digitally signed by the CA, and the public key of the CA can be known by all
potential relying parties. Thus, a relying party can verify a subscriber's true public key by
verifying the signature on the subscriber's certificate, and then relying on the subscriber's public
key in subsequent e-commerce transactions. CAs rely on the services of a Registration Authority
(RA) to vouch for the identity of subscribers and to publish certificates and certificate status
information to a repository, which is usually a directory accessible via the LDAP protocol.

Subscribers and relying parties use PKI-enabled applications in actual e-commerce. These
applications, in turn, use PKI clients to perform signing, verification, and key management
operations. The digital signature and key management functionality of PKI are used in PKI-
enabled applications to achieve authentication, integrity, confidentiality, and nonrepudiation.

5.5.1        Types of Products

Before selecting a CA product, a CA service provider, or PKI clients, an organization should
understand the PKI-enabled applications that it wishes to run and the products available for those
applications. In many cases, it will make sense to select the CA and client type in conjunction
with the primary application packages, or to select the applications first and let them drive PKI
choices. Once the applications to be supported have been identified and the security policies and
requirements associated with them have been defined, the following characteristics will
differentiate PKI products.

Key Protection and Cryptographic Modules. The protection afforded private keys is a major
factor in establishing the assurance level of a PKI. Agencies should decide what their assurance
requirements are and ensure that the kinds of modules needed to achieve that assurance are
incorporated in CAs and clients. In most cases, PKI products can use a range of cryptographic
modules, but all PKI products do not support all modules. Private keys should always be stored
and used in an approved cryptographic module, validated to conform to FIPS 140-2. FIPS 140-2
has four levels of security, 1 to 4, in order of increasing security. The CA cryptographic module
should normally be at levels 2 to 4 depending on the sensitivity of the data and transactions being
protected. Hardware cryptographic modules are usually more secure than software-based
products. In many cases, CAs and RAs will use hardware modules, and subscribers will use
software modules, however in some cases many or all subscribers will also use hardware
modules.

Cross-Certification and the Federal PKI Architecture. In some cases, organizations will wish
to allow their users to use certificates issued by another CA to conduct business with other
agencies and organizations. This action requires that the CA be capable of some form of cross-
certification, where the CA can issue certificates to other CA’s extending trust to that CA, its
subscribers, and its associated applications. If this capability is required by the organization, it is
critical that the products selected strictly adhere to industry standards. Demonstration of
interoperability with a wide variety of CA vendors’ products is recommended.

The Federal PKI Bridge CA (FBCA) provides a trust path between PKIs in various agencies. The
use of it, however, depends on the use of clients capable of building certification paths of
certificates through cross-certificates stored in directories. The FBCA defines certificate policies
for four levels of assurance. Technical interoperation with the FBCA is the ability to process
certain certificate extensions, including nameConstraint, certificatePolicies, and policyMapping.
Agencies wishing to cross-certify with the bridge CA should ensure that the clients, CAs, and
directory servers they select can interoperate technically with the Bridge CA and that the products
selected support the policy requirements established for the level of assurance. Current policy and
interoperability information is available at http://www.cio.gov/fpkisc/documents.

Repositories. CAs typically publish certificates and certificate revocation lists (CRL) to directory
servers, and many clients can retrieve the certificates and CRLs they need from directories.
Agencies may chose to implement a directory solely for the purposes of PKI, or they may
integrate directories into a broad range of applications and services, including PKI. It is easier to
build a directory solely for PKI, but also less generally useful.

The LDAP is used by CAs and clients to publish and retrieve certificates and CRLs. Directories
are a complex subject in their own right; however, nearly all now support LDAP. A broad
consideration of directory issues is beyond the scope of this section; however, agencies



                                                                                                       33
                                                                          NIST SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-36



implementing PKI should consider their directory plans and needs, and make PKI directory
decisions in that broader context.

Key Recovery. Most CA products today offer a key recovery capability for encryption or key
management private keys only. (If signature private keys are subject to key recovery, then
nonrepudiation is compromised.) Although other key recovery schemes are possible, many CA
products offer a feature in which the CA automatically keeps a backup copy of the encryption
private key. This copy can be used to recover encrypted data if subscribers lose their keys, or are
not available to activate their key. Agencies should consider key recovery needs when procuring
CA products or PKI-enabled applications that encrypt stored data.

Certificate Status. Certificates may be revoked before they expire. Most CA products can create
a list of revoked certificates called a certificate revocation list (CRL) and post it in a repository,
and most clients can check such a list. The freshness of this revocation information may be an
issue in a PKI; and the CRL features and capabilities of CAs products, services, and clients vary
significantly, but support for these features in CA products and clients is not ubiquitous. A wide
range of alternative means exists for tracking and managing certificate status in a PKI, each with
its own efficiencies and weaknesses. Certificate status and revocation are major issues in the
performance and scalability of PKIs and in the assurance level of certificates. The larger the PKI,
the more difficult and expensive it is to maintain very fresh status information. High-assurance
certificates, however, require a status mechanism that provides fast effective revocation to limit
the damage caused by key compromises. Agencies selecting PKI products or services must
determine their certificate status requirements. They also must select a system and products that
can provide needed status information in a timely manner as the PKI grows in size and scope.

PKI-Enabled Applications. In a sense, the CA, the clients it supports and the entire PKI are "just
plumbing." Perhaps the most basic elements to be considered in selecting a CA product or service
provider are the applications that are enabled to use the clients supported by the CA. PKI enabled
applications and products include the following:
 S/MIME secure E-mail application that can be used to sign and encrypt e-mail. The S/MIME
  software uses the subscriber's PKI client to perform PKI operations with certificates and keys.
 Web servers and browsers that implement the SSL/Transport Layer Security (TLS) are
  widely implemented and support not only PKI-based cryptographic authentication of servers
  and clients but also encryption of traffic in “secure” sessions. Again, the application either
  relies on a PKI vendor’s PKI client or uses a built-in PKI client to perform PKI operations.
 Document-signing products or applications that are used with forms, document management,
  or workflow products to allow signatures and approvals on electronic documents and to
  replace signed paper documents.
 Access control that uses certificates and a challenge/signed response protocol to authenticate
  an identity or privilege for use in access control, and may implement "single sign-on" for a
  variety or services.
 Products with built-in PKI-enabled access control—for example, firewalls, mail servers, or
  directory servers. These products often rely on the SSL/TLS protocol.
 File encryption systems that may use public key certificates to manage file encryption keys
  and to provide for a key recovery capability, if keys are otherwise lost.

5.5.2      PKI Product Characteristics
 The PKI product must be designed and implemented in a manner that ensures that the
  security policies can be enforced.
 The system should provide for easy key maintenance and secure public and private key
  backups.
 The selected PKI products must be compliant with applicable federal regulations and policies
  such as the following:

   –    FIPS PUB 140-2: Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules

   –    FIPS PUB 180-2: Secure Hash Standard

   –    FIPS PUB 186: Digital Signature Standard.
 The PKI product must conform to the X.509v3 or PKIX standards. These standards are the
  basis for most PKI-oriented products. If scalability and future interoperability are necessary
  requirements, products that conform to these standards should be considered.
 PKI client products must implement the PKIX path processing algorithm in conformance to
  X.509 and RFC 3280. Conformance is demonstrated by performing the PKITS X.509 path
  validation test suite, available at http://csrc.nist.gov/pki/testing/x509paths.html.

5.6          Malicious Code Protection

Viruses, worms and other malicious code9 are typically hidden in software and require a host to
replicate. Malicious code protection requires strict procedures and multiple layers of defense.
Protection includes prevention, detection, containment, and recovery. Protection hardware and
access-control software can inhibit this code as it attempts to spread. Most security products for
detecting malicious code include several programs that use different techniques.

5.6.1          Types of Products

Scanners. Scanners provide precise identification of known malicious code. Scanners search for
“signature strings” or use algorithmic detection methods to identify known code. Scanners rely on

        9
            The terms “virus” and “malicious code” are used interchangeably in this section.


                                                          36
                                                                       NIST SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-36



a significant amount of a prior knowledge about the code. Therefore, it is critical that the
signature information for scanners is current. Most scanners can be configured to automatically
update their signatures from a designated source, typically on a weekly basis; scanners can also
be forced to update their signatures on demand.

Integrity Checkers. Integrity checkers detect infections by searching a program or other
executable code to determine if it has been altered or changed. Integrity checkers can only flag a
change as suspicious; they cannot determine if the change is a genuine virus infection. These
programs are usually checksum based. The integrity checking process begins with the creation of
a baseline, where checksums for clean executables are computed and saved. Each time the
integrity checker is run, it again makes a checksum computation and compares the result with the
stored value. Note that several different kinds of checksums are used. Simple checksums are easy
to defeat; cyclical redundancy checks (CRC) are better, but can still be defeated. Cryptographic
checksums such as SHA provide the highest level of security.

Vulnerability Monitors. These monitors are designed to prevent modification or access to
particularly sensitive parts of the system; consequently, the monitors may block an attack on
those parts. This requires considerable information about “normal” system use because PC
viruses typically take advantage of system vulnerabilities and do not circumvent any security
features. This type of software also requires decisions from the user about permitted operations.

Behavior Blockers. These programs contain a list of rules that a legitimate program must follow.
If the program breaks one of the rules, the behavior blockers alert the users. The “sandbox”
concept is that untrusted code is first checked for improper behavior. If none is found, it can be
run in a restricted environment, where dynamic checks are performed on each potentially
dangerous action before it is permitted to take effect. By adding multiple layers of reviews and
checks to the execution process, behavior blockers can prevent malicious code from performing
undesirable actions.

5.6.2       Malicious Code Protection Product Characteristics

      connections, PDAs and other removable devices so that viruses can be intercepted before
      they are stored on the hard drive.
 Integration with e-mail, Web, FTP, instant messaging and other applications that may
  transport malicious code should be transparent but effective.
 The tool should be able to scan all file types for malicious code and monitor JavaScript and

  appropriate action, such as deleting an infected file or attempting to remove the virus from an
  infected file.
 The tool should offer a repair feature of any infected files or quarantine files designated as
  irreparable.

 What is the level of documentation needed?
 Can the vendor create custom virus definitions for the organization?

5.7         Vulnerability Scanners

Vulnerability scanners examine hosts such as servers, workstations, firewalls and routers for
known vulnerabilities. Each vulnerability presents a potential opportunity for attackers to gain
unauthorized access to data or other system resources. Vulnerability scanners contain a database
of vulnerability information, which is used to detect vulnerabilities so that administrators can
mitigate through network, host and application-level measures before they are exploited. By

                                                                         NIST SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-36



running scanners on a regular basis, administrators can also see how effectively they have
mitigated vulnerabilities that were previously identified. Products use dozens of techniques to
detect vulnerabilities in hosts’ operating systems, services and applications.

5.7.1       Types of Products

Network Vulnerability Scanners. Network vulnerability scanners are utilized to detect
vulnerabilities on remote hosts by performing scans across networks. These scanners typically
identify only those vulnerabilities that can be exploited remotely. Most network vulnerability
scanners first perform network mapping to enumerate the hosts, then send additional scans and
probes to each host to fingerprint its operating system and identify the applications and services it
is running. The final step is to examine each application and service for known vulnerabilities.
Some tools take this a step farther and actually attempt to validate the identified vulnerabilities by
exploiting them; this is known as penetration testing.

Host Vulnerability Scanners. Host vulnerability scanners are run on a particular host to detect
its vulnerabilities. These scanners identify vulnerabilities that can be exploited either remotely or
locally. Typically the administrator defines security policy settings for each operating system in
use, and the scanner compares the policies to the actual settings of each host. Host vulnerability
scanners usually identify vulnerabilities primarily by checking configuration settings and user
and group-related information, including permissions and ownership.

Outsourced Scanning. An alternative to acquiring vulnerability scanning is to contract with an
outside vendor to perform the scanning. An outside vendor uses the same host and network
scanners that individual organizations may have, but the vendors can typically possess a wide
range of open source and commercial products, a deep knowledge of vulnerabilities and scanning
techniques, and more experience in performing vulnerability scans, increasing the likelihood of
detecting vulnerabilities. On the other hand, the vendors typically lack the specific knowledge of
an organization’s environment that is needed to determine the significance of vulnerabilities.
Outsourced scanning works best when the security, network and system administrators within an
organization collaborate with the vendor. Outsourced scanning is also often extended into a full
penetration test to determine not only what vulnerabilities exist within an environment, but how
attackers may exploit them.

5.7.2       Vulnerability Scanner Product Characteristics
 Accuracy, ease of use, administration and system overhead should be considered in product
  selection.
 The tool should be easily customizable for an environment and for particular hosts within the
  environment.
 Vulnerability scanners should be procured from vendors with a history of frequent updates
  and rapid responses to new serious vulnerabilities.
 The product should be able to update its vulnerability database from remote locations or local
  files, on demand and automatically on a pre-set schedule.
 The tool should provide an option to choose scanning preferences such as intensity and speed
  so that scanning does not overwhelm hosts, networks or the scanner itself.
 The tool should minimize host crashes, lockups and other problems inadvertently caused by
  scanning activities.


                                                                                                     39

 The tool should determine for each host which ports are listening and what application or
  service is listening at each port. It should not make any assumptions regarding which services
  or applications are listening at a particular port number.
 The tool should use a combination of methods to identify vulnerabilities. The methods used
  will vary from product to product and are also dependent on whether host or network
  scanning is being performed and on the operating system of the target. Possible methods
  include:

   -    Permission and ownership checks on files, directories, shares, Windows registry settings
        and other components

   -    Reviewing user and group privileges and group membership

   -    Password, screen saver, remote access, logging and audit policy checking

   -    Banner grabbing, to identify service and application types and versions, and to confirm
        that legal notices are provided before access is granted

   -    Password guessing, particularly default operating system and application accounts and
        passwords.

   -    The results produced by the tool should be easy to view and to compare with previous
        results.

   -    Whenever applicable, the tool should report the CVE number for each identified
        vulnerability.

   -    The tool should make specific recommendations for mitigating each identified
        vulnerability and provide references to additional information.

   -    The tool should report a reasonable risk level for each vulnerability.

5.8            Forensics

Computer forensics involves the identification, preservation, extraction, and documentation of
computer-based evidence.10 Such information may be hidden from view; thus, special forensic
software tools and techniques are required. Forensic software tools and methods can be used to
identify passwords, log-ons, and other information that may have been deleted from the computer
memory. These tools can also be used to identify backdated files and to tie a diskette to the
computer that created it.

The computer forensics process consists of three phases: acquisition, examination, and
presentation. Computer forensic investigators must have software tools that can effectively and
efficiently accomplish the following tasks:
  Image data (e.g. make a clone of suspect media)
  Create comprehensive file listings with file checksums
  Compare an existing list of file checksums with the checksums of current files

 Identify and recover text located anywhere on the storage media
 View text and image files
 Assure that recovery methods do not unnecessarily contaminate data evidence or produce
  artifacts
 Identify compressed data and decompress it
 Identify files by their contents and file header signatures, not just filenames and file
  extensions
 Identify encrypted files.

5.8.1          Types of Products

Forensic tools can be purchased individually or as a suite. They may be grouped into two
categories: evidence preservation and collection tools, and analysis tools. These tools facilitate
many different forensic activities, including evaluating system content, file comparisons,
transactions, and file deletions.

Evidence Preservation and Collection Tools. These tools preserve the integrity of data that
resides on evidentiary computer media and provide an unobtrusive mechanism for making copies
of some or all of the original data. Write-protection tools and disk imaging software assist
forensic examiners during preservation and copying of evidence.

Analysis Tools. The primary function of forensic analysis tools is to assist the examiner in
analyzing vast amounts of data. Analysis tools perform the following:
 Recover deleted files
 Recover data not allocated to a specific file or application
 Perform string and pattern matching
 Conduct file identification
 Perform file listing or cataloging.

5.8.2          Forensics Product Characteristics

The needed characteristics of a computer forensic toolset will vary with each application. Some
products perform a wide range of forensic tasks, such as text string search, deleted file recovery,
free space extraction, and hidden data recovery, while others perform only a single task.11

  in use by the organization)?
 What is the speed of duplication/collection?
 Does the product sanitize the destination media prior to duplication/collection?

5.9          Media Sanitizing

With the more prevalent use of increasingly sophisticated encryption systems, an attacker wishing
to gain access to an organization’s sensitive data is forced to look elsewhere for information. One
avenue of attack is the recovery of supposedly deleted data from media or memory. This residual
data may allow unauthorized individuals to reconstruct and thereby gain access to sensitive
information. Media sanitization tools can be used to thwart this attack by ensuring that deleted
data are completely removed from the system or media.

When storage media are transferred, become obsolete, or are no longer usable as a result of
damage, it is important to ensure that residual magnetic, optical, or electrical representation of
data that has been deleted is no longer recoverable. Sanitization is the process of removing data
from storage media, such that there is reasonable assurance, in proportion to the sensitivity of the
data, that the data may not be retrieved and reconstructed. Once the media are sanitized, it should
be impossible or impractical to retrieve the data. There are several accepted methods for
sanitizing media: overwriting, degaussing, and destruction12.

5.9.1          Types of Products
 Overwriting. One method to sanitize media is to use software or hardware products to
  overwrite storage space on the media with nonsensitive data. This process may include
  overwriting not only the logical storage location of a file(s) (e.g., file allocation table) to be
  erased or deleted but also the entire media, including all addressable locations. The security

        12
             The cost and benefit of a media sanitization method should be understood prior to a final decision. For
             instance, it may not be cost effective to degauss inexpensive media like diskettes.


                                                                                                                       43
                                                                       NIST SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-36



   goal of the overwriting process is to replace sensitive data with nonsensitive random data.
   Media should be overwritten a minimum of three times using a method based on the
   information sensitivity contained on the media. Overwriting cannot be used for media that are
   damaged or not rewriteable. The media type and size may also influence whether overwriting
   is a suitable sanitization method.
 Degaussing. A degausser is a device that generates a magnetic field used to sanitize magnetic
  media. Degaussers are rated based on the type (i.e., low energy or high energy) of magnetic
  media they can erase. Degaussers have two different mechanisms: strong magnet and
  electromagnetic. Degaussing can be an effective method for sanitizing damaged media, for
  sanitizing media with exceptionally large storage capacities, or for quickly sanitizing
  diskettes. Degaussing is not effective for sanitizing nonmagnetic media, such as optical
  media.
 Destruction. Media also can be sanitized using physical destruction of the media. Physical
  destruction can be accomplished using a variety of methods, including disintegration,
  incineration, pulverization, shredding, melting, sanding, and acid bath. Physical destruction
  may be the only appropriate sanitization method for optical media, such as CD-ROM (read
  only) and Write-Once Read-Many (WORM).

   –    Disintegration, Pulverization, Melting, and Incineration. These sanitization methods are
        designed to completely destroy the media. They are typically conducted at an outsourced
        metal destruction or incineration facility with the specific capabilities to perform these
        activities effectively, securely, and safely.

   –    Shredding. Paper shredders can be used to destroy flexible media such as diskettes once
        the media are physically removed from their outer containers. The shred size of the refuse
        should small enough that there is reasonable assurance in proportion to the sensitivity of
        the data that the data cannot be reconstructed.

   –    Sanding. Sanding is the application of an abrasive substance (e.g., an emery wheel,
        grinder, or disk sander or sanding device) to the media’s physical recording surface. The
        entire media recording surface must be removed completely.

   –    Acid Bath. The application of acid solutions (e.g., concentrated hydriodic) to the media is
        typically conducted at an outsourced facility with the specific capabilities to perform
        these activities effectively, securely, and safely.
 Memory Sanitization. Sanitization of memory is determined based on whether the memory
  is volatile or nonvolatile. Volatile memory, such as RAM chips, requires power to maintain
  their content. Removing electrical power from the chip will erase or sanitize its contents.
  Nonvolatile memory, such as forms of Programmable Read-Only Memory (PROM) flash
  memory, maintain their contents permanently or until reprogrammed. Sanitization methods
  vary for specific forms of PROM. These methods include ultraviolet light, PROM
  programmers using overwriting, and physical destruction.

 Conducted at an approved facility or location, whether performed internally by the
  organization or outsourced, that has been proved effective, secure, and safe

5.9.3          Environment Questions

Organizational Considerations
 What types (e.g., optical nonrewritable, magnetic) and size (e.g., megabyte, gigabyte, and
  terabyte) of media storage does the organization require to be sanitized?
 What is the sensitivity of the data stored on the media?
 Will the media be processed outside a controlled area?
 Should the sanitization process be conducted within the organization or outsourced?

        13
             The cost versus benefit of a media sanitization method should be understood prior to a final decision. For
             instance, it may not be cost effective to degauss a inexpensive media like diskettes.

Appendix C–Frequently Asked Questions

1. Why was this guide written?

   This guide seeks to help organizations make informed decisions when selecting computer security
   products. The categories of products listed here include operational controls such as intrusion
   detection and technical controls such as firewalls. This guide should be used with other NIST
   publications to develop a comprehensive approach to the management of an organization’s computer
   security requirements. The guide first defines broad security product categories and then specifies
   product types within those categories. This guide explains and provides a list of characteristics and
   pertinent questions an organization should ask in the selection process.

2. For whom is the guide intended?

   This guide is written to help an organization during the various stages of the computer security
   product life cycle. It can be used as a tool by—

 IT Security Officers in gathering the necessary information for the IT risk assessment and building the
  business case for the procurement of IT security products
 Chief Information Officers (CIO) and Chief Technology Officers (CTO) in
  establishing product procurement policy and ensuring that security has been appropriately considered
  in the selection process
 IT directors, program managers, and system owners in understanding the types of available security
  products, what they should consider when making a selection decision, and what factors they should
  use for evaluating a security product.


3. Who has a role in product selection?

   Product selection involves numerous people throughout an organization. Each person involved in the
   process, whether on an individual or group level, should understand the importance of security in the
   organization’s information infrastructure and the security impacts that their decisions will have. The
   personnel listed below are a sample guide. Depending on the organization’s needs, one may include
   all of the personnel listed below or a combination of particular positions relevant to IT security needs.

 IT Security Program Manager
 Chief Information Officer
 IT Investment Board (or equivalent)
 Program Manager (owner of data) / Procurement Initiator
 Acquisition Team
 Contracting Officer
 Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative
 IT System Security Officer




                                                   C-1
                                                                                                NIST SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-36




4. What specific security products should an organization select?

   This guide does not discuss how an organization should develop its overall computer security
   program or the optimal set of products that should be implemented, nor are the product categories
   listed in this guide exhaustive as the commercial marketplace for IT security products is constantly
   changing. Also, the specific products that are right for each organization will vary based on mission,
   specific IT infrastructure, security objectives, costs, performance requirements, schedule constraints,
   operational constraints, and so forth.

5. How should an organization go about selecting IT security products?

   A security program, whether at the organization or at the system level, should include an appropriate
   mixture of security controls: management, operational, and technical. The number and type of
   appropriate security controls and their corresponding IT security products may vary throughout a
   particular system’s development and procurement life cycle. The relative maturity of an
   organization’s security architecture may influence the types of appropriate security controls. The
   blend of security controls is tied to the mission of the organization and the role of the system within
   the organization as it supports that mission.

   Risk management is the process used to identify an effective mix of management, operational, and
   technical security controls to mitigate risk to a level acceptable to the responsible senior official.
   Once the necessary controls are identified, IT security products can then be identified to provide for
   these controls. In addition, it is important to perform a cost-benefit analysis when selecting security
   products1. As part of the cost-benefit analysis, a life-cycle cost (LCC) estimate for the status quo and
   each alternative identified should be developed. In addition to LCC estimates, benefits associated
   with each alternative should be identified and, to the extent practicable, quantified in terms of dollar
   savings or cost avoidance.

   Once all options are weighed in the cost-benefit analysis, the security product selection is made, and
   implementation of the product can follow.

6. How can an organization gain assurance in the operation of the security features of
   commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) products?

   Independent, third-party testing and evaluation of IT products can give consumers greater confidence
   that the security features in those products work as advertised by the vendor. Testing and evaluation
   also provides a way to demonstrate product compliance with organization security requirements and
   public security standards. Additionally, whether or not evaluated, the vendor’s expression of security
   capability in the form of a Common Criteria Security Target (ST) enhances understanding of product
   claims by providing a standard format that includes rationale for correctness and completeness. NIST
   Special Publication 800-23 provides guidance on security assurance and the use of tested/evaluated
   products, and should be consulted by organizations selecting security products for their IT systems
   and networks.

 Two prominent security testing and evaluation programs are now in place to assess the security
  features and assurances of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) products: (1) National Information


       1
           There may be cases where the cost of a product is relatively low or the benefit is somewhat obvious, i.e. a virus scan
            product. In these situations, the rigor of a cost-benefit analysis may be reduced.


                                                              C-2
                                                                              NIST SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-36



   Assurance Partnership2 (NIAP) Common Criteria (CC) Evaluation and Validation Scheme (CCEVS)
   and (2) NIST Cryptographic Module Validation Program3 (CMVP). In the case of cryptographic
   modules, when agencies have determined the need to protect information via cryptographic means
   they may only select CMVP validated cryptographic modules. See http://csrc.nist.gov/cryptval/ for a
   validation list for cryptographic standards.


7. What are the organizational considerations when selecting an IT security product?

   The organizational considerations required to support a product purchase are provided in the list of
   following questions. An organization may or may not have a need to consider all questions. In some
   cases, a high cost product acquisition may require a more extensive evaluation of organizational
   considerations.

 Is the anticipated user community identified? How many and what type of users does the organization
  anticipate will use the security product?
 Is the relationship between this security product and the organization’s mission performance
  understood and documented?
 Has the sensitivity of the data the organization is trying to protect been determined?
 Are the organization security requirements supported by security plans, policies and procedures?
 Have security requirements been identified and compared against product specifications?
 Has appropriate procurement language been used for the specific product under selection?
 Have operational issues, such as daily operation, maintenance, contingency planning, awareness, and
  training, and documentation been considered?
 Have policies been developed for the procurement and use of evaluated products as appropriate?
  When selecting products, organizations need to consider the threat environment, the security
  functions needed to cost-effectively mitigate the risks to an acceptable level. Organizations should
  give consideration to procurement and deployment of IT security products that meet their
  requirements and have been evaluated and tested by independent accredited laboratories against
  appropriate security specifications and requirements. Examples of these specifications include
  protection profiles based on ISO/IEC 15408, the Common Criteria for IT Security Evaluation.
 Is communication required across a domain boundary (implies the need for a boundary controller;
  e.g., sub-system of firewall, intrusion detection system, and/or routers)?
 Are the system components (hardware or software) required for this product identified?
 Is the security product consistent with physical security and other policy requirements?
 Has the impact on the enterprise operational environment where this product will operate been
  considered?
 Has the impact of emerging technologies on the product been considered?
 Is the product necessary to mitigate risk?

                                                                                                 NIST SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-36



 Are the system components (hardware or software) required for this product identified?
 Have security reviews been made for support/plug-in components middleware?

8. What are the product considerations?

   The following questions apply to the product and should be considered when forming a decision and
   selecting a product:

 Have total life-cycle support, ease-of-use, scalability, and interoperability requirements been
  determined? The total life cycle covers “cradle to grave” and hence includes security product disposal
  requirements.
 Have test requirements, for acceptance and integration testing, and configuration management been
  developed? If the product has been evaluated under the NIAP-CCEVS, validation test reports can be
  examined to avoid duplication of tests already performed as part of the independent evaluation
  process.
 Have known product vulnerabilities been addressed by reviewing the relevant vulnerabilities for a
  product? Known vulnerabilities for some products can be found using the NIST ICAT Vulnerability
  Search Engine (http://icat.nist.gov).4
 Have all relevant patches been tested and implemented?
 Have existing CC protection profiles (PP) been reviewed (for example, http://niap.nist.gov/cc-
  scheme/PPRegistry.html and http://www.commoncriteria.org/protection_profiles/pp.html), to identify
  PPs that express security requirements applicable to the organization’s needs in the anticipated threat
  environment? If existing protection profiles are not adequate, organizations should consider the
  usefulness of similar protection profiles as a starting point for examining products that might satisfy
  requirements applicable to the new environment.
 Lists of validated products (for example, http://niap.nist.gov/cc-scheme/ValidatedProducts.html)
  should be reviewed. Products independently tested and validated under NIAP-CCEVS (or mutually
  recognized) provide some level of security assurance that the security functions of the product work
  as specified. In general, third party testing and evaluation can provide a significantly greater basis for
  customer confidence than is available from unevaluated products. Note, however, that purchasing an
  evaluated product simply because it is evaluated and without due consideration of applicable
  functional and assurance requirements and vendor reliability, may be neither useful nor cost effective.
  Organizations should consider their overall requirements and select the best products accordingly.
  The FIPS 140-1/FIPS 140-2 (CMVP) program’s Validated Products lists (see
  http://csrc.nist.gov/cryptval) should be reviewed as the use of validated products is mandatory and
  binding on federal agencies where they have determined information must be protected via
  cryptographic means. This applies to all IT products irrespective of whether the product is a security
  product or whether the cryptographic module is embedded within another product (e.g. a database).
 Has the vendor's policy or stance on re-validation of products when new releases of the product are
  issued been considered?
 Have product specifications been reviewed with respect to existing and planned organizational
  programs, policies, procedures, and standards? Examples include an organization’s

       –       Public key infrastructure (PKI) program and policy

       –       Smart card program

       –       Network interconnection and approval policy.
 Does the product have any security critical dependencies on other products? For example, an
  operating system (OS) or cryptographic module?
 Does interfacing the new product with the existing infrastructure introduce new vulnerabilities?
 What is the frequency of product failures and adequacy of corrective actions?

9. What are the vendor considerations?

   The following questions apply to the vendor and should be considered when forming a decision and
   selecting a product:

 Will the selection of a particular product limit the future choices of other computer security or
  operational modifications and improvements? (Note: The change and pace of technology may make it
  difficult to estimate the impact to an organization’s future security architecture.)
 Does the vendor have experience in producing high quality IT security products?
 What is the vendor’s “track-record” in responding to security flaws in its products?
 How does the vendor handle software and hardware maintenance, end user support, and maintenance
  agreements?
 What is the long-term viability of the vendor?
 Has the vendor developed a security configuration guide?
 Does the vendor have an associated security guide for the product? Does the vendor use or make
  reference to NIST, consortia, or other consensus-based checklists, security configurations/settings or
  benchmarks.
10. Which IT security product categories are discussed in this document?
