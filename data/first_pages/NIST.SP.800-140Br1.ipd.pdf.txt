52   This publication has been developed by NIST in accordance with its statutory responsibilities under the
53   Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) of 2014, 44 U.S.C. § 3551 et seq., Public Law
54   (P.L.) 113-283. NIST is responsible for developing information security standards and guidelines, including
55   minimum requirements for federal information systems, but such standards and guidelines shall not apply
56   to national security systems without the express approval of appropriate federal officials exercising policy
57   authority over such systems. This guideline is consistent with the requirements of the Office of Management
58   and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130.

59   Nothing in this publication should be taken to contradict the standards and guidelines made mandatory and
60   binding on federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory authority. Nor should these
61   guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the Secretary of Commerce,
62   Director of the OMB, or any other federal official. This publication may be used by nongovernmental
63   organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright in the United States. Attribution would,
64   however, be appreciated by NIST.

187   6.1   Changes to ISO/IEC 24759 section 6.14 and ISO/IEC 19790 Annex B Requirements

188   All requirements from ISO/IEC 24759 section 6.14 and ISO/IEC 19790 Annex B apply and are
189   required in the security policy as applicable.

190   ISO/IEC 19790 Annex B uses the same section naming convention as ISO/IEC 19790 section 7 -
191   Security requirements. For example, Annex B section B.2.1 is named “General” and B.2.2 is
192   named “Cryptographic module specification,” which is the same as ISO/IEC 19790 section 7.1
193   and section 7.2, respectively. Therefore, the format of the security policy shall be presented in
194   the same order as indicated in Annex B, starting with “General” and ending with “Mitigation of
195   other attacks.” If sections are not applicable, they shall be marked as such in the security policy.

196   ISO/IEC 24759 section 6.14 – Cryptographic module security policy requirements are modified
197   as indicated below:

198   No Change.

253   In addition to ISO/IEC 24759 section 6.14 and ISO/IEC 19790 Annex B, other publications and
254   documents specify documentation requirements for the Security Policy. Many of these
255   requirements relate to specific conditions and configurations of modules and would not be
256   applicable in many cases.

257   These additional requirements are listed for each section of the Security Policy, grouped by the
258   source publication or document and reference the specific section from the document where the
259   requirement is stated. Where possible, they are direct statements from the source documents and
260   would often require the original context to best understand the requirement.

313      1. Triple-DES within IETF Protocol - The limit of 2^20 encryptions with the same Triple-
314         DES key applies when keys are generated as part of one of the recognized IETF
315         protocols. To use this provision, the Security Policy shall say which of the IETF
316         protocols governs the generation of the Triple-DES keys and list the IETF RFC(s) where
317         the details of this protocol, relevant to the generation of the Triple-DES encryption keys,

324          with the TLS 1.2 specification and only for use within the TLS 1.2 protocol, then the
325          module’s Security Policy shall explicitly state the module’s compatibility with TLS 1.2
326          and the module’s support for acceptable AES-GCM ciphersuites from Section 3.3.1 of SP
327          800-52 rev1 or SP 800-2rev2.
328      2. TLS 1.2 - Trigger Statement - A statement concerning the triggering or a handshake to
329          establish a new encryption key shall be included in the Security Policy and Validation
330          Test Report.
331      3. IPsec-v3 Compatibility Statement - The Security Policy shall explicitly state the
332          module’s compliance with RFC 4106 and/or RFC 5282 (depending on the protocols
333          supporting GCM).
334      4. IPsec-v3 Compliant IKEv2 Statement - The Security Policy shall state that the module
335          uses RFC 7296 compliant IKEv2 to establish the shared secret SKEYSEED from which
336          the AES-GCM encryption keys are derived.
337      5. IPsec-v3 Rekey Trigger Statement - A statement indicating a rekeying trigger shall be

345          Authenticator and the Authentication Server shall be provided in the Security Policy of
346          the module.
347      8. MACsec Link Secure - The Peer and the Authenticator Modules Security Policies shall
348          state that the link between the Peer and the Authenticator should be secured to prevent
349          the possibility for an attacker to introduce foreign equipment into the local area network
350      9. SSHv2 Compliance - If the vendor claims that the IV generation is in compliance with
351          the SSHv2 specification and only for use within the SSHv2 protocol, then the module’s

353          compliance with RFCs 4252, 4253 and 5647.
354      10. Case 2: Internal, Random Generation - If the IV is generated internally at its entirety
355          randomly, the Security Policy shall include a statement that the generation uses an

358      11. Case 3: Generated Deterministically - Human Operator Reset - There will be a human
359          operator who will reset the IV to the last one used in case the module’s power is lost and
360          then restored. (This condition is not enforced but shall be stated in the module’s Security
361          Policy, under the “User Guide” heading.)
362      12. Case 3: Generated Deterministically - Power Lost and Restored - In case the module’s
363          power is lost and then restored, a new key for use with the AES-GCM
364          encryption/decryption shall be established. (This condition may or may not be enforced
365          but shall be stated in the module’s Security Policy, under the “User Guide” heading.)
366      13. Case 3: Generated Deterministically - Generation and Restoration Statement - A
367          statement explaining how the deterministic IV generation is performed and how the IV
368          restoration conditions are met shall be included in the Security Policy and Validation Test

374          the documents (such as the IETF RFCs) where the protocol and, specifically, the use of
375          the AES-GCM encryption within the protocol are defined.
376
377   IG:C.J - Requirements for Testing to SP 800-38G
378      1. Parameter Lengths - The vendor shall document, in the module’s Security Policy, the
379         lengths of the following parameters from SP 800-38G: radix, radix^minlen, minlen,
380         maxlen, and maxTlen.
381
382   IG:D.A - Acceptable SSP Establishment Protocols
383      1. SSP Establishment Caveat - If the comparable strength of the largest SSP (taken at face
384         value) that can be established by a cryptographic module is greater than the largest
385         comparable strength of the implemented SSP establishment method, then the module
386         certificate and Security Policy will be annotated with, in addition to the other required
387         caveats, the caveat "(SSP establishment methodology provides xx bits of encryption
388         strength)" for that SSP establishment method.
389
390   IG:D.C - References to the Support of Industry Protocols
391      1. Not Validated, Not Listed - If the module implements a KDF from SP 800-135rev1 and
392         this KDF has not been validated by the CAVP, then the module’s certificate shall not list
393         this function. The module’s Security Policy shall make it clear that the corresponding
394         protocol shall not be used in an approved mode of operation.
395      2. Validated, Listed with Statement - If the module’s Security Policy claims that the module
396         supports or uses the corresponding protocol, then the Security Policy shall state that no
397         parts of this protocol, other than the approved cryptographic algorithms and the KDFs,
398         have been tested by the CAVP and CMVP.
399      3. KDF Not Implemented - If the module does not implement any KDFs from SP 800-
400         135rev1 but the module’s Security Policy claims that the module supports or uses parts of
401         the corresponding protocol(s) then no entry on the certificate’s approved or allowed
402         algorithms lines is required. As in the case considered above (2), the Security Policy shall
403         state that this protocol has not been reviewed or tested by the CAVP and CMVP.

404
405   IG:D.E - Assurance of the Validity of a Public Key for SSP establishment
406      1. No Ephemeral Public Key Validation - If a cryptographic module implements a key
407         agreement / shared secret computation scheme whereby the recipient of an ephemeral
408         public key omits the explicit ephemeral public key validation, the modules Security
409         Policy shall indicate the appropriate protocol listed above that allows the omission of the
410         validation in order to claim conformance to this Implementation Guidance.

438      4. Approved Annotation with Caveat - The module’s compliance with either the symmetric
439         or the asymmetric key based approved key transport techniques shall be annotated in the
440         approved cryptographic algorithms list in the Security Policy, with the caveats, as
441         necessary and as shown in the Management Manual - Annex A.
442      5. Allowed Annotation with Caveat - The use of the allowed methods for key transport shall
443         be annotated in the allowed algorithms list in the Security Policy.

452      2. Deterioration Action - If the source may deteriorate to the point when the generation of
453         the sufficient amount of entropy (sufficient to support the claims about the strengths of
454         the generated cryptographic keys) can no longer be guaranteed, the module’s Security
455         Policy shall explain what action is to be taken.

585      5. Estimation and Porting to Untested Platform - The module’s SP shall contain a statement
586         that if porting to an untested platform is allowed then when running a module on such an

588         applies regardless of what caveat, if any, is applicable to the original validation.
589      6. Generating Random Strings, not SSPs - If the module generates random strings that are
590         not SSPs and the security strength of a generated string is less than the bit length of the
591         string due to limited entropy, the module’s SP shall state the guaranteed amount of
592         entropy for both the SSPs and the random strings generated by the module using the
593         available entropy source(s).
594      7. Random String Length and Key Strength - The module’s SP shall inform the reader about
595         the length of a random string loaded into the module and explain, if applicable, the effect

603         conditional self-tests shall be specified in the security policy
604      2. Met Inherently Claim - Rationale - If a vendor wishes to claim that a module meets the
605         periodic self-testing requirements inherently based on module design or limitations and
606         falls into one of the cases above, the vendor shall provide rationale in the module’s
607         security policy as to how the module is protected against faults or errors that may occur
608         over time.
609      3. Met Inherently Claim - Timeframe - The module’s security policy shall explicitly state
610         what the expected timeframe is for the periodic self-test.
611      4. Different Execution Triggers - In the event that multiple triggers for periodic self-test are
612         defined, each mechanism shall be clearly stated in the module’s security policy along
613         with the self-tests that correspond to each.

625   6.3     Documentation input, structure, and formatting

626   This section is intended to provide further guidance on what type of information is expected for a
627   specific requirement or set of requirements from Annex B and the additional requirements listed
628   in Section 6.2. All of the requirement statements are organized into appropriately named and
629   numbered sub-sections (i.e. B.2.1.1- Security Levels, B.2.2.1 – Purpose or Use). Each sub-
630   section identifies the applicable requirements and provides any clarifying and explanatory notes
631   for that sub-section.

632   The content for each sub-section will be separately input and then combined to create the
633   Security Policy. There are currently three methods that will be used to input the information.

634         1. Web Cryptik

635         The Web Cryptik program will continue to be used to enter specific field and table
636         information. In this update, most of the information required to fulfill the Annex B
637         requirements will be input through Web Cryptik. Appendix A – Security Policy Detailed
638         Information Description contains detailed descriptions of the tables and fields, where
639         needed.

640         2. CAVP Algorithm-Mode-Property Selection

641         In this update to 140B and the corresponding update to Web Cryptik, the labs/vendors will be
642         selecting algorithms, modes, and properties from the sets that have been tested through the
643         CAVP process. This will replace the previous process of separately enter that information.

644         Part of the initial information labs/vendors enter into Web Cryptik will be the CAVP
645         Certificate numbers associated with the algorithm tests for that particular module. Web
646         Cryptik will then retrieve and display the relevant information from the CAVP system. Each
647         algorithm/operational environment entry will be listed, along with the set of properties for
648         that test. The lab/vendor will then select the specific items that are implemented in the
649         module. When algorithms are tested in multiple operating environments, they will each have
650         a separate entry in the list.

651         The selected subset will be saved, maintained with the rest of the module’s information, and
652         used to generate the Tested Algorithm table in the Security Policy.

653         3. Vendor Document Uploads

654         A small number of the sub-sections require the labs/vendors to create a document containing
655         the appropriate content for that sub-section and upload it as a PFD file into Web Cryptik.

656   Also, an Additional Information sub-section has been included at the end of each Security Policy
657   section. The vendors have the option to use this section to provide clarification or to add to the
658   content of the Security Policy.

908                 algorithm with a FIPS 180-4 hash function and there is a corresponding entry on
909                 the approved line of the module’s validation certificate, then the vendor
910                 affirmation of the same algorithm using SHA-3 does not need to be shown
911                 separately on the certificate’s approved line but shall be documented in the

924                 IETF protocols governs the generation of the Triple-DES keys and list the IETF
925                 RFC(s) where the details of this protocol, relevant to the generation of the Triple-

962             17. Case 2: Internal, Random Generation - If the IV is generated internally at its
963                 entirety randomly, the Security Policy shall include a statement that the
964                 generation uses an Approved DRBG that is internal to the module’s boundary and
965                 the IV length is at least 96 bits (per SP 800-38D). [IG:C.H]
966             18. Case 3: Generated Deterministically - Human Operator Reset - There will be a
967                 human operator who will reset the IV to the last one used in case the module’s
968                 power is lost and then restored. (This condition is not enforced but shall be stated
969                 in the module’s Security Policy, under the “User Guide” heading.) [IG:C.H]
970             19. Case 3: Generated Deterministically - Power Lost and Restored - In case the
971                 module’s power is lost and then restored, a new key for use with the AES-GCM
972                 encryption/decryption shall be established. (This condition may or may not be
973                 enforced but shall be stated in the module’s Security Policy, under the “User

1115                 135rev1 and this KDF has not been validated by the CAVP, then the module’s
1116                 certificate shall not list this function. The module’s Security Policy shall make it
1117                 clear that the corresponding protocol shall not be used in an approved mode of
1118                 operation. [IG:D.C]

1125                 uses parts of the corresponding protocol(s) then no entry on the certificate’s
1126                 approved or allowed algorithms lines is required. As in the case considered above
1127                 (2), the Security Policy shall state that this protocol has not been reviewed or

2061           o SF Properties – If there are specific properties or characteristics associated with
2062               this SF implementation. This could include a reference to a specific Publication
2063               Section, IG, etc. This is where appropriate bit strength caveats should be included.
2064           o Algorithms – what Algorithms from the tested and allowed lists are part of the

2068                o A module can (and often does) have more than one implementation for a given
2069                   Security Function type
2070                        A KTS that uses an authenticated encryption mode vs. separate encryption
2071                           and authentication would both be KTS but would have two
2072                           implementation entries
2073                        A SigVer could be used for role/identity authentication and also for an
2074                           integrity test
2075                        Block Cipher could include modes for storage (XTS) or as part of a KTS
2076                        The same algorithm could be used with different key sizes to support
2077                           different sizes
2078                o For many modules, there would likely be one SFI for a SF type.
2079      •    Why these wouldn’t just map directly to Services
2080                o At times, these could map directly to services, particularly for modules like
2081                   software libraries.
2082                o Documenting in this manner will clarify which algorithms are actual services
2083                   provided and which are supporting or prerequisite
2084                o When the same category SF algorithms are used for different functions and
2085                   therefore different services, there should be separate SFIs. Many modules have
2086                   multiple DigSigVer implementations. For example, one for authentication during
2087                   an SSH connection and one for the module startup integrity test. These should be
2088                   separately defined as implementations and then mapped to different services.
2089                o Requiring the Services to map directly to the Security Functions seems to
2090                   overreach into the vendor’s design of their module. The Services and
2091                   corresponding level of granularity should be left to the vendor to determine.
2092      •    There should only be entries for top-level functions. For example, if SHA2-256 is only
2093           used for Hash DRBG, then it shouldn’t be included as a separate Secure Hash entry. And,
2094           if the DRBG is only a supporting function (for example, just a prerequisite to Symmetric
2095           Key Generation), then DRBG shouldn’t be a separate entry in this table. The Services
2096           table will include the Security Function Implementations, so often that will likely
2097           determine what is a top-level entry.
2098      •    All the supporting and prerequisite algorithms for that implementation would be included

                                     1. Defines a more detailed structure and organization for
                                        the Security Policy
                                     2. Captures Security Policy requirements that are defined
                                        outside of ISO/IEC 19790 and ISO/IEC 24759
                                     3. Builds the Security Policy document as a combination
                                        of the subsection information
                                     4. Generates the approved algorithm table based on
                                        lab/vendor selections from the algorithm tests
