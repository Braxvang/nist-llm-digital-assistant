Certain commercial equipment, instruments, software, or materials, commercial or non-commercial, are identified in
this paper in order to specify the experimental procedure adequately. Such identification does not imply
recommendation or endorsement of any product or service by NIST, nor does it imply that the materials or
equipment identified are necessarily the best available for the purpose.

There may be references in this publication to other publications currently under development by NIST in
accordance with its assigned statutory responsibilities. The information in this publication, including concepts and
methodologies, may be used by federal agencies even before the completion of such companion publications. Thus,
until each publication is completed, current requirements, guidelines, and procedures, where they exist, remain
operative. For planning and transition purposes, federal agencies may wish to closely follow the development of
these new publications by NIST.

Organizations are encouraged to review all draft publications during public comment periods and provide feedback
to NIST. Many NIST cybersecurity publications, other than the ones noted above, are available at

Authority
This publication has been developed by NIST in accordance with its statutory responsibilities under the Federal
Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) of 2014, 44 U.S.C. § 3551 et seq., Public Law (P.L.) 113-283.
NIST is responsible for developing information security standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements
for federal information systems, but such standards and guidelines shall not apply to national security systems
without the express approval of appropriate federal officials exercising policy authority over such systems. This
guideline is consistent with the requirements of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130.

Nothing in this publication should be taken to contradict the standards and guidelines made mandatory and binding
on federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory authority. Nor should these guidelines be
interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the Secretary of Commerce, Director of the OMB, or
any other federal official. This publication may be used by nongovernmental organizations on a voluntary basis and

Abstract
The approved sensitive security parameter generation and establishment methods listed in this

Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) 19790 Annex D and ISO/IEC 24759 paragraph 6.16,
within the context of the Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP). As a validation
authority, the CMVP may supersede Annex D in its entirety. This document also supersedes SP
800-140Dr1.

Reports on Computer Systems Technology
The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical
leadership for the Nation’s measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops tests, test
methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance
the development and productive use of information technology. ITL’s responsibilities include the
development of management, administrative, technical, and physical standards and guidelines for
the cost-effective security and privacy of other than national security-related information in
federal information systems. The Special Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research,
guidelines, and outreach efforts in information system security, and its collaborative activities
with industry, government, and academic organizations.

       Purpose
This document identifies CMVP-approved sensitive security parameter generation and
establishment methods. These are considered CMVP-approved security functions. It precludes
the use of all other sensitive security parameter generation and establishment methods.

       Sensitive security parameter generation and establishment methods
