100   The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and
101   Technology (NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical
102   leadership for the Nation’s measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops tests, test
103   methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance
104   the development and productive use of information technology. ITL’s responsibilities include the
105   development of management, administrative, technical, and physical standards and guidelines for
106   the cost-effective security and privacy of other than national security-related information in
107   federal information systems. The Special Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research,
108   guidelines, and outreach efforts in information system security, and its collaborative activities
109   with industry, government, and academic organizations.

110                                               Abstract

111   The increasing frequency, creativity, and severity of technology attacks means that all enterprises
112   should ensure that information and communication technology (ICT) risk is receiving
113   appropriate attention within their enterprise risk management (ERM) programs. Specific types of
114   ICT risk include, but are not limited to, cybersecurity, privacy, supply chain, and artificial
115   intelligence risk. This document provides a framework of outcomes that applies to all types of
116   ICT risk. It complements NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-221, Enterprise Impact of
117   Information and Communication Technology Risk, which focuses on the use of risk registers to
118   communicate and manage ICT risk.

135                                       Document Conventions

136   For the purposes of this publication, “assets” are defined as technologies that may compose an
137   information or communication system. The term “asset” or “assets” is used in multiple
138   frameworks and documents. Examples include laptop computers, desktop computers, servers,
139   sensors, data, mobile phones, tablets, routers, and switches. In instances where the authors mean
140   “assets” as they appear on a balance sheet, the word “asset” will be preceded by words such as
141   “high-level,” “balance sheet,” or “Level 1” to differentiate context.

142                                          Note to Reviewers

143   The authors are grateful for the feedback and support provided by the community in response to
144   draft publications. In support of the final edition of this report, NIST asks that readers review the
145   following questions and consider these in your feedback and recommendations.
146      1. Is this document a useful extension of the concepts in SP 800-221?
147      2. Is the framework comprehensive with respect to risk governance and risk management?
148         If not, what additional items should NIST consider?
149      3. Does the framework support and advance your current risk governance and risk
150         management practices? If not, what additional practices should NIST include?
151      4. Has this publication provided adequate explanation for how the framework might be used
152         with and support program risk frameworks (e.g., Cybersecurity Framework, Privacy
153         Framework)?
154      5. Does this publication effectively relate to both private- and public-sector enterprises
155         through its structure, terminologies, and examples?
156      6. Are there additional ICTRM/ERM-related topics that would be helpful to include in
157         future iterations of this publication?
158      7. Is the relationship between SP 800-221A and Cybersecurity and Privacy Reference Tool
159         (CPRT) (https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cprt) clear? Is CPRT a helpful supplement to SP
160         800-221A?

161                                        Call for Patent Claims

162   This public review includes a call for information on essential patent claims (claims whose use
163   would be required for compliance with the guidance or requirements in this Information
164   Technology Laboratory (ITL) draft publication). Such guidance and/or requirements may be
165   directly stated in this ITL Publication or by reference to another publication. This call also
166   includes disclosure, where known, of the existence of pending U.S. or foreign patent applications
167   relating to this ITL draft publication and of any relevant unexpired U.S. or foreign patents.

168   ITL may require from the patent holder, or a party authorized to make assurances on its behalf,
169   in written or electronic form, either:

170      a) assurance in the form of a general disclaimer to the effect that such party does not hold
171         and does not currently intend holding any essential patent claim(s); or

      INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT

172      b) assurance that a license to such essential patent claim(s) will be made available to
173         applicants desiring to utilize the license for the purpose of complying with the guidance
174         or requirements in this ITL draft publication either:

175             i.   under reasonable terms and conditions that are demonstrably free of any unfair
176                  discrimination; or
177            ii.   without compensation and under reasonable terms and conditions that are
178                  demonstrably free of any unfair discrimination.

179   Such assurance shall indicate that the patent holder (or third party authorized to make assurances
180   on its behalf) will include in any documents transferring ownership of patents subject to the
181   assurance, provisions sufficient to ensure that the commitments in the assurance are binding on
182   the transferee, and that the transferee will similarly include appropriate provisions in the event of
183   future transfers with the goal of binding each successor-in-interest.

184   The assurance shall also indicate that it is intended to be binding on successors-in-interest
185   regardless of whether such provisions are included in the relevant transfer documents.

186   Such statements should be addressed to: ictrm@nist.gov

202   ICT risk include, but are not limited to, cybersecurity, privacy, supply chain, and artificial
203   intelligence risk.

204   1.1       Purpose and Scope

205   This document provides a framework of outcomes that applies to all types of ICT risk. It
206   complements NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-221, Enterprise Impact of Information and
207   Communication Technology Risk [SP800221], which focuses on the use of risk registers to
208   communicate and manage ICT risk. Before reading this publication, you should first read NIST
209   SP 800-221 so that you understand the concepts and context for the information contained in the
210   framework of outcomes.

211   NIST has already defined outcome-based frameworks for several types of ICT risk, including the
212   Cybersecurity Framework [CSF], the Privacy Framework [PF], and the Secure Software
213   Development Framework [SSDF]. The outcomes in those frameworks are effectively more
214   specific instances of the outcomes in the more general framework defined in this publication.

215   1.2       Publication Contents

216   The remainder of this publication is organized into the following major sections:
217         •    Section 2 provides an overview of ICT processes as a context for ERM.

222   2     Information and Communications Technology Areas

223   ERM is the highest terminus of ICT risk management (ICTRM). As with NIST SP 800-221, the
224   processes described within this publication focus on ICTRM within, between, and across ICT
225   areas. ICTRM helps ensure that leaders and stakeholders are supported by a holistic risk
226   monitoring and communication model,
227   which is needed for the complexity of risks
228   at the enterprise level.

229   An ICT Risk Outcomes Framework (ROF)
230   is needed to support ICT risk escalation and
231   elevation, as well as reduce ICTRM
232   complexity. While the focus of many risk
233   management program frameworks is the
234   comprehensiveness of each program’s
235   controls, the ICT ROF focuses on the
236   comprehensiveness of overarching risk
237   governance and management. Specifically,
238   the ICT ROF enumerates distinct outcomes
239   associated with the ICTRM process
240   described in NIST SP 800-221 and
241   illustrated in Figure 1.

242   The risk governance outcomes of the ICT
243   ROF are meant to be applied at select levels
244   in a given organization. Typically, risk
245   governance will occur at the enterprise
246   level, and may also occur at the
247   organization level.
248   The risk management outcomes of the
249   ICT ROF may be applied at all levels in a
250   given organization. The risk management
251   outcomes are highly relevant to individual
252   risk management programs and may be
253   used alongside risk management program
254   frameworks.

255   3       ICT Risk Outcomes Framework (ROF)

256   This section defines the ICT ROF, a framework for integrating ICT risk with enterprise risk. The
257   ICT ROF is a set of desired outcomes and applicable references that are common across all types
258   of ICT risk. It provides a common language for understanding, managing, and expressing ICT
259   risk to internal and external stakeholders. It can be used to help identify and prioritize actions for
260   reducing ICT risk, and it is a tool for aligning policy, business, and technological approaches to
261   managing that risk. Using the framework for each type of ICT risk will help organizations
262   improve the quality and consistency of ICT risk information they provide as inputs to their ERM
263   programs. That, in turn, will help organizations address all forms of ICT risk more effectively in
264   their ERM.

265   The ICT ROF is comprised of the following components:
266       •    Functions organize ICT risk outcomes at their highest level. There are two Functions:
267               o Govern (GV): Develop and implement the organizational business logic for risk
268                 management, and ensure risk management is performed according to that business
269                 logic.
270               o Manage (MA): Continuously identify and address risks in accordance with the
271                 organization’s risk management policies, processes, and priorities.
272       •    Categories are the subdivisions of a Function into groups of ICT risk outcomes closely
273            tied to programmatic needs and particular activities. Examples of Categories include:
274               o Roles and Responsibilities (GV.RR)
275               o Risk Analysis (MA.RA)
276               o Risk Monitoring, Evaluation, and Adjustment (MA.RM)
277       •    Subcategories further divide a Category into specific outcomes of technical and/or
278            management activities. While not exhaustive, they help support achievement of the
279            outcomes in each Category. Examples of Subcategories include:
280               o GV.RR-1: Risk governance roles and responsibilities are established and
281                 communicated.
282               o MA.RA-1: The likelihood of each risk event is estimated using risk assessment
283                 techniques and probability models.
284               o MA.RM-4: When risk exceeds risk tolerance, changes to risk responses are
285                 identified and planned.
286       •    Informative Examples are one or more notional examples of how tools, processes, or
287            other methods could be used to help achieve a Subcategory. No examples or combination
288            of examples are required, and the stated examples are not the only feasible options. Some
289            examples may not be applicable to certain organizations and situations. Examples of
290            Informative Examples include:
291               o For GV.RR-1: An organization establishes which roles are responsible for
292                 documenting risk appetite and policy, as well as performing risk oversight.

293              o For MA.RA-1: Bayesian models, event tree analysis, or similar techniques are
294                used to determine the likelihood of a risk, and that information is recorded in the
295                Current Assessment – Likelihood field in a risk register.
296              o For MA.RM-4: KRIs are monitored to determine when risk exceeds risk
297                tolerance, resulting in updates to the risk register and planning of a revised risk
298                response, risk response type, risk response cost, and/or risk response description.
299      •   Informative References are specific sections of standards, guidelines, and practices that
300          illustrate a method to achieve the outcomes associated with each Subcategory. The
301          Informative References are intended to be illustrative and not exhaustive. To avoid
302          having to re-release this publication every time an Informative Reference is added or
303          updated, Informative References are omitted from this publication. Instead, they will be
304          held in NIST’s Online Informative References (OLIR) Catalog.

305   For ease of use, each Function, Category, and Subcategory is assigned a unique identifier. Table
306   1 lists the identifiers for the Functions and Categories to show the framework’s overall structure.
