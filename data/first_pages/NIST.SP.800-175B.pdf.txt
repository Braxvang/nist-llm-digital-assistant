This publication has been developed by NIST in accordance with its statutory responsibilities
under the Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) of 2014, 44 U.S.C. § 3551 et
seq., Public Law (P.L.) 113-283. NIST is responsible for developing information security
standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements for federal information systems, but
such standards and guidelines shall not apply to national security systems without the express
approval of appropriate federal officials exercising policy authority over such systems. This
guideline is consistent with the requirements of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
Circular A-130.

Nothing in this publication should be taken to contradict the standards and guidelines made
mandatory and binding on federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory
authority. Nor should these guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing
authorities of the Secretary of Commerce, Director of the OMB, or any other federal official.
This publication may be used by nongovernmental organizations on a voluntary basis and is not
subject to copyright in the United States. Attribution would, however, be appreciated by NIST.

an experimental procedure or concept adequately. Such identification is not intended to imply
recommendation or endorsement by NIST, nor is it intended to imply that the entities, materials, or

There may be references in this publication to other publications currently under development by NIST in
accordance with its assigned statutory responsibilities. The information in this publication, including
concepts and methodologies, may be used by federal agencies even before the completion of such
companion publications. Thus, until each publication is completed, current requirements, guidelines, and
procedures, where they exist, remain operative. For planning and transition purposes, federal agencies may
wish to closely follow the development of these new publications by NIST.
