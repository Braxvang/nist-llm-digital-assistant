                                                                                             other systems for their own trustworthiness. A system should be trustworthy by default with any

                                                                                             make it less vulnerable to attack. A corollary to this principle relates to the ability of the system
                                                                                             (or system element) to operate in isolation and then resynchronize with other components when it
