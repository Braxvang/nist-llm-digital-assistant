190      Document organization

191          General
192   Section 6.1 of this document specifies any modifications to ISO/IEC 19790 Annex B and
193   ISO/IEC 24759 section 6.14. Section 6.2 identifies any additional requirements for the Security
194   Policy that are documented in other publications. Section 6.3 provides descriptions of the
195   structure of the Security Policy and how the requirements in sections 6.1 and 6.2 map into that
196   structure. Appendix A indicates specific details for the module information that will be entered
197   in table format within the Web Cryptik application.

198          Modifications
199   Modifications to ISO/IEC 24759 section 6.14 - Cryptographic module security policy - will
200   follow a similar format as in ISO/IEC 24759. For additions to test requirements, new Test
201   Evidence (TEs) or Vendor Evidence (VEs) will be listed by increasing the “sequence_number.”
202   Modifications can include a combination of additions using underline and deletions using
203   strikethrough. If no changes are required, the paragraph will indicate “No change.”
204   ISO/IEC 19790 Annex B includes security policy requirements in bulleted form but does not
205   include ways to format the required information. Modifications are addressed by adding
206   formatting guidance (e.g., tables, images, etc.), adding underlined text, or using strikethrough for
207   deletion. If no changes are required, the paragraph will indicate “No change.” Additional
208   guidance may also be included to address requirements presented in SP 800-140, SP 800-140A,
209   SP 800-140C, SP 800-140D, SP 800-140E, and SP 800-140F.

210      Security requirements

211          Changes to ISO/IEC 24759 section 6.14 and ISO/IEC 19790 Annex B
212          Requirements
213   All requirements from ISO/IEC 24759 section 6.14 and ISO/IEC 19790 Annex B apply and are
214   required in the security policy as applicable.
215   ISO/IEC 19790 Annex B uses the same section naming convention as ISO/IEC 19790 section 7 -
216   Security requirements. For example, Annex B section B.2.1 is named “General” and B.2.2 is
217   named “Cryptographic module specification,” which is the same as ISO/IEC 19790 section 7.1
218   and section 7.2, respectively. Therefore, the format of the security policy shall be presented in
219   the same order as indicated in Annex B, starting with “General” and ending with “Mitigation of
220   other attacks.” If sections are not applicable, they shall be marked as such in the security policy.
221   ISO/IEC 24759 section 6.14 – Cryptographic module security policy requirements are modified
222   as indicated below:
223   No Change.

233          each version is represented separately or annotated that the representation is illustrated
234          for all versions. For a software or , firmware, hybrid, or a sub-chip cryptographic module,

303   These additional requirements are listed for each section of the Security Policy, grouped by the
304   source publication or document and reference the specific section from the document where the
305   requirement is stated. Where possible, they are direct statements from the source documents and

373          Documentation input, structure, and formatting
374   This section is intended to provide further guidance on what type of information is expected for a
375   specific requirement or set of requirements from Annex B and the additional requirements listed
376   in Section 6.2. All of the requirement statements are organized into appropriately named and
377   numbered sub-sections (i.e. 1.2- Security Levels, 2.1 – Purpose or Use). Each sub-section
378   identifies the applicable requirements and provides any clarifying and explanatory notes for that
379   sub-section.
380   A significant portion of the security policy information will be structured and interrelated. These
381   tables can be input through Web Cryptik or uploaded in JSON format which would follow a
382   provided schema and table relationship constraints.
383   The text/picture portions of the security policy will be entered into a provided Microsoft Word
384   template document, which follows a specific structure. Within this document are content controls
385   serving as placeholders for the structured content in Web Cryptik and/or the uploaded JSON file.
386   In this update to 140B and the corresponding update to Web Cryptik, the labs/vendors will be
387   selecting algorithms, modes, and properties from the sets that have been tested through the
388   CAVP process. This will replace the previous process of separately enter that information.
389   Part of the initial information labs/vendors enter into Web Cryptik will be the CAVP Certificate
390   numbers associated with the algorithm tests for that particular module. Web Cryptik will then
391   retrieve and display the relevant information from the CAVP system. Each algorithm/operational
392   environment entry will be listed, along with the set of properties for that test. The lab/vendor will
393   then select the specific items that are implemented in the module. When algorithms are tested in
394   multiple operating environments, they will each have a separate entry in the list.
395   The selected subset will be saved, maintained with the rest of the module’s information, and used
396   to generate the Tested Algorithm table in the Security Policy.
397   All this information (the structured JSON, the uploaded document, and the selected CAVP test
398   information) will be combined into the final security policy and provided as a PDF file. Any
399   changes to the security policy would require making changes to the corresponding source and
400   generating a new version.

1441              o Algorithm Properties – If a subset of the available properties are used, specify.
1442      •   What is meant by Implementations of Security Functions
1443              o A module can (and often does) have more than one implementation for a given
1444                Security Function type
1445                           A KTS that uses an authenticated encryption mode vs. separate encryption
1446                            and authentication would both be KTS but would have two
1447                            implementation entries
1448                           A SigVer could be used for role/identity authentication and also for an
1449                            integrity test
1450                           Block Cipher could include modes for storage (XTS) or as part of a KTS
1451                           The same algorithm could be used with different key sizes to support
1452                            different sizes
1453              o For many modules, there would likely be one SFI for a SF type.
1454      •   Why these wouldn’t just map directly to Services
1455              o At times, these could map directly to services, particularly for modules like
1456                software libraries.
1457              o Documenting in this manner will clarify which algorithms are actual services
1458                provided and which are supporting or prerequisite
1459              o When the same category SF algorithms are used for different functions and
1460                therefore different services, there should be separate SFIs. Many modules have
1461                multiple DigSigVer implementations. For example, one for authentication during
1462                an SSH connection and one for the module startup integrity test. These should be
1463                separately defined as implementations and then mapped to different services.
1464              o Requiring the Services to map directly to the Security Functions seems to
1465                overreach into the vendor’s design of their module. The Services and
1466                corresponding level of granularity should be left to the vendor to determine.
1467      •   There should only be entries for top-level functions. For example, if SHA2-256 is only
1468          used for Hash DRBG, then it shouldn’t be included as a separate Secure Hash entry. And,
1469          if the DRBG is only a supporting function (for example, just a prerequisite to Symmetric
1470          Key Generation), then DRBG shouldn’t be a separate entry in this table. The Services
1471          table will include the Security Function Implementations, so often that will likely
1472          determine what is a top-level entry.
1473      •   All the supporting and prerequisite algorithms for that implementation would be included
1474          in the Algorithms column.
1475      •   Every tested and allowed algorithm should be included somewhere in this table.

         Edition            Date           Change
                                          This revision introduces four significant changes to SP 800-
         Revision 1         [date]
         (r1)                             140B:
                                             1. Defines a more detailed structure and organization for
                                                 the Security Policy
                                             2. Captures Security Policy requirements that are defined
                                                 outside of ISO/IEC 19790 and ISO/IEC 24759
                                             3. Builds the Security Policy document as a combination
                                                 of the subsection information
                                             4. Generates the approved algorithm table based on
                                                 lab/vendor selections from the algorithm tests
1678
1679   In October 2022, the following changes were made to the document for the second public draft:
1680      •   Section 6.1 – Included additional changes to ISO/IEC 19790 Annex B requirements in
1681          the following sub-sections:
1682               o B.2.2 Cryptographic module specification – added TOEPP description
1683               o B.2.9 Sensitive security parameters management – updated SSP wording and
1684                 specified SSP storage techniques.
1685      •   Section 6.2 – Removed references to security policy requirements included in
1686          Implementation Guidance. These will be identified and tracked separately.
1687      •   Section 6.3
1688               o Simplified security policy document structure by combining and reordering
1689                 subsections.
1690               o Changed input method for rich text sections of the security policy from entering
1691                 subsections separately in Web Cryptik to including them directly in a template
1692                 document.
1693               o Indicated which subsections and columns are optional
1694               o Removed Implementation Guidance requirements specifications (see item above).
1695                 Note that these requirements remain applicable but will be identified and tracked
1696                 separately.
1697               o Added tables to Appendix A
1698                           Executable Code Sets – Software/Firmware/Hybrid (2.3)
1699                           Modes of Operation (2.5)
1700               o Changed tables in Appendix A
1701                           Operating Environments – Hardware (2.3)
1702                           Operating Environments – Software/Firmware/Hybrid (2.3)
