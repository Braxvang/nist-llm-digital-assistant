Executive Summary

The Homeland Security Presidential Directive HSPD-12 called for new standards to be adopted
governing the interoperable use of identity credentials to allow physical and logical access to Federal
government locations and systems. The Personal Identity Verification (PIV) for Federal Employees and
Contractors, (Federal Information Processing Standard 201 (FIPS 201)) was developed to establish
standards for identity credentials. This document, Special Publication 800-87 (SP 800-87), provides the
organizational codes necessary to establish the Federal Agency Smart Credential Number (FASC-N) that
is required to be included in the FIPS 201 Card Holder Unique Identifier (CHUID) and is a companion
document to FIPS 201.

1     Introduction

1.1   Authority

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed this document in furtherance of its
statutory responsibilities under the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002,
Public Law 107-347.

NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements, for
providing adequate information security for all agency operations and assets; but such standards and
guidelines shall not apply to national security systems. This guideline is consistent with the requirements
of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Section 8b(3), “Securing Agency
Information Systems,” as analyzed in A-130, Appendix IV: Analysis of Key Sections. Supplemental
information is provided in A-130, Appendix III.

This guideline has been prepared for use by federal agencies. It may be used by nongovernmental
organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright, though attribution is desired.

Nothing in this document should be taken to contradict standards and guidelines made mandatory and
binding on federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory authority, nor should these
guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the Secretary of Commerce,
Director of the OMB, or any other federal official.

1.2   Purpose and Scope

This publication, Codes for the Identification of Federal and Federally Assisted Organizations, provides a
four-character identifier for each organization listed. The set of identifiers defines a standard data
element. The two leftmost characters form a component data element which is identical with the two-digit
numerical code used in the federal budgetary process to identify major federal organizations. This
component, designated as the Treasury Agency Symbol (TAS), is maintained by the U.S. Department of
the Treasury; and the National Archives and Records Administration legislatively owns the records.

The purposes of data element standardization are to eliminate unnecessary duplications and
incompatibilities in the collection, processing, and dissemination of data, and to maximize the usefulness
of data resources. The use of data referenced to a standard set of representations or codes reduces
collection costs by allowing previously collected data to be applied to new uses, and provides a potential
for benefits derived from those additional applications. Standardization also reduces conversion costs for
interchange of data between databases, and reduces costs of data element maintenance by the
implementation of a single, maintained standard to replace separately maintained elements.

1.3   Maintenance Organization

The maintenance organization for codes for the identification of federal and federally assisted
organizations is the Governments Division, Bureau of the Census, Washington, D.C. in coordination with
the General Services Administration and the Departments of Homeland Security and Commerce. Federal
departments and independent agencies are invited to assist in the maintenance of this publication by
submitting copies of newly implemented tables of organization that affect any listing. Such changes
should be submitted to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) through the online
request form located at http://piv.nist.gov/.

CODES FOR THE IDENTIFICATION OF FEDERAL AND FEDERALLY ASSISTED ORGANIZATIONS



1.4   Applicability

This publication applies to data interchange among executive departments and independent agencies and
for federal data interchange with the non-federal sector including industry, State, local, and other
Governments, and the public at large.

This standard data element may be used for the interchange of information on federal operations when
that information is identified by organization. Information interchanged may concern, for example:
number of personnel employed, value of contracts and grants issued, value of services of an identical type
received from a single source, inventoried quantity of a particular item, and value and identity of property
managed or controlled. The data element need not be used to record information on federal operations of
unlisted, lower-level organizations. The data element may be used if lower-level data are aggregated to
the level of organizations identified in this Special Publication.

This standard data element also may be used for interchange of identification codes assigned to a set of
similar items, but only if an organizational indication is included as part of the coding structure. Examples
of sets of items which could employ organizational-indicative identification codes are: the Federal
Agency Smart Credential Number (FASC-N) that is required to be included in the FIPS 201 Card Holder-
Unique ID (CHUID), the set of identities of federal reports and computer programs that are available for
public use or distribution, the set of identities of domestic assistance programs for which a prospective
recipient might apply, and the set of identities of grants and contracts awarded. If organizational
identification is used but is not fully appropriate below the first level, then only the two leftmost
characters of the standard data element (the TAS) should be used. Agencies may wish to use the Standard
in applications other than those suggested above. However, this publication is not intended for the
replacement of U.S. Department of the Treasury agency location and appropriation fund account codes.

1.5   Organizational Structure

This publication provides a four-character identifier for each organization listed. The set of identifiers
defines a standard data element. The major set of categories used to distinguish groups of organizations in
this publication is the following:

            Legislative Branch,
            Judicial Branch,
            Executive Office and Departments (and their Associated Organizations)
            Other Independent federal and Quasi-federal Organizations (and their Associated
            Organizations)
            Independent federal-State and Interstate Organizations
            International Organizations.
Organizational structure is described and encoded in this publication in a manner consistent with the
budgetary structure of the U.S. Government. Consistency with the budgetary structure has been
maintained in order to permit the adoption, in every case, of the two-digit numerical code used in the
budgetary process to identify most first-level, independent federal organizations. This coding system is
maintained by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Designated as the Treasury Agency Symbol (TAS), it
serves as the two leftmost characters of the organization code used in this publication.




                                                      2
                                 CODES FOR THE IDENTIFICATION OF FEDERAL AND FEDERALLY ASSISTED ORGANIZATIONS



All first-level organizations in each of the above categories are listed in this publication. A first-level
organization is not subsumed hierarchically under any other organization. Second-level organizations are
included with the Executive Office, executive departments, and certain other major agencies. Third- and
lower-level organizations are included only in the Department of Defense and in special situations in
other departments. Second-, third-, and lower-level organizations are always subsumed hierarchically
under a next-higher-level organization.

In this publication, an "independent" organization is defined as having both hierarchical independence
and budgetary independence, i.e., it is first-level (hierarchical independence) and has a budget which is
not subsumed by or connected in a subsidiary manner with the budget of another organization (budgetary
independence). An "associated" organization is first-level, but has no budgetary independence. The five
types of associated organizations are:

            Associated federal Organizations, which are federal agencies or their ancillary units such as
            advisory committees; they are often included as part of the independent organizations to
            which they are related
            Associated federal-State Organizations, which are associated organizations in which the
            federal Government and one or more States participate jointly
            Government-Sponsored Enterprises, which are so identified in a separate section of the
            Budget of the United States Government, Appendix (referred to as The Budget)
            Federally Aided Organizations, which are domestic and non-federal, and are identified in The
            Budget as receiving some form of financial support such as a direct payment, loan guarantee,
            line of credit, or stock purchase arrangement
            International Organizations, identified in The Budget or in the Department of State's annual
            report of United States Contributions to International Organizations as organizations in which
            the federal Government serves as a financial contributor.
A "quasi-federal" organization is an organization that is listed as "quasi-official" in the U.S. Government
Manual and is also assigned its own unique TAS code by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. An
"interstate" organization included in this publication is federally assisted but differs from a federal-State
organization in that it involves no federal participation.

Associated organizations and organizations below the first level usually carry the same TAS as the
independent, first-level organization with which they are connected. Organizations having the same TAS
are distinguished from each other by the two rightmost characters of the identifier. These characters are
alphanumeric, although numeric characters are being used at this time in most cases. The system used for
assignment of the two rightmost characters of the identifier is explained below in Section 4: Special
Information.

2     Specifications: Table of Organizations and Codes

2.1   Part A: Arrangement by Hierarchical and Budgetary Relationship

In this part, names of first-level organizations are presented immediately to the right of the assigned codes
without an indentation.

Second-level organizations are listed immediately below the first-level organization to which they report
and are indented further to the right. Second-level organizations which subdivide a first-level organization
form a complete, non-duplicative set, i.e., each employee of the first-level organization can be assigned to
one and only one second-level entry.

Third- and lower-level organizations are indented further to the right than their respective next-higher
level entries, and they are listed immediately below the entry that they subdivide. Third- and lower-level
entries, similarly, form a complete, non-duplicative set.

At any level for which entries are provided, some subdivisions may not be individually identified. Those
divisions not specifically listed are included by implication, as in "Office of the Assistant Secretary for
Health except National Centers."

Each domestic, associated organization is listed with the independent organization with which its
financial or administrative support is connected. International organizations are listed in a separate
section.

2.2   Part B: Arrangement by Alphanumeric Sequence of Assigned Codes

Part B is a listing of organizations and codes arranged by alphanumeric sequence of codes.

3     Qualifications

Non-federal organizations which receive no assistance identified in the federal budget were excluded
from the requirements of this Special Publication. Users desiring a compatible code assignment to an
initially excluded organization have two alternatives. Users may assign their own four-character code,
preferably with a letter as the leftmost character to avoid possible conflict with the numerical TAS, or
they can submit their request to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) through the
online request form located at http://piv.nist.gov/, for a formal assignment of a code. Requests should
include an explanation of the application requiring the assignment. NIST will forward requests to the
maintenance agency and will issue change notices for this Special Publication as appropriate.

CODES FOR THE IDENTIFICATION OF FEDERAL AND FEDERALLY ASSISTED ORGANIZATIONS



4     Special Information

The coding structure in this publication is based on the establishment of four active classes of TAS codes.
The assignments of the two rightmost characters of the identifier differ in each of the classes and are
described below.

            Defense TAS Codes
The following TAS codes are used to identify component organizations of the Department of Defense:

        17: Department of the Navy;
        21: Department of the Army;
        57: Department of the Air Force;
        84: U.S. Soldiers' and Airmen's Home;
        96: U.S. Corps of Engineers--(civil); and
        97: Department of Defense as a whole and components, other than the military department,
            reporting to the Secretary of Defense.

Values of the two rightmost characters of the identifier for all component organizations of the Department
of Defense (DoD) are received from the Directorate for Information Resources Management Systems,
Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Comptroller). DoD assigns their own codes, usually
alphabetic (can be numeric).

            Joint-Use TAS Codes
Several non-Defense, independent organizations share certain TAS codes. These organizations are fully
distinguished at the first level by the third and fourth characters of the identifier. The TAS codes in this
class, and their applications, are:

        00: Senate and House of Representatives;
        09: Smaller Legislative Agencies;
        10: Judicial Agencies;
        46: Independent federal-State and Interstate Organizations (excepting Advisory Commission on
            Intergovernmental Relations);
        48: Temporary Study Commissions;
        76: Historical and Memorial Agencies; and
        95: Other Independent Organizations Not Assigned Unique TAS Codes.

Values of the two rightmost characters for independent agencies in this TAS class are in the range 01
through 59. For values of the two rightmost characters for associated organization in this TAS class, see
below under "Single-Use TAS Codes."

            TAS Code 11: Executive Office of the President/Funds Appropriated to the President
The Executive Office of the President is assigned identifier 1100, and agencies within the 0ffice are
assigned identifiers in the range of 1101 through 1130. The office of the Vice President is assigned 1160.

Agencies that come under the "Funds Appropriated to the President" (FAP) in the federal Budget also are
assigned TAS code 11. Currently, two different ranges are used for the two rightmost characters for these
FAP agencies. Agencies that are international in scope, such as the Multilateral Development Banks, are
assigned alphabetic characters consistent with other international agencies. Other FAP agencies, such as



                                                      6
                                 CODES FOR THE IDENTIFICATION OF FEDERAL AND FEDERALLY ASSISTED ORGANIZATIONS



the Peace Corps, are assigned numerics for the two rightmost characters. These currently range from 31 to
62.

Users should note two exceptions about FAP agencies. First, the International Development Corporation
Agency (IDCA) is assigned identifier 1150, and its second level organizations are assigned identifiers in
the range 1151 to 1159. The IDCA is related to the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), but
the latter retains TAS code 71, even though it is listed in the federal Budget as an FAP agency. Thus, the
IDCA does not include OPIC in this standard. Secondly, not all FAP accounts found in the federal Budget
have a FIPS 95 code assignment. FIPS 95 is an organizational code set, and does not automatically
include all fiscal activities represented in Budget accounts.

For values of the two rightmost characters of the identifier for associated organizations using TAS code
11, see below under "Single-Use TAS Codes." This class of TAS codes includes all codes that are active
(i.e., in current use) and not identified above in another class. As implied in the class name, an
independent organization using a TAS code in this class does not share that TAS code with any other
independent organization. Second-level, third-level, and associated organizations may be included in this
class and will use the same TAS codes as their respective independent organizations.

For each TAS code in this class, the two rightmost characters of the identifier are available to be assigned
as follows, if an organization with the appropriate name is separately identified:

        00: organization as a whole (always present);
        01: office of the chief executive and any staff functions not separately identified;
        02: office of the deputy chief executive;
        03: office of the general counsel or equivalent;
        04: office of the inspector general;
        05: office of administration or management, if no "planning" or "policy" functions are included
             in the name;
        06: office of policy, evaluation, or program analysis, including any "budget" functions not
             included in "administration" or "management";
        07: office of Congressional and legislative affairs; may include public or intergovernmental
             affairs if not separately identified;
        08: office of public affairs, if identified separately from Congressional and legislative affairs;
        09: office of international affairs;
        10 through 29: other staff offices;
        30 through 59: programmatic or line organizations, and all of their separately
           identified, lower-level components;
        60 through 69: Associated federal Organizations;
        70 through 79: Associated federal-State Organizations;
        80 through 89: Government-Sponsored Enterprises;
        90 through 99: Federally Aided Organizations; and
        AA through ZZ: International Organizations.

For the assignment of the two rightmost characters to international organizations, groupings of such
organizations have been established. The third character of the identifier is the same for each organization
in a group. This permits recognition of an identifier as pertaining to a particular group. For example, inter-
American organizations have the two rightmost characters of their identifiers in the range AA through
AZ; international fisheries organizations are assigned the range FA through FZ, while United Nations and
affiliated agencies are assigned the range UA through UZ. This procedure for assigning the two rightmost
characters of the identifier is used for each international organization, regardless of the TAS code
assigned to the organization.

If expansion of the coding structure is required due to saturation, the fourth or rightmost character of the
identifier will be converted to an alphanumeric for staff, line, and domes associated organizations under
Single-Use TAS Codes. Then, more identifiers for these types of organizations would be available. For
example, in this expansion, the two rightmost characters of identifiers for line organizations under Single-
Use TAS Codes could include code 2A through 5Z as well as 20 through 59, while the two rightmost
characters for associated federal organizations could include codes 6A through 6Z as well as 60 through
69. This expansion could apply, in a similar fashion, to the coding structure for domestic organization
under TAS code 11 or the Joint-Use TAS Codes.
