This publication has been developed by NIST in accordance with its statutory responsibilities under the
Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) of 2014, 44 U.S.C. § 3551 et seq., Public Law
(P.L.) 113-283. NIST is responsible for developing information security standards and guidelines,
including minimum requirements for federal information systems, but such standards and guidelines shall
not apply to national security systems without the express approval of appropriate federal officials
exercising policy authority over such systems. This guideline is consistent with the requirements of the
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130.

Nothing in this publication should be taken to contradict the standards and guidelines made mandatory
and binding on federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory authority. Nor should
these guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the Secretary of
Commerce, Director of the OMB, or any other federal official. This publication may be used by
nongovernmental organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright in the United States.
Attribution would, however, be appreciated by NIST.

Certain commercial entities, equipment, or materials may be identified in this document in order to describe an
experimental procedure or concept adequately. Such identification is not intended to imply recommendation or
endorsement by NIST, nor is it intended to imply that the entities, materials, or equipment are necessarily the best
available for the purpose.
There may be references in this publication to other publications currently under development by NIST in
accordance with its assigned statutory responsibilities. The information in this publication, including concepts and
methodologies, may be used by federal agencies even before the completion of such companion publications. Thus,
until each publication is completed, current requirements, guidelines, and procedures, where they exist, remain
operative. For planning and transition purposes, federal agencies may wish to closely follow the development of
these new publications by NIST.

                                                                                                   1. Individual components may be developed outside of an SCAP data stream where the linking to
                                                                                                      other components is not necessarily known at the time the component is created.
                                                                                                   2. The SCAP source data stream creates links between different components that were not
                                                                                                      necessarily designed to reference each other. For example, XCCDF was not designed to reference
                                                                                                      a particular checking system; it can reference OVAL, OCIL, and other checking systems.

                                                                                               consider two policy recommendations. One is that a particular piece of software be installed, and the
                                                                                               second that another piece of software not be installed. Both rules for these policy recommendations could
                                                                                               use the same CPE entry in their <xccdf:ident> elements. However, because the interpretation of a
                                                                                               CPE entry is that a “pass” result indicates software was installed, the second policy recommendation’s
                                                                                               rule would violate this. This can be corrected by using the @con:negate attribute, a Boolean attribute
                                                                                               that inverts the rule result. The second rule could check for the software being installed and then negate
                                                                                               that result, thus giving a result consistent in meaning with the first rule. For rules that cannot have their

                                                                                               entry corresponding to the recommendation. Rules that do not use <xccdf:ident> elements have no

                                                                                               •   Confidentiality. SCAP does not define any mechanisms for protecting the confidentiality of SCAP

                                                                                                   validation, and for stronger assurance may choose not to use any content that has not been signed.
