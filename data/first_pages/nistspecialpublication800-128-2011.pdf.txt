                                                 Authority

This publication has been developed by NIST to further its statutory responsibilities under the
Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), Public Law (P.L.) 107-347. NIST is
responsible for developing information security standards and guidelines, including minimum
requirements for federal information systems, but such standards and guidelines shall not apply to
national security systems without the express approval of appropriate federal officials exercising
policy authority over such systems. This guideline is consistent with the requirements of the
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Section 8b(3), Securing Agency
Information Systems, as analyzed in Circular A-130, Appendix IV: Analysis of Key Sections.
Supplemental information is provided in Circular A-130, Appendix III.

Nothing in this publication should be taken to contradict the standards and guidelines made
mandatory and binding on federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory
authority. Nor should these guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing
authorities of the Secretary of Commerce, Director of the OMB, or any other federal official.
This publication may be used by nongovernmental organizations on a voluntary basis and is not
subject to copyright in the United States. Attribution would, however, be appreciated by NIST.

                     Compliance with NIST Standards and Guidelines

In accordance with the provisions of FISMA, 1 the Secretary of Commerce shall, on the basis of
standards and guidelines developed by NIST, prescribe standards and guidelines pertaining to
federal information systems. The Secretary shall make standards compulsory and binding to the
extent determined necessary by the Secretary to improve the efficiency of operation or security of
federal information systems. Standards prescribed shall include information security standards
that provide minimum information security requirements and are otherwise necessary to improve
the security of federal information and information systems.
     •    Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) are approved by the Secretary of
          Commerce and issued by NIST in accordance with FISMA. FIPS are compulsory and
          binding for federal agencies. 2 FISMA requires that federal agencies comply with these
          standards, and therefore, agencies may not waive their use.
     •    Special Publications (SPs) are developed and issued by NIST as recommendations and
          guidance documents. For other than national security programs and systems, federal
          agencies must follow those NIST Special Publications mandated in a Federal Information
          Processing Standard. FIPS 200 mandates the use of Special Publication 800-53, as
          amended. In addition, OMB policies (including OMB Reporting Instructions for FISMA
          and Agency Privacy Management) state that for other than national security programs
          and systems, federal agencies must follow certain specific NIST Special Publications. 3
     •    Other security-related publications, including interagency reports (NISTIRs) and ITL
          Bulletins, provide technical and other information about NIST's activities. These
          publications are mandatory only when specified by OMB.
     •    Compliance schedules for NIST security standards and guidelines are established by
          OMB in policies, directives, or memoranda (e.g., annual FISMA Reporting Guidance).

 The E-Government Act (P.L. 107-347) recognizes the importance of information security to the economic and
national security interests of the United States. Title III of the E-Government Act, entitled the Federal Information
Security Management Act (FISMA), emphasizes the need for organizations to develop, document, and implement an
organization-wide program to provide security for the information systems that support its operations and assets.
2
 The term agency is used in this publication in lieu of the more general term organization only in those circumstances
where its usage is directly related to other source documents such as federal legislation or policy.
3
  While federal agencies are required to follow certain specific NIST Special Publications in accordance with OMB
policy, there is flexibility in how agencies apply the guidance. Federal agencies should apply the security concepts and
principles articulated in the NIST Special Publications in accordance with and in the context of the agency’s missions,
business functions, and environment of operation. Consequently, the application of NIST guidance by federal agencies
can result in different security solutions that are equally acceptable, compliant with the guidance, and meet the OMB
definition of adequate security for federal information systems. Given the high priority of information sharing and
transparency with the federal government, agencies should also consider reciprocity in developing their information
security solutions. When assessing federal agency compliance with NIST Special Publications, Inspectors General,
evaluators, auditors, and assessors should consider the intent of the security concepts and principles articulated within
the specific guidance document and how the agency applied the guidance in the context of its mission/business
responsibilities, operational environment, and unique organizational conditions.

CHAPTER ONE

INTRODUCTION
THE NEED FOR CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT TO PROTECT INFORMATION AND INFORMATION
      SYSTEMS



A      n information system is composed of many components 4 that can be interconnected in a
       multitude of arrangements to meet a variety of business, mission, and information security
       needs. How these information system components are networked, configured, and
managed is critical in providing adequate information security and supporting an organization’s
risk management process.

An information system is typically in a constant state of change in response to new, enhanced,
corrected, or updated hardware and software capabilities, patches for correcting software flaws
and other errors to existing components, new security threats, changing business functions, etc.
Implementing information system changes almost always results in some adjustment to the
system configuration. To ensure that the required adjustments to the system configuration do not
adversely affect the security of the information system or the organization from operation of the
information system, a well-defined configuration management process that integrates information
security is needed.

Organizations apply configuration management (CM) for establishing baselines and for tracking,
controlling, and managing many aspects of business development and operation (e.g., products,
services, manufacturing, business processes, and information technology). Organizations with a
robust and effective CM process need to consider information security implications with respect
to the development and operation of information systems including hardware, software,
applications, and documentation. Effective CM of information systems requires the integration of
the management of secure configurations into the organizational CM process or processes. For
this reason, this document assumes that information security is an integral part of an
organization’s overall CM process; however, the focus of this document is on implementation of
the information system security aspects of CM, and as such the term security-focused
configuration management (SecCM) is used to emphasize the concentration on information
security. Though both IT business application functions and security-focused practices are
expected to be integrated as a single process, SecCM in this context is defined as the management
and control of configurations for information systems to enable security and facilitate the
management of information security risk.

1.1       PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY
Federal agencies are responsible for “including policies and procedures that ensure compliance
with minimally acceptable system configuration requirements, as determined by the agency”
within their information security program. 5 Managing system configurations is also a minimum
security requirement identified in FIPS 200, 6 and NIST SP 800-53 7 defines security controls that
support this requirement.

4
 Information system components include, for example, mainframes, workstations, servers (e.g., database, electronic
mail, authentication, Web, proxy, file, domain name), network components (e.g., firewalls, routers, gateways, voice and
data switches, wireless access points, network appliances, sensors), operating systems, middleware, and applications.

________________________________________________________________________________________________


In addition to general guidelines for ensuring that security considerations are integrated into the
CM process, this publication provides guidelines for implementation of the Configuration
Management family of security controls defined in NIST SP 800-53 (CM-1 through CM-9). This
publication also includes guidelines for NIST SP 800-53 security controls related to managing the
configuration of the information system architecture and associated components for secure
processing, storing, and transmitting of information. Configuration management is an important
process for establishing and maintaining secure information system configurations, and provides
important support for managing security risks in information systems.

The guidelines in this publication are applicable to all federal information systems other than
those systems designated as national security systems as defined in 44 U.S.C., Section 3542. The
guidelines have been broadly developed from a technical perspective to complement similar
guidelines for national security systems and may be used for such systems with the approval of
appropriate federal officials exercising policy authority over such systems. State, local, and tribal
governments, as well as private sector organizations are encouraged to consider using these
guidelines, as appropriate.

This publication is intended to provide guidelines for organizations responsible for managing and
administrating the security of federal information systems and associated environments of
operation. For organizations responsible for the security of information processed, stored, and
transmitted by external or service-oriented environments (e.g., cloud service providers), the
configuration management concepts and principles presented here can aid organizations in
establishing assurance requirements for suppliers providing external information technology
services.

1.2     TARGET AUDIENCE
This publication is intended to serve a diverse audience of information system and information
security professionals including:

•     Individuals with information system and information security management and oversight
      responsibilities (e.g., chief information officers, senior agency information security officers,
      and authorizing officials);

•     Individuals with information system development responsibilities (e.g., program and project
      managers, mission/application owners, system designers, system and application
      programmers);

•     Individuals with information security implementation and operational responsibilities (e.g.,
      information system owners, information owners, information system administrators,
      information system security officers); and

•     Individuals with information system and information security assessment and monitoring
      responsibilities (e.g., auditors, Inspectors General, assessors/assessment teams).

Commercial companies producing information technology products and systems, creating
information security-related technologies, and providing information security services can also
benefit from the information in this publication.

1.3     RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER SECURITY PUBLICATIONS
Configuration management concepts and principles described in this publication provide
supporting information for NIST SP 800-53, Recommended Security Controls for Federal
Information Systems and Organizations, as amended. This publication also provides important
supporting information for the Implement Step (Step 3), Assess Step (Step 4), and the Monitor
Step (Step 6) of the Risk Management Framework (RMF) that is discussed in NIST SP 800-37,
Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems: A Security
Life Cycle Approach, as amended. More specific guidelines on the implementation of the Monitor
step of the RMF is provided in Draft NIST SP 800-137, Information Security Continuous
Monitoring for Federal Information Systems and Organizations. The purpose of the Monitor step
in the Risk Management Framework is to continuously monitor the effectiveness of all security
controls selected, implemented, and authorized for protecting organizational information and
information systems, which includes the Configuration Management security controls identified
in SP 800-53. The monitoring phase identified in the security-focused configuration management
(SecCM) process defined later in this document supports the RMF Monitoring phase by
providing specific activities associated with the monitoring of the information system structural
architecture and the configuration settings of the software and hardware that operate in that
system architecture.

Many of the SecCM concepts and principles described in this publication draw upon the
underlying principles established for managing information security risk in NIST SP 800-39,
Managing Information Security Risk: Organization, Mission, and Information System View.

This publication often refers to information from NIST SP 800-70, National Checklist Program

CHAPTER TWO

THE FUNDAMENTALS
BASIC CONCEPTS OF SECURITY CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT




T      his chapter presents the fundamentals of security-focused configuration management
       (SecCM) including: (i) an overview of basic configuration management terms and
       concepts, and the role of SecCM; (ii) the primary phases of SecCM; (iii) SecCM concepts;
and (iv) the roles and responsibilities relevant to SecCM.

2.1 OVERVIEW
This section provides an overview of SecCM including its importance in managing
organizational risks from information systems, the basic terms associated with configuration
management, and characterization of SecCM within the configuration management discipline.

2.1.1    BASIC CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT

Configuration management has been applied to a broad range of products and systems in subject
areas such as automobiles, pharmaceuticals, and information systems. Some basic terms
associated with the configuration management discipline are briefly explained below.

Configuration Management (CM) comprises a collection of activities focused on establishing and
maintaining the integrity of products and systems, through control of the processes for
initializing, changing, and monitoring the configurations of those products and systems.

A Configuration Item (CI) is an identifiable part of a system (e.g., hardware, software, firmware,
documentation, or a combination thereof) that is a discrete target of configuration control
processes.

A Baseline Configuration is a set of specifications for a system, or CI within a system, that has
been formally reviewed and agreed on at a given point in time, and which can be changed only
through change control procedures. The baseline configuration is used as a basis for future builds,
releases, and/or changes.

A Configuration Management Plan (CM Plan) is a comprehensive description of the roles,
responsibilities, policies, and procedures that apply when managing the configuration of products
and systems. The basic parts of a CM Plan include:

 − Configuration Control Board (CCB) – Establishment of and charter for a group of qualified
    people with responsibility for the process of controlling and approving changes throughout
    the development and operational lifecycle of products and systems; may also be referred to as
    a change control board;

  − Configuration Item Identification – methodology for selecting and naming configuration
    items that need to be placed under CM;

 − Configuration Change Control – process for managing updates to the baseline configurations
   for the configuration items; and

     − Configuration Monitoring – process for assessing or testing the level of compliance with the
       established baseline configuration and mechanisms for reporting on the configuration status
       of items placed under CM.

This guideline is associated with the application of security-focused configuration management
practices as they apply to information systems. The configuration of an information system is a
representation of the system’s components, how each component is configured, and how the
components are connected or arranged to implement the information system. The possible
conditions in which an information system or system component can be arranged affect the
security posture of the information system. The activities involved in managing the configuration
of an information system include development of a configuration management plan,
establishment of a configuration control board, development of a methodology for configuration
item identification, establishment of the baseline configuration, development of a configuration
change control process, and development of a process for configuration monitoring and reporting.

2.1.2      THE CHALLENGE OF PROTECTING INFORMATION AND MANAGING RISK

As the ubiquity of information technology increases the dependence on information systems,
organizations are faced with an increase in the number and severity of threats that can have
adverse impacts on operations, assets, and individuals. Given the potential for harm that can arise
from environmental disruptions, human errors, and purposeful attacks by hostile entities and other
threats, an organization must place greater emphasis on the management of risk associated with
information systems as it attempts to carry out its mission and business processes. The
cornerstone of any effort to manage organizational risk related to information systems is an
effective information security 8 program.

It is incumbent upon the organization to implement its directives in a manner that provides
adequate security 9 for protecting information and information systems. As threats continue to
evolve in an environment where organizations have finite resources with which to protect
themselves, security has become a risk-based activity where the operational and economic costs
of ensuring that a particular threat does not exploit a vulnerability are balanced against the needs
of the organization’s mission and business processes. In a world of limited resources, the practice
of risk management is fundamental to an information security program.

In risk-based mission protection strategies, organizations explicitly identify and respond to risks
associated with the use of information systems in carrying out missions and business processes.
Careful consideration is given to how a range of diverse threats can expose existing
vulnerabilities and cause harm to the organization. In the management of risk, organizations often
have very little control over threats. Organizations cannot control earthquakes, floods, disgruntled
employees, hackers, and other threats; however, organizations can control vulnerabilities and
reduce threats via implementation of a robust SecCM process that is part of the overall risk
management process. Vulnerabilities 10 represent the various types of weaknesses that can be
exploited by a threat. While an analysis of information system vulnerabilities reveals a variety of

 Information security is the protection of information and information systems from unauthorized access, use,
disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction in order to provide confidentiality, integrity, and availability [44
U.S.C., Sec. 3542]. For the purposes of this publication, “security” is used synonymously with “information security.”
9
 Adequate security is security commensurate with the risk and the magnitude of harm resulting from the loss, misuse,
or unauthorized access to or modification of information.
10
  A vulnerability is a weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or
implementation that could be exploited or triggered by a threat source [CNSS Inst. 4009, Adapted].



CHAPTER 2                                                                                                          PAGE 6

potential causes, many vulnerabilities can be traced to software flaws and misconfigurations of
information system components.

The management of configurations has traditionally been viewed as an IT management best
practice. 11 Using SecCM to gain greater control over and ensure the integrity of IT resources
facilitates asset management, improves incident response, help desk, disaster recovery and
problem solving, aids in software development and release management, enables greater
automation of processes, and supports compliance with policies and preparation for audits.
                                                                                         12
2.1.3     ROLE OF SECURITY-FOCUSED CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT

The configuration of an information system and its components has a direct impact on the
security posture of the system. How those configurations are established and maintained requires
a disciplined approach for providing adequate security. Changes to the configuration of an
information system are often needed to stay up to date with changing business functions and
services, and information security needs. These changes can adversely impact the previously
established security posture; therefore, effective configuration management is vital to the
establishment and maintenance of security of information and the information system. The
security-focused configuration management process is critical to maintaining a secure state under
normal operations, contingency recovery operations, and reconstitution to normal operations.

Security-Focused Configuration Management (SecCM) is the management and control of secure
configurations for an information system to enable security and facilitate the management of risk.
SecCM builds on the general concepts, processes, and activities of configuration management by
attention on the implementation and maintenance of the established security requirements of the
organization and information systems.

Information security configuration management requirements are integrated into (or complement)
existing organizational configuration management processes (e.g., business functions,
applications, products) and information systems. SecCM activities include:

•    identification and recording of configurations that impact the security posture of the
     information system and the organization;
•    the consideration of security risks in approving the initial configuration;
•    the analysis of security implications of changes to the information system configuration; and
•    documentation of the approved/implemented changes.

In cases where an organization has no existing CM process in place, security-focused
configuration management practices as defined in this document are developed and implemented
from process inception.

11
   Best practices are often considered to be proven practices or processes that have been successfully used by multiple
organizations. IT management best practices, as referred to in this publication, are viewed from an organization-wide
perspective as practices that best support the mission and business functions or services of the organization.
12
   There are a number of organizations that have documented best practice standards and guidelines for configuration
management which precede this Special Publication and influence its direction including: International Organization
for Standardization (ISO) ISO 10007:2003; IEEE Standard 828-2005; the Capability Maturity Model Integration
(CMMI) with their focus on configuration management for software development documents
(http://www.sei.cmu.edu/cmmi/); the Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) for its influence on the
integration of configuration within information technology management (http://www.itil-
officialsite.com/home/home.asp); and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) for its attention to
configuration management within quality management systems.

Initial implementation of a SecCM program may require considerable effort. If there is no
existing SecCM process within the organization, there will be an initial investment in developing
and implementing a program that is comprehensive enough to span multiple technologies, the
organizational structure, and disparate processes, and that can deliver consistent results while
supporting the organization’s missions and business processes. In addition, tools are procured and
implemented, system components inventoried and recorded, and processes modified to account
for new ways of managing technology in the context of SecCM.

Once in place, SecCM requires an ongoing investment in time and resources. Product patches,
fixes, and updates require time for security impact analysis even as threats and vulnerabilities
continue to exist. As changes to information systems are made, baseline configurations are
updated, specific configuration settings confirmed, and configuration items tracked, verified, and
reported. SecCM is a continuous activity that, once incorporated into IT management processes,
touches all stages of the system development life cycle (SDLC). Organizations that implement
SecCM throughout the SDLC and make its tenets a part of the IT management culture are most
likely to reap benefits in terms of improvement of security and functionality, and more effective
management of organizational risk.


2.2       THE PHASES OF SECURITY-FOCUSED CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT
Security-focused configuration management of information systems involves a set of activities
that can be organized into four major phases – Planning, Identifying and Implementing
Configurations, Controlling Configuration Changes, and Monitoring. It is through these phases
that SecCM not only supports security for an information system and its components, but also
supports the management of organizational risk. Chapter 3 presents the detailed processes and
considerations in implementing the necessary activities in each of these phases.

The four phases of SecCM are illustrated in Figure 2-1 and described below.



                                Identifying and                   Controlling
      Planning                   Implementing                    Configuration                  Monitoring
                                Configurations                     Changes




                 Figure 2-1 – Security-focused Configuration Management Phases

2.2.1     PLANNING

As with many security activities, planning can greatly impact the success or failure of the effort.
As a part of planning, the scope or applicability of SecCM processes are identified.

Planning includes developing policy and procedures to incorporate SecCM into existing
information technology and security programs, and then disseminating the policy throughout the
organization. Policy addresses areas such as the implementation of SecCM plans, integration into
existing security program plans, Configuration Control Boards (CCBs), configuration change




CHAPTER 2                                                                                              PAGE 8

control processes, tools and technology, the use of common secure configurations 13 and baseline
configurations, monitoring, and metrics for compliance with established SecCM policy and
procedures. It is typically more cost-effective to develop and implement a SecCM plan, policies,
procedures, and associated SecCM tools at the organizational level.

2.2.2    IDENTIFYING AND IMPLEMENTING CONFIGURATIONS

After the planning and preparation activities are completed, a secure baseline configuration for
the information system is developed, reviewed, approved, and implemented. The approved
baseline configuration for an information system and associated components represents the most
secure state consistent with operational requirements and constraints. For a typical information
system, the secure baseline may address configuration settings, software loads, patch levels, how
the information system is physically or logically arranged, how various security controls are
implemented, and documentation. Where possible, automation is used to enable interoperability
of tools and uniformity of baseline configurations across the information system.

2.2.3     CONTROLLING CONFIGURATION CHANGES

Given the continually evolving nature of an information system and the mission it supports, the
challenge for organizations is not only to establish an initial baseline configuration that represents
a secure state (which is also cost-effective, functional, and supportive of mission and business
processes), but also to maintain a secure configuration in the face of the significant waves of
change that ripple through organizations.

In this phase of SecCM, the emphasis is put on the management of change to maintain the secure,
approved baseline of the information system. Through the use of SecCM practices, organizations
ensure that changes are formally identified, proposed, reviewed, analyzed for security impact,
tested, and approved prior to implementation. As part of the configuration change control effort,
organizations can employ a variety of access restrictions for change including access controls,
process automation, abstract layers, change windows, and verification and audit activities to limit
unauthorized and/or undocumented changes to the information system.

2.2.4    MONITORING

Monitoring activities are used as the mechanism within SecCM to validate that the information
system is adhering to organizational policies, procedures, and the approved secure baseline
configuration. Planning and implementing secure configurations and then controlling
configuration change is usually not sufficient to ensure that an information system which was
once secure will remain secure. Monitoring identifies undiscovered/undocumented system
components, misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, and unauthorized changes, all of which, if not
addressed, can expose organizations to increased risk. Using automated tools helps organizations
to efficiently identify when the information system is not consistent with the approved baseline
configuration and when remediation actions are necessary. In addition, the use of automated tools
often facilitates situational awareness and the documentation of deviations from the baseline
configuration.

Processes and requirements within all four SecCM phases do not remain static thus all processes
in all four phases are reviewed and revised as needed to support organizational risk management.

13
   A common secure configuration is a recognized, standardized, and established benchmark (e.g., National Checklist
Program, DISA STIGs, etc.) that stipulates specific secure configuration settings for a given IT platform. See
http://checklists.nist.gov.



CHAPTER 2                                                                                                     PAGE 9
Special Publication 800-128          Guide for Security-Focused Configuration Management of Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________


SecCM monitoring activities may loop back to any of the previous phases (as noted in Figure 2-1)
and precipitate changes.

SecCM monitoring is done through assessment and reporting activities. Reports address the
secure state of individual information system configurations and are used as input to Risk
Management Framework information security continuous monitoring requirements. 14 SecCM
monitoring can also support gathering of information for metrics that can be used to provide
quantitative evidence that the SecCM program is meeting its stated goals, and can be used to
improve SecCM processes in general.


2.3         SECURITY-FOCUSED CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT CONCEPTS
This section describes the fundamental concepts relevant to the practice of SecCM within an
organization. Recognizing that organizations have widely varying missions and organizational
structures, there may be differences in the way that SecCM is implemented and managed.

2.3.1       CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT POLICY AND PROCEDURES

The development of documented SecCM policy communicates senior management’s expectations
for SecCM to members of the organization through specific, measurable, and confirmable
objectives. It is a top-down approach which defines what is required and what is not permitted
with respect to using SecCM to manage and control information resources.

While policy defines the objectives for what must be done, procedures describe how the policy
objectives are met through specific actions and results. SecCM procedures are developed to
describe the methodology and tasks for each activity that supports implementation of the SecCM
policy.

Documenting configuration management policy and procedures is performed during the Planning
phase and supports the implementation of NIST SP 800-53 control CM-1 Configuration
Management Policy and Procedures.

2.3.2       CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT PLAN

The Configuration Management Plan serves to describe how SecCM policy will be implemented.
The SecCM Plan may be written to apply to an entire organization, or it may be localized and
tailored to an information system or a group of information systems within the organization. The
SecCM Plan may take the form of an all-inclusive, stand-alone document that describes all
aspects of SecCM or may be contained within more broadly defined CM procedures. A SecCM
Plan may also take the form of a set of documents and appendices that taken together describe all
aspects of SecCM. Finally, the SecCM Plan may take the form of a set of predefined data
elements in a repository.

The SecCM Plan is produced during the Planning phase and supports the implementation of NIST
SP 800-53 controls CM-1 Configuration Management Policy and Procedures and CM-9
Configuration Management Plan.

Special Publication 800-128   Guide for Security-Focused Configuration Management of Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________


2.3.3    CONFIGURATION CONTROL BOARD

The Configuration Control Board (CCB) is a group typically consisting of two or more
individuals that have the collective responsibility and authority to review and approve changes to
an information system. The group, which represents various perspectives from within the
organization, is chosen to evaluate and approve changes to the information system. The CCB is a
check and balance on configuration change activity, assuring that changes are held to
organizationally defined criteria (e.g., scope, cost, impact on security) before being implemented.

The CCB may be less formal for information systems which have limited size, scope, and
criticality in the context of the mission of the organization. The organization determines the size
and formality of the CCB that is appropriate for a given information system (or systems) within
the organization.

The CCB establishment is part of the Planning phase of SecCM and supports the implementation
of NIST SP 800-53 control CM-3 Configuration Change Control.

2.3.4    COMPONENT INVENTORY

The component inventory is a descriptive record of the components within an organization down
to the information system level. A consolidated representation of the components within all of the
information systems within an organization allows the organization to have greater visibility into
and control over its information systems, facilitating the implementation, operation, and
management of a security program. The organization determines the level of granularity required
for tracking the components for SecCM. For example, one organization may track a workstation
(with all peripherals) as a single component while another may document each peripheral as a
separate component in the inventory.

Each component is associated with only one information system and the authority over and
responsibility for each component is with only one information system owner (i.e., every item in
the component inventory falls within the authorization boundary of a single information system).

Creating an inventory of information system components is part of the Planning phase of SecCM
and supports the implementation of the NIST SP 800-53 control CM-8 Information System
Component Inventory.

2.3.5    CONFIGURATION ITEMS

In the context of SecCM of information systems, a configuration item (CI) is an aggregation of
information system components that is designated for configuration management and treated as a
single entity throughout the SecCM process. This implies that the CI is identified, labeled, and
tracked during its life cycle – the CI is the target of many of the activities within SecCM, such as
configuration change control and monitoring activities. A CI may be a specific information
system component (e.g., server, workstation, router, application), a group of information system
components (e.g., group of servers with like operating systems, group of network components
such as routers and switches, an application or suite of applications), a non-component object
(e.g., firmware, documentation), or an information system as a whole. CIs give organizations a
way to decompose the information system into manageable parts whose configurations can be
actively managed.

The purpose of breaking up an information system into CIs is to allow more granularity and
control in managing the secure configuration of the system. The level of granularity will vary


CHAPTER 2                                                                                            PAGE 11
Special Publication 800-128    Guide for Security-Focused Configuration Management of Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________


among organizations and systems and is balanced against the associated management overhead
for each CI. In one organization, it may be appropriate to create a single CI to track all of the
laptops within a system, while in another organization, each laptop may represent an individual
CI.

Identification of the configuration items that compose an information system is part of the
Planning phase of SecCM and supports the implementation of NIST SP 800-53 control CM-3
Configuration Change Control.

2.3.6    SECURE CONFIGURATIONS OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS

Configurations represent the possible states in which an information system and its components
can be arranged. Secure configurations are designed to reduce the organizational security risk
from operation of an information system, and may involve using trusted or approved software
loads, maintaining up-to-date patch levels, applying secure configuration settings of the IT
products used, and implementation of endpoint protection platforms. Secure configurations for an
information system are most often achieved through the application of secure configuration
settings to the IT products (e.g., operating systems, databases, etc.) used to build the information
system. For example, a secure configuration for selected IT products used within the information
system or organization could incorporate the principle of least functionality. Least functionality
helps to minimize the potential for introduction of security vulnerabilities and includes, but is not
limited to, disabling or uninstalling unused/unnecessary operating system (OS) functionality,
protocols, ports, and services, and limiting the software that can be installed and the functionality
of that software.

Implementing secure configurations is part of the Identifying and Implementing Configurations
phase of SecCM and supports the implementation of NIST SP 800-53 controls CM-6
Configuration Settings and CM-7 Least Functionality.

2.3.7    BASELINE CONFIGURATION

A baseline configuration is a set of specifications for a system, or Configuration Item (CI) within
a system, that has been formally reviewed and agreed on at a given point in time, and which can
be changed only through change control procedures. The baseline configuration is used as a basis
for future builds, releases, and/or changes.

The baseline configuration of an information system may evolve over time depending on the
stage of the system development life cycle (SDLC). Early in the SDLC when an information
system is being initiated and acquired, the baseline may be a set of functional requirements. As
the information system is developed and implemented, the baseline may expand to include
additional configuration items such as the technical design, the software load, the architecture,
and configurations of the information system and its individual components. A baseline
configuration may also represent different information computing environments such as
development, test, and production.

When a new baseline configuration is established, the implication is that all of the changes from
the last baseline have been approved. Older versions of approved baseline configurations are
maintained and made available for review or rollback as needed.

Developing and documenting the baseline configuration for an information system is part of the
Identifying and Implementing Configurations phase of SecCM and supports the implementation
of NIST SP 800-53 control CM-2 Baseline Configuration.


CHAPTER 2                                                                                             PAGE 12

________________________________________________________________________________________________



2.3.8      CONFIGURATION CHANGE CONTROL

Configuration change control is the documented process for managing and controlling changes to
the configuration of an information system or its constituent CIs. Configuration change control
for the information system involves the systematic proposal, justification, implementation,
test/evaluation, review, and disposition of changes to the system, including upgrades and
modifications. Configuration change control is applied to include changes to components of the
information system, changes to the configuration settings for information technology products,
emergency/unscheduled changes, and changes to remediate flaws. Changes are controlled from
the time the change is proposed to the implementation and testing of the change. Each step in the
change process is clearly articulated along with the responsibilities and authorities of the roles
involved.

Configuration change control falls under the Controlling Configuration Changes phase of SecCM
and supports the implementation of NIST SP 800-53 control CM-3 Configuration Change
Control and CM-5 Access Restrictions for Change.

2.3.9      SECURITY IMPACT ANALYSIS

Security impact analysis is the analysis conducted by qualified staff within an organization to
determine the extent to which changes to the information system affect the security posture of the
system. Because information systems are typically in a constant state of change, it is important to
understand the impact of changes on the functionality of existing security controls and in the
context of organizational risk tolerance. Security impact analysis is incorporated into the
documented configuration change control process.

The analysis of the security impact of a change occurs when changes are analyzed and evaluated
for adverse impact on security, preferably before they are approved and implemented, but also in
the case of emergency/unscheduled changes. Once the changes are implemented and tested, a
security impact analysis (and/or assessment) is performed to ensure that the changes have been
implemented as approved, and to determine if there are any unanticipated effects of the change on
existing security controls.

Security impact analysis is performed as a part of the Controlling Configuration Changes phase of
SecCM and supports the implementation of NIST SP 800-53 control CM-4 Security Impact
Analysis.

2.3.10 CONFIGURATION MONITORING
Configuration monitoring involves activities to determine whether information systems are
configured in accordance with the organization’s agreed-upon baseline configurations, and
whether the IS components identified within the information system are consistent with the IS
component inventory being maintained by the organization.

Configuration monitoring helps to ensure that SecCM controls are operating as intended and are
providing effective security while supporting adherence to SecCM policies and procedures.
Configuration monitoring may also help to motivate staff members to perform SecCM activities
in accordance with policies and procedures. Additionally, configuration monitoring supports
organizations in their efforts to conform to the Risk Management Framework. 15 Information

     See NIST SP 800-37, as amended, for more information on the Risk Management Framework (RMF).



CHAPTER 2                                                                                                 PAGE 13

gathered during configuration monitoring can be used to support overall continuous monitoring
activities 16 including ongoing assessments of specific security controls and updates to security
documentation such as System Security Plans, Security Assessment Reports, and Security Status
Reports. Automation capabilities, such as those defined by SCAP, can be used to automate
assessment activities.

Configuration monitoring is part of the Monitoring phase of SecCM and supports the
implementation of all NIST SP 800-53 controls in the CM Family.


2.4         SECCM ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
The set of roles (at the organizational as well as the information system level) that are relevant to
the SecCM program are defined along with the responsibilities. The responsibilities are in the
context of SecCM only and are not inclusive of other non-SecCM responsibilities the roles may
also have. Typically, SecCM roles and responsibilities include:

Chief Information Officer (CIO)
The CIO designates and/or provides a SecCM Program Manager for the organization and
approves the organizational SecCM plan and policies.

Senior Information Security Officer (SISO)
The SISO may act as the SecCM Program Manager for the organization. The SISO may also
provide staff with security expertise to serve on the CCB and/or to conduct security impact
analyses. Organizations may also refer to this position as the Chief Information Security Officer
(CISO).

Authorizing Official (AO)
The AO manages or participates in the CCB for systems s/he authorizes and may provide
technical staff to conduct and/or review security impact analyses. The AO coordinates with the
Risk Executive (Function) on SecCM issues and makes the final determination whether or not a
given change or set of changes continues to be an acceptable security risk.

Information System Owner (ISO)
The ISO identifies, defines, and ensures implementation of the aspects of SecCM for the
information system that have not been defined by the organization of which the information
system is a part. The ISO also ensures implementation of organizational-level SecCM
requirements for the information system.

SecCM Program Manager
The SecCM Program Manager develops SecCM policies and procedures, provides direction, and
oversees the implementation of the SecCM program for the organization and/or system level
SecCM program. The SecCM Program Manager may be the SISO (or someone designated by the
SISO or the CIO) at the organizational level or the ISO (or someone designated by the ISO) at the
system level.

Information System Security Officer (ISSO)
The ISSO assists the information system owner with implementation of SecCM for the system,
conducts configuration monitoring activities (reporting and analysis), and may serve on the CCB.

________________________________________________________________________________________________



Information System Administrator (ISA)
The ISA implements agreed-upon secure baseline configurations, incorporates secure
configuration settings for IT products, and assists with security impact analyses and configuration
monitoring activities as needed. In addition, the ISA may be included in the process for
determining the appropriate baseline configuration for each CI and may serve on the CCB. ISAs
are also responsible for complying with SecCM policies and implementing/following SecCM
procedures.

System/Software Developer
The developer ensures that secure configuration settings are built into applications in accordance
with security requirements and assists with security impact analyses and configuration monitoring
activities as needed. In addition, the developer may be included in the process for determining
the appropriate baseline configuration for relevant CIs and may serve on the CCB. Developers are
also responsible for complying with SecCM policies and implementing/following SecCM
procedures.

Information System User (ISU)
The ISU initiates change requests, assists with functional testing, and complies with SecCM
requirements.

THE PROCESS
IMPLEMENTATION AND APPLICATION OF SECURITY-FOCUSED CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT




T
      his chapter describes the process of applying security-focused configuration management
      to information systems within an organization. The goal of SecCM activities is to manage
      and monitor the configurations of information systems to achieve adequate security and
minimize organizational risk while supporting the desired business functionality and services.

The following sections discuss activities that occur within each of the four phases of SecCM.
Some of these activities may be more efficiently performed at the organizational level (i.e.,
applying to more than one information system), while other activities may be more efficiently
performed at the system level (i.e., applying to a single information system). Each organization
determines what activities are conducted at the organizational level and what activities are
conducted at the system level in accordance with organizational management requirements.
Appendix G provides flow charts of the SecCM activities described here. The flow charts are
intended to serve as tools for organizations to draw upon for developing their own organizational
and information system SecCM processes.

3.1 PLANNING
This section describes various SecCM planning activities at both the organizational and
information system level.

3.1.1     PLANNING AT THE ORGANIZATIONAL LEVEL

The following subsections describe the planning phase activities that are normally conducted at
the organizational level. The subsections are listed in the order in which the planning activities
typically occur. As always, organizations have flexibility in determining which activities are
performed at what level and in what order. Planning at the organizational level includes SecCM
program documented policies and procedures that provide direction and support for managing
configurations of individual information systems within the organization.

Establish Organization-wide SecCM Program
The practice of SecCM for ensuring adequate security and facilitating the management of risk is
most effectively realized if it is implemented in a consistent manner across the organization.
Some SecCM activities are more effective when performed at the organizational level, with
responsibility assigned to the organization-wide SecCM program.

For organizations with varied and complex enterprise architecture, implementing SecCM in a
consistent and uniform manner across the organization requires organization-wide coordination of
resources. A senior management-level program manager designated to lead and oversee the
organization-wide SecCM program can provide this type of coordination. For many large
organizations, dedicated staff may be needed. For smaller organizations, or those with funding or
resource constraints, the organization-wide SecCM program may be implemented by senior
management-level staff that meet as a group to determine the SecCM-related activities for the
organization.

________________________________________________________________________________________________


The SecCM program manager provides knowledge and direction in the form of policies and
procedures, communications, training, defined roles and responsibilities, support, oversight of
program activities, and coordination with stakeholders. An organization-wide SecCM program
also demonstrates management commitment for the effort. This commitment from the top of the
organization is communicated throughout the organization down to the individual information
system owners.

The SecCM program manager facilitates communications regarding SecCM policies, procedures,
issues, etc., within the organization. Consideration is given to implementation of a security
information management console or “dashboard” to communicate basic project and operational
information to stakeholders in language they understand. The SecCM program manager also
considers other vehicles for communication such as Web site updates, emails, and newsletters to
share milestones, measures of value, and other SecCM-related news with stakeholders.

Primary Roles: SecCM Program Manager

Supporting Roles: SISO (if s/he is not the SecCM Program Manager); CIO; AO

Expected Input: Organizational risk tolerance; organizational security requirements; applicable
laws, regulations, policies, etc. from higher authorities

Expected Output: Functional organization-wide SecCM program

Develop Organizational SecCM Policy
The organization is typically responsible for defining documented policies for the SecCM
program. The SecCM program manager develops, disseminates, and periodically reviews and
updates the SecCM policies for the organization. The policies are included as a part of the overall
organization-wide security policy. The SecCM policy normally includes the following:

   • Purpose – the objective(s) in establishing organization-wide SecCM policy;
   • Scope – the extent of the enterprise architecture to which the policy applies;
   • Roles – the roles that are significant within the context of the policy;
   • Responsibilities – the responsibilities of each identified role;
   • Activities – the functions that are performed to meet policy objectives;
   • Common secure configurations – federal and/or organization-wide standardized
     benchmarks for configuration settings along with how to address deviations; and
   • Records – the records of configuration management activities to be maintained; the
     information to be included in each type of record; who is responsible for writing/keeping
     the records; and procedures for protecting, accessing, auditing, and ultimately deleting
     such records.

SecCM policy may also address the following topics:

   •   SecCM training requirements;
   •   Use of SecCM templates;
   •   Use of automated tools;
   •   Prohibited configuration settings; and
   •   Requirements for inventory of information systems and components.

________________________________________________________________________________________________


The SecCM policy emphasizes management commitment, clarifies the required level of
coordination among organizational entities, and defines the configuration monitoring approach.

Primary Roles: SecCM Program Manager

Supporting Roles: SISO (if s/he is not the SecCM Program Manager); CIO; AO

Expected Input: Organizational risk tolerance; organizational security requirements; applicable
laws, regulations, policies, etc. from higher authorities

Expected Output: Documented SecCM policies

Develop Organizational SecCM Procedures
The organization typically establishes and maintains common procedures for security-focused
configuration management activities; however, some SecCM procedures may require
development at the system level. Organizations may also provide hybrid procedures, i.e., the
organization establishes procedures that contain parameters to be defined at the system level. In
any case, the procedures are documented and disseminated to relevant staff, and in accordance
with organizational policy. SecCM procedures address the following, as applicable:

Templates - Establishes templates related to SecCM that integrate the organization-wide SecCM
policy and procedures and allow individual system owners to fill in information specific to their
information system. Templates may be developed for a SecCM Plan, system-specific
procedure(s), change requests, security impact analyses, reporting on SecCM, etc. Templates may
also be developed to apply specifically to low, moderate, or high-impact information systems. 17
Sample templates are provided in Appendices D and E.

IS Component Inventory – Describes how components are to be managed within the inventory
(e.g., how new components are added to the inventory, what information about each component is
tracked, and how updates are made including removal of retired components). If automated tools
are to be used, factors such as how often they will run, who will administer them, who will have
access, and how they will be audited are described.

Baseline Configuration – Identifies the steps for creation of a baseline configuration, content of
the baseline configuration, approval of the initial baseline configuration, maintenance of the
baseline configuration (i.e., when it should be updated and by whom), and control of the baseline
configuration. If applicable, requirements from higher regulatory bodies are considered and
integrated when defining baseline configurations (e.g., requirements from OMB memos, laws
such as Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), etc.).

Common Secure Configurations – Identifies commonly recognized and standardized secure
configurations to be applied to configuration items. The common secure configurations specified
in the procedure are derived from established federal, organizational, or industry specifications
(the National Checklist Program contains references to common secure configurations such as the
United States Government Configuration Baseline (USGCB), Federal Desktop Core
Configuration (FDCC), Defense Information System Agency (DISA) Security Technical

17
  Information systems categorized in accordance with FIPS 199, Standards for Categorization of Federal Information
and Information Systems, and the security impact level derived from the categorization in accordance with FIPS 200,
Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems.

Special Publication 800-128           Guide for Security-Focused Configuration Management of Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________


Implementation Guides (STIGs), Center for Internet Security (CIS) Benchmarks, etc.). Where
possible, common secure configurations use SCAP-expressed content. Deviations from the
common secure configurations are also addressed (e.g., identification of acceptable methods for
assessing, approving, documenting, and justifying deviations to common secure configurations,
along with identification of controls implemented to mitigate risk from the deviations), in the
event that the configuration for a given system must diverge from the defined configuration due
to mission requirements or other constraints.

Patch Management – Defines how an organization’s patch management process is integrated into
SecCM, how patches are prioritized and approved through the configuration change control
process, and how patches are tested for their impact on existing secure configurations. Also
defines how patches are integrated into updates to approved baseline configurations and how
patch implementation is controlled (access controls, etc.).

Configuration Change Control – Identifies the steps to move a configuration change from its
initial request to eventual release into the operational environment. The procedure includes, but is
not limited to:

       •    Change request and approval procedures;
       •    Criteria to determine the types of changes that are preapproved or exempt from
            configuration control such as vendor-provided security patches, updated antivirus
            signatures, creation or deletion of users, replacement of defective peripherals,
            motherboard or hard drives, etc.; 18
       •    Security impact analysis procedures including how and with what level of rigor analysis
            results are to be documented and requirements for post-implementation review to
            confirm that the change was implemented as approved and that no additional security
            impact has resulted;
       •    Criteria to determine whether a change is significant enough to trigger consideration of
            system reauthorization activities;
       •    Review for consistency with organizational enterprise architecture;
       •    Establishment of a group that approves changes (e.g., a Configuration Control Board);
       •    Requirements for testing of changes for submission to the CCB (i.e., the format and types
            of information to present to the CCB such as a test plan, schedule, and test results);
       •    If change approvals at the system level are permitted, criteria for elevating a change
            request from system level approval to organizational approval (e.g., the change will
            affect other organizational systems, the change will require a system outage that could
            adversely impact the mission, etc.);
       •    Requirements for testing of changes prior to release into the operational environment;
       •    Requirements for access restrictions for change (i.e., who can make change to the
            information system and under what circumstances);
       •    Requirements for rollback of changes in the event that problems occur;
       •    Requirements for management of unscheduled changes (e.g., changes needed for critical
            flaw remediation) that are tailored to support expedited reviews and approvals; and
       •    Requirements for retroactive analysis, testing, and approval of changes that are
            implemented outside of the change control process.




18
     Preapproved changes are still tested and documented prior to implementation.



CHAPTER 3                                                                                                    PAGE 19

________________________________________________________________________________________________


Help Desk Procedures – Describes how change requests originating through the help desk are
recorded, submitted, tracked, and integrated into the configuration change control process.

SDLC Procedures – Describes how SecCM is used to manage and control system configurations
and changes within the organizationally defined SDLC process and throughout the life cycle of a
system.

Monitoring – Describes how monitoring activities and related reports are applied to assess the
secure state of the information system, and how to identify when the actual configuration
becomes different in some way from the approved baseline configuration (i.e., unauthorized
change) within an information system through analysis of monitoring and reporting activities.

Media Library Procedures – Describes management of the media library and includes naming
conventions for media, labeling procedures (name/version, date created, retention period, owner,
date for destruction, impact or classification level), tracking media, access controls, protections
for media integrity (e.g., checksums), inventory checks, capacity planning, and archiving of
media.

Primary Roles: SecCM Program Manager; ISOs. Note: SecCM Program Managers and ISOs both
have responsibility in determining which procedures are needed at their respective levels and how
they are documented (e.g., as several separate procedures, as a single procedure, as part of the
SecCM plan)

Supporting Roles: SISO or equivalent (if s/he is not the SecCM Program Manager); ISSO; ISA;
User

Expected Input: Organizational policies organizational risk tolerance; organizational security
requirements; applicable laws, regulations, policies, etc. from higher authorities

Expected Output: Documented SecCM procedures

Develop the SecCM Monitoring Strategy
SecCM monitoring verifies that the SecCM process is effective with respect to maintaining the
security posture of the organization and adherence to baseline configurations and SecCM policy.
The SecCM monitoring strategy is based on the risk tolerance of, and security requirements for,
the organization. The SecCM monitoring strategy is consistent with, and provides input to, the
organization’s overall continuous monitoring strategy. The organization typically develops the
SecCM monitoring strategy; however, organizations have the flexibility to develop some or all of
the SecCM monitoring strategy at the system level.
A schedule for SecCM monitoring and associated reporting is established as part of the strategy.
Scheduled and ad hoc assessments are included within the strategy. The monitoring schedule may
coincide with scheduled releases such that assessments are performed before and after
deployments. Ad hoc assessments may also be conducted so that staff does not become lax in
between scheduled assessments. Additionally, the schedule includes provisions for reviewing and
revising the SecCM monitoring strategy to ensure that the strategy continues to meet
organizational security requirements.
See Section 3.4 for more information on SecCM monitoring.

Primary Roles: SecCM Program Manager

Expected Input: SecCM policy and procedures, overall organizational continuous monitoring
policy and procedures; organizational risk tolerance; organizational security requirements

Expected Output: Strategy and schedule for configuration monitoring and reporting

Define the Types of Changes That Do Not Require Configuration Change Control
In the interest of resource management, the organization may wish to designate the types of
changes that are preapproved (i.e., changes that are not sent to the CCB for approval)18 and
changes that are typically not included under configuration control (i.e., changes that are
completely exempt from SecCM). Vendor-provided security patches, updated antivirus
signatures, and replacement of defective peripherals or internal hardware are examples of changes
that may be preapproved. Database content updates, creating/removing/updating accounts, and
creation or deletion of user files are examples of changes that are typically exempt from
configuration change control.

Primary Roles: SecCM Program Manager; ISO

Supporting Roles: SISO (if s/he is not the SecCM Program Manager); AO; ISSO; ISA;
System/Software Developers

Expected Input: SecCM policies and procedures; types of changes that typically occur within the
organization and/or system

Expected Output: Record of the types of changes that are exempt from configuration control;
record of the types of changes that are configuration controlled

Develop SecCM Training
SecCM is a fundamental part of an organizational security program, but often requires a change
in organizational culture. Staff is provided training to ensure their understanding of SecCM
policies and procedures. Training also provides a venue for management to communicate the
reasons why SecCM is important. SecCM training material is developed covering organizational
policies, procedures, tools, artifacts, and monitoring requirements. The training may be
mandatory or optional as appropriate and is targeted to relevant staff (e.g., system administrators,
system/software developers, system security officers, system owners, etc.) as necessary to ensure
that staff has the skills to manage the baseline configurations in accordance with organizational
policy.

Identify Approved IT Products
Many organizations establish a list of approved hardware and software products for use across the
organization. Information system owners are able to select and use products from the approved
list without the need for explicit approval. Depending upon organizational policy, additional
products required for a particular information system may need to be approved by the CCB for
that information system; alternatively, a product used may need to be added to the
organizationally controlled and approved IT products list. Some organizations may also provide a
buying service or similar purchasing/contracting vehicle from which preapproved products may
be purchased or are required to be purchased.

Primary Roles: SecCM Program Manager and/or the Configuration Control Board; ISO

Supporting Roles: SISO (if s/he is not the SecCM Program Manager); AO; ISSO

Expected Input: SecCM policies and procedures; organizational security requirements;
acquisition/buying service information

Expected Output: List of approved IT Products for the organization

Identify Tools
Managing the myriad configurations found within information system components has become an
almost impossible task using manual methods like spreadsheets. When possible, organizations
look for automated solutions which, in the long run, can lower costs, enhance efficiency, and
improve the reliability of SecCM efforts.

In most cases, tools to support activities in SecCM phases two, three, and four are selected for use
across the organization by SecCM program management, and information system owners are
responsible for applying the tools to the SecCM activities performed on each information system.
Similarly, tools and mechanisms for inventory reporting and management may be provided to
information system owners by the organization. In accordance with federal government and
organizational policy, if automated tools are used, the tools are Security Content Automation
Protocol (SCAP)-validated to the extent that such tools are available. SCAP is described in more
detail in Section 3.5.

If not provided by the organization, tools are identified and deployed to support SecCM at the
information system level. When possible, existing SecCM tools from within the organization are
leveraged to support consistent organization-wide SecCM practices, centralized reporting, and
cost efficiency. Leveraging existing tools may require them to be installed and configured to
function on individual information systems. This usually requires that accounts be set up,
administrators identified, schedules determined, the appropriate baseline configurations set up,
and possibly installation of a client on each component to be configuration-controlled. If the tool
has already been deployed within the organization, instructions for installation, configuration, and
deployment are available or easy to produce if needed.

There are a wide variety of configuration management tools available to support an
organization’s SecCM program. At a minimum, the organization considers tools that can
automatically assess configuration settings of IS components. Automated tools should be able to
scan different information system components (e.g., Web server, database server, network
devices, etc.) running different operating systems, identify the current configuration settings, and
indicate where they are noncompliant with policy. Such tools import settings from one or more


CHAPTER 3                                                                                             PAGE 22

________________________________________________________________________________________________


common secure configurations and then allow for tailoring the configurations to the
organization’s security and mission/functional requirements.

Tools that implement and/or assess configuration settings are evaluated to determine whether they
include requirements such as:

    •    Ability to pull information from a variety of sources (different type of components,
         different operating systems, different platforms, etc.);
    •    Use of standardized specifications such as XML and SCAP;
    •    Integration with other products such as help desk, inventory management, and incident
         response solutions;
    •    Vendor-provided support (patches, updated vulnerability signatures, etc.);
    •    Compliance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies,
         regulations, standards, and guidelines and link vulnerabilities to SP 800-53 controls;
    •    Standardized reporting capability (e.g. SCAP, XML) including the ability to tailor output
         and drill down; and
    •    Data consolidation into Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools and
         dashboard products.

Organizations may consider implementation of an all-in-one solution for configuration
management. For example, various configuration management functions are included in products
for managing IT servers, workstations, desktops, and services provided by applications. These
products may include functions such as:

    •    Inventory/discovery of IS components;
    •    Software distribution;
    •    Patch management;
    •    Operating system deployment;
    •    Policy management;
    •    Migration to new baseline configuration; and
    •    Backup/recovery.

Primary Roles: SecCM Program Manager and/or the Configuration Control Board; ISO

Supporting Roles: SISO (if s/he is not the SecCM Program Manager); CIO; AO; ISSO; ISA

Expected Input: SecCM policies and procedures; organizational and information system security
requirements; acquisition/buying service information

Expected Output: Tools to be implemented in support of SecCM

Establish Configuration Test Environment and Program
Some organizations may wish to establish and maintain a configuration test environment and
program for testing IT products, tools, and proposed changes to them in a centrally managed
environment isolated from the production environment. The test environment is used for various
types of testing to include:

    •    IT products proposed for approval and use within the organization;
    •    Configuration settings for approved IT products;



CHAPTER 3                                                                                            PAGE 23

     •   Patches issued by suppliers prior to their rollout through the organization;
     •   Validation of tools that detect unapproved configuration settings;
     •   Verification of testing processes to validate approved configuration settings;
     •   Security impact analyses; and
     •   Other configuration-related changes.

NIST SP 800-115, Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment, provides
guidelines on how to establish and conduct an effective information security functional testing
program. Specific guidelines are provided for system configuration review and vulnerability
scanning which may be directly applied to the configuration test program.

Expected Input: SecCM policies and procedures;

Expected Output: Isolated test environment and program in support of SecCM

3.1.2    PLANNING AT THE SYSTEM LEVEL

The following subsections describe the planning phase activities that are normally completed at
the system level. The subsections are listed in the order in which the planning activities typically
occur. As always, organizations have flexibility in determining which activities are performed at
the organizational level and which activities are performed at the system level, and in what order.
The system-level planning phase results in a completed SecCM Plan, an established
Configuration Control Board, an accurate information system component inventory, and defined
configuration items for the system.

Develop SecCM Plan for Information System
The primary goal of the SecCM Plan is to document or provide references to system-specific
SecCM-related information. The organization may define a master SecCM Plan and provide
templates that require a subset of the SecCM Plan to be documented for each information system,
or the system owner may be required to define the system SecCM Plan in its entirety. Regardless
of the format, a SecCM Plan is completed at the system level and typically covers the following
topics:

     •   Brief description of the subject information system;
     •   Information system component inventory;
     •   Information system configuration items;
     •   Rigor to be applied to managing changes to configuration items (e.g., based on the impact
         level of the information system 19 );
     •   Identification of the roles and responsibilities;
     •   Identification and composition of the group or individual(s) that consider change

  Information systems categorized in accordance with FIPS 199, Standards for Categorization of Federal Information
and Information Systems, and FIPS 200, Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information
Systems.

         requests;
    •    Configuration change control procedures to be followed (including references to
         organization-wide procedures);
    •    Identification on the location where SecCM artifacts (change requests, approvals, etc.)
         are maintained (e.g., media libraries);
    •    Access controls employed to control changes to configurations;
    •    Access controls to protect SecCM artifacts, records, reports, etc. (e.g., commensurate
         with system impact level;
    •    SecCM tools that are used;
    •    Identification of common secure configurations (e.g., FDCC/USGCB, DISA STIGs,
         National Checklist Program, etc.) to be used as a basis for establishing approved baseline
         configurations for the information system;
    •    Deviations from common secure configurations for configuration items including
         justifications;
    •    Criteria for approving baseline configurations for the information system; and
    •    Handling of exceptions to the SecCM plan (e.g., location of SecCM artifacts,
         configuration change control procedures, etc.).

The SecCM Plan may have various representations; it could be an actual document, a collection
of data stored within a SecCM tool, or a variety of other representations. SecCM procedures may
be covered separately or the SecCM plan may incorporate SecCM procedures. The SecCM Plan
may also be instantiated at the system level from organizational templates. The level of detail for
the SecCM plan is commensurate with the impact level of the subject information system.

SDLC Phase: Begin in Initiation phase, fine tune in Development/Acquisition phase, finalize in
Implementation/Assessment phase

Supporting Roles: ISSO; ISA; System/Software Developer; User

Expected Input: Organizational SecCM policies, procedures, and templates

Expected Output: System-level SecCM plan, including system-level procedures

Create or Update Information System Component Inventory
An information system component is a discrete identifiable IT asset that represents a building
block of an information system. An accurate component inventory is essential to record the
components that compose the information system. The component inventory helps to improve the
security of the information system by providing a comprehensive view of the components that
need to be managed and secured. All information system components are tracked from
acquisition to retirement as part of the organization’s SDLC process.
The information system component inventory can be represented as:

         IS Component Inventory = {ISC1, ISC2, … ISCn},

where n is greater than or equal to one, and ISC represents an information system component
within the organization.




CHAPTER 3                                                                                             PAGE 25
Special Publication 800-128            Guide for Security-Focused Configuration Management of Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________


Every organizational component is included within the authorization boundary of one, and only
one, information system and is documented and tracked in an inventory which reflects the
association with the information system under which it is managed i.e., an component associated
with an information system is included in that information system component inventory. A
component may support information systems that are not within the same authorization boundary
(such as a server that supports several Web applications or virtual machines); however, the
owners of the supported information systems have neither authority over, nor responsibility for,
the supporting component and thus the component would not be included in the component
inventories of the supported information systems.

The component inventory is populated through a process of discovery. Discovery, which may be
manual or automated, is the process of obtaining information on IS components that compose the
information systems within the organization. The organization typically determines the types and
granularity of the components (peripherals versus workstations, routers, etc.) that are to be
identified within the inventory. In most organizations, it is impractical to manually collect this
information for inclusion in the inventory or for analysis against the authorized inventory. The
use of automated tools for discovery, analysis, and management of component inventories is
generally a more effective and efficient means of maintaining component inventories. Still, it is
important to note that even with automated inventory management tools, it may still be necessary
to enter some component inventory data elements manually. Examples include, but are not
limited to, organizational unique identifiers, information system association (depending on
network configuration, whether the inventory management tool installation is at the
organizational level or system level, etc.), system/component owner, administrator, or user,
configuration item association, or type of component. Tools that support inventory management
are usually database-driven applications to track and manage information system components
within a given environment. Once an inventory is established, automated tools are often used to
detect the removal or addition of components. Some inventory management tools allow for
expanded monitoring of components through the use of built-in hooks in the OS, installation of
agents on each component, or Application Programming Interfaces. With this functionality, the
inventory management system can monitor changes in the component’s configuration and report
the results to specified staff.

Inventory management tools are SCAP-validated, to the extent such tools are available. When
purchasing a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) or customized inventory management application,
organizations are well advised to include SCAP requirements in requests for proposals, purchase
agreements, contracts, etc. Specifying components by a commonly recognized identifier such as
the Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) can facilitate interchange of data among SCAP-
compliant tools. See Section 3.5 for more information on SCAP. Use of commonly recognized
identifiers from the start of the acquisition process provides a common taxonomy for the
component inventory to track components throughout the entire SDLC (i.e., from acquisition to
retirement).

An IS component inventory adds real value to SecCM when each item in the inventory is
associated with information that can be leveraged for determination of approved configuration
baselines, configuration change control/security impact analysis, and monitoring/reporting. Some
data elements 20 typically stored for each component in the IS component inventory include:

       •    Unique Identifier and/or Serial Number;

  A single IS component may support additional information systems. For example, a server in a server farm may host
several virtual machines, and each virtual machine in turn may support a Web application. When such a server suffers a
service interruption or compromise, the information stored in the component inventory about the uses of that server can
assist in the quick identification of the applications that are impacted so that appropriate actions can be taken.
Additionally, virtual machines are included as separate items in IS component inventories and are under configuration
control. Identifying virtual machines and including them in the CM process is important in managing overall
organizational risk and system-level security.

Determine Configuration Items
When implementing configuration management, the system owner determines how to best
decompose the information system (IS) into one or more configuration items (CIs). CIs may be
one or a group of IS components, documents, network diagrams, scripts, custom code, and
various other elements that compose the information system and which require configuration
management.

An IS can be represented as a set of one or more CIs as follows:

         IS = {CI1, CI2, …CIn} where n is greater than or equal to 1.

There is a one-to-many relationship between ISs and CIs. Thus, each IS is composed of one or
more CIs and each CI is part of one, and only one, IS. In cases where an organization establishes
and maintains a common configuration baseline for a given platform (e.g., Windows version X,
Linux version Y) or component type (e.g., workstation, server, router) each individual
information system inherits the common configuration baseline as a CI, or part of a CI, for that
information system. The CI is managed for use in that information system to include any
deviations as justified and recorded (See Section 3.2.2.iii). The point is that a CI is owned and
managed as part of only one IS regardless of the common configuration baseline source.

A CI may be composed of one or more IS components (ISCs) (e.g., server, workstation, router,
application), one or more non-component (NC) information system objects (e.g., documentation,
diagrams, firmware), or some combination thereof as indicated in the following representations:

       i. CIA = {ISC1, ISC2, …ISCn} where n is greater than or equal to one;
       ii. CIB = {NC1, NC2, …NCn} where n is greater than or equal to one; and/or
       iii. CIC = {ISC1, ISC2, …ISCn + NC1, NC2, …NCn} where n is greater than or equal to
       one.

For example, an information system with a number of servers using similar technology may be
taken together as one CI (as in representation i). System applications may be represented as one
or more CIs (also as in representation i). All documentation for the system may be included in
one CI or each document may be treated as a separate CI (as in representation ii). Conversely, the
system owner may find that it is more expedient to include the servers, applications running on
the servers, and supporting documentation in a single CI (as in representation iii). When applying
representations i or ii, it is important to note that the rigor of the review and approval of change
proposals for one CI (e.g., a CI composed of servers) may be higher than that applied to another
CI (e.g., a CI composed of documentation). Furthermore, CIs within the same system may be
tracked using different tools.

Every item within the IS component inventory is associated with one and only one CI, and hence,
is included within the authorization boundary of a single information system.

Each CI is assigned an unambiguous identifier so that it can be uniquely referenced within
SecCM processes. Each CI could have a series of approved baseline configurations as it moves
through its life cycle and is the object of configuration change control. As the CI moves through
its life cycle, the organization manages version numbers for the CI.

A set of data elements is maintained for each CI to define and describe the CI to enable it to be
rebuilt from scratch. The types of information that are associated with a CI may include:



CHAPTER 3                                                                                            PAGE 28
Special Publication 800-128    Guide for Security-Focused Configuration Management of Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________



   •   The information system of which the CI is a part;
   •   Logical and/or physical placement within the system;
   •   Ownership and management information;
   •   Inventory of IS components that makes up the CI;
   •   Inventory of documentation that makes up the CI;
   •   Version numbers for components and non-component objects;
   •   Relationship to/dependencies on other CIs within the system;
   •   Information related to custom software used within the CI;
   •   IT products or components common secure configurations; and
   •   Any other information needed to rebuild or reconstitute the CI.

While decomposing an information system into a number of CIs may make it easier to manage
changes within the information system, it is important to note that when one CI within an IS
changes, other CIs within the IS may also be affected. Furthermore, approved changes to a CI
may result in updates to the system IS component inventory.

Another potential type of configuration item that is considered, particularly with respect to
establishment and maintenance of a configuration test program is a CI for SecCM tools and
testing processes. Tools and testing processes used to validate deviations from approved
information system baseline configurations are under configuration control to reduce the potential
for such testing to return false positive or false negative results (i.e., subject tools and processes
are able to detect unauthorized configuration settings and are able to successfully recognize
approved configuration settings).

Relationship between an Information System and Its Configuration Items and Information
System Components
Figure 3-1 depicts the relationship between the information system as a whole, individual
information system components and non-component objects, and information system
configuration items (CIs). The information system is composed of numerous individual
components and non-component objects as described above. The information system components
and non-component objects that require configuration management are grouped into CIs whose
configurations are managed as one. For instance, in Figure 3-1 at the component level we see
numerous individual desktops. At the CI level we see that all the desktops running OS QRS
version 8 have been grouped into one CI and all the desktops running OS XYZ version 5 have
been grouped into another CI. In this way, the system components and non-component objects

with related/similar/identical configuration requirements are configuration-managed as a group
rather than as individual components.




       Figure 3-1 – Example of the Relationship between an IS and its Components and CIs


Establish Configuration Control Board (CCB) for Information System
A CCB or equivalent group is identified for the review and approval of configuration changes for
the information system. The CCB is established through the creation of a charter which defines
the authority and scope of the group and how it should operate. A charter may define the CCB’s
membership, the roles and responsibilities of its members, and whether it reports to an oversight
body like an Executive Steering Committee or the Risk Executive (Function). A charter also
describes the process by which the CCB operates, including how to handle changes and the range
of dispositions (approved, not approved, on hold, etc.), evaluation criteria, and the quorum
required to make configuration change control-related decisions.

The CCB plays an important role of gatekeeper in deciding which changes may be acted upon
and introduced into an information system. The CCB deliberately considers the potential effect of
a proposed change on the functionality and secure state of the information system and risk to the
mission should the change be implemented in the context of the risk tolerance established by the
organization. By reviewing each proposed and implemented modification, the CCB ensures that
there is a disciplined, systematic, and secure approach for introducing change. Having a clearly
defined process or framework for the evaluation and approval of change requests, including
predefined evaluation criteria, helps to ensure that each proposed and implemented change is



CHAPTER 3                                                                                            PAGE 30

________________________________________________________________________________________________


evaluated in a consistent and repeatable manner balancing security, business, and technical
viewpoints.

Organizational policy may allow flexibility regarding the size and formality of the CCB. Low-
impact and/or small, uncomplicated information systems may require less formality such that the
CCB may be composed of as few as two members (typically the system owner and the ISSO). For
high-impact systems and complex moderate-impact systems, the organization may require a CCB
that is composed of at least three individuals, at least one of whom is an ISSO or ISSM.
Additionally, the organization may determine that it is necessary to formally submit proposed
changes to the CCB and go through formalized reviews and security impact analysis prior to
acceptance and approval.

Regardless of the size and formalism of the CCB for an information system, best practices for
configuration change control require that changes to the information system be vetted by at least
one authorized individual who is independent of the requestor – in other words, in order to
maintain adequate separation of duties, system administrators, developers, etc., are not given the
authority to unilaterally propose and approve changes to the configuration of an information
system (excluding changes identified in procedures as being exempt from SecCM). The vetting
activity is recorded in an artifact that can be archived (e.g., CCB minutes, actions to be taken,
assigned responsibilities for actions, reports generated, approvals/disapprovals and rationale,
etc.).

In selecting members of the CCB, an organization considers roles that represent a range of
stakeholders. The viewpoints and expertise of individuals representing the organizational and/or
system mission, information security (information system security officers, security architects,
etc.), information technology (e.g., system administrators, network engineers, enterprise
architects, etc.), end users, customers, vendors, etc., are considered for inclusion in the CCB. It is
not necessary that all participants have a voting role in the CCB, but their input may support
improved decision making. For example, vendor participation may be valuable for insight into
product-specific functions, features, or configurations but the vendor is not given a vote on
approval of the change.

3.2 IDENTIFYING AND IMPLEMENTING CONFIGURATIONS
The following subsections describe the Identifying and Implementing Configurations phase
activities. In this phase, the activities are typically completed at the system level following the


CHAPTER 3                                                                                             PAGE 31

applicable organizational and/or system-specific SecCM policy and procedures. The subsections
are listed in the general chronological order in which the configuration activities occur. As
always, organizations have flexibility in determining which activities are performed at what level
and in what order. Completion of the Identifying and Implementing Configurations phase results
in implementation of a secure configuration baseline for each information system and constituent
CIs, i.e., each established CI is the object of a documented and approved secure configuration.

3.2.1     ESTABLISH SECURE CONFIGURATIONS

In developing and deploying an information system, secure configurations are established for the
information system and its constituent CIs. Secure configurations may include:

    •    Setting secure values (i.e., the parameters that describe how particular automated
         functions of IT products behave) including, but not limited to:

              o    OS and application features (enabling or disabling depending on the specific
                   feature, setting specific parameters, etc.);
              o    Services (e.g., automatic updates) and ports (e.g., DNS over port 53);
              o    Network protocols (e.g., NetBIOS, IPv6) and network interfaces (e.g., Bluetooth,
                   IEEE 802.11, infrared);
              o    Methods of remote access (e.g., SSL, VPN, SSH, IPSEC);
              o    Access controls (e.g., controlling permissions to files, directories, registry keys,
                   and restricting user activities such as modifying system logs or installing
                   applications);
              o    Management of identifiers/accounts (e.g., changing default account names,
                   determining length of time until inactive accounts are disabled, using unique user
                   names, establishing user groups);
              o    Authentication controls (e.g., password length, use of special characters,
                   minimum password age, multifactor authentication/use of tokens);
              o    Audit settings (e.g., capturing key events such as failures, logons, permission
                   changes, unsuccessful file access, creation of users and objects, deletion and
                   modification of system files, registry key and kernel changes);
              o    System settings (e.g., session timeouts, number of remote connections, session
                   lock); and
              o    Cryptography (e.g., using FIPS 140-2-validated cryptographic protocols and
                   algorithms to protect data in transit and in storage);

    •    Applying vendor-released patches in response to identified vulnerabilities, including
         software updates;
    •    Using approved, signed software, if supported;
    •    Implementing safeguards through software to protect end-user machines against attack
         (e.g., antivirus, antispyware, antiadware, personal firewalls, host-based intrusion
         detection systems [HIDS]);
    •    Applying network protections (e.g., TLS, IPSEC);
    •    Establishing the location where a component physically and logically resides (e.g.,
         behind a firewall, within a DMZ, on a specific subnet, etc.); and
    •    Maintaining and updating technical specification and design documentation, system
         security documentation, system procedures, etc.

In many cases, organizational policies, in accordance with federal laws, standards, directives, and
orders, establish generally accepted common secure configurations (e.g., National Checklist


CHAPTER 3                                                                                               PAGE 32

________________________________________________________________________________________________


Program, DISA STIGs, CIS benchmarks). Configurations identified in the National Checklist
Program 22 as well as SCAP-expressed checklists are a source for establishing common secure
configurations. Commercial product developers are also a potential source for common secure
configurations. Deviations from common secure configurations are justified and recorded (see
Section 3.2.2.iii).

In establishing and maintaining secure configurations, organizations consider potential
interoperability conflicts with interconnected systems. Coordination of secure configuration
baselines between system staff and/or the relevant CCB(s) helps ensure synchronization of secure
configurations between interconnected systems to meet desired security and operational
functionality.

If not identified in organizational policies and procedures, the IS owner, in coordination with the
ISSO, has the responsibility of establishing secure configurations (based on appropriate common
secure configurations, if available) for an information system and its constituent CIs. Regardless
of the responsible party, the secure configurations comply with all applicable federal
requirements and are approved in accordance with organizational policy.

SDLC Phase: Begin in Development/Acquisition phase, finalize in Implementation/Assessment
phase

Primary Roles: ISO; ISSO

Supporting Roles: ISA; System/Software Developer

Expected Input: Organizational and/or system-level policies and procedures including mandated
or suggested common secure configurations; System Security Plan/information system security
requirements; system/component technical documentation

Expected Output: Initial secure baseline configuration(s) for the information system and its CI(s)

3.2.2    IMPLEMENT SECURE CONFIGURATIONS

Implementing secure configurations for IT products is no simple task. There are many IT
products, and each has a myriad of possible parameters that can be configured. In addition,
organizations have mission and business process needs which may require that IT products be
configured in a particular manner. To further complicate matters, for some products, the
configuration settings of the underlying platform may need to be modified to allow for the
functionality required for mission accomplishment such that they deviate from the approved
common secure configurations.

Using the secure configuration previously established (see Section 3.2.1) as a starting point, the
following structured approach is recommended when implementing the secure configuration:

        i. Prioritize Configurations
        In the ideal environment, all IT products within an organization would be configured to the
        most secure state that still provided the functionality required by the organization.

22
  National Institute of Standards and Technology Special Publication 800-70, National Checklist Program for IT
Products: Guidance for Checklists Users and Developers, as amended, provides information on the National Checklist
Program. Also see http://checklists.nist.gov.



CHAPTER 3                                                                                                  PAGE 33
Special Publication 800-128     Guide for Security-Focused Configuration Management of Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________


       However, due to limited resources and other constraints, many organizations may find it
       necessary to prioritize which information systems, IT products, or CIs to target first for
       secure configuration as they implement SecCM.

       In determining the priorities for implementing secure configurations in information
       systems, IT products, or CIs, organizations consider the following criteria:

             •   System impact level – Implementing secure configurations in information systems
                 with a high or moderate security impact level may have priority over information
                 systems with a low security impact level.
             •   Risk assessments – Risk assessments can be used to target information systems,
                 IT products, or CIs having the most impact on security and organizational risk.
             •   Vulnerability scanning – Vulnerability scans can be used to target information
                 systems, IT products, or CIs that are most vulnerable. For example, the Common
                 Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is a specification within SCAP that provides
                 an open framework for communicating the characteristics of software flaw
                 vulnerabilities and in calculating their relative severity. CVSS scores can be used
                 to help prioritize configuration and patching activities.
             •   Degree of penetration – The degree of penetration represents the extent to
                 which the same product is deployed within an information technology
                 environment. For example, if an organization uses a specific operating system on
                 95 percent of its workstations, it may obtain the most immediate value by planning
                 and deploying secure configurations for that operating system. Other IT products
                 or CIs can be targeted afterwards.

       ii. Test Configurations
       Organizations fully test secure configurations prior to implementation in the production
       environment. There are a number of issues that may be encountered when implementing
       configurations including software compatibility and hardware device driver issues. For
       example, there may be legacy applications with special operating requirements that do not
       function correctly after a common secure configuration has been applied. Additionally,
       configuration errors could occur if OS and multiple application configurations are applied
       to the same component. For example, a setting for an application configuration parameter
       may conflict with a similar setting for an OS configuration parameter.

       Virtual environments are recommended for testing secure configurations as they allow
       organizations to examine the functional impact on applications without having to configure
       actual machines.

       iii. Resolve Issues and Document Deviations
       Testing secure configuration implementations may introduce functional problems within
       the system or applications. For example, the new secure configuration may close a port or
       stop a service that is needed for OS or application functionality. These problems are
       examined individually and either resolved or documented as a deviation from, or exception
       to, the established common secure configurations.

       In some cases, changing one configuration setting may require changes to another setting,
       another CI, or another information system. For instance, a common secure configuration
       may specify strengthened password requirements which may require a change to existing
       single sign-on applications. Or there may be a requirement that the OS-provided firewall be


CHAPTER 3                                                                                              PAGE 34
Special Publication 800-128    Guide for Security-Focused Configuration Management of Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________


       enabled by default. To ensure that applications function as expected, the firewall policy
       may need to be revised to allow specific ports, services, IP addresses, etc. When conflicts
       between applications and secure configurations cannot be resolved, deviations are
       documented and approved through the configuration change control process as appropriate.

       iv. Record and Approve the Baseline Configuration
       The established and tested secure configuration, including any necessary deviations,
       represents the preliminary baseline configuration and is recorded in order to support
       configuration change control/security impact analysis, incident resolution, problem solving,
       and monitoring activities. Once recorded, the preliminary baseline configuration is
       approved in accordance with organizationally defined policy. Once approved, the
       preliminary baseline configuration becomes the initial baseline configuration for the
       information system and its constituent CIs.

       The baseline configuration of an information system includes the sum total of the secure
       configurations of its constituent CIs and represents the system-specific configuration
       against which all changes are controlled.

       The baseline configuration may include, as applicable, information regarding the system
       architecture, the interconnection of hardware components, secure configuration settings of
       software components, the software load, supporting documentation, and the elements in a
       release package. There could be a different baseline configuration for each life cycle stage
       (development, test, staging, production) of the information system.

       When possible, organizations employ automated tools to support the management of
       baseline configurations and to keep the configuration information as up to date and near
       real time as possible. There are a number of solutions which maintain baseline
       configurations for a wide variety of hardware and software products. Some comprehensive
       SecCM solutions integrate the maintenance of baseline configurations with component
       inventory and monitoring tools.

       v. Deploy the Baseline Configuration
       Organizations are encouraged to implement baseline configurations in a centralized and
       automated manner using automated configuration management tools, automated scripts,
       vendor-provided mechanisms, etc.

Media libraries may be used to store, protect, and control the master copies of approved versions
of baseline configurations. Media may be the means to store information (paper, tapes,
CD/DVDs, USB drives, etc.) or the information itself (e.g., files, software code). The media
library may also include commercially licensed software, custom-developed software, and other
artifacts and documents generated throughout the SDLC.

3.3 CONTROLLING CONFIGURATION CHANGE
If organizations are to maintain secure configurations for their information systems in an
environment where technology is continually evolving and the number and seriousness of threats
is expanding, changes to system configurations need to be managed and controlled.

The following subsections describe the Controlling Configuration Changes phase activities. In
this phase, the activities are normally implemented at the system level following policy and
procedures. The following subsections are listed in the order in which the configuration activities
typically occur. As always, organizations have flexibility in determining which activities are
performed at what level and in what order. Completion of the Controlling Configuration Changes
phase results in implementation of access restrictions for change, and documented configuration
change control and security impact analysis processes.

3.3.1     IMPLEMENT ACCESS RESTRICTIONS FOR CHANGE

Access restrictions for change represent the enforcement side of SecCM. Configuration change
control is a process for funneling changes for an information system through a managed process;
however, without access restrictions, there is nothing preventing someone from implementing
changes outside of the process. Access restrictions are a mechanism to enforce configuration
control processes by controlling who has access to the information system and/or its constituent
CIs to make changes. Access restrictions for change may also include controlling access to
additional change-related information such as change requests, records, correspondence, change
test plans and results, etc.

To implement access restrictions for change:

         i. Determine the possible types of configuration changes that can be made in the
              information system including network, operating system, and application layers;
         ii. Determine which individuals have privileged access and which of those privileged
              individuals are authorized to make what types of changes; and
         iii. Implement technical mechanisms (e.g., role-based access, file/group permissions, etc.)
              to ensure that only authorized individuals are able to make the appropriate changes.

Expected Output: Appropriate access restrictions for change implemented for the system

3.3.2     IMPLEMENT THE CONFIGURATION CHANGE CONTROL PROCESS

A well-defined configuration change control process is fundamental to any SecCM program.
Configuration change control is the process for ensuring that configuration changes to an
information system are formally requested, evaluated for their security impact, tested for
effectiveness, and approved before they are implemented. Although the process may have
different steps and levels of rigor depending on organizational risk tolerance and/or system-
impact level, it generally consists of the following steps:

    i.   Request the change. A request for change may originate from any number of sources
         including the end user of the information system, a help desk, or from management.
         Proposed changes may also originate from vendor-supplied patches, application updates,
         security alerts, system scans, etc. See Appendix E for a Sample Change Request
         Template.

    ii. Record the request for the proposed change. A change request is formally entered into
        the configuration change control process when it is recorded in accordance with
        organizational procedures. Organizations may use paper-based requests, emails, a help
        desk, and/or automated tools to track change requests, route them based on workflow
        processes, and allow for electronic acknowledgements/approvals.

    iii. Determine if the proposed change requires configuration control. Some types of changes
         may be exempt from configuration change control or pre-approved as defined in the
         SecCM plan and/or procedures. If the change is exempt or pre-approved, note this on the
         change request and allow the change to be made without further analysis or approval;
         however, system documentation may still require updating (e.g., the System Security
         Plan, the baseline configuration, IS component inventory, etc.).

    iv. Analyze the proposed change for its security impact on the information system (see
        Section 3.3.3).

    v. Test the proposed change for security and functional impacts. Testing confirms the
       impacts identified during analysis and/or reveals additional impacts. The impacts of the
       change are presented to the CCB and to the AO.

    vi. Approve the change. This step is usually performed by the CCB. The CCB may require
        the implementation of additional controls if the change is necessary for mission
        accomplishment but has a negative impact on the security of the system and organization.
        Implementation of additional controls is coordinated with the AO and ISO.

    vii. Implement the approved change. Once approved, authorized staff makes the change.
         Depending upon the scope of the change, it may be helpful to develop an implementation
         plan. Change implementation includes changes to applicable/related configuration
         parameters as well as updating system documentation to reflect the change(s).
         Stakeholders (e.g., users, management, help desk, etc.) are notified about the change,
         especially if the change implementation requires a service interruption or alters the
         functionality of the information system. In the case of the latter situation, user and help
         desk training may be required.




CHAPTER 3                                                                                            PAGE 37
Special Publication 800-128   Guide for Security-Focused Configuration Management of Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________


    viii. Verify that the change was implemented correctly (e.g., vulnerability scans, post-
          implementation security and functionality analysis, reassessment of affected security
          controls, etc.). Configuration change control is not complete and a change request not
          closed until it has been confirmed that the change was deployed without issues. Although
          the initial security impact analysis and testing may have found no impact from the
          change, an improperly implemented change can cause its own security issues.

    ix. Close out the change request. With completion of the above steps, the change request is
        closed out in accordance with organizational procedures.

Changes are also evaluated for consistency with organizational enterprise architecture.

If configuration change control procedures have been defined by the organization, the
information system owner interprets the procedures in the context of the target information
system, and refines the process to make it practical to perform. These changes to the process may
need to be approved by the organizational CCB in accordance with SecCM policy.

It is important that IT operations and maintenance staff who support the information system are
active participants in the configuration change control process and are aware of their
responsibility for following it. If significant business process reengineering is needed, for
example, updating help desk activities or a patch management process, training may be required.

Unscheduled or Unauthorized Changes

Unfortunately, it is not uncommon to see activities such as deploying or disposing of hardware,
making changes to configurations, and installing patches occurring outside the configuration
change control process even though these activities can have a significant impact on the security
of an information system. Additionally, situations may arise that necessitate an unscheduled
(emergency) change. It is incumbent upon information system owners to identify all sources of
change to make certain that changes requiring configuration control go through the configuration
change control process, even if it is after the fact.

When unscheduled changes must be made and time does not allow for following the established
configuration change control process, unscheduled changes are still managed and controlled.
Organizations include instructions for handling unscheduled changes within the configuration
change control procedures as well as instructions for handling unauthorized changes that are
subsequently discovered. Configuration change control procedures also address flaw remediation
to allow rapid but controlled change to fix software errors. Unscheduled changes are
reviewed/resolved by the CCB as soon as is practical after unscheduled changes are made.

3.3.3       CONDUCT SECURITY IMPACT ANALYSIS

This is one of the most critical steps in the configuration change control process with respect to
SecCM. Organizations spend significant resources developing and maintaining the secure state of
information systems; failing to properly analyze a change for its security impact can undo this
effort and expose the organization to attack. The security impact analysis activity provides the
linkage between configuration change control and improved security. The management of
changes through a structured process has its own benefits – for instance, increased efficiency.
However, it is only when those changes are evaluated for their security impact that the
configuration change control process realizes benefits for the security posture of an information
system.

Very large organizations or ISOs of large and complex systems may find it helpful to create a
Configuration Review Board to manage and conduct security impact analyses and report the
findings to the relevant CCB.

Changes are examined for impact on security, and for mitigating controls that can be
implemented to reduce any resulting vulnerability. Security impact analyses are conducted by
individuals or teams with technical knowledge of the information system throughout the SDLC
such that the impact of changes on security is considered at every phase: 23

       •    Initiation Phase (Before a Change is Deployed)
            Security impact analysis before a change is deployed is critical in ascertaining whether
            the change will impact the secure state of the information system. The initial security
            impact analysis is conducted before the change is approved by the CCB. If there are
            security concerns with a change, they can be addressed/mitigated before time and energy
            are spent in building, testing, and/or rolling out the change.

       •    Development/Acquisition and Implementation/Assessment Phases
            Security impact analysis is not a one-time event conducted during the initiation phase to
            support the decisions of the CCB when approving changes. When the change is initially
            proposed and reviewed, the manner in which it will be built and implemented may not be
            known, something which can greatly influence the security impact of the change. For
            instance, for a custom-built component during the design phase, security impact analysis
            is performed on technical design documents to ensure that the design considers security
            best practices, implements the appropriate controls, and would not need to be
            redeveloped at a later date due to introduced vulnerabilities. Developers ensure that
            security is taken into account as they build the component, and the design is tested during
            implementation to confirm that expected controls were implemented and that no new or
            unexpected vulnerabilities were introduced.

       •    Operations and Maintenance Phase (After a Change is Deployed) – This confirms
            that the original security impact analysis was correct, and that unexpected vulnerabilities
            or impacts to security controls not identified in the testing environment have not been
            introduced. Additionally, the security impact of unscheduled and unauthorized changes is
            analyzed during the operations and maintenance phase.

Special Publication 800-128          Guide for Security-Focused Configuration Management of Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________


The process for a security impact analysis consists of the following steps:

       i.   Understand the Change - If the change is being proposed, develop a high-level
            architecture overview which shows how the change will be implemented. If the change
            has already occurred (unscheduled/unauthorized), request follow-up
            documentation/information and review it or use whatever information is available (e.g.,
            audit records, interview staff who made the change, etc.) to gain insight into the change.

       ii. Identify Vulnerabilities - If the change involves a COTS hardware or software product,
           identifying vulnerabilities may include, for example, a search of the National
           Vulnerability Database (NVD) 24 which enumerates vulnerabilities, user experience, etc.
           Organizations can leverage this information to address known issues and remove or
           mitigate them before they become a concern. Other public databases of vulnerabilities,
           weaknesses, and threats may also be searched (e.g., US-CERT). Some automated
           vulnerability scanning tools (SCAP-validated tools where possible) are able to search
           various public vulnerability databases that apply to IT products/CPE names of IT
           products. If the change involves custom development, a more in-depth analysis of the
           security impact is conducted. Although application security is beyond the scope of this
           publication, there are many best practices and useful sources of information for how to
           ensure the security of software code.

       iii. Assess Risks - Once a vulnerability has been identified, a risk assessment is needed to
            identify the likelihood of a threat exercising the vulnerability and the impact of such an
            event. Although vulnerabilities may be identified in changes as they are proposed, built,
            and tested, the assessed risk may be low enough that the risk can be accepted without
            remediation (i.e., risk acceptance). In other cases, the risk may be high enough that the
            change is not approved (i.e., risk avoidance), or that safeguards and countermeasures are
            implemented to reduce the risk (i.e., risk mitigation). 25

       iv. Assess Impact on Existing Security Controls - In addition to assessing the risk from the
           change, organizations analyze whether and how a change will impact existing security
           controls. For example, the change may involve installation of software that alters the
           existing baseline configuration, or the change itself may cause or require changes to the
           existing baseline configuration. The change may also affect other systems or system
           components that depend on the function or component being changed, either temporarily
           or permanently. For example, if a database that is used to support auditing controls is
           being upgraded to the latest version, auditing functionality within the system may be
           halted while the upgrade is being implemented.

       v. Plan Safeguards and Countermeasures - In cases where risks have been identified and
          are unacceptable, organizations use the security impact analysis to revise the change or to
          plan safeguards and countermeasures to reduce the risk. For instance, if the security
          impact analysis reveals that the proposed change causes a modification to a common
          secure configuration setting, plans to rework the change to function within the existing
          setting are initiated. If a change involves new elevated privileges for users, plans to
          mitigate the additional risk are made (e.g., submission of requests for higher clearance
          levels for those users or implementation of stronger access controls).

Expected Output: Identified vulnerabilities; risk assessment of identified vulnerabilities including

3.3.4       RECORD AND ARCHIVE

Once the change has been analyzed, approved, tested, implemented, and verified, the organization
ensures that updates have been made to supporting documents such as technical designs and
baseline configurations, in addition to security-related documentation such as System Security
Plans, Risk Assessments, Security Assessment Reports, and Plans of Action & Milestones. In
cases where there is high risk or where significant changes have been made, a system
reauthorization may be required.
As changes are made to baseline configurations, the new baseline becomes the current version,
and the previous baseline is no longer valid but is retained for historical purposes. If there are
issues with a production release, retention of previous versions allows for a rollback or restoration
to a previous secure and functional version of the baseline configuration. Additionally, archiving
previous baseline configurations is useful for incident response and traceability support during
formal audits. 26

3.4         SECCM MONITORING
If an information system is inconsistent with approved configurations as defined by the
organization’s baseline configurations of system CIs, the System Security Plan, etc., or an
organization’s component inventory is inaccurate, the organization may be unaware of potential
vulnerabilities and not take actions that would otherwise limit those vulnerabilities and protect it

26
     Archived baselines are protected in accordance with the system impact level.

from attacks. Monitoring activities offer the organization better visibility into the actual state of
security for its information systems and also support adherence to SecCM policies and
procedures. SecCM monitoring also provides input to the organization’s overall continuous
monitoring strategy. 27

Organizations implement the configuration monitoring strategy developed during the SecCM
planning phase. SecCM monitoring activities confirm that the existing configuration is identical
to the current approved baseline configuration, that all items in the component inventory can be
identified and are associated with the appropriate information system, and, if possible, whether
there are any unapproved (i.e., not recorded in the component inventory) components.
Unapproved components are often a major threat to security; they rarely have updated patches,
are not configured using the approved baseline configurations, and are not assessed or included in
the authorization to operate. For example, if a technician uses a router for testing and then forgets
to remove it, or if an employee sets up a wireless access point in a remote office without
management consent, the organization may be vulnerable without being aware of it.

3.4.1       ASSESSMENT AND REPORTING

SecCM monitoring is accomplished through assessment and reporting activities. For
organizations with a large number of components, the only practical and effective solution for
SecCM monitoring activities is the use of automated solutions that use standardized reporting
methods such as SCAP. An information system may have many components and many baseline
configurations. To manually collect information on the configuration of all components and
assess them against policy and approved baseline configurations is not practical, or even possible,
in most cases. Automated tools can also facilitate reporting for Security Information and Event
Management applications that can be accessed by management and/or formatted into other
reports on baseline configuration status. Care is exercised in collecting and analyzing the results
generated by automated tools to account for any false positives.

SecCM monitoring may be supported by numerous means, including, but not limited to:

       •   Scanning to discover components not recorded in the inventory. For example, after
           testing of a new firewall, a technician forgets to remove it from the network. If it is not
           properly configured, it may provide access to the network for intruders. A scan would
           identify this network device as not a part of the inventory, enabling the organization to
           take action.

       •   Scanning to identify disparities between the approved baseline configuration and the
           actual configuration for an information system. For example, a technician rolls out a new
           patch but forgets to update the baseline configurations of the information systems
           impacted by the new patch. A scan would identify a difference between the actual
           environment and the description in the baseline configuration enabling the organization
           to take action. In another example, a new tool is installed on the workstations of a few
           end users of the information system. During installation, the tool changes a number of
           configuration settings in the browser on the users’ workstations, exposing them to attack.
           A scan would identify the change in the workstation configuration, allowing the
           appropriate individuals to take action.

    •    Implementation of automated change monitoring tools (e.g., change/configuration
         management tools, application whitelisting tools). Unauthorized changes to information
         systems may be an indication that the systems are under attack or that SecCM procedures
         are not being followed or need updating. Automated tools are available that monitor
         information systems for changes and alert system staff if unauthorized changes occur or
         are attempted.

    •    Querying audit records/log monitoring to identify unauthorized change events.

    •    Running system integrity checks to verify that baseline configurations have not been
         changed.

    •    Reviewing configuration change control records (including system impact analyses) to
         verify conformance with SecCM policy and procedures.

When possible, organizations seek to normalize data to describe their information system in order
that the various outputs from monitoring can be combined, correlated, analyzed, and reported in a
consistent manner. SCAP provides a common language for describing vulnerabilities,
misconfigurations, and products and is an obvious starting point for organizations seeking a
consistent way of communicating across the organization regarding the security status of the
enterprise architecture (see Section 3.5).

When inconsistencies are discovered as a result of monitoring activities, the organization may
want to take remedial action. Action taken may be via manual methods or via use of automated
tools. Automated tools are preferable since actions are not reliant upon human intervention and
are taken immediately once an unauthorized change is identified. Examples of possible actions
include:

    •    Implementing nondestructive remediation actions (e.g., quarantining of unregistered
         device(s), blocking insecure protocols, etc.);
    •    Sending an alert with change details to appropriate staff using email;
    •    Rolling back changes and restoring from backups;
    •    Updating the inventory to include newly identified components; and
    •    Updating baseline configurations to represent new configurations.

Changes detected as a result of monitoring activities are reconciled with approved changes.
Specifically, reconciliation attempts to answer the following:

    •    Who made the change;
    •    Whether the change occurred in a scheduled maintenance window;
    •    Whether the change matches a previously detected and approved change; and
    •    Whether the change corresponds with an approved change request, help desk ticket, or
         product release.

Additionally, the results of monitoring activities are analyzed to determine the reason(s) that an
unauthorized change occurred. There are many potential causes for unauthorized changes. They
may stem from:

    •    Accidental or unintentional changes;
    •    Malicious intent/attacks;

    •    Individuals who believe configuration change control processes don’t apply to them;
    •    Individuals who aren’t aware of the configuration change control process;
    •    Errors made when changes are implemented; and
    •    A delay between introducing the change and updating the inventory and baseline
         configuration for the affected information systems;

Analyzing unauthorized changes identified through monitoring can not only identify
vulnerabilities, but can also give organizations insight into any potential systemic problems with
how the configuration change control process is managed. Once organizations are aware of any
such problems, they can take actions such as reengineering processes, implementing improved
access restrictions for change, and providing training on SecCM processes.

Finally, monitoring may support the generation of metrics related to SecCM activities. Analysis
and consolidation of monitoring reports can generate metrics such as the percentage of
information systems that are implemented in accordance with their approved baselines, the
percentage of IT products that are configured in accordance with the organizationally defined
common secure configurations, or percentage of information system changes that have been
subjected to security impact analyses. Thus, SecCM monitoring may also be a source of
information that supports metrics requirements associated with the organization’s overall
continuous monitoring process.

Results of SecCM monitoring are reported to management as defined by organizational policy
and the SecCM strategy. Various types of reporting may be needed to support compliance with
applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards and
guidelines.

The SecCM monitoring strategy and procedures are reviewed and revised to ensure that
organizational security requirements continue to be met.

SDLC Phase: Operations and Maintenance phase

Primary Roles: SISO (for implementing organization-wide monitoring tools and overseeing
monitoring activities potentially including engaging independent assessment teams); ISO (for
ensuring that configuration monitoring is implemented at the system level as defined in the
strategy)

Supporting Roles: ISSO; ISA; System/Software Developer

Expected Input: SecCM monitoring strategy; automated tools; IS component inventory; current
baseline configuration(s); audit records; System Security Plan/system security requirements

Expected Output: SecCM monitoring reports, including security assessment reports and output
from automated tools, as defined in the strategy and schedule

3.4.2     IMPLEMENT AND MANAGE TOOLS FOR SECCM MONITORING

SecCM monitoring tools identified during the planning phase are implemented and managed
during the monitoring phase. Some tools may support SecCM activities in multiple phases, i.e.,
tools may have already been implemented and supporting activities during the identifying and
implementing configurations phase and/or the controlling configuration changes phase. The

monitoring-related functionality of such tools is then leveraged and managed during the
monitoring phase.

Before implementing automated monitoring tools, organizations conduct a security impact
analysis to ensure that the tools do not have a negative effect on the existing enterprise
architecture as a whole or on individual information systems/components.

It is important to note that automated tools may not support or be able to function with all
organizational systems or all components within a system. Organizations document the systems
and/or components that are not monitored via automated tools and a manual process is developed
and implemented for those systems/components.

SDLC Phase: Implementation phase

Primary Roles: SecCM Program Manager; ISO

Supporting Roles: SISO (if s/he is not the SecCM Program Manager); CIO; AO; ISSO; ISA;
System/Software Developer

Expected Input: Configuration monitoring strategy; enterprise architecture information and/or
system architecture information; tools identified during the planning phase, information about
other IT products with which monitoring tools will interface

Expected Output: Implemented configuration monitoring tools

3.5         USING SECURITY CONTENT AUTOMATION PROTOCOL (SCAP) 28
SCAP is a protocol currently consisting of a suite of specifications 29 that standardize the format
and nomenclature by which security software communicates information about software flaws
and secure configurations. SCAP-enabled tools can be used for maintaining the security of
enterprise systems, such as automatically verifying the installation of patches, checking system
security configuration settings, and examining systems for signs of compromise.

To automate configuration management and produce assessment evidence for many NIST SP
800-53 controls, federal agencies use SCAP-enabled tools along with SCAP-expressed checklists.
SCAP-expressed checklists are customized as appropriate to meet specific organizational
requirements. SCAP-expressed checklists can map individual system configuration settings to
their corresponding high-level security requirements. These mappings can help demonstrate that
the implemented settings adhere to requirements. The mappings are embedded in SCAP-
expressed checklists which allow SCAP-enabled tools to automatically generate standardized
assessment and compliance evidence. This can provide a substantial savings in effort and cost. If
SCAP-enabled tools are not available or are not currently deployed within an organization,
organizations plan ahead by implementing SCAP-expressed checklists for their common secure
configurations in order to be well positioned when SCAP-enabled tools become available and/or
are deployed.

APPENDIX F

BEST PRACTICES FOR ESTABLISHING SECURE
CONFIGURATIONS
Although there is no one-size-fits-all approach to SecCM, there are practices that organizations
consider when developing and deploying secure configurations. These include:

1. Use Common Secure Configurations for Settings

Organizations consider available common secure configurations as the basis for establishing
secure configuration settings. A comprehensive source for information on configuration settings
is the National Checklist Program (http://checklists.nist.gov). These checklists cover a wide range
of commercial products and are written in a standardized format to facilitate automatic
assessment through SCAP-enabled tools.

         Achieving Security);

         Configuration Checklist;

         and Developers; and
NIST SP 800-117: Guide to Adopting and Using the Security Content Automation Protocol
         (SCAP); and
http://nvd.nist.gov.

2. Centralize Policy and Common Secure Configurations for Configuration Settings

Where possible and appropriate, secure configurations are developed and implemented in a top-
down approach to ensure consistency across the organization. An example is the implementation
of the group policy functionality, which can be used to distribute secure configuration policy in a
centralized manner throughout established domains. Exceptions to the organization’s policy may
be needed to tailor configurations for a particular information system to support local constraints
or requirements. Such exceptions are documented and approved as a part of the baseline
configuration for that information system.

References: None.

3. Tailor Secure Configurations According to System/Component Function and Role

Secure configuration settings are tailored to the system component’s function. For example, a
server acting as a Windows domain controller may require stricter auditing requirements (e.g.,
auditing successful and unsuccessful account logons) than a file server. A public access Web
server in a DMZ may require that fewer services are running than in a Web server behind an
organization’s firewall supporting an intranet.

4. Eliminate Unnecessary Ports, Services, and Protocols (Least Functionality)

Devices are configured to allow only the necessary ports, protocols, and services in accordance
with functional needs and the risk tolerance in the organization. Open ports and available
protocols and services are an inviting target for attackers, especially if there are known
vulnerabilities associated with a given port, protocol, or service. Sources such as the NIST
National Vulnerability Database (NVD) are available for highlighting vulnerabilities in various
system components.

References: http://nvd.nist.gov/.

5. Limit the Use of Remote Connections

While connecting remotely to information systems allows more flexibility in how users and
system administrators accomplish their work, it also opens an avenue of attack popular with
hackers. Use of remote connections is limited to only those absolutely necessary for mission
accomplishment.

6. Develop Strong Password Policies

Passwords are a common mechanism for authenticating the identity of users and if they are
poorly implemented or used, an attacker can undermine the best secure configuration.
Organizations stipulate password policies and related requirements with the strength appropriate
for protecting access to the organization’s assets.

       Applications; and
NIST SP 800-135: Recommendation for Existing Application-Specific Key Derivation Functions.


7. Implement Endpoint Protection Platforms (EPPs)

Personal computers are a fundamental part of any organization’s information system. They are an
important source of connecting end users to networks and information systems, and are also a
major source of vulnerabilities and a frequent target of attackers looking to penetrate a network.
User behavior is difficult to control and hard to predict, and user actions, whether it is clicking on
a link that executes malware or changing a security setting to improve the usability of their PC,
frequently allow exploitation of vulnerabilities. Commercial vendors offer a variety of products to
improve security at the “endpoints” of a network. These EPPs include:

         a. Anti-malware

         Anti-malware applications are part of the common secure configurations for system
         components. Anti-malware software employs a wide range of signatures and detection
         schemes, automatically updates signatures, disallows modification by users, run scans on
         a frequently scheduled basis, has an auto-protect feature set to scan automatically when a
         user action is performed (e.g., opening or copying a file), and may provide protection
         from zero-day attacks. For platforms for which anti-malware software is not available,
         other forms of anti-malware such as rootkit detectors may be employed.

         b. Personal Firewalls

         Personal firewalls provide a wide range of protection for host machines including
         restriction on ports and services, control against malicious programs executing on the
         host, control of removable devices such as USB devices, and auditing and logging
         capability.

         c. Host-based Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS)

         Host-based IDPS is an application that monitors the characteristics of a single host and
         the events occurring within that host to identify and stop suspicious activity. This is
         distinguished from network-based IDPS, which is an intrusion detection and prevention
         system that monitors network traffic for particular network segments or devices and
         analyzes the network and application protocol activity to identify and stop suspicious
         activity.

________________________________________________________________________________________________


         d. Restrict the use of mobile code

         Organizations exercise caution in allowing the use of "mobile code" such as ActiveX,
         Java, and JavaScript. An attacker can easily attach a script to a URL in a Web page or
         email that, when clicked, will execute malicious code within the computer’s browser.

NIST SP 800-47: Security Guide for Interconnecting Information Technology Systems;
NIST SP 800-54: Border Gateway Protocol Security; and
NIST SP 800-94: Guide to Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS).

8. Use Cryptography

In many systems, especially those processing, storing, or transmitting information that is
moderate impact or higher for confidentiality, cryptography is considered as a part of an
information system’s secure configuration. There are a variety of places to implement
cryptography to protect data including individual file encryption, full disk encryption, Virtual
Private Network connections, etc.

       Algorithms and Key Lengths.

9. Develop a Patch Management Process

A robust patch management process is important in reducing vulnerabilities in an information
system. As patches greatly impact the secure configuration of an information system, the patch
management process is integrated into SecCM at a number of points within the four SecCM
phases including:

    •    Performing security impact analysis of patches;
    •    Testing and approving patches as part of the configuration change control process;
    •    Updating baseline configurations to include current patch level;
    •    Assessing patches to ensure they were implemented properly; and
    •    Monitoring systems/components for current patch status.

10. Control Software Installation

The installation of software is a point where many vulnerabilities are introduced into an
organization’s information system. Malware or insecure software can give attackers easy access
to an organization’s otherwise tightly protected network. Although the simplest approach is to
lock down computers and manage software installation centrally (i.e., at the organizational level),
this is not always a viable option for some organizations. Other methods for controlling the
installation of software include:

    •    Whitelisting – All software is checked against a list approved by the organization;
    •    Checksums – All software is checked to make sure the code has not changed;
    •    Certificate – Only software with signed certificates from a trusted vendor is used;
    •    Path or domain – Only software within a directory or domain can be installed; and
    •    File extension – Software with certain file extensions such as .bat cannot be installed.

The following is a sample template for a CCB charter that can be used within a SecCM program.
Organizations are encouraged to adapt it to suit their needs.

                    Configuration Control Board Charter
PURPOSE
<Describe the objectives of the CCB. It might say something like:“The Configuration Control
Board (CCB) represents the interests of program and project management by ensuring that a
structured process is used to consider proposed changes and incorporate them into a specified
release of a product. The CCB shall request that impact analysis of proposed changes be
performed, review change requests, make decisions, and communicate decisions made to affected
groups and individuals.” Define the relationship of this CCB to any other CCBs in the
organization or other decision-making bodies, such as a project steering committee.>

SCOPE OF AUTHORITY
<Indicate the scope of decisions that the CCB makes. This scope could be over a specific
organizational range; a project, group of projects (program), or subproject; a maximum budget
or schedule impact. This scope boundary separates decisions that this CCB can make from those
that it must escalate to a higher-level CCB or manager for resolution.>

MEMBERSHIP
<List the members of this CCB. The CCB typically includes representatives from program
management, project management, software engineering, hardware engineering, testing,
documentation, customer support, and marketing. One individual is designated as the CCB
Chair. Keep the CCB as small as possible, to facilitate its ability to make rapid decisions, but
make sure that the critical perspectives are represented.>

OPERATING PROCEDURES
<State the frequency of regularly scheduled CCB meetings and the conditions that will trigger a
special meeting. Describe how meetings will be conducted, the number of CCB members who
constitute a quorum to make decisions at a meeting, and the roles that must be represented for the
meeting to proceed. Identify whether guest participants may attend, such as the individuals who
proposed the change requests being considered at a specific meeting.>

DECISION-MAKING PROCESS
<Describe how the CCB will make its decisions. Indicate whether voting, consensus, unanimity,
delegation to a specific individual, or some other decision rule is used to make decisions. State
whether the CCB Chair or another manager is permitted to overrule the CCB’s collective
decision.>

COMMUNICATING STATUS
<Describe how each decision that the CCB makes will be communicated to the individual who
requested the change, senior management, project management, affected team members who
must implement the change, higher- or lower-level CCBs, and any other stakeholders. Indicate
where the decisions and any supporting information, rationale, or data will be stored.>
