                                NATIONAL CHECKLIST PROGRAM FOR IT PRODUCTS—GUIDELINES FOR CHECKLIST USERS AND DEVELOPERS




Executive Summary

A security configuration checklist (also called a lockdown, hardening guide, or benchmark) is a series of
instructions for configuring a product to a particular operational environment. Checklists can comprise
templates or automated scripts, patches or patch descriptions, Extensible Markup Language (XML) files,
and other procedures. Checklists are intended to be tailored by each organization to meet its particular
security and operational requirements. Some checklists also contain instructions for verifying that the
product has been configured properly. Typically, checklists are created by IT vendors for their own
products; however, checklists are also created by other organizations with the necessary technical
competence, such as academia, consortia, and government agencies. The use of well-written, standardized
checklists can markedly reduce the vulnerability exposure of IT products. Checklists can be particularly
helpful to small organizations and to individuals with limited resources for securing their systems.

NIST maintains the National Checklist Repository, which is a publicly available resource that contains a
variety of security configuration checklists for specific IT products or categories of IT products. The
repository, which is located at http://checklists.nist.gov/, contains metadata that describes each checklist.
Users can browse and search the metadata to locate a particular checklist using a variety of criteria,
including the product category, vendor name, and submitting organization. Having a centralized checklist
repository makes it easier for organizations to find the current, authoritative versions of security
checklists and to determine which ones best meet their needs.

This document is intended for users and developers of security configuration checklists. For checklist
users, this document makes recommendations for how they should select checklists from the NIST
National Checklist Repository, evaluate and test checklists, and apply them to IT products. The document
also provides general information to users about threats and baseline technical security practices for
associated operational environments. For checklist developers, this document sets forth the policies,
procedures, and general requirements for participation in the NIST National Checklist Program (NCP).

Major recommendations made in this document for checklist users and developers include the following:

Organizations should apply checklists to operating systems and applications to reduce the number
of vulnerabilities that attackers can attempt to exploit and to lessen the impact of successful attacks.

There is no checklist that can make a system or product 100 percent secure, and using checklists does not
eliminate the need for ongoing security maintenance, such as patch installation. However, using checklists
that emphasize both hardening of systems against software flaws (e.g., by applying patches and
eliminating unnecessary functionality) and configuring systems securely will typically reduce the number
of ways in which the systems can be attacked, resulting in greater levels of product security and
protection from future threats. Checklists can also be used to verify the configuration of some types of
security controls for system assessments, such as confirming compliance with certain Federal Information
Security Management Act (FISMA) requirements or other sets of security requirements.

Federal agencies are required to use appropriate security configuration checklists from the NCP when
available. In February 2008, revised Part 39 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) was published.
Paragraph (d) of section 39.101 states, ―In acquiring information technology, agencies shall include the
appropriate IT security policies and requirements, including use of common security configurations
available from the NIST website at http://checklists.nist.gov. Agency contracting officers should consult
with the requiring official to ensure the appropriate standards are incorporated.‖1 Also, FISMA (section
3544(b)(2)(D)(iii)) requires each Federal agency to determine minimally acceptable system configuration

requirements and to ensure compliance with them. Accordingly, Federal agencies, as well as vendors of
products for the Federal government, should acquire or implement and share such checklists using the
NIST repository. NIST encourages checklist developers to assert mappings to the security controls
delineated in NIST SP 800-53 to facilitate FISMA compliance checking for Federal agencies.2

Organizations should consider the availability of security configuration checklists during their IT product
selection processes.

When selecting checklists, checklist users should carefully consider the degree of automation and
the source of each checklist.

NIST has defined four tiers of checklists to assist checklist users in being able to readily identify the
major differences among checklists. The tiers range from Tier I checklists, which are prose-based with
narrative descriptions of how a person can manually alter a product’s configuration, to Tier IV checklists,
which have all security settings documented in machine-readable, standardized Security Content
Automation Protocol (SCAP) formats; have been validated by NIST or a NIST-recognized authoritative
entity for interoperability with SCAP-validated products; and have vetted mappings between low-level
security settings (for example, standardized identifiers for individual security configuration issues) and
high-level security requirements as represented in security frameworks (for example, SP 800-53 controls
for FISMA).

When multiple checklists are available for a particular product, organizations should take into
consideration the tier of each checklist. Generally, checklists from higher tiers can be used more
consistently and efficiently than checklists at lower tiers. There may be other significant differences
among checklists that are not indicated by the tier; for example, one checklist may include software
bundled with an operating system (e.g., web browser, and email client) while another checklist addresses
that operating system only. Another example is the assumptions on which the checklists are based (e.g.,
environment, threat model). A checklist user should identify such differences and determine which
checklist(s) seem appropriate and merit further analysis.

If it is not clear which checklist(s) should be analyzed, users from Federal civilian agencies should first
search for government-authorized or mandated checklists.3 In general, users should search for NIST-
produced checklists, which are tailored for civilian agency use. If no NIST-produced checklist is
available, then agency-produced checklists from the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) or the
National Security Agency (NSA) should be used if available. If formal government-authored checklists
do not exist, then organizations are encouraged to use vendor-produced checklists. If vendor-produced
checklists are not available, then checklists from other trusted third parties may be used.

Checklist users should customize and test checklists before applying them to production systems.

A checklist that is not mandatory for an organization to adopt should be considered a baseline for an
organization to customize. Although the baseline settings are based on sound knowledge of security
threats and vulnerabilities, they cannot take into account organization-specific security and operational
requirements, existing security controls, and other factors that may necessitate changes to the baseline.
Organizations should carefully evaluate the baseline settings and give them considerable weight, then
make any changes necessary to adapt the settings to the organization’s environment, requirements,
policies, and security objectives. This is particularly true for checklists intended for an environment with

    Organizations are also encouraged to include information in their checklists that supports mapping to other sets of
    requirements, such as HIPAA.
3
    The Office of Management and Budget’s (OMB’s) Federal Desktop Core Configuration (FDCC) is an example of a
    government-mandated checklist. More information about OMB’s FDCC can be found at http://fdcc.nist.gov/.


                                                            ES-2
                              NATIONAL CHECKLIST PROGRAM FOR IT PRODUCTS—GUIDELINES FOR CHECKLIST USERS AND DEVELOPERS




significantly different security needs. All deviations from the baseline settings should be documented for
future reference, and include the reason behind each deviation and the impact of deviating from the
baseline setting.

Before applying a checklist that will be used to alter product settings, users should first test it on non-
critical systems, preferably in a controlled non-operational environment. Each checklist in the NIST
repository has been tested by its developer, but there are often significant differences between a
developer’s testing environment and an organization’s operational environment, and some of these
differences may affect checklist deployment. In some cases, a security control modification can have a
negative impact on a product’s functionality and usability, or on other products or security controls.
Consequently, it is important to perform testing to determine the impact on system security, functionality,
and usability; to document the results of testing; and to take appropriate steps to address any significant
issues.

Checklist users should take their operational environments into account when selecting checklists,
and checklist developers should target their checklists to one or more operational environments.

Checklists are significantly more useful when they can run in common operational environments. The
NCP has identified several broad and specialized operational environments, such as Standalone and
Managed, and at least one of the environments should be common to most of the audiences. Thoroughly
identifying and describing these environments will make it easier for users to select the checklists that are
most appropriate for their particular operating environments, and will allow developers to better target
their checklists to the general security baselines associated with their operating environments.

NIST strongly encourages IT product vendors to develop security configuration checklists for their
products and contribute them to the NIST National Checklist Repository.

NIST encourages IT product vendors to develop security configuration checklists for their products, since
the vendors have the most expertise on the possible security configuration settings and the best
understanding of how the settings relate to and affect each other.

Vendors that create security configuration checklists should submit them for inclusion in the National
Checklist Repository through the NCP. The NCP provides a process and guidance for developing
checklists in a consistent fashion. For checklist developers, steps include initial development of the
checklist, checklist testing, documenting the checklist according to the guidelines of the NCP, and
submitting a checklist package to NIST. NIST screens the checklist according to program requirements
and then releases the checklist for public review, which typically lasts 30 to 60 days. After the public
review period and subsequent resolution of issues, the checklist is listed on the NIST checklist repository
with its metadata. NIST periodically asks checklist developers to review their checklists and to provide
updates as necessary. NIST retires or archives checklists as they become outdated or incorrect.

                               NATIONAL CHECKLIST PROGRAM FOR IT PRODUCTS: GUIDELINES FOR CHECKLIST USERS AND DEVELOPERS




1.    Introduction

1.1       Authority

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed this document in furtherance of its
statutory responsibilities under the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002,
Public Law 107-347, and also under the Cyber Security Act, which tasks NIST to ―develop, and revise as
necessary, a checklist setting forth settings and option selections that minimize the security risks
associated with each computer hardware or software system that is, or is likely to become widely used
within the Federal Government.‖

NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements, for
providing adequate information security for all agency operations and assets, but such standards and
guidelines shall not apply to national security systems. This guideline is consistent with the requirements
of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Section 8b(3), ―Securing Agency
Information Systems,‖ as analyzed in A-130, Appendix IV: Analysis of Key Sections. Supplemental
information is provided in A-130, Appendix III [3].

This guideline has been prepared for use by federal agencies. It may be used by nongovernmental
organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright, though attribution is desired.

Nothing in this document should be taken to contradict standards and guidelines made mandatory and
binding on federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory authority, nor should these
guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the Secretary of Commerce,
Director of the OMB, or any other Federal official.

1.2       Purpose and Scope

This document describes security configuration checklists and their benefits, and explains how to use the
NIST National Checklist Program (NCP) to find and retrieve checklists. The document also describes the
policies, procedures, and general requirements for participation in the NCP.

1.3       Audience

This document was created for current and potential checklist developers and users in both the public and
private sectors. Checklist developers include information technology (IT) vendors, consortia, industry,
government organizations, and others in the public and private sectors. Checklist users include end users,
system administrators, and IT managers within government agencies, corporations, small businesses, and
other organizations, as well as private citizens.

It is assumed that readers of this document are familiar with general computer security concepts.

2.      The NIST National Checklist Program

Maintaining secure networks and hosts continues to increase in importance. Widespread electronic attacks
on all computer systems have become commonplace. There are many threats to users’ computers, ranging
from remotely launched exploitations of network services to malicious code spread through emails,
malicious websites, and downloads of infected files. Vulnerabilities in IT products (e.g., operating
systems and applications) are discovered almost daily, and many ready-to-use exploitation techniques are
widely available on the Internet. Also, because IT products often are intended for a wide variety of
audiences, restrictive security controls are usually not enabled by default, which means that many IT
products are immediately vulnerable in their out-of-the-box configuration.

Complicating this situation is that today’s systems and products can be complex to administer and
difficult to secure. For example, the personal computer systems of today are far more complicated and
sophisticated than yesterday’s systems, and many if not most users and administrators cannot be expected
to manage them securely without assistance. It is a complicated, arduous, and time-consuming task even
for experienced system administrators to know what a reasonable set of security settings is for many
different IT products. However, security is important to all audiences, from individual home users to large
enterprise end users, because all systems face threats. In some cases, home and telecommuter user
systems may benefit from the same strong security controls that are usually found in larger organizations
because they face common threats via use of the Internet.

Although the solutions to IT security are complex, one simple yet effective tool is the security
configuration checklist. To facilitate development of security configuration checklists and to meet the
requirements of the Cyber Security Research and Development Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-305)
(CSRDA), NIST developed the National Checklist Program (NCP) for IT Products. This section contains
an overview of the NCP. It begins by describing the contents of checklists and giving examples of the
types of IT products for which checklists are often created. It next explains the benefits of using security
configuration checklists, such as improving baseline levels of security for an organization. It also explains
the goals and benefits of the NCP, which include increasing the quality, usability, and availability of
checklists. This section also provides an overview of the procedures for checklist users and developers, as
well as a summary of FISMA-related guidance pertaining to use of configuration checklists.

2.1         Security Configuration Checklists

A security configuration checklist (also referred to as a lockdown guide, hardening guide, security guide,
security technical implementation guide [STIG], or benchmark)4 is essentially a document that contains
instructions or procedures for configuring an IT product to an operational environment. Some checklists
also contain instructions or procedures for verifying that the product has been configured properly. Using
well-written, standardized checklists can reduce the vulnerability exposure of IT products and be
particularly helpful to small organizations and individuals in securing their systems. Checklists can be
developed not only by IT vendors, but also by other organizations with technical competence in IT
product security. A security configuration checklist might include any of the following:




4
      From this point on in this document, the term checklist (used according to CSRDA terminology) is used to describe a
      security configuration checklist or what other literature may refer to as a lockdown guide, hardening guide, or benchmark
      configuration.


                                                               2-1
                                     NATIONAL CHECKLIST PROGRAM FOR IT PRODUCTS: GUIDELINES FOR CHECKLIST USERS AND DEVELOPERS




 Configuration files that automatically set or verify various security settings (e.g., executables, security
  templates that modify settings, Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) XML files, and
  scripts).5
 Documentation (e.g., text file) that guides the checklist user to manually configure an IT product
 Documents that explain the recommended methods to securely install and configure a device
 Policy documents that set forth guidelines for such things as auditing, authentication mechanisms
  (e.g., passwords), and perimeter security.
Not all instructions in a security configuration checklist address security settings. Checklists can also
include administrative practices that improve an IT product’s security. Often, successful attacks on
systems result from poor administrative practices, such as not changing default passwords or not applying
vendor patches.

Typically, a system administrator or end user follows the instructions in the checklist to configure a
product or system to the baseline level of security implemented in the checklist or to verify that a product
or system is already configured properly. The system administrator may need to modify the checklist to
incorporate the local security policy.

Examples of the types of devices and software for which security checklists are intended are as follows:

 General-purpose operating systems
 Common desktop applications such as email clients, web browsers, word processors, personal
  firewalls, and antivirus software
 Infrastructure devices such as routers, firewalls, virtual private network (VPN) gateways, intrusion
  detection systems (IDS), wireless access points, and telecommunication systems
 Application servers such as Domain Name System (DNS), Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
  (DHCP), web, Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), and database servers
 Other network devices such as mobile devices, scanners, printers, copiers, and faxes.
2.2         Benefits of Using Security Checklists

Security configuration checklists, when developed correctly, can help users configure IT products to
security baselines that offer more protection than the installed out-of-the-box defaults. Applying
checklists to operating systems and applications can reduce the number of vulnerabilities that attackers
can attempt to exploit and lessen the impact of successful attacks. Using checklists improves the
consistency and predictability of system security, particularly in conjunction with user training and
awareness activities and other supporting security controls. Additional benefits associated with using
checklists include the following:

 Provides a baseline level of security to protect against common and dangerous local and remote
  threats (e.g., viruses and worms, denial-of-service attacks, unauthorized access, and inappropriate
  usage)

                              NATIONAL CHECKLIST PROGRAM FOR IT PRODUCTS: GUIDELINES FOR CHECKLIST USERS AND DEVELOPERS




 Verify the configuration of certain technical security controls for system assessments, such as
  confirming compliance with certain FISMA requirements or other sets of requirements, and
  understanding the exposure caused by misconfigurations
 Significantly reduces the time required to research and develop appropriate security configurations
  for installed IT products
 Allows smaller organizations to leverage outside resources to implement recommended practice
  security configurations
 Reduces the likelihood of public loss of confidence or embarrassment resulting from a compromise of
  publicly accessible systems.
Although using security configuration checklists can significantly improve overall levels of security in
organizations, using a checklist cannot make a system or a product 100 percent secure. However, using
checklists that emphasize hardening of systems against the hidden software flaws will typically result in
greater levels of product security and protection from future threats (e.g., zero-day vulnerabilities). IT
vendors that configure their products using checklists that adhere to the FISMA-associated security
control baselines will not only provide more consistency in configuration settings within the federal
agencies but also provide a much more cost-effective method for establishing and verifying the minimum
configuration settings, even if the agencies must modify the original checklists provided by checklist
developers to fine-tune the configuration settings for their specific applications and operational
environments.

2.3      Overview of NIST National Checklist Program

Many organizations have created checklists; however, these checklists vary widely in terms of quality and
usability, and they may become outdated as software updates and upgrades are released. Without a central
checklist repository, finding security checklists can be difficult. In addition, checklists may differ
significantly from one another in terms of the level of security provided. Also, it may be difficult to
determine if the checklist is current or how the checklist should be implemented.

To facilitate development of security configuration checklists for IT products and to make checklists more
organized and usable, NIST established the NCP. The goals of the NCP are to—

 Facilitate development and sharing of checklists by providing a formal framework for vendors and
  other checklist developers to submit checklists to NIST
 Provide guidance to developers to help them create standardized, high-quality checklists that conform
  to common operational environments
 Help developers and users by providing guidelines for making checklists better documented and more
  usable
 Encourage software vendors and other parties to develop checklists
 Provide a managed process for the review, update, and maintenance of checklists
 Provide an easy-to-use repository of checklists
 Provide checklist content in a standardized format
 Encourage the use of automation technologies for checklist application.

                                   NATIONAL CHECKLIST PROGRAM FOR IT PRODUCTS: GUIDELINES FOR CHECKLIST USERS AND DEVELOPERS




Federal agencies are required to use appropriate security configuration checklists from the NCP when
available. In February 2008, revised Part 39 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) was published.
Paragraph (d) of section 39.101 states, ―In acquiring information technology, agencies shall include the
appropriate IT security policies and requirements, including use of common security configurations
available from the NIST website at http://checklists.nist.gov. Agency contracting officers should consult
with the requiring official to ensure the appropriate standards are incorporated.‖6

2.3.1     Types of Checklists Listed by National Checklist Program

The NCP deals with checklists that are tied to specific IT products, such as a checklist for a specific brand
and model of a router. Some checklists may guide a user to other checklists. For example, a checklist for a
database product may reference the checklist for the operating system on which the database product runs.
The NCP includes two major groups of checklists:

 Automated. An automated checklist is one that is used through one or more tools that automatically
  alter or verify settings based on the contents of the checklist. Many checklists are written in
  Extensible Markup Language (XML), and there are special tools that can use the contents of the XML
  files to check and alter system settings.7 For example, the Security Content Automation Protocol
  (SCAP) is commonly used to express checklist content in a standardized way that can be processed
  by tools that support SCAP.
 Non-Automated. As the name implies, a non-automated checklist is one that is designed to be used
  manually, such as English prose instructions that describe the steps an administrator should take to
  secure a system or to verify its security settings.
Security configuration checklists in the NCP can help organizations meet FISMA requirements. FISMA
requires each agency to determine minimally acceptable system configuration requirements and to ensure
compliance with them. Checklists can also map specific technical control settings to the corresponding
NIST SP 800-53 controls, which can make the verification of compliance more consistent and efficient.
Accordingly, federal agencies, as well as vendors of products for the federal government, are encouraged
to acquire or develop and to share such checklists using the NIST repository. The development and
sharing of checklists can reduce what would otherwise be a ―reinvention of the wheel‖ for IT products
that are widely used in the federal government, such as common operating systems, servers, and client
applications.

The NIST checklist repository (located at http://checklists.nist.gov/) contains automated and non-
automated checklists that have been developed and screened to meet the requirements of the NCP. Users
can browse checklist descriptions to locate and retrieve a particular checklist using a variety of different
fields, including such fields as product category, vendor name, and submitting organization. A mailing
list for the checklist program is available at http://nvd.nist.gov/home.cfm?emaillist.

    The Extensible Checklist Configuration Description Format (XCCDF) is an XML-based format for automating tool usage
    and eliminating interpretation issues. The XCCDF XML format can be used for both technical checklists (e.g., operating
    systems, software applications, and hardware configurations) and non-technical checklists (e.g., physical security for IT
    systems). More information on XCCDF is available from NIST Interagency Report (IR) 7275 Revision 3, Specification for
    the Extensible Configuration Checklist Description Format (XCCDF) Version 1.1.4, which is available for download at
    http://nvd.nist.gov/scap/xccdf/docs/xccdf-spec-1.1.4-20071102.pdf. Another XML-based format for checklists is the Open
    Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL), which is used to exchange technical details about how to check for the
    presence of vulnerabilities and configuration issues on systems. More information on OVAL is available at
    http://oval.mitre.org/.

2.3.2    Procedures for Users and Developers

The general steps involved in acquiring and using checklists are simple and straightforward—

    1. Users gather their local requirements (e.g., IT products, the operating environment, and
       associated security needs) and then acquire or purchase the IT product that best suits their needs.
    2. Users browse the checklist repository to retrieve checklists that match the user’s operational
       environment and security requirements. If a product is intended to be secure out-of-the-box (e.g.,
       it was secured by the vendor using a security configuration checklist), it is still important to check
       the NIST checklist repository for updates to that checklist.
    3. Users review the checklists and select the checklist that best meets their requirements, then tailor
       and document the checklist as necessary to take into account local policies and functional
       requirements, test the checklist, and provide feedback to NIST and checklist developers.
    4. Users prepare to deploy the checklist, such as making configuration or data backups, and then
       apply the checklist in production.
Section 4 provides more details on the activities and considerations associated with each step. The
checklist description fields, used when browsing checklists, are summarized in Appendix B.

For checklist developers, the process includes two stages. The first stage involves actions by only the
developer; the second stage involves interactions among NIST, the developer, and public reviewers. The
first stage consists of four steps—

    1. The developer becomes familiar with the procedures and requirements of the NCP and completes
       an agreement to participate in the program.
    2. The developer creates, tests, and refines the checklist.
    3. The developer documents the checklist according to the guidelines of the NCP.
    4. The developer prepares a checklist submission package and submits it to NIST.
In stage two, NIST performs the remaining four steps, with interaction from the developer and public
reviewers—

    5. NIST screens the checklist according to program requirements and addresses any issues with the
       developer.
    6. A public review of the checklist is conducted, which typically lasts 30 to 60 days. Comments
       submitted during the review are addressed as applicable by the developer and NIST.
    7. NIST posts the checklist on the repository and announces its presence.
    8. Periodic updates are made to the checklist and the issue of checklist archival is addressed.

3.      Operational Environments for Checklists

Checklists are significantly more useful if they can be associated with generic operational environments.
However, it is difficult and sometimes impossible to specify these environments in detail; they must by
necessity be general so that they are useful to a wide range of audiences. The NCP identifies several
broad and specialized operational environments, at least one of which should be common to most
audiences. Identifying and describing these environments allows developers to better target their
checklists to the general security requirements associated with the environments, and allows end users to
more easily select the checklists that are most appropriate for their environments.

This section describes the operational environments defined for the NCP, and the general threat
description and baseline technical security practice for each environment. The two broad operational
environments are referred to as Standalone (or Small Office/Home Office [SOHO]) and Managed (or
Enterprise). Three typical Custom environments, which could be subsets of the broader environments, are
Specialized Security-Limited Functionality (SSLF), Legacy, and Federal Desktop Core
Configuration (FDCC).

Users of IT products may find it useful to consult this section of the document when initially identifying
their own security requirements and needs (outlined in detail in Section 4). Developers may find this
section useful when building checklists because tailoring checklist development to these environments
and their policies will enable developers to create checklists for diverse products but still adhere to the
general uniform technical security practices and settings associated with the environments. This is
discussed in detail in Section 5. Before submitting a checklist to NIST, developers should ensure they
have the most recent version of this document because updates to the criteria for operational
environments may occur periodically. The most recent version is available as a separate file at
http://checklists.nist.gov/.8

3.1         Background

When planning security, it is essential to first define the threats that must be mitigated. Knowledge of
potential threats is important to understanding the reasons behind the various baseline technical security
practices presented in this document.

The threat discussions for each environment represent the major threat categories that were considered
when selecting the environments and their associated baseline practices. Many threats against data and
resources are possible because of mistakes—either software flaws and weak configuration settings in
operating system and application software that create exploitable vulnerabilities, or errors made by end
users and administrators. Threats may involve intentional actors (e.g., attacker who wants to access
information on a system) or unintentional actors (e.g., administrator who forgets to disable user accounts
of a former employee.) Threats can be local, such as a disgruntled employee, or remote, such as an
attacker in another geographical area. Organizations that use checklists should conduct risk assessments
to identify the specific threats against their systems and determine the effectiveness of existing security
controls in counteracting the threats; they then should perform risk mitigation to decide what additional
measures (if any) should be implemented, as discussed in the NIST Risk Assessment Guide for
Information Technology Systems [8]. Performing risk assessments and mitigation helps organizations
better understand their needs and decide whether or not they need to modify or enhance selected
checklists.

      NIST may, as new information becomes available, update the criteria and information for the operational environments as
      well as other criteria contained in this document.


                                                              3-1
                               NATIONAL CHECKLIST PROGRAM FOR IT PRODUCTS: GUIDELINES FOR CHECKLIST USERS AND DEVELOPERS




The checklist environment baseline technical security practices are based on commonly accepted
technical security principles and practices, catalogued in various NIST Special Publications (SP) [4], [5],
[16] and other sources such as the Department of Defense (DoD) Information Assurance Technical
Framework [26]. In particular, NIST SP 800-27, Engineering Principles for Information Technology
Security (A Baseline for Achieving Security) [6], contains a set of engineering principles for system
security that provide a foundation upon which a more consistent and structured approach to the design,
development, and implementation of IT security capabilities can be constructed. Section 5.1 contains a
detailed discussion of the security-related criteria recommended for developers when building checklists.

3.2       Standalone Environment

The Standalone environment, also referred to as Small Office/Home Office (SOHO), describes small,
informal computer installations that are used for home or business purposes. This environment
encompasses a variety of small-scale environments and devices, such as laptops, mobile devices, home
computers, and remote systems (e.g., telecommuting systems and small branch offices). For technical and
business (economic) reasons, SOHO systems are generally not managed remotely. Figure 3-1 shows a
typical Standalone network architecture.

The Standalone environment assumes the following end-user audiences and operational settings:

 Home users with standalone systems, generally with dial-up or high-speed access to the Internet,
  possibly using wired or wireless home networks, and possibly sharing resources across the networks
 Telecommuters using standalone systems who work from a home office
 Small businesses, typically with small networks of standalone desktop systems and small office
  servers protected from direct Internet access by a firewall, but possibly including some small centrally
  managed networks of desktop systems and products, and typically not maintaining publicly accessible
  servers
 Other small organizations with similar functions.
Standalone environments are typically the least secured. The individuals who perform system
administrator duties on Standalone systems are assumed to be less knowledgeable about security, which
often results in environments that are less secure than they should be because the focus is on functionality.
In some cases, there may be no network-based security controls such as firewalls, so Standalone systems
may be directly exposed to external attacks. Standalone environments are frequently targeted for
exploitation—not necessarily to acquire information, but instead to attack other computers or incidentally
as collateral damage from the propagation of a worm.

Standalone checklists should be relatively simple to understand and implement by home users or novice
system administrators in small organizations.

Because the primary threats in Standalone environments are external and because Standalone devices
generally have less restrictive security policies than Managed or Specialized Security-Limited
Functionality systems, they tend to be most vulnerable to attacks from remote threats. Local threats are
often less significant because few people typically have local access to Standalone systems; however, it is
still important to protect against local and other threats. Standalone systems typically are exposed to
attacks against network services and by malicious payloads (e.g., viruses and worms). These attacks are
most likely to affect availability (e.g., crashing the system, consuming all network bandwidth, breaking
functionality), but they also may affect integrity (e.g., infecting data files) and confidentiality (e.g.,
providing remote access to sensitive data and emailing data files to others).


                                                       3-2

                        Figure 3-1: Home Office Standalone Environment Example



The baseline technical security practices for the Standalone environment include protecting IT systems
and products from the common out-of-the-box configuration vulnerabilities, blocking external access to
the network, and restricting local access when possible. The adoption of inexpensive, hardware-based
firewall routers and personal firewalls can help secure Standalone environments. Another key to
Standalone security is strengthening the hosts on the Standalone network by patching vulnerabilities and
altering settings to restrict unneeded services and applications. Some commonly accepted security
practices for Standalone environments include the following:

 Use of small hardware firewall appliances at Internet connections to block inbound connections and
  to filter outbound traffic, if feasible
 Use of personal firewall products on Standalone systems
 Application (e.g., antivirus software, web browser, and email client) and operating system updates
  patches applied regularly
 Web and email clients configured to filter and block traffic/messages that could contain malicious
  content
 Unnecessary applications disabled (e.g., personal web servers, Simple Network Management Protocol
  [SNMP], messaging)
 Encryption used for wireless network traffic and as appropriate for other traffic
 Restrictions on which systems/users can connect to wired and wireless local area networks (LAN)


                                                      3-3
                                      NATIONAL CHECKLIST PROGRAM FOR IT PRODUCTS: GUIDELINES FOR CHECKLIST USERS AND DEVELOPERS




 Restrictions on user privileges
 Restrictions on sharing resources such as directories or printers
 Backup and recovery procedures
 Physical security procedures.
NIST and other security publications can be consulted for additional guidance in security practices related
to Standalone environments. Users may find the guidance on system administration for Microsoft
Windows systems [18], telecommuting [14], and wireless network security [15], [21] particularly useful.
NIST has a variety of security-related SPs and general security guidance available on its computer
security website.9

3.3          Managed Environment

The Managed environment, also referred to as Enterprise, typically contains large organizational
systems with defined suites of hardware and software configurations, usually consisting of centrally
managed IT products (e.g., workstations and servers) protected from direct Internet access by firewalls
and other network security devices. Figure 3-2 shows a typical Enterprise network architecture. For
example, it would include networked printers and multi-function devices, managed workstations, and
internal servers.

The Managed environment audience generally includes medium to large businesses, large governmental
agencies, and organizations requiring managed telecommuting systems and remote offices. Managed
checklists are intended for advanced end users and system administrators in a medium to large
organization. Managed environments typically have a group of individuals dedicated to supporting users
and providing security. The combination of structure and skilled staff allows security practices to be
implemented during initial system deployment and during ongoing support and maintenance. The
managed nature of typical Managed environments gives administrators centralized control over various
settings on workstations, servers, and other types of devices, as well as the sharing of resources (e.g., file
servers and printers). The enterprise enables only the services needed for normal business operations, with
other possible avenues of exploit removed or disabled. Authentication, account, and policy management
can also be administered centrally to maintain a consistent security posture across an organization.

Remote and local threats to Managed networks could have significant impacts on systems and
applications. Managed organizations often have systems with permanent, well-known IP addresses and
name spaces with high visibility on the Internet. Most systems on Managed networks are inward-facing—
protected from direct exposure to the Internet by firewalls—but penetrations of those systems through
other means could allow an intruder to gain access to internal networks. For example, viruses and worms
could spread across homogenous networks in a short time. Also, in Managed environments, the insider
threat is generally greater than in a Standalone environment because the Managed environment has a
larger number of users.

The Managed environment is more restrictive and provides less functionality than the Standalone
environment. However, Managed environments typically have better control over the flow of various
types of traffic, such as filtering traffic based on protocols and ports at the enterprise’s connections with
external networks. Because of the supported and largely homogeneous nature of the Managed
environment, it is typically easier to use more functionally restrictive settings in Managed environments
than in Standalone environments. Managed environments also tend to implement several layers of defense

(e.g., firewalls, antivirus servers, IDSs, patch management systems, and email filtering), which provides
greater protection for systems.




                            Figure 3-2: Centrally Managed Environment Example

In the Managed environment, systems are typically susceptible to local and remote threats. Local attacks,
such as unauthorized use of another user’s workstation, most often lead to a loss of confidentiality (e.g.,
unauthorized access to data), but also may lead to a loss of integrity (e.g., data modification) or
availability (e.g., theft of a system). Remote threats may be posed not only by attackers outside the
organization, but also by local users who are attacking other local systems across the organization’s
network. Most security breaches caused by remote threats involve malicious payloads sent by external
parties, such as viruses and worms acquired from emails or infected websites. Threats against network-
based applications tend to affect a smaller number of systems and may be caused by internal or external

parties. Both malicious payloads and network application attacks are most likely to affect availability
(e.g., crashing the system, consuming all network bandwidth, and breaking functionality), but also may
affect integrity (e.g., infecting data files) or confidentiality (e.g., providing remote access to sensitive
data). Data disclosure threats tend to come from internal parties who are monitoring traffic on local
networks, and they primarily affect confidentiality.

Some commonly accepted security practices for Managed environments are as follows:

 Segmented internal networks with internal firewalls and other defense-in-depth techniques
 Centralized management of systems with highly restricted local user access
 Centralized management of security-related applications such as antivirus software
 Automated installation of system and application patches and updates
 Restricted access to printer and multi-function devices and their features
 Centralized systems for log monitoring
 Centralized backup and recovery facilities.
Security publications can be consulted for additional guidance in security practices related to Managed
environments. NIST has produced a variety of SPs that are particularly useful for the Managed
operational environment. Relevant publications available from the NIST security website include
guidance for system administration of Microsoft Windows systems [18], wireless network security [15],
[21], active content and mobile code [7], security patches [10], firewalls [11], information security testing
[22], and incident handling [17], [20].

3.4       Specialized Security-Limited Functionality Custom Environment

A Custom environment contains systems in which the functionality and degree of security do not fit the
other types of environments. Specialized Security-Limited Functionality (SSLF) is a typical Custom
environment that is highly restrictive and secure; it is usually reserved for systems that have the highest
threats and associated impacts. Typical examples of such systems are outward-facing web, email, and
DNS servers, other publicly accessed systems, and firewalls. It also encompasses computers that contain
confidential information (e.g., central repository of personnel records, medical records, and financial
information) or that perform vital organizational functions (e.g., accounting, payroll processing, and air
traffic control). These systems might be targeted by third parties for exploitation, but also might be
targeted by trusted parties inside the organization. Because systems in an SSLF environment are at high
risk of attack or data exposure, security takes precedence over functionality. The systems’ data content or
mission purpose is of such value that aggressive tradeoffs in favor of security outweigh the potential
negative consequences to other useful system attributes such as legacy applications or interoperability
with other systems.

An SSLF environment could be a subset of another environment. For example, three desktops in a
Managed environment that hold the organization’s confidential employee data could be thought of as an
SSLF environment within a Managed environment. In addition, a laptop used by a mobile worker (e.g.,
organization management) might be an SSLF environment in a Standalone environment. An SSLF
environment might also be a self-contained environment outside any other environment, such as a
government security installation processing sensitive data.

                               NATIONAL CHECKLIST PROGRAM FOR IT PRODUCTS: GUIDELINES FOR CHECKLIST USERS AND DEVELOPERS




SSLF checklists are intended for experienced security specialists and seasoned system administrators who
understand the impact of implementing strict technical security practices. If home users and other users
who do not have security expertise attempt to apply SSLF checklists to their systems, they typically
experience unwanted limitations on system functionality and cause possibly irreparable system damage.

Systems in the SSLF environment face the same threats as systems in Managed environments. Most
recommendations for systems in SSLF environments are intended to thwart external threats; SSLF
systems may be directly connected to the Internet, and as in the Managed environment, may have
permanent, well-known IP addresses and name spaces with high visibility. Systems may be subject to
automated intrusions and denial-of-service attacks as well as to manual intrusions, and penetration of
firewalls and servers could lead to local attacks and intrusions. In addition, the threat of local attacks may
be high if the systems are connected to large networks with many users; conversely, the threat of local
attacks may be less if the systems are connected to smaller networks. Because of the risks and possible
consequences of a compromise, this environment usually has the most functionally restrictive and secure
configuration. The suggested configuration provides the greatest protection, with considerable tradeoffs to
ease of use, functionality, and remote system management.

It is difficult to specify technical security practices except in general terms because many disparate types
of systems and applications could, depending on how they are used, qualify as SSLF. However, it is likely
that the following general practices and controls will be applicable:

 Systems should generally process as few types of data as possible (e.g., do not combine multiple
  server applications on the same system).
 Systems should be stripped of all unnecessary services and applications.
 If possible, host-based firewall applications should be used.
 Systems should have as few users as possible.
 The strongest possible authentication should be used (e.g., authentication token, biometrics, and smart
  cards).
 Remote administration or access should be restricted; if used, connections should be encrypted.
 Security-related operating system and application patches and updates should be tested and applied as
  soon as possible.
 Systems should be placed behind firewalls and other network security devices that restrict access and
  filter unnecessary protocols.
 Intrusion detection logs and other logs should be monitored frequently.
 Vulnerability assessment tools should be run against the systems frequently.
 System administrators should be highly skilled in the appropriate technologies.
NIST and other organizations have recommended security practices for firewalls [11], web servers [12],
and email servers [13]. The publications mentioned previously for the Standalone and Managed
environments also should be consulted for detailed recommendations.

3.5      Legacy Environments

A Legacy environment is another example of a Custom environment. A Legacy environment contains
older systems or applications that may need to be secured to meet today’s threats, but they often use older,
less secure communication mechanisms and need to be able to communicate with other systems. Non-
legacy systems operating in a Legacy environment may need less restrictive security settings so that they
can communicate with legacy systems and applications. Legacy environments are often subsets of other
environments.

An example of a Legacy environment is shown in Figure 3-4. Warehouse workers use wireless personal
digital assistant (PDA) devices to collect inventory for shipping and receiving. The PDAs cannot be
inexpensively upgraded to support wireless protocols with strong encryption capabilities. However, the
location and structure of the warehouse prevents easy intercepts of the wireless traffic. Due to cost
considerations, a risk determination was made and a Legacy environment checklist was created for the
server/wireless access point (WAP). In such cases, compensating controls, such as configuring each
application used by the PDAs to encrypt its communications, are typically needed to provide the
protection that the legacy protocols cannot.

                                Figure 3-4: Legacy Environment Example



Figure 3-5 shows another simple example of a Legacy environment in which older workstations must be
part of a network that uses more recent server technology. The older workstations cannot support newer,
more robust aspects of the newer technology, such as a more secure file-sharing protocol, file system, or
authentication protocol. Consequently, modifications must be made to support the legacy workstations. In
this case, the server would require a Legacy environment checklist.

3.6         Federal Desktop Core Configuration (FDCC) Environments

A Federal Desktop Core Configuration (FDCC) environment is another example of a Custom
environment. An FDCC environment contains systems that need to be secured using an Office of
Management and Budget (OMB) mandated security configuration known as the FDCC. As of mid-2009,
FDCC security configurations exist for Microsoft Windows XP Professional Service Pack 2 and later,
Windows Vista Enterprise Service Pack 1 and later, Internet Explorer 7, Windows XP firewall, and
Windows Vista firewall. The Windows XP FDCC is based on the DoD customization of the SSLF
recommendations in NIST SP 800-68 and DoD customization of the recommendations in Microsoft’s
Security Guide for Internet Explorer 7.0. The Windows Vista FDCC is based on DoD customization of
the Microsoft Security Guides for both Windows Vista and Internet Explorer 7.0. Microsoft’s Vista
Security Guide was produced through a collaborative effort with DISA, NSA, and NIST, and the guide
reflects the consensus recommended settings from DISA, NSA, and NIST for the Windows platform. The
FDCC configurations are broader than previous configurations for Windows XP and Windows Vista,
incorporating settings for Web browsers, personal firewalls, and other software not included in earlier
configuration efforts. The FDCC settings also include non security-related settings aimed at improving
performance, compatibility, and interoperability.

FDCC checklists are intended to be applied to systems primarily through automated tools. The
recommended method is to implement most FDCC settings using group policies as managed with
Microsoft Group Policy Objects (GPO): most of the FDCC settings may be implemented through GPOs,
with the remaining settings implemented locally through .inf files, batch files, or manual methods.10
These latter methods may also be used by smaller organizations to implement all the FDCC configuration
settings. Organizations should thoroughly test FDCC checklists before deploying them in operational
environments because a number of FDCC settings, such as cryptographic algorithm options and wireless
services, may impact system functionality. Settings may also be checked through automated means for
compliance with FDCC checklists. According to OMB, FDCC checklists are required to be assessed
using SCAP-validated products, ―Both industry and government information technology providers must
use SCAP validated tools with FDCC Scanner capability to certify their products operate correctly with
FDCC configurations and do not alter FDCC settings.‖11

Because the FDCC checklists are intended to be deployed primarily to managed systems, the basic
characteristics of Managed environments, such as primary threats against the systems and baseline
technical security practices for the systems, are also basic characteristics of FDCC environments. Section
3.3 contains additional information on Managed environments.

4.    Checklist Usage

This section describes a high-level process for checklist users to follow when retrieving and using
checklists. Although all checklist users, ranging from home users to system administrators at large
organizations, have their own specific requirements, the process described will apply to most situations.
This section includes guidance on conducting an initial analysis of local environment threats and risks,
and lists the potential impacts of such attacks. It then describes a process for selecting and retrieving
checklists from the NIST checklist repository, and recommends steps for analyzing, tailoring, and
applying the checklist.

Figure 4-1 shows the general process for using checklists. In Step 1, a prospective checklist user analyzes
local requirements and security needs or policy and identifies the appropriate operational environment
model. The user then selects the IT product that best matches those needs. In Step 2, the user browses the
NIST repository for checklists that match the IT product and the selected operational environment (and
possibly other criteria, such as whether the checklist can be rolled back or whether it is supported by the
product vendor). The user downloads the checklists along with any supporting documents and tools. In
Step 3, the user reviews the downloaded checklists and then tests and customizes them to reflect local
policy and functionality as needed. Feedback on the checklists can be sent to NIST and the developer via
the repository. In Step 4, the user prepares to apply the checklists in production by backing up

                               NATIONAL CHECKLIST PROGRAM FOR IT PRODUCTS: GUIDELINES FOR CHECKLIST USERS AND DEVELOPERS




information that might be affected if the application of the checklists is not successful or if it causes
unanticipated problems. Finally, the checklists are applied to production systems. The following sections
describe the details of the activities included in each of these steps.

4.1       Determining Local Requirements

Organizations usually conduct a requirements analysis before actually selecting and purchasing a
particular IT product. Such an analysis would include identifying the needs of the organization (what the
product must do) and the security requirements for the product (e.g., relevant security policies). Individual
end users can conduct the same process, although it could be quite informal. Because it is difficult to add
security later, it is best to assess requirements upfront when incorporating security into IT operations, big
or small.

NIST SP 800-30, Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems [8], contains useful
guidance for federal agencies on conducting a requirements analysis and a subsequent risk assessment.
Organizations use risk assessments to determine the extent of the potential threat and the risk associated
with an IT system or product throughout its life cycle. The output of this process helps to identify
appropriate controls for reducing or eliminating risk. (Risk is a function of the likelihood of a given
threat-source taking advantage of a particular potential vulnerability and the resulting impact of that
adverse event on the organization.) Organizations other than federal agencies can also benefit from
following the methodology presented in SP 800-30.

The methodology includes steps that are straightforward and simple, even for an individual home user
who may not be especially savvy with regard to IT security. Important steps include the following:

 Identify Functional Needs. What must the product do? Identifying upfront the end user’s
  requirements, such as remote access for telecommuters or a web server to make internal information
  available to employees, is necessary to ensure that the security controls selected are appropriate; that
  is, that they implement an appropriate security solution and still allow the system to meet its
  requirements for functionality.
 Identify Threats and Vulnerabilities. A threat is the potential for a particular threat-source to
  successfully exercise a particular vulnerability. A vulnerability is a weakness that can be accidentally
  triggered or intentionally exploited. The goal of this step is to identify potential threat-sources that are
  applicable to the IT product or system being considered, as well as the vulnerabilities that could be
  exploited by the potential threat-sources.
 Identify Security Needs. The goal of this step is to determine the controls needed to minimize or
  eliminate the likelihood (or probability) of a threat exercising a product or system vulnerability. It
  answers the question, ―What security features must the product provide?‖ Armed with this
  information, the organization can make wiser choices about which IT product best meets its needs.
Federal agencies conduct formal requirements analysis and risk assessments as outlined in SP 800-30. For
any organization or individual, the threat discussions and general security practices associated with each
operational environment described in Section 3 can help identify threats and vulnerabilities and
recommended security policies. For example, a home user could study the discussion in Section 3 on the
Standalone operational environment before purchasing a product (assuming that the home user’s
environment matches the description of a Standalone environment). Given that the home user understands
the requirements and the type of product that should be acquired, the home user can use the Standalone
environment’s security model and general recommendations to make an informed choice about which
product best meets the needs.



                                                       4-2
                                      NATIONAL CHECKLIST PROGRAM FOR IT PRODUCTS: GUIDELINES FOR CHECKLIST USERS AND DEVELOPERS




NIST has also written several documents and guides to help federal agencies when selecting information
security products and when acquiring and using tested/evaluated products [5], [9]. Another key resource
available at NIST for identifying vulnerability-related information about IT products is the National
Vulnerability Database (NVD).12 This website provides a search engine for identified system
vulnerabilities and information on patches that are available to correct the vulnerabilities.

4.2          Browsing and Retrieving Checklists

After determining local requirements and identifying an IT product, a checklist user is ready to browse
the NIST checklist repository. Figure 4-2 shows an example of the repository home page. To help users
obtain checklists that can be processed by SCAP-validated products, the checklists are sorted by default
according to tier (described later in this section), from tier IV to tier I. Within each tier, the checklists are
also sorted by default based on checklist authority (see the end of Section 4.2 for details). Users can
browse the checklists based on the checklist tier, IT product, IT product category, or authority, and also
through a keyword search that searches the checklist name and summary for user-specified terms. As
shown in Figure 4-2, the search results show the detailed checklist metadata and a link to any SCAP
content for the checklist, as well as links to any supporting resources associated with the checklist.




                                    Figure 4-2: NIST Checklist Repository Home Page



Selecting a particular checklist will show a description template, shown in Figure 4-3, that includes
extensive information to help users decide whether the checklist will suit their specific purposes. (The list
and definition of all the fields used to describe each checklist is presented in Appendix B.)

in the description will be more important than others. Table 4-1 lists fields that should be helpful to all
users in determining whether the checklist meets their specific needs.

                            The checklist tier (Tier I, II, III, or IV).
                                Tier I checklists are prose-based, such as narrative descriptions of how a person can
                                 manually alter a product’s configuration.

                                Tier II checklists document their recommended security settings in a machine-
                                 readable but non-standard format, such as a proprietary format or a product-specific
                                 configuration script. These checklists may include some elements of SCAP (for
                                 example, they may contain CCE identifiers), but do not meet the Tier III
                                 requirements.

                                Tier III checklists use SCAP to document their recommended security settings in
                                 machine-readable standardized SCAP formats that meet the definition of “SCAP
 Tier                            Expressed” specified in NIST SP 800-126 [29]. Tier III checklists can be processed
                                 by SCAP-validated tools, which are products that have been validated by an
                                 accredited independent testing laboratory as conforming to applicable SCAP
                                 specifications and requirements.

                                Tier IV checklists include all properties of Tier III checklists. Additionally, Tier IV
                                 checklists are considered production-ready and have been validated by NIST or a
                                 NIST-recognized authoritative entity to ensure, to the maximum extent possible,
                                 interoperability with SCAP-validated products. Tier IV checklists also demonstrate the
                                 ability to map low-level security settings (for example, standardized identifiers for

                      If it is not clear which checklists(s) should be analyzed, users from Federal civilian

                      for NIST-produced checklists, which are tailored for civilian agency use. If no NIST-
                      produced checklist is available, then agency-produced checklists from the Defense
                      Information Systems Agency (DISA) or the National Security Agency (NSA) should be
                      used. If no “Governmental Authority” checklists exist, the user should search for checklists

Some checklists address more than one application or operating system, such as several products from a
single organization. To help users navigate the site from the checklist detail page, a Checklist Group link
is available; it represents the grouping of checklists based on a common source material. For example, the
DISA Desktop Checklist contains configuration settings for multiple products including browsers and
antivirus products. The NCP decomposes the checklist metadata according to these individual targets, but
keeps them conveniently linked to the same source document via the Checklist Group.

In some cases, multiple checklists are available for a particular version of a product. Such checklists are
often similar, but they have important differences, such as the degree of automation provided and the
target audience (e.g., providing general recommendations versus complying with Federal agency-specific
requirements). To assist checklist users in being able to readily identify the major differences among
checklists, NIST has defined four tiers of checklists. The minimum requirements for each tier are listed
below.

 Tier I checklists are prose-based, such as narrative descriptions of how a person can manually alter a
  product’s configuration.
 Tier II checklists document their recommended security settings in a machine-readable but non-
  standard format, such as a proprietary format or a product-specific configuration script. These
  checklists may include some elements of SCAP (for example, they may contain CCE identifiers), but
  do not meet the Tier III requirements.
 Tier III checklists use SCAP to document their recommended security settings in machine-readable
  standardized SCAP formats that meet the definition of ―SCAP Expressed‖ specified in NIST SP 800-
  126 [29]. Tier III checklists can be processed by SCAP-validated tools, which are products that have
  been validated by an accredited independent testing laboratory as conforming to applicable SCAP
  specifications and requirements.
 Tier IV checklists include all properties of Tier III checklists. Additionally, Tier IV checklists are
  considered production-ready and have been validated by NIST or a NIST-recognized authoritative
  entity to ensure, to the maximum extent possible, interoperability with SCAP-validated products. Tier
  IV checklists also demonstrate the ability to map low-level security settings (for example,
  standardized identifiers for individual security configuration issues) to high-level security
  requirements as represented in various security frameworks (e.g., SP 800-53 controls for FISMA),
  and the mappings have been vetted with the appropriate authority.
Table 4-2 summarizes the main differences in the requirements for the four tiers.

                         to high-level security requirements.       categorization (e.g., SP 800-53 controls).


Each checklist, regardless of tier, should provide checklist metadata, security configuration
recommendations, and a description of the threat model on which the recommendations are based.

When multiple checklists are available for a particular product, organizations should take into
consideration the tier of each checklist. Generally, checklists from higher tiers can be used more
consistently and efficiently than checklists at lower tiers. There may be other significant differences
among checklists that are not indicated by the tier; for example, one checklist may include software
bundled with an operating system (e.g., web browser, and email client) while another checklist addresses
that operating system only. Another example is the assumptions on which the checklists are based (e.g.,
environment, threat model). A checklist user should identify such differences and determine which
checklist(s) seem appropriate and merit further analysis. If it is not clear which checklist(s) should be
analyzed, users from Federal civilian agencies should first search for government-authorized or mandated
checklists. In general, users should search for NIST-produced checklists, which are tailored for civilian
agency use. If no NIST-produced checklist is available, then agency-produced checklists from the
Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) or the National Security Agency (NSA) should be used if
available. If formal government-authored checklists do not exist, then organizations are encouraged to use
vendor-produced checklists. If vendor-produced checklists are not available, then checklists from other
trusted third parties may be used.

Organizations often submit checklists with associated alphanumeric version identifiers (e.g., R1.2.0).
Unfortunately; these identifiers do not have universal meanings. Some organizations may change the
version number when new checks are added, old technology is deleted, patches are added, or simply
based on a review date. Conversely, other organizations may update their checklist and not change the
version numbers.

To clarify updates to checklists, NCP uses the concept of a ―Checklist Revision.‖ A Checklist Revision
indicates that something has changed even if the version identifier did not change. For example, if the
organization does not change the version number on the document, but the content has been updated (e.g.,
patches were added for a given month), the current checklist will be archived and the checklist with the
updated patch content will show as the current checklist. Likewise, if the submitting organization updates
the version identifier, then the NCP will archive the current checklist and link to the new checklist. From
the checklist detail page, a user can navigate to the checklist history via the ―Archived Revisions‖ link.

4.3          Reviewing, Customizing and Documenting, and Testing Checklists

Checklist users should download all documentation for the checklist and review it carefully. The
documentation should explain any required preparatory activities, such as backing up a system. Because a
checklist may not exactly match a user’s specific requirements, reviewing a checklist is useful in
determining whether the checklist may need to be modified14 and whether the system or product will
require further changes after applying the checklist.

The user’s review can identify the impact on an organization’s current policies and practices if a given
security checklist is used (e.g., having JavaScript disabled in a browser might make some web pages
unusable). An organization may determine that some aspects of the checklist do not conform to certain
organization-specific security and operational needs and requirements. Organizations should carefully
evaluate the baseline settings and give them considerable weight, then make any changes necessary to
adapt the settings to the organization’s environment, requirements, policies, and security objectives.15
This is particularly true for checklists intended for an environment with significantly different security
needs. Organizations should tailor the checklists to reflect local rules, regulations, and mandates; for
example, federal civilian agencies would need to ensure that checklists reflect compliance with FIPS 140
encryption requirements. Because the checklist may be used many times within the organization, the
checklist itself might need to be modified. This is especially likely if the checklist includes a script or
template to be applied to systems.

At this point, all deviations from the baseline settings in the checklist should be documented for future
reference. The documentation should include the reason behind each deviation, including the impact of
retaining the baseline setting and the impact of deviating from the baseline setting. This documentation
helps in managing changes to the baseline over the life cycle of the product being secured. Feedback on
the checklist can be sent to NIST as well as to the checklist developers. Feedback is especially important
to developers in gauging whether the checklist is well written and the settings are applicable to the
targeted environment.

Before applying a checklist that will be used to alter product settings, users should first test it on non-
critical systems, preferably in a controlled non-operational environment. (Such testing may be difficult for
home or small business users who do not have extra systems and networks for testing purposes.) Each
checklist in the NIST checklist repository has been tested by its developer, but there are often significant
differences between a developer’s testing environment and an organization’s operational environment,
and some of these differences may affect checklist deployment. The testing configuration of the IT
product should match the deployment configuration. In some cases, a security control modification can
have a negative impact on a product’s functionality and usability, or on other products or security
controls. For example, installing a patch could inadvertently break another patch, or enabling a firewall
could inadvertently block antivirus software from updating its signatures or disrupt patch management
software. Consequently, it is important to perform testing to determine the impact on system security,
functionality, and usability; to document the results of testing; and to take appropriate steps to address any
significant issues. Section 4.4 contains recommendations for performing backups and other suggestions to
prevent or recover from potential damage or unwanted effects that could occur if applying an untested
checklist.

Before using a checklist to verify product settings without altering them, users should test it. If the
checklist is automated, users should also test the tool or tools that will be used with the checklist to ensure

14
      If multiple checklists are available for the same product, the checklist user may wish to compare the settings or steps in the
      selected checklist to the other checklists to see which settings or steps differ and determine if any of these alternate
      recommendations should be used.
15
      This may not be applicable to checklists that are mandatory for an organization to adopt.


                                                                 4-9
                                 NATIONAL CHECKLIST PROGRAM FOR IT PRODUCTS: GUIDELINES FOR CHECKLIST USERS AND DEVELOPERS




that they do not inadvertently disrupt the functionality of the system or alter the configuration of the
product. Checklist testing should be performed to identify discrepancies between the expected and actual
settings, which could indicate errors in the checklist, such as environment-specific characteristics for
which the checklist was not modified.

4.4        Applying Checklists to IT Products

A checklist can be applied to an IT product in one of two ways: modifying the product’s settings or
verifying the existing settings. The following provides recommendations for both ways of applying
checklists:

 Setting Modification

      – Each checklist will include specific installation instructions to help with deployment. Even after
          review and testing, users should handle deployment carefully to minimize any issues that might
          arise from applying a security checklist.

      – For users who are unable to test a checklist in a non-operational environment (e.g., home users), it
          is important to carefully review the checklist documentation completely and to determine if an
          initial backup is required. The Rollback Capability field in the checklist description (see Table 4-
          1) will indicate whether the results of applying the checklist can be reversed to return the product
          to its original configuration. Regardless of this setting, it is strongly recommended that a user
          back up the IT product’s configuration before installing the checklist recommendations.

      – At a minimum, users should back up all critical data files in their computing environment. If
          possible, the user should make a full backup of the system to ensure that the system can be
          restored to its pre-checklist state if necessary. (Making a full backup is recommended before
          making any major system change; it does not apply only to implementing a checklist.) Large
          organizations should also follow this procedure and, if possible, first select several operational
          systems as pilots to provide ―real-world‖ testing for the checklist before enterprise-wide
          deployment.
 Setting Verification

      – Each checklist will include specific installation instructions to assist with using it to verify
          settings. Even after review and testing, users should handle verification carefully to ensure that
          product settings are not inadvertently altered.
After initially applying a checklist, an organization may need to acquire and apply revised versions of the
checklist in the future. Depending on the product being secured, a checklist may be updated periodically
based on a set schedule or updated as needed, frequently or infrequently. For selected checklists, NIST
may maintain a mailing address list of users, and users who subscribe to the list will receive
announcements of updates or other issues connected with the checklist. Instructions for subscribing to the
mailing address list will be included in the selected checklist’s description on the checklist repository. An
organization that acquires an updated checklist would perform the same steps already described in this
section while taking advantage of knowledge gained and documented from applying previous versions of
the checklist.

NIST welcomes all feedback, ―bug‖ reports, comments, and suggestions from checklist users in regard to
individual checklists or the repository itself. Where applicable, NIST will encourage feedback from
checklist users so that the developers are better able to gauge the effectiveness and appropriateness of
their checklists.

5.    Checklist Development

This section describes the general process for developing security configuration checklists and submitting
them to the NCP. It includes an overview of the process NIST will follow to screen the checklist
submissions and publish them in its repository, and the process NIST and developers will follow to
update the checklist or to archive the checklist. Individual developers and organizations that want to
submit checklists to NIST should review the appendices of this document, which contain the
administrative requirements for participation in the NCP. Before submitting a checklist to NIST,
developers should ensure they have the most recent version of this document. The most recent version is
available as a separate file at http://checklists.nist.gov/.

The life-cycle steps shown in Figure 5-1 are straightforward. Each step should be carried out to ensure the
checklist is accurate, tested, and documented during its development and subsequent publication, update,
or archival. The following sections describe considerations for each step.

5.1         Background on Security-Related Criteria for Checklists

This section discusses the security-related criteria that NIST recommends developers follow to enhance
consistency of the technical security policy practices among the checklists. NIST recognizes that detailed
checklist development cannot be covered extensively in this document. Therefore, NIST based the
security-related criteria on commonly accepted technical security principles and practices, as catalogued
in NIST SP 800-53 [16], other NIST publications [4], [5], and other literature [26]. Additional
considerations are contained in NIST SP 800-27, Engineering Principles for Information Technology
Security (A Baseline for Achieving Security) [6]. To aid in designing secure information systems, NIST
compiled a set of engineering principles for system security that are discussed in this document. These
principles provide a foundation upon which a consistent and structured approach to the design,
development, and implementation of IT security capabilities can be constructed. SP 800-27’s guidance is
based in part on the Information Assurance Technical Framework (IATF) [26].

The checklist must be consistent with one of the general operational environments described in Section 3
(excepting the Custom environment). This will require consulting the guidance in Section 3, the checklist
format and content guidelines in the remainder of this section and in Appendix C, and other generally
recommended practices and procedures. If no recommended practices guidance is available for a product
or class of products, general security recommended practices should be used (e.g., defense in depth and
layered security; least privilege, confidentiality, integrity, and availability controls).

In terms of vulnerability coverage, the security objectives should take into account the most up-to-date
vulnerabilities and generally be consistent with recognized sources of vulnerability-related information,
including the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) United States Computer Emergency Readiness
Team (US-CERT), the Computer Emergency Response Team/Coordination Center (CERT/CC), and
NIST’s NVD.16

Developers of checklists for products that are used by the federal government should consult the FISMA-
associated security control baselines. NIST SP 800-53, Recommended Security Controls for Federal
Information Systems [16], provides a catalog of security controls, using groups of the controls to create
three minimum baseline security control sets for federal information systems—low, moderate, and high
impact as specified in FIPS 199 [24]. Developers of IT products that will be used in federal information
systems are encouraged to help federal agencies meet the mandatory requirements in FISMA by creating
checklists that provide recommended configuration settings in a variety of operational environments or
for information systems of differing impact levels, as described in FIPS 199 and SP 800-53. Developers
are also encouraged to consider requirements imposed by HIPAA and other sources.

5.2         Developer Steps for Creating and Submitting Checklists

The first four steps in the development methodology shown in Figure 5-1 begin with the developer
becoming familiar with the procedures and requirements of the checklist program, and then performing
the initial development of the checklist. Following initial development, the developer tests the checklist
and refines it as needed. The third step involves documenting the checklist according to the guidelines of
the program. In the fourth step, the developer prepares and submits a checklist submission package to

NIST for screening and public review. Sections 5.2.1 through 5.2.4 describe considerations in each of
these steps.

5.2.1       Initial Checklist Development

During initial checklist development, a developer becomes familiar with the requirements of the checklist
program and all procedures involved during the checklist life cycle (as described throughout this section).
At this point, a developer would presumably agree to the requirements for participation in the NCP before
continuing to develop the checklist. The participation requirements are described in this document, but are
presented in administrative and programmatic terms in Appendix C, which is intended less for technical
developers and more for those in developer organizations who must formally agree to NCP requirements.
The participation agreement is contained in Appendix D.17

After agreeing to NCP requirements, the developer decides in which operational environment (see
Section 3) the checklist should be implemented, and builds the checklist accordingly, using the security-
related criteria presented in Sections 3 and 5.1. The output of this step is an initial checklist for the
product.

Appendix B describes the complete set of fields for a checklist description on the repository; users can
browse and view these fields when using the repository.

Table 5-1 shows the fields of the checklist description that would be completed at this step:

                               according to their “Authority Type.” Within the NCP website, authorities are
                               grouped with their authority types through the syntax of Authority Type:
                               Authority.
                               If it is not clear which checklists(s) should be analyzed, users from Federal
                               civilian agencies should first search for checklists produced by authorities of
     Authority                 type “Governmental Authority.” If “Governmental Authority” produced
                               checklists exist, the user should search for NIST-produced checklists, which
                               are tailored for civilian agency use. If no NIST-produced checklist is
                               available, then agency-produced checklists from the Defense Information
                               Systems Agency (DISA) or the National Security Agency (NSA) should be
                               used. If no “Governmental Authority” checklists exist, the user should search
                               for checklists produced by authorities of type “Software Vendor.” If none of
                               these checklists exist, the user should search for checklists produced by
                               authorities of type “Third Party.”
                               The organization responsible for creating the checklist in its current format.
                               In most cases an organization will represent both the author and authority of
                               a checklist, but this is not always true. For example, if an organization
     Author
                               produces validated SCAP content for NIST SP 800-68, the organization that
                               created the SCAP content will be listed as the Author, but NIST will remain
                               the Authority.



5.2.2     Checklist Testing

Before a checklist is submitted to NIST, it should be fully tested in a configuration that meets the target
environment and platform. The checklist should be tested with a variety of applications and hardware
platforms, if applicable. Ideally, at least some testing should be performed in a production or mirrored
production environment. The testing data does not need to be submitted to NIST; however, the developer
should retain the data for review as appropriate.

Table 5-2 shows fields in the checklist description that would be completed at this step.

                          expressed in XCCDF and validates against the published version of the XCCDF
     XCCDF Expressed
                          schema. The checklist also validates against the NIST-provided XCCDF
                          reference implementation.

                           setting has an associated CCE.
                           Whether the checklist has valid CPEs (yes or no). If yes, the checklist expresses
     CPE Expressed
                           its applicability to systems using CPE.
                           Whether the checklist has valid CVEs (yes or no). If yes, each software flaw and
     CVE Expressed
                           patch has an associated CVE or CVEs.

Selecting the most appropriate set of security controls can be a daunting task because many security
controls have limited system functionality and usability. In some cases, a security control can have a
negative impact on other security controls. For example, installing a patch could inadvertently break
another patch, or enabling a personal firewall could inadvertently block antivirus software from updating
its signatures or disrupt patch management software. Therefore, it is important to perform testing for all
security controls to determine what impact they have on system security, functionality, and usability, and
to take appropriate steps to address any significant issues.

NIST has produced SP 800-115, Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment [22], to
help administrators in testing systems for vulnerabilities and configuration problems. Although this
publication is focused more on testing systems than testing on individual IT products, it may be useful to
checklist developers.

5.2.3     Checklist Documented

The quality of checklist documentation often makes a major difference in the checklist’s effectiveness.
The checklist documentation should clearly explain how to use the checklist, with concise, sound, and
complete instructions. The skill level required to use the checklist should be identified, as well as the
targeted environment. The documentation should also explain the significance of individual settings,
including any changes to product functionality. If applicable, the documentation should also include
procedures to verify that the checklist installation is successful, as well as guidance for uninstalling the
checklist or restoring the product to its state before installation of the checklist. In some cases, it may not
be possible to roll back checklist settings, in which case the checklist documentation should recommend
procedures such as backups and system restoration as applicable.

The testing methodology, such as how the checklist was tested and what platforms were used, should be
documented. The checklist documentation should also contain information for troubleshooting if errors
occur or if the checklist settings cause the product to operate incorrectly. Ideally, assistance is available
for (registered) users of the product if there are problems.

The developer needs to complete the fields as indicated to describe the checklist accurately and minimize
user confusion as to what the checklist accomplishes.

In summary, well-structured checklist documentation includes the following, as appropriate:

 Complete and accurate checklist description
 Statement of the security objectives, including the targeted environment and the expected behavior of
  the product after applying the checklist
 The target audience (e.g., end user, system administrator) and the level of technical skill required to
  use the checklist
 Explanation of the checklist settings, including each setting’s effect on operation of the product and
  any functionality the settings enable or disable
 Backup procedures or any other initial steps required before applying the checklist
 As appropriate, step-by-step instructions for applying the checklist (e.g., screen shots, illustrated
  procedures) and verifying that the installation is successful
 Procedures for uninstalling the checklist (if applicable)

 Troubleshooting instructions or other information and references.


5.2.4      Checklist Submitted to NIST

At this point, the checklist developer has completed, tested, and documented the checklist. The developer
now submits the package of materials to NIST. The package includes the following:

 Checklist and configuration files, templates, scripts, etc.
 Completed checklist description
 Checklist documentation
 Identification of the developer point of contact
 Signed participation agreement.
The participation agreement and other requirements are outlined in detail in Appendix C, which also
includes the appropriate NIST contact information.

5.3        NIST Steps for Reviewing and Finalizing Checklists for Publication

The NIST process for screening and publishing a checklist is described in the following sections. Figure
5-1 shows the general steps; steps 4 and 5 may loop depending on the amount of feedback to the
developer. Steps 6 and 8 may repeat depending on the magnitude of updates to an already-published
checklist (most changes should not require additional public reviews).

5.3.1      NIST Screening of the Checklist Package

This step involves determining if the checklist is sufficiently accurate and complete to be publicly
reviewed. NIST screens the checklist materials for completeness and accuracy, and examines the testing
procedures used to evaluate the checklist. NIST may contact the developer with questions about the
submitted materials during the screening period. NIST completes the screening and, if all issues are
addressed, posts the checklist and its description as a candidate for public review for a period of 30 to 60
days.

The criteria used to screen the checklist are the same criteria that were used for checklist description
development, which are described in Section 5.1. Essentially, the security objectives of the checklist
should be consistent with recommended guidance from NIST and other recognized security organizations.
The checklist must be documented according to the guidelines in this section and in Appendix C. Some of
the questions typically posed by NIST when screening checklist submissions include the following:

 Documentation

      – Does it specify the checklist’s automation, SCAP, OVAL, and XCCDF compliance?
      – Does it specify the target audience?
      – Does it identify the targeted environment?
      – Does it specify if the checklist is designed specifically for federal agencies?
      – Does it explain the security objectives?


                                                        5-7
                               NATIONAL CHECKLIST PROGRAM FOR IT PRODUCTS: GUIDELINES FOR CHECKLIST USERS AND DEVELOPERS




    – Does it contain a complete, clear, and concise description of the checklist settings?
 Best Practices

    – Are the checklist settings consistent with recommended practices?
    – Do the checklist settings take into account recent vulnerabilities?
 Impact of Settings

    – Has the checklist developer tested the checklist settings on the product in an operationally
        realistic environment and determined that the application of the checklist settings causes the
        product to meet the security objectives of the checklist?

    – Do any of the checklist settings cause the product to become inoperable or unstable?
    – Do any of the checklist settings reduce product functionality? If so, is this documented?
 Ease of Implementation

    – Is the checklist straightforward to apply?
    – Are the instructions concise, sound, and complete?
    – Is the required skill level identified?
    – Are procedures to verify that the installation is successful included?
    – Is there guidance for uninstalling the checklist or restoring the product to the state before
        installation?

    – If the checklist cannot be rolled back, does the documentation recommend other preparatory
        measures such as backups?
 Assistance

    – Is checklist-related help available?
    – Does the documentation contain information for troubleshooting if errors occur or if the checklist
        settings cause the product to operate incorrectly?

    – Is there assistance available for qualified users of the product?
 If the checklist developer is NOT the IT product’s vendor, does the documentation indicate whether
  the checklist has been sponsored or endorsed by the IT product’s vendor?
5.3.2    Public Review and Feedback for the Candidate Checklist

After the checklist has been screened and the developer has addressed any issues, NIST will post it for
public review for a period of typically 30 to 60 days. This allows the public to review and test the
checklist, and to provide the checklist developers and NIST with comments and feedback. Information
from comments and feedback may be incorporated in a revision of the checklist to improve its quality.
When a candidate checklist has completed the review process, it is included in the checklist repository.




                                                       5-8
                               NATIONAL CHECKLIST PROGRAM FOR IT PRODUCTS: GUIDELINES FOR CHECKLIST USERS AND DEVELOPERS




A checklist reviewer will complete a form to provide comments as well as other information about the
reviewer’s test environment, procedures, and other relevant information. Depending on the review, the
checklist developer may need to respond to comments. NIST may also consult independent expert
reviewers as appropriate. Typical reasons for using independent reviewers include the following:

 NIST may decide that it does not have the expertise to determine whether the comments have been
  addressed satisfactorily.
 NIST may disagree with the proposed issue resolutions and seek reviews from third parties.
At the end of the public review period, NIST will announce that the comment period is closed. Depending
on the number of comments received and the ramifications of those comments to the checklist, NIST will
specify a timeframe (typically 15 to 30 days from the end of the review period) in which the developer
must respond to comments.

5.3.3     Final Listing on Checklist Repository, Maintenance, and Archival

After any outstanding issues are addressed, NIST lists the final checklist and announces that the checklist
is now listed on the repository. At this time, the developer (e.g., IT product vendor) may be eligible to use
the checklist logo on the IT product’s promotional material if the developer provides assistance for the
checklist. Requirements for use of the logo are described in Appendix D.

NIST will also announce procedures for accepting further comments or questions about the checklist
throughout its life cycle. Depending on the product and how frequently updates occur, NIST may
maintain a mailing address for the associated checklists. Users who subscribe to the mailing list can
receive announcements of updates or other issues connected with a checklist. The selected checklist’s
description (on the checklist repository) will contain instructions for subscribing to the mailing address
list. Throughout the checklist life cycle, NIST will continue to collect feedback and pass this information
to the checklist developer.

When the final checklist is listed, NIST will establish a periodic review schedule with the developer.
Typically, the timeframe for the review will be 1 year; however, it could be sooner depending on factors
such as the discovery of new vulnerabilities. If the developer decides to update the checklist, NIST will
announce that the checklist is in the process of being updated. If the revised checklist contains major
changes, it will be accepted as if it were a new submission, and will be required to undergo the same
review process as a new submission.

At the developer’s discretion, the checklist can be removed from the repository or reclassified as an
archive. Typical reasons for such actions would be that the product is no longer supported or is obsolete,
or that the developer no longer wishes to provide support for the checklist.

   Field Name                    Description                                       Example Data

Tier             The checklist tier (Tier I, II, III, or IV).    Tier III
                     Tier I checklists are prose-based,
                      such as narrative descriptions of
                      how a person can manually alter a
                      product’s configuration.

                     Tier II checklists document their
                      recommended security settings in a
                      machine-readable but non-
                      standard format, such as a
                      proprietary format or a product-
                      specific configuration script. These
                      checklists may include some
                      elements of SCAP (for example,
                      they may contain CCE identifiers),
                      but do not meet the Tier III
                      requirements.

                     Tier III checklists use SCAP to
                      document their recommended
                      security settings in machine-
                      readable standardized SCAP
                      formats that meet the definition of
                      “SCAP Expressed” specified in
                      NIST SP 800-126 [29]. Tier III
                      checklists can be processed by
                      SCAP-validated tools, which are
                      products that have been validated
                      by an accredited independent
                      testing laboratory as conforming to
                      applicable SCAP specifications and
                      requirements.

                     Tier IV checklists include all
                      properties of Tier III checklists.
                      Additionally, Tier IV checklists are
                      considered production-ready and
                      have been validated by NIST or a
                      NIST-recognized authoritative
                      entity to ensure, to the maximum
                      extent possible, interoperability with
                      SCAP-validated products. Tier IV
                      checklists also demonstrate the
                      ability to map low-level security
                      settings (for example, standardized
                      identifiers for individual security
                      configuration issues) to high-level
                      security requirements as
                      represented in various security
                      frameworks (e.g., SP 800-53
                      controls for FISMA), and the
                      mappings have been vetted with
                      the appropriate authority.

SCAP Expressed   Checklists that are designed to be              Yes
                 processed by SCAP-validated products.
                 For more details regarding the definition
                 of SCAP Expressed, see NIST SP 800-
                 126 [29].

CVE Expressed          Whether the checklist has valid CVEs           Yes
                       (yes or no). If yes, each software flaw
                       and patch has an associated CVE or
                       CVEs.
CVSS Expressed         Whether the checklist has valid CVSSs          No
                       (yes or no). If yes, each CVE identifier
                       has an associated CVSS base score.
OVAL Expressed         Whether the checklist is expressed in          Yes
                       OVAL (yes or no). If yes, each OVAL
                       definition must validate according to the
                       OVAL reference implementation.18

                   If it is not clear which checklists(s)
                   should be analyzed, users from Federal
                   civilian agencies should first search for
                   checklists produced by authorities of
                   type “Governmental Authority.” If
                   “Governmental Authority” produced

                   for NIST-produced checklists, which are
                   tailored for civilian agency use. If no
                   NIST-produced checklist is available,
                   then agency-produced checklists from
                   the Defense Information Systems
                   Agency (DISA) or the National Security
                   Agency (NSA) should be used. If no
                   “Governmental Authority” checklists
                   exist, the user should search for
                   checklists produced by authorities of
                   type “Software Vendor.” If none of
                   these checklists exist, the user should
                   search for checklists produced by
                   authorities of type “Third Party.”
Author             The organization responsible for            NIST, Computer Security Division
                   creating the checklist in its current
                   format. In most cases an organization
                   will represent both the author and
                   authority of a checklist, but this is not
                   always true. For example, if an
                   organization produces validated SCAP
                   content for NIST SP 800-68, the
                   organization that created the SCAP
                   content will be listed as the Author, but
                   NIST will remain the Authority.
Authority Type     Type of organization that lends its         Governmental Authority
                   authority to the checklist. The three
                   types are Governmental Authority,
                   Software Vendor, and Third Party (e.g.,

1. Overview and General Considerations

This section focuses on general considerations for all parts of the National Checklist Program.

(a) Checklist Lifecycle Overview: Checklists typically have the following lifecycle:

        1. Checklist developers inquire about the program and download a submission package. The
           developer subsequently contacts NIST with a tested checklist, supporting information, and a
           signed agreement to the requirements of the NCP. General information about checklists is
           discussed in Section 1. Checklist submission requirements and procedures are discussed in
           Section 2.




                                                      C-2
                               NATIONAL CHECKLIST PROGRAM FOR IT PRODUCTS: GUIDELINES FOR CHECKLIST USERS AND DEVELOPERS




        2. NIST verifies that all information is complete and performs a screening on the checklist.
           Checklists meeting the requirements for listing receive further consideration and are referred
           to as ―candidate checklists.‖ Section 2 discusses screening criteria and procedures. Section 1d
           discusses issue resolution processes.
        3. NIST lists the candidate checklist on the repository for public review, typically for a period of
           30 to 60 days, as discussed in Section 3.
        4. NIST forwards comments from public reviewers to the developer. When all issues are
           addressed, the checklist is listed on the FCL, as discussed in Section 4.
        5. The developer contacts NIST on typically an annual basis to determine whether the listing
           should continue, be updated, or be archived, as discussed in Section 5.

(b) Intellectual Property Rights: Developers retain intellectual property rights to their checklists.

(c) Confidential Information: NIST does not anticipate the need to receive confidential information
    from checklist developers. If it becomes necessary to disclose confidential information to NIST, NIST
    and the developer must enter into a separate confidentiality agreement prior to such disclosure.

(d) Independent Qualified Reviewers: NIST may decide to seek technical advice from independent
    qualified experts who will review checklist submissions to determine whether they meet the program
    requirements. The reviewers are tasked with making a recommendation to NIST regarding a
    subsequent public review or final listing of the checklist. Typical but not exclusive of the reasons for
    using independent reviewers include the following:

        1. NIST does not possess the expertise to determine whether issues have been addressed
           satisfactorily.
        2. NIST disagrees with proposed issue resolutions.


(e) Terminating Consideration of a Checklist Submission: NIST or the developer may terminate
    consideration of checklist submissions at any time. If NIST terminates consideration, the points of
    contact are asked to respond within 10 business days. Typical but not exclusive of the reasons for
    terminating consideration of checklist submissions include the following:

        1. The submission package does not meet the screening criteria.
        2. The developer fails to address issues raised at other times.
        3. The developer violates the terms and conditions of participation in the program.


2. Checklist Submission and Screening

This section outlines the procedures and requirements for submitting checklists to NIST and the process
by which NIST determines if checklists are suitable for public review. When checklists meet the
screening criteria, they receive further consideration in a public review and are referred to as ―candidate
checklists.‖ NIST then follows the subsequent procedures.

(a) Notification of Checklist Program Requirements: NIST maintains on the repository a complete set
    of information for developers. The information outlines the requirements for participation in the
    program and describes materials and timeframes.



                                                       C-3
                              NATIONAL CHECKLIST PROGRAM FOR IT PRODUCTS: GUIDELINES FOR CHECKLIST USERS AND DEVELOPERS




(b) Materials Required From the Developer: Developers provide the following information:

        1. Contact information for an individual from the submitting organization who will serve as the
           point of contact for questions and comments pertaining to the checklist, and contact
           information for a backup or deputy point of contact. The information must include postal
           address, direct telephone number, facsimile number, and email address.
        2. The checklist, documentation, and description template.
        3. The participation agreement, which must be printed, signed, and sent to NIST. NIST accepts
           emailed PDF copies of the participation agreement, facsimiles, or copies via regular mail.
        4. Participation fees. Currently, there is no fee to checklist developers. NIST reserves the right
           to charge fees for participation in the future. Fees are not retroactive.


(c) Preliminary Screening Checklist Contents: NIST performs a preliminary screening to verify that
    checklists meet the program requirements. The following paragraphs summarize the screening
    criteria, which are described more fully in NIST Special Publication 800-70 Revision 1.

        1. The checklist settings reflect consideration of recommended security and engineering
           practices.
        2. The checklist contains a complete, clear, and concise description of the configuration settings.
        3. The checklist has been tested and configuration or compatibility issues have been identified.
        4. The documentation explains how to install and uninstall the checklist.
        5. Checklist-related help is available.


3. Candidate Checklist Public Review

NIST follows the subsequent procedures when listing candidate checklists for public review.

(a) Public Review Period: NIST typically lists candidate checklists for a 30 to 60 day comment period.
    NIST reserves the right to extend the review cycle, particularly for long or complicated checklists.
    NIST uses the following disclaimer (or very similar words) in conjunction with candidate checklists:

        NIST does not guarantee or warrant the checklist’s accuracy or completeness. NIST is not
        responsible for loss, damage, or problems that may be caused by using the checklist.

(b) Accepting Comments from Reviewers: Public reviewers complete a web-based feedback form to
    capture their comments as well as other information about the reviewer’s test environment,
    procedures, and other relevant information. The contents of the feedback forms are considered public
    records.

(c) Maintaining Records: NIST maintains copies of all correspondence and feedback between the
    public and developers by creating a unique email address for each checklist. NIST will archive the
    information.



                                                      C-4
                               NATIONAL CHECKLIST PROGRAM FOR IT PRODUCTS: GUIDELINES FOR CHECKLIST USERS AND DEVELOPERS




(d) Addressing Comments: At the end of the public review period, NIST announces that the comment
    period is closed. Depending on the number of comments received and the ramifications of those
    comments to the checklist settings, NIST determines a timeframe in which the developer must
    respond to comments. This timeframe typically ranges from 15 to 30 days from the date the
    comments were submitted or from the end of the review period. At no time will this period be less
    than 15 days.

4. Final Checklist Listing

After NIST determines that a checklist and the associated developers have met all requirements for final
listing, NIST lists checklists in the FCL and refers to them as ―final checklists.‖ NIST then follows the
subsequent procedures.

(a) Finalizing Checklists: NIST lists the checklist in the FCL. NIST may send announcements to
    various email lists maintained by NIST or other organizations. NIST uses the following disclaimer (or
    very similar words) for final checklists:

        NIST does not guarantee or warrant the checklist’s accuracy or completeness. NIST is not
        responsible for loss, damage, or problems that may be caused by using the checklist.

(b) Handling Comments: NIST continues to accept comments about final checklists by maintaining a
    central email address on the repository. NIST lists the procedures to be used for contacting the
    developer, along with the contact information for the developer, such as an email address or URL.

(c) Scheduling Periodic Reviews: NIST determines whether a final checklist should be reviewed
    periodically and typically sets a review timeframe of one year. NIST may request that a checklist be
    reviewed sooner for reasons such as new vulnerabilities or threats. NIST schedules reviews with the
    developer’s points of contact. If at any time the point of contact changes, NIST must be notified
    immediately.

5. Final Checklist Update, Archival, and Delisting

NIST follows the subsequent procedures for periodic update, archival, and delisting of final checklists.

(a) Periodic Reviews: NIST contacts developers at least annually to identify changes in the status of
    checklists. NIST also may contact developers, as appropriate, to determine if there are changes in the
    status of a checklist, in which case developers have 30 days to respond and indicate whether
    checklists should be updated, archived, or delisted.

(b) Updates: NIST may indicate on the FCL when checklists are under periodic review. Developers have
    60 days after the review to submit the updated material to NIST. Depending on the magnitude of
    updates, NIST may screen the checklist and schedule a public review.

(c) Archival: When a developer no longer provides support for the checklist, at the developer and
    NIST’s discretion, the checklist can remain in the repository, but it will be reclassified as an archive.
    Typical reasons for archiving a checklist are that the product is no longer supported or is obsolete or
    that the developer no longer wants to provide support for the checklist.




                                                       C-5
                               NATIONAL CHECKLIST PROGRAM FOR IT PRODUCTS: GUIDELINES FOR CHECKLIST USERS AND DEVELOPERS




(d) Delisting: NIST removes the checklist from the FCL. NIST may send announcements to various
    email lists maintained by NIST or other organizations.

(e) Automatic Delisting: If a final checklist is not reviewed annually, it is automatically removed from
    the FCL. At the developer and NIST’s discretion, it can be reclassified as an archive.

6. Record Keeping

NIST maintains information associated with the program and requires that participants in the checklist
program also maintain certain records, as follows.

(a) NIST Records: During the period that a checklist has been submitted to NIST, and during the period
    that a checklist is listed on the FCL as a final or archived checklist, and for three years thereafter,
    NIST will maintain the following:

        1. The checklist description template, as listed on the repository
        2. The checklist and checklist description, as listed on the repository
        3. All comments submitted as part of the public review
        4. All comments submitted to NIST regarding the checklist.


(b) Developer Records: During the period that a checklist has been submitted to NIST, and during the
    period that a checklist is listed on the FCL as a final or archived checklist, the developer will maintain
    the following:

        1. The checklist description template, as listed on the repository
        2. The checklist and checklist description, as listed on the repository
        3. Test reports and other evidence of checklist testing.
