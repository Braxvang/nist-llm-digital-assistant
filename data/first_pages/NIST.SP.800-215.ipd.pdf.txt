 85   Abstract
 86   Access to multiple cloud services, the geographic spread of enterprise IT resources (including
 87   multiple data centers), and the emergence of microservices-based applications (as opposed to
 88   monolithic ones) have significantly altered the enterprise network landscape. This document is
 89   meant to provide guidance to this new enterprise network landscape from a secure operations
 90   perspective. Hence, it starts by examining the security limitations of the current network access
 91   solutions to the enterprise network. It then considers security feature enhancements to traditional
 92   network appliances in the form of point security solutions, network configurations for various
 93   security functions (e.g., application security, cloud access security, device or endpoint security,
 94   etc.), security frameworks that integrate these individual network configurations, and the
 95   evolving wide area network (WAN) infrastructure to provide a comprehensive set of security
 96   services for the modern enterprise network landscape.

174   Executive Summary
175   The enterprise network landscape has undergone tremendous changes in the last decade due to
176   the following three drivers:
177      1. Enterprise access to multiple cloud services,
178      2. The geographical spread of enterprise-based (on-premises) IT resources (e.g., multiple
179         data centers and branch offices), and
180      3. Changes to application architecture from being monolithic to a set of loosely coupled
181         microservices.
182   The impact of these drivers on the security of the enterprise network landscape include:
183      •   Disappearance of the concept of a network perimeter that can be protected and the
184          necessity to protect each endpoint (device or service) that treats it as a perimeter
185      •   Increase in attack surface due to sheer multiplicity of IT resources (computing,
186          networking, storage) and components
187      •   Sophistication of the attackers in their ability to escalate attacks across several network
188          boundaries and leverage connectivity features
189   This document is meant to provide guidance to this new enterprise network landscape from a
190   secure operations perspective. The adopted methodology considers the security challenges that
191   the network poses and then examines the limitations of current network access technologies and
192   how solutions have evolved from being security function-specific to a security framework to a
193   comprehensive security infrastructure that provides a holistic set of security services. Specific
194   areas addressed include:
195      •   Feature enhancements to traditional network security appliances
196      •   Secure enterprise networking configurations for various scenarios
197      •   Security frameworks that integrate individual network configurations
198      •   Evolving wide area network (WAN) infrastructure that provides a comprehensive set of
199          security services
200   What is termed as the enterprise network in this document encompasses the various local
201   networks on enterprise premises and that portion of wide area network that is used to connect its
202   various geographically dispersed locations and cloud service access points.

203      Introduction
204   The enterprise network landscape has undergone a significant transformation in the last decade.
205   The drivers for this transformation are (a) enterprise access to multiple cloud services, (b) the
206   geographic spread of enterprise-owned (on-premises) IT resources (e.g., in a central office,
207   multiple branch offices, and data centers), and (c) changes to application architecture from being
208   monolithic to a set of loosely coupled microservices – often with a dedicated infrastructure
209   (called the service mesh) that provides all application services, including security. The high-level
210   impact of these drivers on the security of the current enterprise network landscape are (a)
211   disappearance of the concept of a perimeter associated with the enterprise network; (b) an
212   increase in attack surface due to the sheer multiplicity of IT resource components associated with
213   application services, storage, and network appliances; and (c) sophistication of the attackers in
214   their ability to escalate attacks across several network boundaries and leverage connectivity
215   features. This document will consider these impacts by identifying the structural components of
216   the new network landscape as well as specific security threats that they have opened up.

217          Structural Implication of Drivers on Enterprise Network Landscape
218   In order to have a good structural view of the current enterprise network landscape, it is
219   necessary to look at the current enterprise IT environment in general. The IT environment now
220   consists of:
221      •   Subscription to multiple cloud services, such as IaaS for computing, SaaS for software,
222          PaaS for an application development platform, and other cloud services (e.g., IDaaS for
223          authentication)
224      •   Enterprise IT applications (on-premises) located in corporate headquarters and
225          geographically distributed branch offices and data centers
226      •   IT applications range from being monolithic to ones that are made up of loosely coupled
227          microservices, each of them hosted on heterogeneous platforms
228      •   Presence of edge computing devices, such as IoTs, in some environments
229   The above scenarios call for widespread connectivity between IT systems that now defines the
230   current enterprise network landscape. Connectivity, in turn, involves:
231      •   Connectivity between IT resources (servers for computing and storage) in data centers
232          (network fabric)
233      •   Connectivity between IT resources within a corporate office or branch office (Wi-Fi,
234          LAN, VLAN)
235      •   Connectivity for users to remotely access to IT resources from home, travel locations,
236          branch offices, and corporate offices using WANs, which use multiple networks such as
237          the internet, MPLS, and – in some instances – cellular networks (e.g., 4G/LTE, 5G, etc.)
238      •   Connectivity to cloud services through a cloud service provider (CSP), virtual private
239          metworks (VPN), or subscription to WAN services (premises based equipment licenses
240          or cloud-based)

      August 2022                                                                         Network Landscape

241          Security Implication of Drivers for the Enterprise Network Landscape
242   The beginning of this section stated the following as the drivers for the state of the current
243   enterprise network landscape:
244      •   Subscription to multiple cloud services
245      •   Geographically distributed IT resources
246      •   Changes in application architecture
247   Now consider the immediate security implications of these drivers.
248   Subscription to multiple cloud services: Accessing cloud services from multiple cloud providers
249   has become the norm for many enterprises. This trend is motivated not only by the need to avoid
250   a cloud-vendor locked-in situation but also by different CSPs offering different value-added
251   functions for different services (e.g., IaaS, SaaS). The consequence of this trend is that – from an
252   enterprise point of view – the following networks have become extensions of the enterprise
253   network and, thus, come under the scope of enterprise network management with attendant
254   responsibilities for ensuring security protections becoming a critical function.
255      •   Network used for accessing the cloud services
256      •   Inter-cloud network (since communication between one CSP and another may be
257          inevitable)

258      •   The network inside the cloud provider that needs to be navigated to access the subscribed
259          services (e.g., VPC, VNET, etc.)

260   Geographically distributed IT resources: The implication of distributed IT resources is that the
261   users are also geographically distributed. Applications are now accessed by users not only from
262   the enterprise premises, such as the corporate office and branch offices (through the enterprise
263   network), but also from home and public locations (e.g., hotels and cafes) through multiple
264   devices, such as desktops, laptops, and mobile phones. Ensuring secure access from these
265   multiple locations and devices becomes the responsibility of the enterprise.
266   Changes in application architecture: Application architectures – especially those of cloud-native
267   applications – have changed from being monolithic to being microservices-based, with the
268   distributed nature increasing the communication channels between the components across a
269   network (instead of just being local procedure/function calls). These applications have enlarged
270   the threat and attack surface due to:
271      •   Inherent architectures (multiple independent microservices and APIs),
272      •   Automation tools used during software development and deployment, and
273      •   Agile development and deployment methodologies, such as DevSecOps, that contain
274          CI/CD pipeline code (workflows).
275   Attacks include data breaches, distributed denial of service (DDoS), account takeover (ATO) due
276   to credential theft, and insider threats.

277          The Need for a Security Guide
278   Based on these considerations for security implementation, the arguments for the need for a
279   security guide to the current enterprise network landscape are:
280      •   Ubiquitous access locations, ubiquitous hosting locations of the application components,
281          and multiple WAN transport protocols have caused shifts in security focuses, goals, and
282          principles.
283      •   The security focus has enlarged from being network-centric (i.e., internal/corporate
284          network versus external/public internet) to user- and device/endpoint-centric.
285      •   The new trust relationship has to be based not just on identity or the location of the access
286          but enhanced to include validation of each access request (not just at the beginning of an
287          access session), as well as the applicable set of contextual information associated with the
288          user, device, or service.

289          Scope
290   The scope of this document includes:
291      •   A structural view of the enterprise network landscape based on the distribution of IT
292          resources and the consequent security challenges it poses
293      •   Emerging and state-of-practice solutions in terms of feature sets and requirements to
294          address the security challenges; solutions discussed will focus on the functional and
295          operational levels

296          Target Audience
297   This guidance is intended for network design architects and network security solution architects
298   in organizations with a hybrid IT environment (consisting of both on-premises and cloud-based
299   applications) with a combination of legacy and microservices-based (i.e., cloud-native)
300   applications.

302   The organization of this document is as follows:
303      •   Chapter 2 considers traditional network access principles and technologies and their
304          limitations in the context of the current enterprise network landscape.
305      •   Chapter 3 provides a brief functional description of network security appliances – some
306          new, some traditional (e.g., firewall) – that have enhanced capabilities to meet the

316      Traditional Enterprise Network Access Approaches and Their Limitations
317   Section 1 outlined the drivers for the current enterprise network landscape. Both drivers (change
318   in application architectures and access to cloud-based applications) have impacted the mechanics
319   of secure access to those applications through the network. Now consider the security limitations
320   of the traditional enterprise network access approaches in the current enterprise network
321   landscape context.
322      •   Limitation of network perimeter-based protections
323      •   Limitations of VPN-based access
324      •   Limitations of MPLS technology as enterprise WANs
325      •   Limitation of user identity-based controls

326          Limitations of Network Perimeter-based Protections
327   Early solutions for secure enterprise network access were geared toward environments with well-
328   defined network perimeters. All enterprise IT resources were endpoints of enterprise LANs
329   (usually defined as a floor in a large enterprise, building, or small campus), and multiple LANs
330   connected together inside a defined building or campus constituted the internal corporate
331   network. Entry points into this corporate network were protected using devices called firewalls,
332   which were initially implemented as hardware appliances and later used software. In this
333   environment, all devices and users within firewalls were totally trusted and, hence, considered
334   safe for accessing application resources. However, the following factors have annulled the
335   concept of that perimeter:
336      •   Distributed nature of the application into ones located within a corporate data center,
337          remote branch offices, and multiple cloud locations
338      •   Perimeter approach based on the premise that the threat originates outside of the network,
339          which is why most perimeter security solutions (e.g., IPS, IDS, firewalls) focus only on
340          north-south traffic. However, over 75 % of network traffic is now east-west or server-to-
341          server (due to applications being microservices-based), which is largely invisible to
342          security teams. Any threat that is already inside of a network can move laterally and
343          remain undetected for days or even months.
344      •   Edge computing [1], where much of the computing takes place close to the location of
345          multiple IoT devices
346      •   Users located both within and outside of the corporate network, such as in homes, remote
347          branch offices, and public locations (e.g., hotels, pubs, etc.). Some enterprises must also
348          provide access to ecosystem partners, who may be on their own corporate networks.
349   The above scenarios have greatly expanded the attack surface.

350          Limitations of VPN-based Access
351   The increase in teleworking employees due to the pandemic has necessitated a means for secure
352   access to IT resources inside an enterprise network in the form of virtual private networks
353   (VPNs). A VPN allows organizations to extend a perimeter-based security across a public

354   network. Security is enabled by setting up a secure tunnel in the public network using protocols
355   such as IPSEC and TLS.
356   However, there are some limitations and security risks associated with VPNs.
357      •   An increasing trend involves the movement of corporate resources to the cloud and the
358          use of mobile devices. The VPN connections that remote users establish terminate at the
359          VPN concentrators located at the edge of the corporate network. Hence, using a process
360          called hair pinning, the traffic that lands at the corporate internet edge is routed back to
361          the internet to access the cloud resources. This extra path increases network latency and
362          has the potential to cause traffic bottlenecks.
363      •   The mobile devices used by many employees, such as smartphones and tablets, can
364          connect directly to software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications and data in the cloud. These
365          mobile devices are especially prone to phishing attacks that steal credentials or deliver
366          malware. Thus, the VPN becomes an entry point by which a bad actor could compromise
367          a device and enter an organization’s infrastructure.
368      •   Two recent vulnerabilities were discovered in some VPNs [2]. One was “session
369          hijacking,” where malicious actors access a valid session ID through brute-force attacks
370          or reverse engineering. The second vulnerability involved pulling a unique ID for an
371          account, leveraging web browser development tools to manually set a value to the ID,
372          and using that to obtain unauthenticated access to the VPN administrator console. That
373          access was then used to remotely connect to internal systems, harvest passwords, move
374          laterally in the network, and – in many cases – deploy ransomware.

375          Limitation of MPLS Technology as Enterprise WANs
376   Multi-protocol label switching (MPLS) technology is used for enterprise WANs, but the wide
377   geographic span of an enterprise network due to multiple data centers and cloud services has
378   imposed some limitations on its use.
379      •   The geographic span of enterprise IT resources and subsequent networking connections
380          have made traversal through internet inevitable for many portions of its enterprise’s
381          access network. Since MPLS is a different network, it provides access to the internet only
382          through designated and limited access points. This increases latency for time-sensitive
383          corporate applications.
384      •   Given the different networking technology, the appliances and subsequent configuration
385          procedures are different, making networking management a complex task.

386          Limitation of User Identity-based Controls
387   In traditional monolithic applications, all invocations of applications are either directly from the
388   user or through scripts written and programmed to run by the user. Hence, the only parameters
389   for access validation are the user identity or attributes associated with the user.
390   Changes in application architectures expand the validation parameters beyond user identity and
391   attributes. The initial changes to application architectures are found in web-based and API-based
392   applications where access can take place from any device located in any network (e.g., home,


                                                        7

393   public WiFi, etc.). The latest changes are found in microservices-based applications (often called
394   cloud-native applications because this architecture is the predominant one among cloud-hosted
395   applications). This class of application consists of loosely coupled microservices that require the
396   generation of multiple interservice requests to complete a business process or transaction. The
397   limitations of identity-based controls can be seen from the following expanded security
398   requirements for microservices-based applications:
399      •   Validation is required not only for the identity of the users initiating the transaction but
400          also for the identity of each service (service identity) making the request and the device
401          on which the service is hosted (authorized device).
402      •   The location of the service and device may change due to the virtualized nature of the
403          application hosting environment (e.g., migration to VMs located in a different subnet,
404          more powerful hosting devices and storage mechanisms, etc.), necessitating the need for
405          validating an application request based not only on user identity and attributes but also on
406          attributes associated with the device, network, geolocations, etc.
407      •   The validation of identity (authentication) and authorization need to be done continuously
408          (and not just at the beginning of an application invocation session) as the risk profile of
409          an access may change due to there being multiple entities involved or changes in
410          behavioral patterns that need to be included as a validation parameter (and monitored).

411      Network Security Appliances in Enterprise Network Landscape
412   This section will consider some new network security appliances as well as enhanced features in
413   established appliances for meeting the security needs of the current landscape. These can be
414   viewed simply as point security solutions, but evaluating their functions and features will provide
415   an understanding of the effectiveness of network configurations and technologies that form part
416   of the integrated solutions that are going to be discussed in Sections 4 and 5, respectively.

417          Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB)
418   Given the increasing subscription to multiple clouds in many enterprises, one of the most
419   important pieces of software is the cloud access security broker (CASB). Just like IAM systems,
420   a CASB can be run either on-premises or as a cloud-based service. It sits on the network between
421   the cloud service customers (CSC) and the cloud service providers (CSP). The evolution of
422   CASB functionality can be traced as follows [3]:
423      •   The primary function of the first generation of CASBs was the discovery of resources.
424          They provided visibility into all of the cloud resources that the enterprise users accessed,
425          thus preventing or minimizing the chances of shadow IT. Shadow IT is the practice of
426          some users using cloud applications that are not authorized by the enterprise IT
427          management from home or the office using enterprise desktops. An example of this is the
428          use of unapproved software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications for file sharing, social
429          media, collaboration, and web conferencing by some enterprise users [4]. This generation
430          of CASBs also provides some statistics, such as software-as-a-service (SAAS) utilization.
431      •   The current generation of CASBs enforces security and governance policies for cloud
432          applications, thus enabling enterprises to extend their on-premises policies to the cloud.
433          Specific security services provided by CASBs include:
434              o Protection of enterprise data that lives in cloud service providers’ servers (due to
435                SAAS or IAAS subscriptions), as well as data inflow and data outflow from those
436                servers
437              o Tracking of threats, such as account hijacking and other malicious activities.
438                Some can detect anomalies in users’ cloud access behavior (through robust user
439                and entity behavior analytics, or UEBA, functionality) and stop insider threats and
440                advanced cyberattacks [5].
441              o Detection of misconfigurations in the enterprise’s subscribed infrastructure as a
442                service (IaaS) and cloud servers. These misconfigurations pose serious security
443                risks such as data breaches. Alerts generated by CASB due to misconfigurations
444                in the enterprise’s IaaS deployments direct the enterprise to follow guidelines,
445                such as the Center for Internet Security’s (CIS) benchmarks for public cloud
446                services, thus improving the overall security profile of the enterprise for cloud
447                access [4].

448          Enhanced Firewall Capabilities
449   The security functions in firewalls have enlarged alongside the changing network landscape.
450   Firewalls started as hardware appliances that prevented network packets from a device with a
451   particular network location (e.g., combination of IP address and port) in one subnet (e.g.,
452   external network or internet) from accessing a device on another network location or subnet
453   (e.g., intranet or DMZ or corporate network). In that setup, it primarily secured a network
454   perimeter. The evolution of firewall functions can be traced based on the following feature sets
455   [6]:
456      •   Packet filters and network address translation: Packet filtering and NAT are used to
457          monitor and control packets moving across a network interface, apply predetermined
458          security rules, and obscure the internal network from the public internet.
459      •   Stateful inspection: Stateful firewalling, also known as dynamic packet filtering, monitors
460          the state of connections and makes determinations on what types of data packets
461          belonging to a known active connection are allowed to pass through the firewall.
462      •   Threat detection and response: Modern firewalls can gather and analyze enough data
463          across multiple packets and sessions to detect threats and security incidents targeted at a
464          particular system or a family of systems. The data from multiple firewalls can also be
465          directed toward security information and event management (SIEM) and correlated with
466          data from other security tools and IT systems to detect enterprise-wide attacks that span
467          multiple systems and network layers. In addition, this data can be used to understand
468          evolving threats and define new access rules, attack patterns, and defensive strategies [6].

469      •   Logging and auditing capabilities: Logging and auditing capabilities result in the
470          construction of network events that can be used to identify patterns of performance and
471          security issues.

472      •   Access control functions: Access control functions enforce granular sophisticated access
473          control policies.

474      •   Multiple locations and functions: Firewalls reside at different locations to perform
475          different functions. Firewalls at the network edge perform the network perimeter
476          protection function by filtering disallowed sources and destinations and blocking packets
477          of potential threats. Firewalls inside a data center can create segmentation of the internal
478          network to prevent the lateral movement of traffic and isolate sensitive resources (e.g.,
479          services and data stores). Device-based firewalls prevent malicious traffic in and out of
480          endpoints.

481      •   Open APIs integrate with many networking products.
482      •   Some features centrally define or merge policies so that consistent policies are applied to
483          different class of users (e.g., those on-premises and on private and public clouds).
484      •   Web application firewalls (WAF): This class of firewalls has been used ever since web
485          applications accessed through web protocols, such as HTTP, came into existence. A
486          feature advancement in this class of firewalls is advanced URL filtering. This is the
487          ability to detect traffic from malicious URLs and thus prevent web-based threats and

488          attacks by receiving real-time data analyzed by machine learning algorithms [7][8].
489          Specifically, this class of firewalls can inspect threat vectors for SQL Injection, OS
490          command injections, and cross-site scripting attacks, as well as prevent inbound attacks.
491          They are used in content delivery networks (CDN) and to prevent distributed denial-of-
492          (DDoS) attacks. Some additional features found in this class of firewalls are:
493              1. Ability to specify allowable list of services (control at the application level)
494              2. Traffic matches the intent of allowed ports
495              3. Filtering of some unwanted protocols

496          Appliance-set with Integrated Functions
497      •   Unified threat management (or UTMs): UTM devices combine many of the most critical
498          security functions – firewall, intrusion prevention system (IPS), VPN concentrator,
499          gateway antivirus, content filtering, and WAN load balancing – into a single device,
500          usually with a unified management console.
501      •   Next-generation firewall (NGFW): This all-in-one security appliance is based on the
502          UTM model but is combined with enterprise-class scalability and performance and a
503          focus on the granular inspection of Layer 7 application traffic. NGFWs have added
504          capabilities to facilitate internal segmentation, integration with sandboxing products,
505          secure sockets layer (SSL) inspection, and SD-WAN. Processing at the edge benefits
506          from on-premises firewalls, which apply processing on-site. They are more energy-
507          efficient than virtual machines and reduce latency because they avoid the “round trip” to
508          the cloud. NGFWs come with high-performance threat protection (e.g., intrusion
509          prevention, web filtering, anti-malware, application control) for known attacks, SSL/TLS
510          inspection, and antivirus [9].
511      •   Web application and API protection (WAAP): This is a comprehensive security approach
512          and an enhancement over web application firewalls (WAF). WAF is an integral
513          component for API security, BOT defense, and DDOS protection.
514      •   These can be offered as a product suite or as a cloud-based service [10][11].
515      •   Secure web gateway (SWGs): SWGs are appliances utilized for policy-based access to
516          and control of cloud-based applications for enterprise users in ubiquitous locations (e.g.,
517          headquarters, branch offices, home, remote locations). A SWG is fundamentally a web
518          filter that protects outbound user traffic through HTTP or HTTPS inspection [12]. They
519          also protect user endpoints from web-based threats that can occur when users click on
520          links to malicious websites or to websites infected with malware. They centralize control,
521          visibility, and reporting across many locations and types of users. They are not a
522          replacement for WAFs, which protect websites housed in enterprise data centers and
523          large headquarter sites from inbound attacks.

524          Requirements for Network Automation Tools
525   Network automation tools automate the entire life cycle processes involved in deployment,
526   observability/monitoring, threat intelligence gathering/reporting (e.g., generating alerts of
527   security violations for security personnel to take timely action), and – in some instances –

      August 2022                                                                        Network Landscape

528   automatic remediation. These automated tools are an indispensable part of a complex enterprise
529   network landscape. The requirements for these tools can be broadly classified into generic and
530   functional requirements. These requirements are described below. Each generic requirement is
531   tagged with the abbreviation NAUT-GR-x, while each functional requirement is tagged with
532   NAUT-FR-x, where x in both types of tags stand for the numerical sequence.
533      •   NAUT-GR-1: Scale to meet the volume, velocity, and variety of today’s application
534          development deployment and maintenance paradigms [13]. This requirement is critical in
535          environments where DevSecOps is used to deploy not only applications but also
536          infrastructures, the latter using infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tools. These tools are made an
537          integral part of the smart automated workflows called CI/CD pipelines, which invoke
538          these tools to deploy servers (computing), networking, and storage infrastructure. Hence,
539          this class of network automation tools can be seamlessly integrated into the
540          corresponding CI/CD pipelines.
541      •   NAUT-GR-2: They should have the capability to minimize human intervention for
542          security remediation, which is slow and prone to error. In other words, the more
543          automated remediation features built into the tool, the better.
544   The minimum functional requirements of network automation tools should be:
545      •   NAUT-FR-1 (enhanced threat intelligence and protection): The tools should have
546          advanced threat intelligence, real-time threat prevention capabilities for known and zero-
547          day vulnerabilities, and sandboxing features for isolating malicious traffic.
548      •   NAUT-FR-2 (leveraging knowledge of previous events): The tools should have features
549          for matching current events to past ones and for leveraging the remediation measures
550          performed for those instances in the current solution. This brings about reduction to the
551          average outage time [14].
552   The network monitoring and observability tools and IaC tools are important classes of network
553   automation tools, and the requirements and feature set are discussed in the following subsections.

554   3.4.1. Network Monitoring and Observability Tools
555   This class of tools gathers the data for obtaining visibility into the entire network. The data is
556   then used to generate a dashboard that presents the topography of the enterprise network by
557   showing all connections and presenting key operating parameters (e.g., latency, network traffic
558   level, etc.). Some of the data generated by this class of tool and their uses are:
559      •   Identification of interfaces: Monitoring tools identify the interfaces for defining the
560          parameters for network resources provisioning and help the IaC generate the relevant
561          code for invoking those interfaces.
562      •   Measurement of drift: Despite using IaC to deploy the network infrastructure,
563          unauthorized or ad hoc changes in network configuration can alter the performance and
564          security parameters for application execution (called the drift). Monitoring tools should
565          have the ability to monitor these parameters (e.g., bandwidth availability, unwanted
566          traffic, etc.) and alert for corrective action.

      August 2022                                                                        Network Landscape

567      •   Secure overlay designs for cloud service access: Monitoring tools can generate data to
568          enable centralized network management tools to perform security functions, such as
569          building a virtual network segmentation on top of the native network segmentation
570          features offered by CSP, provided that suitable APIs are available.
571      •   Support for incidence response process: Sophisticated network monitoring tools generate
572          network security alerts and threat intelligence feeds. Handling these alerts and feeds is
573          part of the incidence response (IR) process in an enterprise and is carried out by members
574          of a security operations center (SOC). A security strategy that has evolved in recent years
575          to automate the IR process is called security orchestration, automation, and response
576          (SOAR). Some of the state of practice applications of SOAR include threat detection and
577          response, vulnerability prioritization, compliance checks, and security audits with
578          potential applications in many emerging areas, such as IoT management [15].

579   3.4.2. Automated Network Provisioning Tools
580   As already stated, automated network resource provisioning is enabled by infrastructure as code
581   (IaC) tools. The code that describes the networking infrastructure (in addition to the computing
582   and storage infrastructure) is stored in a code repository. The process of initial deployment of the
583   networking infrastructure and subsequent upgrade is automated by defining a workflow that
584   invokes the IaC (e.g., GitOps workflow) as part of a CI/CD pipeline definition [16]. The
585   advantages of this approach for managing the enterprise networking infrastructure for multi-
586   cloud deployment are the following:
587      •   Enables the enterprise to have tight version control (tracking changes) so that
588          unauthorized networking devices and unauthorized changes in associated configurations
589          do not open up security vulnerabilities.
590      •   Enables the enterprise to have a uniform infrastructure across all environments –
591          development, testing, staging, and production.
592      •   Monitoring the drift (the unintended changes) between the defined infrastructure (as
593          found in IaC) and the operational infrastructure (as measured by monitoring tools
594          described in Section 3.4.1) and taking corrective action to address the drift help to
595          maintain the necessary security posture for the enterprise networking environment.
596      •   The DevSecOps paradigm consisting of CI/CD pipelines invokes the network
597          provisioning tool (IaC code generator) to automate the initial deployment and subsequent
598          re-configuration of the networking infrastructure. Since the pipelines have a built-in audit
599          process, the changes in network configuration are automatically captured in the audit,
600          which in turn enables the enterprise to demonstrate corporate security policy compliance
601          and regulatory policy compliance for their networks where applicable.
602      •   Testing the code (IaC code) generated by IaC tools (and invoked by the CI/CD pipeline
603          code that deploys the infrastructure using IaC) ensures that security policies are
604          consistently and uniformly applied across the entire enterprise networking infrastructure
605          (i.e., multiple cloud services).
606      •   The advantage of having plug-ins for defining network provisioning for different public
607          cloud provider environments is that they can be used to customize the observability tools

608          used for networking monitoring for each of those cloud services that the enterprise has
609          subscribed to [17].

610          Networking Appliances as Services
611   Another trend in the enterprise network landscape is that a portion of network infrastructure can
612   be obtained as a leased service called a network as a service (NaaS) from third-party providers.
613   This service is offered using technologies such as enterprise 5G and edge computing. The
614   advantages of NAAS are as follows:
615      •   Just like subscriptions to SaaS and IaaS, it reduces capex costs for the enterprise.
616      •   Being software-defined and virtualized, it is flexible and scalable.
617      •   As a consequence of the previous advantage, QoS requirements of diverse applications
618          can be met by creating customized traffic flow for each application type [18].
619      •   New applications that require an increased network footprint can be quickly introduced to
620          the enterprise (agility), thus facilitating business diversification.

621      Enterprise Network Configurations for Hybrid Application Environments
622   Since the enterprise context in this document refers to enterprises that consist of on-premises and
623   cloud-hosted applications (i.e., hybrid application environments), this document describes the
624   network configurations or designs (and network communication exchanges based on them) that
625   have emerged as state of practice in those enterprises.
626   The state of practice network configuration features (NCF) found in enterprises with hybrid
627   application environments can be classified under the following areas [19]:
628      •   Network configuration for Device Management
629      •   Network configuration for User Authentication
630      •   Network configuration for Device Authentication and Health Monitoring
631      •   Network configuration for Authorizing Application Access
632      •   Network configuration for Preventing Attack Escalation (Microsegmentation)
633   Each of the network configuration features are enumerated using the identifier of the form HAE-
634   NCF-x, where HAE denotes a hybrid application environment, NCF denotes the network
635   configuration feature, and x stands for the sequence number of the feature.

636          Network Configuration for Device Management
637   With the disappearance of the network perimeter (Section 2.1) and the distribution of the
638   application targets (being a hybrid application environment), enterprises should adopt an
639   “endpoint is the perimeter” paradigm and have a device management system in place.
640   HAE-NCF-1: All endpoints that will be accessing on-premises and cloud-based applications
641   should be managed using a dedicated management network. Minimal managed tasks should
642   include:
643      a) Installation and maintenance of device and service authentication certificates
644      b) Installation and maintenance of device health applications
645      c) Updates of patches on the devices
646      d) Creation and maintenance of white pages that contain device-service mappings to prevent
647         service hijacking (preventing malicious or compromised servers posing as legitimate
648         hosts for the services)

649          Network Configuration for User Authentication
650   HAE-NCF-2: The network should be configured to route the user access request to different
651   destinations for authenticating the user, depending on the target application accessed.
652      a) When the user access request is for a cloud-based application (e.g., SaaS), the user should
653         be routed to the enterprise IdP. When the user access request is for an on-premises web
654         application, the user should be directed to a web gateway (reverse proxy). This
655         redirection can be affected through a process called split DNS. If a digital certificate is
656         used as the first authentication factor, the IdP should check the validity of the user

      August 2022                                                                         Network Landscape

657          certificate (right status and not expired) through mechanisms such as CRL, OCSP, or
658          Active Directory calls.
659      b) A minimum of two authenticator factors must be used to authenticate users. If possession
660         of a valid certificate is the first factor, then the acknowledgement of a push message
661         (using technologies such as DuoMobile, TouchID or Yubikey) or OTP to the cell phone
662         can be used as the second factor.

663          Network Configuration for Device Authentication and Health Monitoring
664   HAE-NCF-3: Device authentication can be performed through certificate validation using
665   appropriate protocols. A device health check can be performed by invoking the resident
666   application.
667   HAE-NCF-4: Microservices-based applications (on-premises or in cloud) should have service
668   proxies installed with each service to provide the necessary connectivity for inter-service
669   communication in addition to performing authentication and authorization services for each
670   service request.

671          Network Configuration for Authorizing Application Access
672   HAE-NCF-4: Standardized protocols, such as OAuth 2.0 [20], should be used to issue access
673   tokens to the validated user, device, or service to enable access to cloud-based applications.

674          Network Configuration for Preventing Attack Escalation
675          (Microsegmentation)
676   Microsegmentation is a security design practice where an internal network (e.g., in the data
677   center, cloud provider region) is divided into isolated segments so that the traffic in and out of
678   each segment can be monitored and controlled [21].
679   Things enabled by microsegmentation are:
680      •   Segments being isolated and relatively small enables close monitoring of the traffic
681          because of better visibility.
682      •   The consequence of the above capability is that granular access control is possible by
683          defining associated policies.
684   The enablement of the above capabilities restricts the unauthorized lateral movement of a user or
685   application that has either (a) breached the perimeter to enter the internal network or (b) been
686   initiated by users within the internal network itself.

687   4.5.1. Prerequisites for Implementing Microsegmentation
688      a) Creation of application identity: The fundamental requirement to enable this is the
689         assignment of a unique identity to each application or service, just like how each user
690         carries a unique identity (e.g., userid). Prior to the era of cloud-based applications, the
691         application requests were validated based on the IP subnet or IP address from which they

      August 2022                                                                         Network Landscape

692          originated. Ubiquitous access and multi-clouds have eliminated the concept of network
693          perimeters. Hence, authentication and authorization based on those parameters are neither
694          feasible nor scalable. Further, the presence of proxies, network address translation, and
695          load balancers make it impossible for the called application to know the IP address of the
696          calling application in order to make authentication or authorization decisions. A unique
697          application identity is inevitable.
698      b) Establishment of trust in application identity: The created application identity should not
699         be subject to spoofing and should be continuously verifiable. Hence, a cryptographic
700         identity in the form of a public key carried in a certificate issued by a trusted source is
701         required to meet these criteria. Verification of the authenticator associated with this
702         identity is done by the authenticating party by sending a challenge, and insurance against
703         replay attack for the authentication process is ensured by sending a nonce attached to the
704         challenge. A secure directory that provides a mapping of the service to the hosting server
705         should be maintained to ensure that applications or services are hosted only on authorized
706         servers and that spurious versions of services do not exist.
707      c) Discovery of application resources: There should be a robust means for discovering all
708         application resources (e.g., services, networks, etc.).
709      d) Segmentation of workloads: Security requirements for all applications and services must
710         be identified and groupings established based on identical security requirements.
711      e) Mapping of logical application groupings to physical or virtual infrastructures:
712         Application-centric groupings must be mapped to physical or virtual infrastructures that
713         constitute the data center topology to facilitate actual applications and services
714         deployment.

715   4.5.2. Microsegmentation – Implementation Approaches
716   The following approaches are employed to implement microsegmentation [22]:
717      a) Segment-based approach: In this approach, the applications and services resources with
718         similar security requirements are grouped into a unique segment, and firewall rules are
719         created to block or allow communication with each group or segment. The segments are
720         created using network layer abstractions, such as VLAN IDs or some other tagging
721         approaches, while policies are defined using network address constructs (e.g., IP addresses
722         and ports). Policies apply to subnets (e.g., VLANs) and not to individual hosts. Each
723         segment is protected by gateway devices, such as intelligent switches and routers or next-
724         generation firewalls (NGFWs), which should have the capacity to react and adapt in
725         response to the threats and changes in the application workflows. Segmentation gateways
726         monitor traffic, stop threats, and enforce granular access across east-west traffic (rarely for
727         north-south traffic) within on-premises data centers or cloud regions. The main difficulty
728         with this approach is the difficulty in mapping the applications security requirements-
729         based segments created to corresponding network segments [23].
730          A schematic diagram of the segment-based microsegmentation is shown in Figure 1.
731          Each numbered microsegment in the figure is a unique VLAN identified by a VLAN ID.
732          The group of applications that will run in that particular VLAN segment can be defined
733          using different criteria. One of the criteria is “all applications with similar security

735          database servers) associated with a particular application” should run in a single
736          microsegment, as shown in the figure.

740      b) Virtualized server-based approach: This approach is only applicable to networks that
741         contain virtualized servers since it is implemented in the hypervisor. There are two
742         possible mechanisms:
743              1. Using virtual firewalls inside a hypervisor to isolate traffic destined for different
744                 VMs inside the hypervisor
745              2. Using encapsulation techniques to create overlays (e.g., VXLAN) that run on top
746                 of an underlay network consisting of IP addresses designations; access control
747                 policies are enforced on the hypervisor itself outside of the workload (application
748                 or microservice)
749      c) Host-based microsegmentation: Alternatively (or additionally), host-based
750         microsegmentation can be implemented using software agents on the endpoint artifacts
751         (e.g., servers). It leverages native firewall functionality built into the host. Software agents
752         can overlay a software-defined segmented network across data centers, cloud, bare metal,
753         and hybrid environments. The agent provides context awareness and visibility for each
754         workload and, hence, enables the definition and enforcement of fine-grained policies.
755      d) Identity-based microsegmentation: Identity-based microsegmentation policies use
756         contextual, application-driven identifiers (e.g., order processing front-end service can
757         communicate with inventory back-end service) instead of network parameters (permit
758         calls from 192.168.10.x subnet to 10.0.0.31) [24]. The identifiers assigned to services are
759         cryptographic identities, which they use for mutual authentication and authorization
760         during each service request and response.
761   The advantages of this type of microsegmentation are:
762      •   Policies based on service/application identities do not use any infrastructure-related
763          variables (e.g., IP addresses, subnets, etc.), so these policies are environment-agnostic
764          and provide the freedom for the services/applications to be migrated to different
765          environments and still maintain the same policies.

766      •   Policies being independent of infrastructure enables them to be tested by merely
767          exercising the application and observing the outcomes (e.g., trace of the sequence of
768          service calls and requests/responses instead of configuring the infrastructure correctly for
769          test runs).
770      •   With the availability of tools for the declarative specification of policies through “policy
771          as code” tools, microsegmentation policies can be defined/implemented by incorporating
772          the code into automated workflows, such as CI/CD pipelines.
773      •   Microsegmentation enables granular (fine-grained) access control by providing visibility
774          to application call sequences/interdependencies and data flows through host-level tracking,
775          thus enabling the enforcement of security policies for application traffic that is both north-
776          south and east-west, irrespective of the environment (e.g., corporate data center or cloud
777          infrastructure).
778   The reason that identity-based microsegmentation is studied under the enterprise network
779   landscape is that it enables only valid network traffic between the various component services of
780   the application due to the mutual authentication and authorization using service identities, thus
781   enabling the goals of zero trust network access (ZTNA) to be met [25].

782          Security Frameworks Governing Network Configurations
783   The network configurations described in Sections 4.1 through 4.5 are each for specific functions
784   (e.g., user authentication, preventing attack escalation, etc.). In many enterprise environments,
785   these network configurations are not ad hoc but are driven by some conceptual underpinning
786   (e.g., contextual information) and/or some evolving enterprise network security framework that
787   the enterprise has chosen to implement. Examples of such frameworks are software-defined
788   perimeter (SDPs) and zero trust network access (ZTNA).

789   4.6.1. Conceptual Underpinnings – Contextual Information
790   Section 2.4 discussed the limitation of using user identity alone to authorize application access.
791   This, however, does not mean that identity verification can be relegated to a secondary
792   requirement. It has been widely recognized that identity validation is the entry point (may be a
793   highly vulnerable point of entry into the system) to an application request [26] since all requests
794   – whether coming from a service (or microservice), user, or device – come with a claimed
795   identity. This identity must be verified using robust, phishing-resistant multi-factor
796   authentication.
797   However, other attributes associated with the user and the information associated with other
798   entities involved in an application access request, such as devices and services, are required in
799   current enterprise IT environments and are collectively called contextual information. This
800   contextual information set may vary from one enterprise to another and is also based on the level
801   of trust that the organization requires for a particular access request. Since the role of contextual
802   information in potential attacks may not be known, the set to be included in the access decision is
803   a risk-based decision. Contextual information may broadly belong to the following five key areas
804   [27]:

805      1. Information about the user requesting access – Apart from user identity, attributes
806         associated with the user, such as their role in the organization, current assignments, and
807         status (cross verification of identity in the enterprise IDM vs enterprise directory)
808      2. Information about the device from which access is being requested – Establishing trust in
809         the device through a combination of health and risk profiles of the device. For example,
810         the risk profile of the device can be obtained through an out-of-the-box posture check
811         (risk of the device [28]) with or without integrating with an endpoint protection tool for
812         the device. Other crucial information (provided by telemetry data) needed to assess the
813         security status of the endpoint devices [29] include (a) device support label (the device is
814         managed or corporate-owned) and (b) device posture information (whether it has been
815         compromised). All of these factors go into a policy evaluation for determining the level
816         of trust and must be channeled into authentication and monitoring decisions [30].
817      3. Information about real-time contextual data – Date, time, and geolocation at which the
818         access request occurs
819      4. Information about IT services (e.g., app, data, etc.) being accessed
820      5. Information about the security of the environment hosting the IT services being accessed
821   The requirements for contextual information [27]:
822      •   Should include not only that which is collected by the native platform (the platform on
823          which the application is hosted) but also that which can be obtained from third-party
824          platforms and can provide more detailed information
825      •   Should be available in real time so that user experience with access is not affected
826      •   Should be prioritized based on the value each provides
827      •   Should be consistent with the level of risk associated with each access request
828   No application and/or data access in the modern enterprise network context can be deemed
829   secure by ignoring relevant contextual information when the access scenario involves allowing a
830   user, device, or service from any network channel (e.g., corporate network, home network,
831   public network, or branch office) to access a resource located anywhere (on-premises or cloud).

832   4.6.2. Network Security Framework – Software-defined Perimeter (SDP)
833   One conceptual underpinning for secure network access to IT resources is the software-defined
834   perimeter (SDP) [31]. In SDP, the separation between networks is not defined by network
835   address group or VLANs, making it network-agnostic. It is logically and dynamically defined for
836   each user and each particular request. In other words, for each user request, the subset of IT
837   resources to which the user has access is dynamically allocated irrespective of the location of the
838   resource (e.g., corporate data center, branch office, private or public cloud, etc.). The salient
839   principles of SDP include:
840      •   The SDP concept involves making all IT resources invisible (e.g., ports, workloads, and
841          applications) and making them known and accessible only after the user is authenticated
842          and authorized. Only a network connection between the user and the allowed IT
843          resources is established, thus following the least privilege principle.

844      •   The access level determined by the previous process is continuously reevaluated during
845          the user session and recalibrated if required. In other words, as the context surrounding
846          the identity changes in real time, so can the user’s entitlements [31].
847      •   Reduce the attack surface by preventing lateral movement [32] through techniques like
848          microsegmentation, as described in Section 4.4. With the increasing deployment of
849          microservices, the inter-services resource requests (generator of east-west traffic)
850          dominate external application requests (north-south traffic). Application of this principle
851          thus secures east-west traffic.

852   4.6.3. Network Security Framework – Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA)
853   ZTNA is the consequence of a zero trust architecture, which in turn is a realization of zero trust
854   principles. NIST defines zero trust and zero trust principles as [33]:
855      •   Zero trust (ZT) is the term for an evolving set of cybersecurity paradigms that move
856          defenses from static, network-based perimeters to focus on users, assets, and resources. It
857          is a set of security primitives rather than a particular set of technologies. Zero trust
858          assumes that there is no implicit trust granted to assets or user accounts based solely on
859          their physical or network location (i.e., local area networks versus the internet) or based
860          on asset ownership (enterprise or personally owned). Zero trust focuses on protecting
861          resources (e.g., assets, services, workflows, network accounts, etc.) rather than network
862          segments, as the network location is no longer seen as the prime component to the
863          security posture of the resource.
864      •   A zero trust architecture (ZTA) uses zero trust principles to plan industrial and enterprise
865          infrastructure and workflows.
866   NIST’s guidance on ZTA [33] contains an abstract definition of zero trust architecture (ZTA)
867   and gives general deployment models and use cases where zero trust could improve an
868   enterprise’s overall information technology security posture. From the NIST vision of ZTA and
869   state of practice implementations [34], the following have emerged as the three building blocks
870   of ZTA:
871      1. Client or Browser: The point of entry for all users to access any resources hosted in
872         multi-cloud and on-premises environments
873      2. The Controller: The policy decision engine, which manages the policies, conditions, and
874         entitlements that grant access for all users, devices, and workloads from a single
875         dashboard or via API
876      3. The Gateway: The policy enforcement point. Gateways control the flow of access to
877         protected resources. It dynamically builds micro-segmentation rules based on granted
878         entitlements.
879   In all security frameworks for current enterprise network environments, the common principles
880   that underly application-specific requirements – such as low latency, high data transfer rates, and
881   high reliability – that were applicable in previous network landscapes remain the same.

882      Secure Wide Area Network Infrastructure for an Enterprise Network
883   The wide area network (WAN) became an integral part of the enterprise network when
884   organizations needed to connect their local area networks (LANs) across multiple geographically
885   distributed locations (within the country and, in some cases, globally) starting in the 1980s. The
886   initial WAN technology involved point-to-point (P2P) leased lines followed by Frame Relay.
887   The first IP-based network was multiprotocol label switching (MPLS), which enabled multiple
888   types of traffic – such as voice, video, and data – to travel on the same line.
889   With the advent of technologies such as virtualization and increasing enterprise access to cloud
890   services, enterprises have begun to adopt a new WAN technology called the software-defined
891   wide area network (SD-WAN). SD-WAN technology removes the tight coupling between the
892   control plane and data plane functions of the network and enables the centralized specification of
893   various policies, such as access control, routing, and application traffic prioritization.
894   Another development involved integrating all of the point security solutions provided by various
895   network security appliances (Section 3) into a network security services infrastructure. Industry
896   and industry consortiums use the term secure access service edge (SASE) [35] to refer to a
897   comprehensive framework that offers wide area networking and various security services. SASE
898   can be looked upon as the networking counterpart of the application’s service mesh, which
899   provides a comprehensive set of application services, including security for cloud-native
900   applications.
901   Based on the above discussion, this section will focus on the following topics:
902      •   Requirements for a secure SD-WAN
903      •   Requirements for an integrated security services architecture for SD-WAN

904          Common Requirements for a Secure SD-WAN
905   In addition to CSP-provided VPNs, a networking technology that provides network connectivity
906   for accessing cloud-based services for enterprises is the software-defined wide area networking
907   (SD-WAN).
908   The design goals and common features in all SD-WAN offerings include:
909      •   Extensive connectivity: To securely connect users located anywhere (e.g., home, public
910          location, branch office, corporate office, etc.) to applications and resources hosted
911          anywhere (e.g., data center, single or multiple cloud services) using any WAN transport
912          (e.g., MPLS, Broadband Internet, 4G, LTE, 5G wireless)
913      •   Application awareness: To monitor the network traffic and dynamically choose the best
914          path available based on (a) the type of network traffic, (b) network load conditions, and
915          (c) the application’s business priority. This capability is enabled using techniques such as
916          bandwidth utilization, load balancing, and the optimization of speed by reducing jitters,
917          latency, and packet loss. Addressing application’s business priority is only possible if the
918          SD-WAN solution has the ability to identify different types of applications (e.g.,
919          messaging/email application, social media application, general storage-related
920          applications, supply chain applications) and allocate routing priorities and WAN
921          resources accordingly.

922      •   Integration of security and networking functions: Use of appliances that contain a
923          combination of networking and security functions (e.g., the presence of a firewall and
924          secure web gateway [SWG] functions in a WAN router) [36]
925      •   Centralized visibility and management capabilities: Includes the ability to recognize and
926          authenticate newly connected appliances and bring them under the defined management
927          workflows as nodes so as to configure a uniform set of policies that cover all components
928      •   Integration with remote LAN locations: An additional preferred but non-essential feature
929          is the integration of WAN and LAN functions in a single appliance (the latter going by
930          the name SD-Branch), which can be managed using a single management console, thus
931          providing better visibility into both components. This feature enables the connectivity of
932          SD-WAN into the local LAN at the remote branch offices.

933          Specific Requirements for WANs for Cloud Access
934   Enterprises can gain cloud access in two ways: (1) through the VPN services provided by the
935   cloud providers or by (2) integrating their own SD-WAN with cloud providers’ private networks,
936   often called the cloud WAN. The advantage of the second approach is that enterprises can extend
937   their existing WANs into and across a cloud provider’s private network, enabling consistent
938   enterprise networking and security policy enforcement. Two of the advantages of this extension
939   are:
940      1. Complete end-to-end visibility between “access endpoint” and IT resource (application or
941         data) endpoint even though the latter is located in a cloud provider’s network
942      2. Application of the network segmentation logic deployed for accessing on-premises
943         resources to the cloud-based resources [37]
944   This orchestration of the cloud provider’s private network can be achieved by designing a
945   customized overlay network on top of the cloud provider’s network as the underlay network.
946   This feature is contingent upon CSPs offering API integrations for different SD-WAN offerings
947   [38][39][40].
948   An architecture has emerged for managing enterprise networks that are connected to multiple
949   CSPs. A portion of the industry calls the collection of appliances in this architecture a cloud
950   network platform. The requirements for this multi-cloud networking platform are [41]:
951      •   It should deliver common operational visibility and control across native network access
952          provided by multiple cloud providers. The big challenge is that public cloud providers
953          have different proprietary architectures using their own “constructs.” In order to provide
954          a networking architecture that can “cross clouds,” one needs to leverage the cloud-native

       August 2022                                                                       Network Landscape

961       •   It should enable end-to-end encryption inside of the cloud as well as high-performance
962           encryption from the data center to the cloud.
963       •   It should support automation for deployment and configuration.
964    Based on the above requirements, multi-cloud networking platform offerings have emerged with
965    the following architectural elements:
966       •   An abstraction layer that sits on top of the native network access offered by individual
967           CSPs to their services. This layer enables the enterprise to manage the entire enterprise
968           network – consisting of connectivity to multiple clouds, intra-cloud connections, and the
969           on-premises data center network fabrics – as one unit. To enable this, complete visibility
970           into the entire enterprise network landscape is needed. Hence, this layer needs input from
971           sophisticated observability and monitoring tools to carry out its functions.
972       •   Choosing an infrastructure configuration (e.g., virtual private cloud configuration with
973           isolated network segments) for hosting applications in the network infrastructure
974           provided by the CSP is facilitated by a class of tools called IaC tools, which have features
975           with network configuration definitions of major CSPs built in as plug-ins. This facilitates
976           initial networking resource provisioning and subsequent modification of networking
977           configuration and resources for hosting enterprise applications in clouds.
978    There are four industry trends [43] that may have security implications with regard to SD-WAN
979    [44]:
980       1. SD-WAN access is acquired as a cloud-based service under the umbrella of network as a
981          service (NaaS), just like IaaS and SaaS.
982       2. AI-based algorithms are used for monitoring networks for security-related conditions; for
983          resiliency-improving measures, such as throttling for certain destinations; and for
984          dynamic routing decisions to maintain QoS parameters, such as latency and bandwidth.
985       3. Wireless networks are used for last mile connectivity using a 5G Radio Access Network
986          (RAN).
987       4. Secure remote access functionalities provided by technologies such as VPN are combined
988          into SD-WAN [45].

989           Requirements for an Integrated Security Services Architecture for SD-WAN
990    An integrated security services architecture for SD-WAN has integrated within it both
991    networking and security functions. The network access and security functions capabilities are
992    offered as a cloud service that are accessible for enterprises through strategic network locations
993    spread over a wide area called Point of Presence (PoP). The term coined by Gartner in 2019 to
994    denote an architecture that converges networking and security functions and delivered at a global
995    scale as a cloud service is called Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) [46]. The networking and
996    security services delivered by a service called SASE are not new but just delivered together as a
997    single package instead of through point security solutions (chapter 3). The various points of
998    connectivity from the enterprise to SASE PoPs are called enterprise edges. The enterprise edges
999    can be either:
1000      •   Clients (Users accessing through desktops, laptops and mobile devices either from branch
1001          offices or remote locations such as Home, or IoTs)

       August 2022                                                                       Network Landscape

1002      •   IT Resources (Internal Apps hosted in data centers or branch offices, Cloud-based Apps
1003          (SaaS, IaaS))
1004   The SASE network infrastructure thus becomes an integral part of the enterprise network
1005   whenever one or more of the enterprise edges get connected to various PoPs of SASE cloud
1006   service.
1007   The three primary functions delivered by SASE are [46]:
1008      •   Optimization of Network Traffic for different types of Traffic – Reduce Latency and
1009          Improve Availability
1010      •   Access Control for accessing different types of IT resources -Applications, Databases etc.
1011      •   Threat Prevention – Monitoring, Gathering threat and attack information, remedial action
1012   Some of the structural features in SASE offerings are:
1013      •   Globally distributed point of presence (PoP): A global SD-WAN service with its own
1014          private backbone network consisting of worldwide points of presence (PoPs) intended to
1015          minimize latency problems. In some instances, major cloud vendors’ PoPs may also be
1016          leveraged.
1017      •   Security agent on devices: The security agent on the end user’s device undertakes
1018          networking decisions and directs traffic from different applications. Specific capabilities
1019          include dynamically allowing or denying connections to services and applications based
1020          on an organization’s defined business rules.
1021   The following are the minimal security services found in an integrated architecture:
1022      •   Firewall services
1023      •   Secure web gateway services
1024      •   Anti-malware services
1025      •   IPS services
1026      •   CASB services
1027      •   DLP services
1028   Some of the advanced security features found in SASE offerings include:
1029      •   Browser isolation technology: This is often combined with secure web gateway solutions
1030          and provides improved web activity security to tackle threats in real time.
1031      •   Continuous adaptive risk and trust assessment (CARTA) strategy: This strategy involves
1032          constantly monitoring sessions and performs adaptive behavior analysis on monitoring
1033          parameters to dynamically change security levels and permissions if the trust profile (e.g.,
1034          trust deficit) of a device changes.

1035      Summary and Conclusions
1036   The purpose of this document is to provide insights into the current enterprise network landscape
1037   in terms of topology, traffic flows, and security threats. It takes the view that changes in
1038   application architecture and technologies (monolithic to microservices-based, bare metal to
1039   virtualization/containers) and increased subscriptions to various types of cloud services (e.g.,
1040   IaaS, SaaS) are drivers of the current state of enterprise networks.
1041   It outlines the limitations of existing network access security assumptions and technologies due
1042   to changes in network topologies in modern enterprise networks. The emergence of new network
1043   appliances (e.g., CASB), enhanced features in existing appliances (firewalls), network
1044   automation tools for gathering data for visibility/monitoring, threat detection and remedial
1045   actions, and tools for automated network provisioning for different public CSP environments
1046   (enabled by IaC tools invoked as part of the smart workflows called CI/CD pipelines defined
1047   under the DevSecOps paradigm) are all discussed under point security solutions. Various
1048   networking configurations for user, device, and service authentication and authorization as well
1049   as microsegmentation to prevent the escalation of attacks are also discussed.
1050   Finally, this document discusses the latest WAN technologies that form part of the current
1051   enterprise network landscape, as well as the features of WAN offerings with global PoP and
1052   integrated security services called SASE.
