47   Abstract
48   A log is a record of events that occur within an organization’s computing assets, including
49   physical and virtual platforms, networks, services, and cloud environments. Log management is
50   the process for generating, transmitting, storing, accessing, and disposing of log data. It
51   facilitates log usage and analysis for many purposes, including identifying and investigating
52   cybersecurity incidents, finding operational issues, and ensuring that records are stored for the
53   required period of time. This document defines a playbook intended to help any organization
54   plan improvements to its cybersecurity log management.

157   Executive Summary
158   A log is a record of the events that occur within an organization’s computing assets, including
159   physical and virtual platforms, networks, services, and cloud environments. Log management is
160   the process for generating, transmitting, storing, accessing, and disposing of log data. It
161   facilitates log usage and analysis for many purposes, including identifying and investigating
162   cybersecurity incidents, finding operational issues, and ensuring that records are stored for the
163   required period of time. Logging and log management practices are part of many cybersecurity
164   and privacy-related laws and regulations. They are also an important part of numerous standards,
165   guidance, and other sets of recommendations for every sector.
166   The purpose of this document is to help all organizations improve their log management so that
167   they have the log data they need. This document’s scope is organization-wide cybersecurity log
168   management planning; all other aspects of logging and log management are out of scope. The
169   document defines a playbook for cybersecurity log management planning with actionable steps
170   that organizations can take for planning improvements to their log management practices. While
171   the plays in the playbook are not comprehensive, they are noteworthy and generally beneficial to
172   organizations. The plays intentionally avoid any recommendations on the details of log
173   management. Log management needs are incredibly variable from one organization to another
174   and frequently change.
175   This playbook can help organizations identify and prioritize their needs and determine how to
176   best meet those needs. There is no “correct” way for an organization to use the playbook. An
177   organization may choose to use it as the start of its own new playbook for log management
178   planning, integrate it with an existing log management playbook, or use its information as
179   reference material when considering its plans, policies, and processes.

180      Introduction
181   A log is a record of the events that occur within an organization’s computing assets, including
182   physical and virtual platforms, networks, services, and cloud environments. Logs are composed
183   of log entries, and each entry contains information related to a specific event, which is an
184   observable occurrence in a computing asset. Logs serve many functions within most
185   organizations, such as optimizing system and network performance, recording the actions of
186   users, and providing useful data for investigating malicious activity. Many logs contain records
187   that are relevant for cybersecurity, such as operating system logs that capture system events and
188   audit records, application logs that capture application operational and security events, and
189   cybersecurity software logs that record routine events, adverse events, and possible malicious
190   activity.
191   Log management is the process for generating, transmitting, storing, accessing, and disposing of
192   log data. It facilitates an organization’s log usage and analysis. Log management can benefit an
193   organization in many ways. For example, it helps ensure that records are stored in sufficient
194   detail for an appropriate period of time. The continuous monitoring and analysis of logs are
195   beneficial for identifying security incidents, policy violations, fraudulent activity, and
196   operational problems shortly after they have occurred, and for providing useful information for
197   resolving such problems. Logs can also be useful for performing auditing and forensic analysis,
198   supporting the organization’s internal investigations, establishing baselines, verifying that assets
199   operate as intended, and identifying operational trends and long-term problems.
200   Logging and log management practices are part of many cybersecurity and privacy-related laws,
201   regulations, standards, guidance, and recommendations for every sector.

202          Purpose and Scope
203   The purpose of this document is to help all organizations improve their log management so that
204   they have the log data they need. The document’s scope is cybersecurity log management
205   planning. All other aspects of logging and log management, including implementing log
206   management technology and making use of log data, are out of scope. The log plan is informed
207   by the activities that will leverage the logs to inform security and operational decisions.
208   This document replaces the original NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-92 [SP800-92], which
209   was released in 2006. That material was developed at a time when many organizations were just
210   starting to think about log management. With the wealth of information now available on log
211   management, this revision of NIST SP 800-92 focuses on high-level guidance for organization-
212   wide improvement, not the details of implementation nor the capabilities of particular
213   technologies.
214   The main content of this publication is a playbook for cybersecurity log management planning.
215   The playbook provides actionable steps that organizations can take to plan improvements to their
216   log management practices in support of recommended practices and regulatory requirements.
217   The playbook contains four high-level plays, each of which is a practice that involves two or
218   more tasks (or other lower-level plays). The playbook and the plays are not comprehensive, but
219   the listed plays are noteworthy and generally beneficial to organizations. Section 2 provides
220   additional information on how to make use of the playbook and plays.

258      How to Use This Publication
259   Sections 3 through 6 of this publication define the following high-level plays, as well as their
260   component tasks and plays:
261      •   INV, Update Logging-Related Inventories (Section 3): Characterize the current state of
262          your organization’s cybersecurity logging.
263      •   TS, Define Target State (Section 4): Define the target state for your organization’s
264          cybersecurity logging.
265      •   GRC, Document Gaps and Their Root Causes (Section 5): Document the gaps
266          between the current cybersecurity logging state and the target state, and identify the root
267          causes of each gap.
268      •   PMG, Develop a Plan to Mitigate the Gaps (Section 6): Develop a plan for addressing
269          the root causes of the identified gaps in order to reach the target state.

270   There is no “correct” way to use the playbook. An organization may choose to use it as the start
271   of its own new playbook for log management planning, integrate it with an existing log
272   management playbook, or use its information as reference material when considering its own
273   plans, policies, and processes.
274   Each play includes the following components:
275      •   Unique ID number (for example, INV-5)
276      •   Title (for example, Update the Work Role Inventory)
277      •   Summary, to include the play’s desired outcome
278      •   Tasks to perform. Each task is briefly stated and has a unique identifier based on its
279          play’s ID. Tasks that need a more detailed explanation are either defined as separate
280          plays or have additional explanatory text following them under the label supporting
281          information for tasks. Each list of tasks is assumed to typically be performed
282          sequentially unless otherwise noted by the phrase “not necessarily in order.”
283   Some plays also include examples related to the play, such as possible roles and
284   responsibilities, use cases, or sources of requirements.
285   In addition to the plays themselves, Appendix B contains crosswalks that indicate how
286   performing each play and its tasks can most significantly help an organization achieve
287   recommended outcomes, controls, and other concepts from a variety of NIST resources.
288   The plays and tasks are intentionally focused on important actions to perform for planning and,
289   thus, avoid any recommendations on the details of log management. Log management needs are
290   incredibly variable from one organization to another and frequently change, so this playbook
291   avoids specifying who is responsible for planning or performing any of the plays or tasks.
292   Rather, this playbook helps organizations identify and prioritize their needs and determine how
293   to best meet those needs.

296   Summary: Characterize the current state of your organization’s cybersecurity logging through a
297   set of inventories. This is not an assessment, only information gathering. The desired outcome is
298   a reasonably comprehensive, up-to-date snapshot of the people, processes, and technologies that
299   are involved with cybersecurity logging.
300   Tasks to perform include the following (not necessarily in order):
301      1. INV-1, Update the Inventory of Log Source Types
302      2. INV-2, Update the Logging Infrastructure Inventory
303      3. INV-3, Update the Logging Use Case Inventory
304      4. INV-4, Update the Requirements Inventory
305      5. INV-5, Update the Work Role Inventory
306   Supporting information for tasks: There are interdependencies between these tasks, so changes
307   to one inventory may necessitate changes to other inventories.

308             INV-1, Update the Inventory of Log Source Types
309   [Tasks] [Examples]                                                         [Previous Play] [Next Play]
310   Summary: Update the inventory of your organization’s types of log sources. A log source is a
311   computing asset (e.g., operating system, application, cloud-based service, container) that is
312   capable of generating cybersecurity log entries. The desired outcome is a reasonably
313   comprehensive, up-to-date picture of all of the types of cybersecurity log data currently available
314   to your organization.
315   Tasks to perform include the following (not necessarily in order):
316      1. INV-1.1: Determine which characteristics to record in the inventory for each log source
317         type. Basic configuration information is generally the minimum to collect. Examples of
318         additional details include copies of logging procedures and other documentation and the
319         identities of each log source within each log source type (essentially, a log source
320         inventory).
321      2. INV-1.2: Update the inventory to reflect standard configurations for logging and which
322         types of assets use each standard configuration.
323      3. INV-1.3: Update the inventory to reflect exceptions to standard configurations for
324         logging, the nature of each exception, and which types of assets employ each exception.
325      4. INV-1.4: Update the inventory to reflect all other types of assets not included in #2 or #3
326         with representative samples of their logging configurations.
327   Examples of log source types include:
328      •      Networks, including network infrastructure devices and the traffic they carry
329      •      Software (e.g., firmware, operating systems, and applications)

337   [Tasks] [Examples]                                                     [Previous Play] [Next Play]
338   Summary: Update the inventory of your organization’s cybersecurity logging infrastructure
339   components. The logging infrastructure encompasses the hardware, software, systems, services,
340   and networks used to transmit, store, analyze, and dispose of log data generated by the log
341   sources. The desired outcome is a comprehensive, up-to-date picture of all of the logging
342   infrastructure components that are currently part of your organization.
343   Tasks to perform include the following:
344      1. INV-2.1: Update the inventory so that it reflects the current set of logging infrastructure
345         components.
346      2. INV-2.2: Update the characteristics recorded for each component in the inventory.
347      3. INV-2.3: Update the logging infrastructure architecture diagrams and other
348         documentation to reflect the updates from INV-2.1 and INV-2.2.
349   Examples of logging infrastructure components include:
350      •   Centralized systems that perform security information and event monitoring (SIEM) and
351          provide bulk storage and other analytical workflows or services
352      •   Cold data storage
353      •   Cyber threat intelligence feeds from third-party services
354      •   Data lakes that act as centrally accessible log storage with log sources that provide data to
355          the data lake and log analysis technologies that receive log data from the data lake instead
356          of or in addition to the log sources that directly provide data to each log analysis
357          technology
358      •   Domain Name System (DNS) logging system
359      •   Managed services for log monitoring and analysis
360      •   Security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) implementation
361      •   User behavior monitoring and analytics

364   Summary: Update the organization’s inventory of logging use cases and the desired outcomes
365   of each use case. This information is valuable when developing or updating logging policies.
366   One desired outcome is that all logging is done for a purpose and not just for the sake of
367   collecting log data. Another desired outcome is that all logging use cases are taken into
368   consideration when defining the target state for cybersecurity log management.
369   Tasks to perform include the following:
370      1. INV-3.1: Document summaries of the known logging use cases and the desired outcome
371         of each.
372      2. INV-3.2: Share the use cases with stakeholders, solicit their feedback, and make
373         revisions if needed.
374   Examples of possible use cases include:
375      •   Continuous monitoring
376      •   Early detection of malicious behavior, potentially malicious behavior, and advanced
377          threats that involve all user and non-user accounts
378      •   Evidence of compliance with a standard/compliance reporting
379      •   Evidence of verification of the functional and security operations of the components
380      •   Incident response
381      •   Passive DNS request analysis
382      •   Security operations
383      •   SIEM tools
384      •   Software development artifact capture, for continuous integration/continuous delivery
385          (CI/CD)
386      •   Threat detection and investigation, including threat hunting
387      •   Zero trust implementation

390   Summary: Update the inventory of existing requirements that are applicable to your
391   organization’s cybersecurity logging. Requirements may come from applicable laws, regulations,
392   standards, and internal policies. The desired outcome is a reasonably comprehensive set of
393   current requirements for your organization’s cybersecurity logging.
394   Tasks to perform include the following (not necessarily in order):
395      1. INV-4.1: Confirm that all requirements already in the inventory are still applicable, and
396         remove outdated requirements.
397      2. INV-4.2: Identify all new requirements applicable to existing log source types or logging
398         use cases.

410   [Tasks] [Examples]                                                     [Previous Play] [Next Play]
411   Summary: Update the inventory of cybersecurity logging-related work roles that your personnel
412   or third parties perform. Each work role includes one or more tasks, and each task is associated
413   with one or more knowledge and skill statements, as defined in NIST SP 800-181 [SP800-
414   181r1]. There are two desired outcomes: to confirm that all necessary work roles and tasks are
415   assigned and to inform the organization’s training and process documentation planning.
416   Tasks to perform include the following (not necessarily in order):
417      1. INV-5.1: Confirm that all roles already in the inventory are still applicable.
418      2. INV-5.2: Identify any new roles, and add them to the inventory.
419      3. INV-5.3: Update which tasks are associated with each role.
420      4. INV-5.4: Update which knowledge and skill statements are associated with each task.

422         and make revisions if needed.
423      6. INV-5.6: Disseminate the updated work role inventory information to affected parties.
424   Examples of parties within an organization who may have log management responsibilities
425   include the following. Note that many of these responsibilities may also be performed by third
426   parties, such as managed security service providers and cloud service providers, for some of the
427   organization’s assets.

473   Summary: Define the target state for your organization’s cybersecurity logging. The target state
474   is a combination of (mandatory) requirements from all applicable laws, regulations, standards,
475   and internal policies and (desired) goals and objectives for log management based on balancing
476   the organization’s reduction of risk and the need for logging resilience with the time and
477   resources needed to perform log management functions. The desired outcome is an integrated set
478   of prioritized requirements, goals, and objectives for your organization’s cybersecurity logging.
479   This set should be updated periodically and as major changes occur, like the impending
480   implementation of a new law or regulation, the introduction of new technology, or the
481   observation of new threats.
482   Tasks to perform include the following (not necessarily in order):
483      1. TS-1, Forecast Future Changes to Logging Inventories
484      2. TS-2, Define Target State for Log Generation
485      3. TS-3, Define Target State for Log Storage and Transfer
486      4. TS-4, Define Target State for Log Access
487      5. TS-5, Define Target State for Log Disposal
488   Supporting information for tasks: There are interdependencies between these tasks. For
489   example, generating a higher volume of logs may necessitate increasing resources for log
490   storage. Conversely, a firm limit on log storage resources may necessitate generating less log
491   data, being more selective about which generated log data is stored, or reducing how long some
492   log data is stored.

495   Summary: Forecast future changes to the organization’s logging inventories (e.g., log source
496   types, infrastructure, use cases, requirements, and work roles), and consider their potential
497   effects on each other and the organization’s logging practices. This includes known changes and
498   educated guesses about future changes. The desired outcome is a set of prioritized future changes
499   that inform the target states for the organization’s logging.

526   Tasks to perform include the following (not necessarily in order):
527      1. TS-2.1: For each type of log source, determine whether it should be required,
528         recommended, not recommended, or prohibited.
529      2. TS-2.2: Determine which types of events each log source should or must log and which
530         types of events each log source should not or must not log.
531      3. TS-2.3: Determine which data characteristics should or must be logged for each type of
532         event, including the log source identity and other metadata, and which types of data
533         characteristics should not or must not be logged.
534      4. TS-2.4: Determine whether the log source might intentionally or inadvertently capture
535         sensitive data, including personal information, passwords, private keys, and access
536         tokens.
537      5. TS-2.5: Determine how frequently each type of event should or must be logged.
538      6. TS-2.6: Determine how to handle log generation errors.
539      7. TS-2.7: Determine when logs should or must record cleartext data instead of or in

      October 2023                                                                            Planning Guide

545      10. TS-2.10: Determine how log generation should or must be protected.
546      11. TS-2.11: Define how the protection of log generation should or must be monitored and
547          validated to ensure that logging is enabled and functioning normally.
548   Supporting information for tasks: Recording more log data is not necessarily better. Generally,
549   organizations should only require logging the necessary data and also have recommendations for
550   which other types and sources of data should be logged if resources permit. Some organizations
551   choose to have all or nearly all log data generated and stored for at least a short period of time in
552   case it is needed; this approach favors security considerations over usability and resource usage.
553   When establishing requirements and recommendations, organizations should be flexible since
554   each host is different and will log different amounts of data than other hosts. The logging
555   behavior of a host may also change rapidly due to an upgrade, patch, or configuration change.
556   Organizations may permit administrators to temporarily reconfigure log sources during adverse
557   conditions, such as unsuccessful malware attacks that cause the same type of log entry to be
558   generated many times. These configuration changes should be performed as a last resort and be
559   as precise as possible. Log source administrators should inform logging infrastructure
560   administrators of such configuration changes to ensure that log management processes are
561   modified if needed.
562   In some cases, software licenses may need to be upgraded in order to generate the required or
563   desired information for logs.

568   Summary: Define your organization’s log storage and transfer-related requirements and goals.
569   This should take log source types, log event types, system locations, and any other pertinent

573   Tasks to perform include the following (not necessarily in order):
574      1. TS-3.1: Determine how long each log event should or must be preserved at the log
575         source.
576      2. TS-3.2: Determine which events, if any, should or must be transferred to a log
577         infrastructure from log sources, which log infrastructure systems should receive the
578         transferred event data, and which data characteristics should or must be transferred for

582      4. TS-3.4: Determine how log data should or must be transferred to the log infrastructure,
583         including out-of-band methods where appropriate, and how frequently log data should or
584         must be transferred.
585      5. TS-3.5: Determine how the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of each log event
586         should or must be protected while in storage at the log source, while in the log
587         infrastructure, while being transferred from the log source to the log infrastructure, and
588         while being transferred from one log infrastructure component to another.
589      6. TS-3.6: Determine how much log storage space should or must be available at the log
590         sources and the log infrastructure.
591      7. TS-3.7: Determine how to handle log storage and log transfer errors at the log sources
592         and the log infrastructure.
593      8. TS-3.8: Determine if and when each type of log event should or must be transferred from
594         active storage to cold data storage for data retention purposes.
595      9. TS-3.9: Determine which log format/type to use (if this is an option).
596      10. TS-3.10: Determine how the protection of log storage and transfers should or must be
597          monitored and validated to ensure their confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
598   Supporting information for tasks: Completing these tasks effectively designs the high-level
599   architecture of the log infrastructure, such as the logical and physical locations of centralized log
600   data storage and various log analysis services. When most organizations only had one or a few
601   closely related logging use cases, a centralized logging server or group of servers could often
602   handle all of an organization’s logging infrastructure needs. Now, organizations often have
603   several diverse logging use cases and magnitudes more data to process and store, so more
604   complex logging architectures have become commonplace. For example, some organizations use
605   a massive data lake to hold all of their security log data instead of a centralized log management
606   and analysis service. Each logging use case probably has one or more different tools that
607   consume log data, and these tools can retrieve data from the data lake instead of having to
608   interact with all of the log sources. This can be much more efficient in terms of time, network
609   bandwidth, and especially storage.
610   Another consideration when performing these tasks is the possibility of another entity, such as a
611   parent organization or an outsourcer, taking care of some or all of your centralized log storage
612   needs in the future. Log storage needs are highly variable over time, although they generally
613   continue to increase. Cloud-based log storage can provide rapid scalability that on-premises log
614   storage often cannot.
615   Organizations will also need to determine whether their original logs need to be preserved for a
616   certain period of time or if preserving log data copied to a centralized log server or storage is
617   acceptable. In many environments, original logs only need to be preserved if they may be needed
618   as evidence.

667      2. GRC-2, Conduct the Assessment and Document Findings
668   Supporting information for tasks: Root cause analysis should go beyond superficial
669   observations and determine the underlying factors. For example, suppose that one log source is
670   generating a much lower volume of log data than other similar log sources. Assessment indicates
671   that this is primarily due to logging configuration errors. Root cause analysis should not stop
672   there; it should determine why this log source is misconfigured (e.g., poor enforcement of
673   requirements, an approved exception to policy that needs to be reassessed, human error, possible
674   compromise of the log source, lack of log storage space).

697      PMG, Develop a Plan to Mitigate the Gaps
698   [Tasks]                                                                [Previous Play] [Next Play]
699   Summary: Develop a plan for addressing the root causes of the identified gaps in order to reach
700   the target state. The project plan takes the relative importance of each gap, the resources needed
701   to address each root cause, and the dependencies among items (e.g., expanding centralized log
702   storage capacity before significantly increasing the volume of logs being sent to that storage) into
703   account. The desired outcome is a project plan that, when executed, has addressed the root
704   causes and filled the identified gaps.
705   Tasks to perform include the following (with the first two not necessarily in order):
706      1. PMG-1, Draft the Plan
707      2. PMG-2, Revise Affected Policies
708      3. PMG-3, Address Feedback on Draft Plan and Policies

709             PMG-1, Draft the Plan
710   [Tasks]                                                                [Previous Play] [Next Play]
711   Summary: Draft the plan for addressing the root causes of identified gaps. The desired outcome
712   is a project plan draft that is ready for stakeholder review and feedback.
713   Tasks to perform include the following (not necessarily in order):
714      1. PMG-1.1: Identify any changes to logging-related inventories (e.g., log source types,
715         infrastructure, use cases, requirements, and work roles).
716      2. PMG-1.2: Develop cost estimates for the resources needed to address the gaps for
717         people, processes, and technology, including both one-time and ongoing costs. This may
718         include adding tools and technologies to automate aspects of log management, adjusting
719         technical configuration baselines and guidance, updating affected procedures and
720         processes, retraining staff with log management-related responsibilities, and establishing
721         a logging test environment.
722      3. PMG-1.3: Include provisions in the plan for creating a plan of action and milestones and
723         using compensating controls until gaps are remediated.
724      4. PMG-1.4: Incorporate the timing of other projects that may affect logging (e.g., the
725         pending replacement of a major enterprise application).
726      5. PMG-1.5: Include information on how often the plan itself will be reviewed and updated,
727         such as a scheduled annual review, audit results that indicate a significant problem, the
728         announcement of new legal or regulatory requirements, and feedback from logging
729         infrastructure and system administrators on logging requirements.
730      6. PMG-1.6: Ensure that all elements of the plan are harmonized.

733   Summary: Revise the organization’s policies to support the draft project plan. The desired
734   outcome is a set of draft revised policies that are ready for stakeholder review and feedback.
735   Tasks to perform include the following:
736      1. PMG-2.1: Identify which policies may be affected by the draft project plan. This may
737         include policies for software procurement, custom software development, and other
738         topics where cybersecurity logging capabilities are a vital part but not the focus.
739      2. PMG-2.2: Revise the affected policies so that they incorporate the organization’s
740         updated set of requirements, goals, and objectives.
741      3. PMG-2.3: Ensure that changes to all affected policies are harmonized.
742   Supporting information for tasks: It may be appropriate to specify future effective dates for
743   certain policy changes, depending on the timeframes for the corresponding items in the draft
744   project plan.

745             PMG-3, Address Feedback on Draft Plan and Policies
746   [Tasks]                                                                             [Previous Play]
747   Summary: Address stakeholder feedback on the draft plan and policies. The desired outcome is
748   a final project plan and policy set.
749   Tasks to perform include the following:
750      1. PMG-3.1: Identify all stakeholders who should be invited to provide feedback on the
751         draft plan and/or policies. It may be particularly important to get feedback from the
752         following:
753                o Legal counsel to ensure that the plan will adequately address all legal, regulatory,
754                  compliance, and other requirements and that the logging itself is performed in
755                  compliance with privacy laws
756                o System administrators and others who will be altering log generation, storage,
757                  transfer, access, and disposal practices to ensure that the changes are feasible and
758                  will not cause unexpected problems (e.g., a legacy system being configured to log
759                  every auditable event could generate an enormous number of log entries, impact
760                  the host’s performance, and cause log entries to be overwritten too quickly)
761                o Any parent or child organizations (subsidiaries, etc.)
762      2. PMG-3.2: Share the draft plan and policies with stakeholders, and encourage them to
763         provide feedback within a particular timeframe.
764      3. PMG-3.3: Review and adjudicate the feedback. Consider the point of view of each
765         stakeholder and the effect that addressing each comment may have on other parts of the
766         draft plan and policies.

767      4. PMG-3.4: Revise the draft plan and policies to address the feedback based on the
768         adjudications. This includes harmonizing changes throughout the documents.
769              o If stakeholder feedback results in significant changes to the draft plan or policies,
770                this play may need to be repeated so that affected stakeholders can provide
771                feedback on the changes.
772              o If stakeholder feedback is not needed, the revised plan and policies should be
773                finalized and communicated to all affected parties.
774   Supporting information for tasks: It may be appropriate to specify future effective dates for
775   certain policy changes, depending on the timeframes for the corresponding items in the draft
776   project plan.
