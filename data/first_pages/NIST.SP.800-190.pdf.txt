                                                                                             together on the same host OS. Segmenting containers by purpose, sensitivity, and threat posture

                                                                                             it more difficult for an attacker who compromises one of the groups to expand that compromise

                                                                                             In larger-scale environments with hundreds of hosts and thousands of containers, this grouping

                                                                                             include some notion of being able to group apps together, and container security tools can use

                                                                                             Adopt container-specific vulnerability management tools and processes for images to

                                                                                             Orchestrators may also be circumvented or unnecessary in other circumstances. For example, a

                                                                                             The risk of using stale images can be mitigated through two primary methods. First,
                                                                                             organizations can prune registries of unsafe, vulnerable images that should no longer be used.
                                                                                             This process can be automated based on time triggers and labels associated with images.
                                                                                             Second, operational practices should emphasize accessing images using immutable names that
                                                                                             specify discrete versions of images to be used. For example, rather than configuring a
                                                                                             deployment job to use the image called my-app, configure it to deploy specific versions of the
                                                                                             image, such as my-app:2.3 and my-app:2.4 to ensure that specific, known good instances of
                                                                                             images are deployed as part of each job.

                                                                                             Another option is using a “latest” tag for images and referencing this tag in deployment
                                                                                             automation. However, because this tag is only a label attached to the image and not a guarantee
                                                                                             of freshness, organizations should be cautious to not overly trust it. Regardless of whether an
                                                                                             organization chooses to use discrete names or to use a “latest” tag, it is critical that processes be
                                                                                             put in place to ensure that either the automation is using the most recent unique name or the
                                                                                             images tagged “latest” actually do represent the most up-to-date versions.

                                                                                             4.2.3      Insufficient authentication and authorization restrictions

                                                                                             Any write access to a registry should require authentication to ensure that only images from
