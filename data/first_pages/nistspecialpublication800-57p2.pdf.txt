                                          Overview

“Best Practices for Key Management Organization,” Part 2 of the Recommendation for Key
Management is intended primarily to address the needs of system owners and managers. It
provides context, principles, and implementation guidelines to assist in implementation and
management of institutional key management systems. It identifies applicable laws and
directives concerning security planning and management, and suggests approaches to satisfying
those laws and directives with a view to minimizing the impact of management overhead on
organizational resources and efficiency. This guideline acknowledges that planning and
documentation requirements associated with small scale or single system cryptographic
applications will not need to be as elaborate as those required for large and diverse government
agencies supported by a number of general support systems and major applications. However,
any organization that employs cryptography to provide security services is required to have
policy, practices and planning documentation at some level or number of levels.
Part 2 of the Recommendation for Key Management first identifies the structural and functional
elements common to effective key management systems; second, identifies security planning
requirements, general security policies and practices necessary to effective institutional key
management; and finally, offers suggestions regarding how key management policies and
procedures might be incorporated into security planning documentation that is already required
by various Federal laws and directives.
The “Key Management Infrastructure,” Section of Part 2 identifies the elements of a
representative key management infrastructure and suggests functions of and relationships among
the organizational elements. A more detailed representation of this general infrastructure is
contained in Appendix A, “Notional Key Management Infrastructure.” This "notional"
infrastructure builds on the Public key infrastructure (PKI), Kerberos, and other US Government
KMI components and mechanisms. It is noted that not all of the infrastructure elements will be
implemented in the same way in all Federal institutions. Organizations with relatively simple
and small-scale cryptographic requirements will be likely to bundle multiple functionality into
single organizational elements in order to foster efficiency and economy. However, most of the
functional elements identified in the notional infrastructure will need to be supported by some
element of any key management organization.
Each U.S. Government organization that manages cryptographic systems that are intended to
protect sensitive information should base the management of those systems on an organizational
policy statement. The “Key Management Policy and Practices” subsection identifies U.S.
Government laws, documents, and regulations relevant to the employment of cryptography and
provides a sample structure and content for organizational Key Management Policies (KMP) and
Key Management Practices Statements (KMPS). The KMPS specifies how key management
procedures, and techniques are used to enforce the KMP.
The plans, practices, and/or procedures documents into which KMPs and KMPSs are inserted
will vary from organization to organization. It is recommended that organizations create stand-

                                                5
alone practices documents where required, but the key management practices information may
be included in PKI Certification Practices Statements, the top-level information security policies,
and/or security procedures documents. The practices information is more prescriptive and
specific than the policy material, so the practices information will be subject to more frequent
change than the policy information.
Key management controls required for Federal systems are identified in Special Publication 800-
53, Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems, National Institute of
Standards and Technology, February 2005.
Key management information should be incorporated into security plans for general support
systems and major applications that employ cryptography. These security plans are already
required for general support systems and major applications by OMB Circular A-130. NIST
Special Publication 800-18 Revision 1, Guide for Developing Security Plans for Federal
Information Systems, provides suggested content for these system security plans. Key
management-related additions to these plans are suggested in the “Information Technology
System Security Plans” section of Part 2 of the Recommendation for Key Management, and
templates for general support systems and major applications security plans are provided with
key management enhancements as Appendix D.
Not all organizations and/or applications for which cryptography is desired are sufficiently large
or complex to require system security plans for General Support Systems or Major Applications.
The “Key Management Planning for Cryptographic Applications” section of Part 2 of the
Recommendation for Key Management identifies Key Management information that needs to be
documented for all Federal applications of cryptography.
Key generation, establishment, agreement, and transport mechanisms shall conform to FIPS 140-
2. Data processing components of IT systems that support other key management functions may
need to be evaluated under the Common Criteria. (See NIST Special Publication 800-23,
Guidelines to Federal Organizations on Security Assurance and Acquisition/Use of
Tested/Evaluated Products.) Where key management supports protection of sensitive Federal
government information, the overall IT system including the set of systems that perform key
management for a Federal government organization is subject to accreditation under SP 800-37,
Federal Guidelines for Security Certification and Accreditation of Information Systems.

                   RECOMMENDATION FOR KEY MANAGEMENT
            Part 2: Best Practices for Key Management Organization


1.       Introduction
“Best Practices for Key Management Organization,” Part 2 of the Recommendation for Key
Management is intended primarily to address the needs of system owners and managers. Parts 1
and 3 of the Recommendation for Key Management focus on technical key management
mechanisms. Part 1, General Guidance, contains basic key management guidance intended to
advise users, developers and system managers on the "best practices" associated with key
management; and Part 3, Application-Specific Key Management Guidance, is intended to address
the key management issues associated with currently available implementations. Technical
mechanisms alone are not sufficient to ensure the protection of sensitive information. These
mechanisms shall be used in combination with a set of procedures in order to implement a
clearly understood and articulated protection policy. Part 2 provides a framework and general
guidance to support establishing cryptographic key management policies, procedures, and the
infrastructure within an organization as a basis for satisfying key management aspects of
statutory and policy security planning requirements for Federal government organizations.
In acknowledgement of the heterogeneous nature of the cryptographic user community, the
guideline presents a significant degree of flexibility with respect to the complexity of
management infrastructures and the amount of documentation required to support key
management. Planning and documentation requirements associated with small scale or single
system cryptographic applications will obviously not be as elaborate as those required for large
and diverse government agencies supported by a number of general support systems and major
applications. However, any organization that employs cryptography to provide security services
is likely to require policy, practices and planning documentation at some level or number of
levels, and for a number of reasons.
     •    At the device or software application level, keying material needs to be provided,
          changed, and protected in a manner that enables cryptographic operation and preserves
          the integrity of cryptographic processes and their dependent services. FIPS 140-2
          provides some guidance on implementing key entry functionality. A variety of
          government publications (e.g., NIST Special Publication 800-56, Recommendation on
          Key Establishment Schemes [SP800-56]) specify key establishment formats and
          processes in specific applications. This guideline specifies key management planning
          requirements for cryptographic product development and for applying or implementing
          cryptographic products in systems.
     •    At the systems level, planning is often required to enable the distribution of keying
          material in a manner that enables interoperability among cryptographic products
          employed in the system. Procedures for the acquisition, management, and protection of
          keying material are also required at the system level in order to preserve the integrity of
          cryptographic processes and their dependent services. This guideline specifies
          cryptographic and key management planning that needs to be incorporated into systems
          security plans for major applications and general support systems.


                                                   10
    •   At the organization level (e.g., government departmental and agency levels), planning is
        required to enable the acquisition or generation of keying material. Planning is also
        required to enable the distribution of keying material to systems operations activities in a
        manner that enables protected communications within the organization’s systems, among
        the organization’s systems, and with systems of other organizations as necessary to
        support the organization’s mission requirements. Practices and procedures need to be
        specified at the organizational level to provide for the management and protection of
        keying material in order to preserve the integrity of cryptographic processes and their
        dependent services. This guideline specifies cryptographic and key management planning
        that needs to be documented and promulgated at the organizational level in order to
        implement and operate the key management infrastructure necessary to support the
        secure generation and/or acquisition, distribution, protection, and use of keying material
        that is consistent with product-level key specifications, system interoperability
        requirements, and the organization’s mission.
    •   In order for key management practices and procedures to be effectively employed,
        support for these practices and procedures at the highest levels of the organization is a
        practical necessity. The executive level of the organization needs to establish policies that
        identify executive level key management roles and responsibilities for the organization.
        The key management policies need to support the establishment of, or access to, the
        services of a key management infrastructure and the employment and enforcement of key
        management practices and procedures.

1.1 Organization
Part 2 of the Recommendation for Key Management is organized as follows:
    •   Section 2 describes a generic key management infrastructure. The infrastructure
        description provides an organizational context for functions and responsibilities described
        in subsequent sections. The described infrastructure is an adaptation of the Public Key
        Infrastructure (PKI) and other widely employed key management infrastructures.
        Appendix A is a companion to Section 2 and details a notional Key Management
        Infrastructure (KMI) and establishes roles and relationships for the management of
        asymmetric and/or symmetric keying material in support of a broad range of
        cryptographic services. It is not anticipated that an organization will necessarily adopt all
        of the elements of the notional KMI as defined and described in this guideline. Unique
        organizations may significantly tailor the infrastructure elements, relationships, and
        terminology. Nevertheless, the basic functions and reporting responsibilities identified in
        Section 2 should be represented in organizational KMIs.
    •   Section 3 provides guidance for the development of organizational key management
        policy statements and key management practices statements. Key management policies
        and practices documentation may take the form of separate planning and implementation
        documents. Alternatively, the documentation may be included in an organization's
        existing information security policies and procedures.1

                                                   11
      •    Section 4 identifies key management information that should be incorporated into
           security plans for general support systems and major applications that employ
           cryptography.2
      •    Not all organizations and/or applications for which cryptography is desired are
           sufficiently large or complex to require system security plans for General Support
           Systems or Major Applications. Section 5 identifies Key Management information that
           needs to be documented for all Federal applications of cryptography.

                         information in the certificate could specify how the key is used and its
                         cryptoperiod.

                         term “secret” in this context does not imply a classification level, but
                         rather implies the need to protect the key from disclosure.

                         members in an attempt to ensure that no one individual has enough
                         information or access privilege to perpetrate damaging fraud.
Service agents           Entities that support organizations’ KMIs as single points of access for

2    Key Management Infrastructure
The complexity of and allocation of roles within a key management infrastructure will depend on
1) the cryptographic algorithms employed, 2) the operational and communications relationships
among the organizational elements being served, 3) the purposes for which cryptography is
employed, and 4) the number and complexity of cryptographic relationships required by an
organization. This section identifies common key management infrastructure elements and
suggests functions of and relationships among the organizational elements. In Appendix A, these
elements and functions are organized into a "notional" key management infrastructure (KMI)
that builds on the Public key infrastructure (PKI), Kerberos, and US Government KMI
components and mechanisms. The notional KMI is employed to illustrate distribution and
management of symmetric and asymmetric keys in a hierarchical organization.
The structure, complexity, and scale of actual KMIs may vary considerably according to the
needs of individual organizations. However, the elements and functions identified here need to
be present in most organizations that require cryptographic protection. This subsection describes
the common KMI organizational elements, functions, and requirements.
A KMI is designed to incorporate a set of functional elements, or nodes, that collectively provide
unified and seamless protection policy enforcement and key management services. Four distinct
functional nodes are identified for the generation, distribution, and management of cryptographic
keys: a central oversight authority, key processing facility(ies), service agents, and client nodes.
It should be noted that organizations may choose to combine the functionality of more than one
node into a single component. Figure 1 illustrates functional KMI relationships.

2.1 Central Oversight Authority
The KMI’s central oversight authority is the entity that provides overall KMI data
synchronization and system security oversight for an organization or set of organizations. The
central oversight authority 1) coordinates protection policy and practices (procedures)
documentation, 2) may function as a holder of data provided by service agents, and 3) serves as
the source for common and system level information required by service agents (e.g., keying
material and registration information, directory data, system policy specifications, and system-
wide key compromise and certificate revocation information). As required by survivability or
continuity of operations policies, central oversight facilities may be replicated at an appropriate
remote site to function as a system back up.

2.2 Key Processing Facility(ies)
Key processing services typically include one or more of the following:
    •   Acquisition or generation of public key certificates (where applicable),
    •   Initial generation and distribution of keying material,
    •   Maintenance of a database that maps user entities to an organization’s certificate/key
        structure,
    •   Maintenance and distribution of compromise key lists (CKLs) and/or certificate
        revocation lists (CRLs), and
    •   Generation of audit requests and the processing of audit responses as necessary for the
        prevention of undetected compromises.
An organization may use more than one key processing facility to provide these services (e.g.,
for purposes of inter-organizational interoperation). Key processing facilities can be added to
meet new requirements or deleted when no longer needed and may support both public key and
symmetric key establishment techniques.
Where public key cryptography is employed, the organization operating the key processing
facility will generally perform most PKI registration authority, repository, and archive functions.
The organization also performs at least some PKI certification authority functions. Actual X.509
public key certificates may be obtained from a government source (certification authorities
generating identification, attribute, or encryption certificates) or a commercial external
certification authority (usually a commercial infrastructure/CA that supplies/sells X.509
certificates). Commercial external certification authority certificates should be cross-certified by
a government root CA.
A key processing facility may be distributed such that intermediary redistribution facilities
maintain stores of keying material that exist in physical form (e.g., magnetic media, smart cards)
and may also serve as a source for non-cryptographic products and services (e.g., software
downloads for KMI-reliant users, usage documents, or policy authority).
All keys and non-cryptographic products that are electronically distributed to end users shall be
encrypted for the end user or for intermediary redistribution services before transmission. Some
key processing facilities may generate and produce human-readable key information and other
key-related information that require physical distribution. Keys that are manually distributed

                                                 23
shall either be encrypted or receive physical protection and be subject to controlled distribution
(e.g., registered mail) between the key processing facility and the user. Part 1, Section 2.3.1
provides general guidance for key distribution. Newly deployed key processing facilities should
be designed to support legacy and existing system requirements and should be designed to
support future network services as they become available.

2.3 Service Agents
Service agents support organizations’ KMIs as single points of access for other KMI nodes. All
transactions initiated by client nodes are either processed by a service agent or forwarded to
other nodes for processing. Service agents direct service requests from client nodes to key
processing facilities, and when services are required from multiple processing facilities,
coordinate services among the processing facilities to which they are connected. Service agents
are employed by users to order keying material and services, retrieve keying material and
services, and manage cryptographic material and public key certificates. A service agent may
provide cryptographic material and/or certificates by utilizing specific key processing facilities
for key and/or certificate generation. A service agent that supports a major organizational unit or
geographic region may either access a central or inter-organizational key processing facility or
employ local, dedicated processing facilities as required to support survivability, performance, or
availability, requirements (e.g., a commercial external Certificate Authority).
Service agents may provide registration, directory, and support for data recovery services (i.e.
key recovery), as well as provide access to relevant documentation, such as policy statements
and infrastructure devices. Service agents may also process requests for keying material (e.g.,
user identification credentials), and assign and manage KMI user roles and privileges. A service
agent may also provide interactive help desk services as required.

2.4 Client Nodes
Client nodes are interfaces for managers, devices, and applications to access KMI functions,
including the requesting of certificates and other keying material. They may include
cryptographic modules, software, and procedures necessary to provide user access to the KMI.
Client nodes interact with service agents to obtain cryptographic key services. Client nodes
provide interfaces to end user entities (e.g., encryption devices) for the distribution of keying
material, for the generation of requests for keying material, for the receipt and forwarding (as
appropriate) of compromised key lists (CKLs) and/or certificate revocation lists (CRLs), for the
receipt of audit requests, and for the delivery of audit responses. Client nodes typically initiate
requests for keying material in order to synchronize new or existing user entities with the current
key structure, and receive encrypted keying material for distribution to end-user cryptographic
devices (in which the content - the unencrypted keying material – is not usually accessible to
human users or user-node interface processes). A client node can be a FIPS 140-2 compliant
workstation executing KMI security software or a FIPS 140-2 compliant special purpose device.
Actual interactions between a client node and a service agent depend on whether the client node
is a device, a manager, or a functional security application. Examples of different types of client
nodes and their relationships to service agents are provided in Appendix A.

3       Key Management Policy and Practices
A key management policy is a set of rules that are established to describe the goals,
responsibilities, and overall requirements for the management of cryptographic keying material
used to protect private or critical facilities, processes, or information. Key Management Policies
(KMP) are implemented through a combination of security mechanisms and procedures. An
organization uses security mechanisms (e.g., safes, alarms, random number generators,
encryption algorithms, signature and authentication algorithms) as tools to implement a policy.
However, key management mechanisms will produce the desired results only if they are properly
configured and maintained. Key Management Practices Statements (KMPS) document the
procedures that system administrators and users follow when establishing and maintaining key
management mechanisms and when using cryptographic systems. The procedures documented
in the KMPS describe are how the security requirements described in the KMP are met and are
directly linked to the key management mechanisms employed by an organization. [PKI 01]
U. S. Government agencies that use cryptography are responsible for defining the KMP that
governs the lifecycle for the cryptographic keys as specified in Part 1, Section 2.3 of the
Recommendation for Key Management. A KMPS is then developed, based on the KMP and the
actual applications supported.
Policy and practices documentation requirements associated with small scale or single system
cryptographic applications will obviously not be as elaborate as those required for large and
diverse government agencies that are supported by a number of general support systems and
major applications. However, any organization that employs cryptography to provide security
services is likely to require some level of policy, practices and planning documentation.

3.1 Key Management Policy (KMP)
Each U.S. Government organization that manages cryptographic systems that are intended to
protect sensitive information should base the management of those systems on an organizational
policy statement. The KMP3 is a high-level document that describes authorization and protection
objectives and constraints that apply to the generation, distribution, accounting, storage, use, and
destruction of cryptographic keying material.
3.1.2     Policy Content
The Key Management Policy (KMP) is a high-level statement of organizational key management
policies that includes authorization and protection objectives, and constraints that apply to the
generation, distribution, accounting, storage, use, and destruction of cryptographic keying
material. The policy document or documents that comprise the KMP will include high-level key
management structure and responsibilities, governing standards and guidelines, organizational
dependencies and other relationships, and security objectives. [Note that in a purely PKI
environment, the KMP is usually a stand-alone document known as a Certificate Policy (CP).]

3
 In a purely PKI environment, the KMP may be a Certificate Policy (CP) in conformance to RFC 3647, the
Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate Policy and Certification Practices
Framework [RFC3647].


                                                    25
The scope of a KMP may be limited to the operation of a single PKI Certificate Authority (CA)
and its supporting components4, or to a symmetric point-to-point or single key center
environment.5 Alternatively, the scope of a KMP may be the operations of a hierarchical PKI,
bridged PKI, or multiple center symmetric key environment.
The KMP is used for a number of different purposes. The KMP is used to guide the
development of KMPSs for each PKI CA or symmetric key management group that operates
under its provisions. CAs from other organizations’ PKIs may review the KMP before cross-
certification, and managers of symmetric key KMIs may review the KMP before joining new or
existing multiple center groups. Auditors and accreditors will use the KMP as the basis for their
reviews of PKI CA and/or symmetric key KMI operations. Application owners that are
considering a PKI certificate source should review a KMP/CP to determine whether its
certificates are appropriate for their applications.
3.1.2.1 General Policy Content Requirements
Although detailed formats are specified for some environments (e.g., See Appendix B for a PKI
CP format), the policy documents into which key management information is inserted may vary
from organization to organization. In general, the information should appear in a top-level
organizational information systems policies and practices document. The policy need not always
be elaborate. A degree of flexibility may be desirable with respect to actual organizational
assignments and operations procedures in order to accommodate organizational and information
infrastructure changes over time. However, the KMP needs to establish a policy foundation for
the full set of key management functions.
3.1.2.1.1 Security Objectives
A KMP should state the security objectives that are applicable to and expected to be supported
by the KMI. The security objectives should include the identification of:
       (a) The nature of the information to be protected (e.g., financial transactions, confidential
           information, critical process data);
       (b) The classes of threats against which protection is required (e.g., the unauthorized
           modification of data, replay of communications, fraudulent repudiation of transactions,
           disclosure of information to unauthorized parties);
       (c) The Federal Information Processing Standard 199 (FIPS 199) impact level which is
           determined by the consequences of a compromise of the protected information and/or
           processes (including sensitivity and perishability of the information);
       (d) The cryptographic protection mechanisms to be employed (e.g., message authentication,
           digital signature, encryption);
       (e) Protection requirements for cryptographic processes and keying material (e.g., tamper-
           resistant processes, confidentiality of keying material); and


4
    This is generally the case when a single CA serves an enterprise or a CA participates in a mesh. [PKI 01]
5
    Note that multiple CAs and/or single symmetric point-to-point or center groups may operate under a single KMP.


                                                           26
       (f) Applicable statutes, and executive directives and guidance to which the KMI and its
           supporting documentation shall conform.
The statement of security objectives will provide a basis and justification for other provisions of
the KMP.
3.1.2.1.2 Organizational Responsibilities
The KMP should identify key KMI management responsibilities and roles, including
organizational contact information. The following classes of organizational responsibilities
should be identified:
       (a) Identification of the Keying Material Manager – Since the security of all material that is
           cryptographically protected depends on the security of the keying material employed, the
           ultimate responsibility for key management should reside at the executive level. The
           keying material manager should report directly to the organization’s Chief Information
           Officer (CIO).6 The keying material manager is a key employee who should have been
           determined to have the capabilities and trustworthiness that are commensurate with the
           responsibility for maintaining the authority and integrity of all formal, electronic
           transactions and the confidentiality of all information that is sufficiently sensitive to
           warrant cryptographic protection. Where public key cryptography is employed, either the
           keying material manager or his/her immediate superior should be designated as the
           organization’s certification authority.
       (b) Identification of Infrastructure Entities and Roles - The key management policy
           document should identify organizational responsibilities for key KMI roles. The
           following roles (where applicable to the type and complexity of the infrastructure being
           established7) should be assigned:
              (1) Central Oversight Authority (may be the Keying Material Manager)
              (2) Certification Authorities (CAs)
              (3) Registration Authorities (RAs)
              (4) Overseers of operations (e.g., Key Processing Facility(ies), Service Agents)
       (c) Basis for and Identification of Essential Key Management Roles – The KMP should also
           identify responsible organization(s), organization (not individual) contact information,
           and any relevant statutory or administrative requirements for the following functions:
              (1) Key generation or acquisition;
              (2) Agreements with partner organizations regarding the cross certification of keying
                  material and/or key establishment, as appropriate;
              (3) Key establishment and revocation tree design and management,

6
 When an organization does not have a CIO position, FISMA requires the associated responsibilities to be handled
by a comparable agency official.
7
    E.g., PKI, KMI for multiple center symmetric key distribution.


                                                          27
          (4) Establishment of cryptoperiods;
          (5) Distribution of and accounting for keying material;
          (6) Protection of secret and private keys and related materials;
          (7) Emergency and routine revocation of keying material;
          (8) Auditing of keying material and related records;
          (9) Destruction of revoked or expired keys;
          (10) Key recovery;
          (11) Compromise recovery;
          (12) Contingency planning,
          (13) Disciplinary consequences for the willful or negligent mishandling of keying
               material; and
          (14) Generation, approval, and maintenance of key management practices statements.
3.1.2.1.3 Sample KMP Format
The sample format provided in this subsection is designed to be compatible with the Standard
Format for PKI Certificate Policies (Appendix B). The sample format differs somewhat from
that for PKI Certificate Policies (CPs) because some key management characteristics of and
requirements for KMIs that accommodate symmetric keys differ from those for purely PKI-
based KMIs. The sample KMP format includes the general information called for in Subsections
3.1.2.1.1 and 3.1.2.1.2 above, plus some additional material that may be required in some
administrative environments. As stated above, variations among organizational structures and
needs will necessarily result in variations in the form and content of policy documentation. The
sample KMP format is provided as a general guide rather than as a mandatory template.
   (a) Introduction -
       The Introduction identifies and introduces the provisions of the policy document and
       indicates the security objectives and the types of entities and applications for which the
       KMP is targeted. This section has the following subsections: 1) Overview, 2)
       Identification, 3) Community and Applicability, and 4) Contact Details.
       Overview - This subsection introduces the KMP.
       Objectives – This subsection states the security objectives applicable to and expected to
       be supported by the KMI. The Objectives subsection should include the elements
       information called for in Section 3.1.2.1.1 above (Security Objectives). [Note that in the
       case of a CP for a purely PKI environment, the Overview is followed by an Identification
       subsection that provides any applicable names or other identifiers, including ASN.1
       object identifiers, for the set of policy provisions.]
       Community and Applicability - This subsection identifies the types of entities that
       distribute keys or certificates. In the general case of the KMI, this will include the
       responsible entities identified in the “Identification of Infrastructure Entities and Roles”

                                                28
         element of Section 3.1.2.1.2 above (Organizational Responsibilities). [Note that in the
         case of a KMI that includes a PKI CA, this subsection should identify the types of
         entities that issue certificates or that are certified as subject CAs, the types of entities that
         perform RA functions, and the types of entities that are certified as subject end entities or
         subscribers.] This subsection may also contains:
                    •    A list of applications for which the issued certificates and/or identified key
                         types are suitable. (Examples of application in this case are: electronic mail,
                         retail transactions, contracts, travel order, etc.)
                    •    A list of applications to which the use of the issued certificates and/or
                         identified key types is restricted. (This list implicitly prohibits all other uses
                         for the certificates.)
                    •    A list of applications for which the use of the issued certificates and/or
                         identified key types is prohibited.
         Contact Details - This subsection includes the organization, telephone number, and
         mailing and/or network address of the Keying Material Manager. This is the authority
         responsible for the registration, maintenance, and interpretation of the KMP (see Section
         3.1.2.1.1).
    (b) General Provisions –
         The General Provisions section of the KMP identifies any applicable policies regarding a
         range of legal and general practices topics. This section may contain subsections
         covering 1) obligations, 2) liability, 3) financial responsibility, 4) interpretation and
         enforcement, 5) fees, 6) publication and repositories, 7) compliance audit, 8)
         confidentiality, and 9) intellectual property rights. Each subcomponent may need to
         separately state the provisions applying to each KMI entity type (e.g., central oversight
         authority, key processing facility, service agent, client node, PKI CA, PKI repository,
         PKI RA, PKI subscriber, and/or PKI relying party8).
         Obligations - This subsection contains, for each entity type, any applicable policies
         regarding the entity's obligations to other entities. Such provisions may include: 1)

           certificate access fee, revocation or status information access fee, reimbursement for
           information desk services, fees for other services such as policy information, refund
           policy).
           Publication and Repositories - This subsection contains any applicable policies regarding
           1) a key and/or certificate source’s obligations to publish information regarding its

    May be by reference to audit guidelines documents.


                                                         30
(c) Identification and Authentication –
   The Identification and Authentication section describes circumstances and identifies any
   applicable regulatory authority and guidelines regarding the authentication of a certificate
   applicant or key variable requestor prior to the issuing of key(s) or certificate(s) by a
   keying material source. This section also includes policies regarding the authentication
   of parties requesting re-key or revocation. Where applicable, this section also addresses
   PKI naming practices, including name ownership recognition and name dispute
   resolution. This section of the KMP has the following subsections:
               •   Initial Registration,
               •   Routine Re-key,
               •   Re-key After Revocation, and
               •   Revocation Request.
(d) Operational Requirements –
   The Operational Requirements section specifies policies regarding the imposition of
   requirements on KMI entities with respect to various operational activities. This section
   may address the following topics:
               •   Request for shared key variable relationship/Certificate application,
               •   Initial issuance of key encrypting keys and/or Certificate issuance,
               •   Acceptance of key variables and Certificates,
               •   Key and/or Certificate suspension and revocation,
               •   Security audit requirements,
               •   Records archiving,
               •   Key changeover (including re-keying, updating, re-derivation),
               •   Compromise and disaster recovery, and
               •   Key Center and/or CA Termination.
   Within each topic, separate consideration may need to be given to each KMI entity class.

(e) Minimum Baseline Security Controls –
   This section states policies regarding management, operational, and technical security
   controls (i.e., physical, procedural, and personnel controls) used by KMI components to
   securely perform 1) key generation, 2) subject authentication, 3) key
   establishment/transfer and/or certificate issuance, 4) key and/or certificate revocation, 5)
   audit, and 6) archiving.
   Based on the FIPS 199 impact level, the appropriate minimum baseline of security
   controls contained in NIST Special Publication 800-53, Recommended Security Controls

                                            31
        for Federal Information Systems, shall be implemented and described in this section of
        the KMP.
   (f) Cryptographic Key, Message Interchange, and/or Certificate Formats –
        This section is used to state policies specifying conformance to specific standards and/or
        guidelines regarding 1) key management architectures and/or protocols, 2) key
        management message formats, 3) certificate formats and/or 4) CRL/CKL formats.
   (g) Specification and Administration –
        The “Specification Administration” section of the policy document specifies:
           •   What organization(s) has/have change control responsibility for the KMP,
           •   Publication and notification procedures for new versions, and
           •   KMPS approval procedures.
3.1.3    Policy Enforcement
In order to be effective, key management policies shall be enforced, and policy implementation
should be evaluated on a regular basis. Appendix C provides an evaluator’s checklist for the
documentation and practices that implement key management policies.
Of course, evaluation requirements will vary with the size and complexity of an organization’s
protected communications infrastructure. Each organization will need to determine its
requirements based on the sensitivity of information being exchanged, the communications
volume associated with sensitive or critical information and processes, personnel resources, the
size and complexity of the organization or organizations supported, the variety and numbers of
cryptographic devices and applications, the types of cryptographic devices and applications, and
the scale and complexity of protected communications facilities.

3.2 Key Management Practices Statement (KMPS)
The Key Management Practices Statement (KMPS) establishes a trust root for the KMI and
specifies how key management procedures, and techniques are used to enforce the KMP. For
example, a KMP might state that secret and private keys shall be protected from unauthorized
disclosure. The corresponding KMPS might then state that secret and private keys shall be either
encrypted or physically protected, and that it is the responsibility of the network systems
administrator to ensure that the keys are properly safeguarded. (The KMPS would also identify
and provide contact information for the network systems administrator.) Note that the practices
information contained in a KMPS is more prescriptive and specific than policy material
contained in a KMP, so it will be subject to more frequent change. Several KMPSs may
implement a KMP for a single organization, one for each organizational key management
domain (e.g., one for each of several CAs).
3.2.1    Alternative KMPS Formats
As in the case of the policy documentation, the plans, practices, and/or procedures documents
into which KMPSs are inserted will vary from organization to organization. In general, the
nature and complexity of the KMPS will vary with an organization’s existing documentation
requirements and the size and complexity of an organization’s protected communications

                                                32
infrastructure. Each organization will need to determine its requirements based on the sensitivity
of information being exchanged, the communications volume associated with sensitive or critical
information and processes, personnel resources, the size and complexity of the organization or
organizations supported, the variety and numbers of cryptographic devices and applications,
types of cryptographic devices and applications, and the scale and complexity of protected
communications facilities.
Each KMPS applies to a single KMI or a single domain of that KMI. The KMPS may be
considered the overall operations manual for the KMI. Specific portions of the KMPS may be
extracted to form a KMI Operations Guide, a CA Operations Guide, a Service Agent Manual, a
Key Distribution Center Manual, a Key Translation Center Manual, an RA Manual, a PKI Users
Guide, or other role-specific documentation. Auditors and accreditors may use the KMPS to
supplement the KMP during reviews of KMI operations.
3.2.1.1      Stand-Alone KMPS
While it is recommended that organizations create stand-alone practices documents, the key
management practices information may be included in pre-existing top-level organizational
information security policies and/or security procedures documents. A stand-alone KMPS may
follow the general RFC 3647 format described for the KMP in Section 3.1.2.1.3 above (Sample
KMP Format), or it may follow a proprietary format. If the general outline of the sample KMP
format is followed, the authors of the KMP will need to keep in mind the basic differences in
character between a KMP and a KMPS. While the KMP is a high-level document that describes
a security policy for issuing certificates and maintaining certificate status information, the KMPS
is a highly detailed document that describes how a KMI implements a specific KMP. The
KMPS identifies the KMP that it implements and specifies the mechanisms and procedures that
are used to support the security policy. Where the KMP specifies organizational roles and states
requirements for mechanisms and procedures, the KMPS identifies the specific individuals
assigned to each role and describes the mechanisms and procedures in detail. [Note that
descriptive material can sometimes be included by reference to other procedures, guidelines,
and/or standards documents.] The KMPS should include sufficient operational detail to
demonstrate that the KMP can be satisfied by this combination of mechanisms and procedures.
3.2.1.2 Certification Practices Statement
A Certification Practices Statement (CPS) is a PKI-specific document. In a purely PKI
environment, the RFC 3647-specified CPS may serve as the KMPS for a CA. In such cases, the
CPS will follow the RFC 3647 format summarized in Appendix B.
3.2.1.3      Information Technology System Security Plans
All government organizations are required by OMB Circular A-130 to develop security plans for
their major applications and general support systems. The use of the format offered in
“Information Technology Systems Security Plans” (Section 4 below) will assist in the
development of a security plan that incorporates key management information.10 Appendix D
suggests key management inserts for a Security Plan Template.


10
     Note also that SP-800-37 also requires Information Technology Security Plans as part of C&A documentation.


                                                         33
3.2.2      Common KMPS Content
Regardless of the KMPS format employed, the document needs to include a minimum set of
information. This subsection identifies the kinds of information that should be included in all
KMPSs.
3.2.2.1    Association of KMPS with the KMP
The KMPS should identify the KMI to which it applies and the KMP that its content
implements.
3.2.2.2 Identification of Responsible Entities and Contact Information
The KMPS should identify the organizational entities that perform the various functions
identified in the Organizational Responsibilities section (Section 3.1.2.1.2). The individuals
assigned to perform each key management role should be identified. Contact information
should include the name, organization, business address, telephone number, and electronic mail
address should be included.
3.2.2.3    Key Generation or Acquisition
The KMPS should prescribe key generation and acquisition functions. The functions described
will normally include those identified for the service agent, or its equivalent, as described in the
KMI discussion (Section 2.1.2). Key generation and/or acquisition should be accomplished in
accordance with the guidelines contained in the key establishment section of this guideline (Part
1, Section 4.2.5). The scope of key acquisition includes out of band procedures for acquiring
keying material (e.g., initial key encrypting keys for communication with key centers and service
agents). The KMPS generally identifies:
   •      Any management organization, roles, and responsibilities associated with key generation
          and/or acquisition,
   •      Any standards and guidelines governing key generation/acquisition facilities and
          processes, and
   •      Any documents required for authorization, implementation, and accounting functions.
For organizations that employ public key cryptography, the KMPS should identify the certificate
issuance elements of the CA (and its hardware, software, and human/organizational components
as appropriate), as well as registration entities. Operating procedures and quality control
procedures for key generation and/or acceptance of acquired keying material may appear either
in the KMPS or in separate documents referenced by the KMPS. Documentation of the key
generation process should also be included in order to establish a chain of evidence to support
establishment of a trust root.
3.2.2.4    Key Agreement
Key agreement, as defined in Part 1, Section 2.2.2.5, involves participation by more than one
entity in the creation of shared keying material. Public key techniques are normally employed to
accomplish key agreement. KMPSs may prescribe the organizational authority and procedures
for authorizing and implementing key agreement between or among partner organizations.



                                                 34
Within the context of a KMI, key agreement will commonly be implemented by client nodes,
using agreement keys received from key processing facilities.
3.2.2.5    Cross Certification Agreements
Organizations having distinct public key certification hierarchies or meshes, but requiring secure
communications between their domains may agree to cross certify the certificates issued by each
organization. KMPSs may prescribe the organizational authority and procedures for authorizing
and implementing the cross certification of keying material between or among partner
organizations. Within the context of the KMI, any authorization for cross certification should
come from the central oversight authority or its organizational equivalent. Cross certification will
normally be implemented in the key processing facility or its equivalent.
3.2.2.6    Key Distribution and Revocation Structures
The KMPS should prescribe the organizational authority and procedures for the design and
management of the organizational structure and information flow necessary to meet the
organization’s key distribution, agreement, and revocation requirements. The KMPS should
include or reference guidelines for maintaining the continuity of operations and maintaining both
the assurance and integrity of the revocation process. The KMPS should include guidelines for
the emergency replacement of keys, compromise lists, and revocation lists as well as timely and
the reliable routine dissemination of keying material. Both the initial establishment and
subsequent changes to key distribution and revocation trees should be authorized by the central
oversight authority and implemented by the key processing facility (or their equivalents) as
described in the KMI discussion (Section 2.1.2). Additionally, prescription of audit and control
of the distribution process is necessary in order to maintain confidence in the integrity of the trust
root.
3.2.2.7    Establishment of Cryptoperiods
The KMPS should prescribe cryptoperiods for the keying material employed by an organization.
Cryptoperiods should be approved by the central oversight authority, or its organizational
equivalent, and should be implemented by the key processing facility and client nodes (or their
equivalents), as described in the KMI discussion (Section 2.1.2). Guidelines for establishing
cryptoperiods are provided in Section 8.2 of Part 1.
3.2.2.8    Tracking of and Accounting for Keying Material
The KMPS should prescribe the organizational authority and procedures for any distribution of,
local creation of, and accounting for keying material required at each phase of the key
management lifecycle (Part 1, Section 7). General accountability guidelines are provided in Part
1, Section 8.5. Responsibilities and procedures should be identified for central oversight
authority, key processing facility, service agent, and client node entities of the KMI (or their
equivalents). Any relevant accounting forms and database structures should be specified as
required for:
   •      Keying material requests,
   •      Keying production authorization,
   •      The authorization of the distribution of specific material to specific organizational
          destinations for use in specific devices,

                                                   35
   •      Physical or electronic distribution of keys or related cryptographic materials,
   •      Receipts for keys or related cryptographic material,
   •      Reporting of the receipt of keys not accompanied by authorized transmittal information,
          and
   •      The destruction of keys or related cryptographic materials.
3.2.2.9    Protection of Keying Material
The KMPS should prescribe the responsibilities, facilities, and procedures for the protection of
secret and private keys and related cryptographic materials. Requirements should be specified
for central oversight authority, key processing facility, service agent, and client node entities of
the KMI (or their equivalents). General guidelines for the protection of keying material at
different lifecycle stages (provided in Part 1, Section 7) should be included or referenced in the
KMPS.
Note that where keys and key exchange security mechanisms are integral to a FIPS 140-2
compliant cryptographic device or application, reference to FIPS 140-2 and any local physical
security procedures may provide an adequate specification of protection practices.
3.2.2.10 Emergency and Routine Revocation of Keying Material
The KMPS should prescribe the roles, responsibilities, and procedures for the emergency and
routine revocation of keying material. The KMPS should prescribe the roles, procedures, and
protocols employed at the key processing facility for the generation of CRLs and CKLs for
prematurely lost or destroyed certificates and keys or for compromised certificates and keys.
The KMPS should also specify the roles, procedures, and protocols employed by service agent
and client node entities, or their organizational equivalents, for the timely and secure reporting of
potential compromises. The KMPS should identify the key types for which revocation actions
are necessary (e.g., not necessary for ephemeral keys). General guidelines for key revocation
provided in Part 1, Section 7.3.5 should be included or referenced in the KMPS.
3.2.2.11 Auditing

The KMPS should prescribe the roles, responsibilities, facilities, and procedures for the routine
auditing of keying material and related records. The KMPS should also describe audit reporting
requirements and procedures. Auditing is normally a function of the central oversight authority
or its organizational equivalent. Note that audit requirements will depend on the sensitivity of the
information (including what is to be audited, the frequency of audits, and the frequency of
reviews of different elements of the audit log). Note also that audits will generally be conducted
in facilities containing servers, rather than facilities containing only client nodes. Conditions and
procedures should also be included for unscheduled audits that are triggered by the observed
and/or suspected unauthorized production, loss, or compromise of keys or related cryptographic
material. General audit guidelines are provided in Part 1, Section 8.6.
Note that where keys and key establishment security mechanisms are integral to a FIPS 140-2
compliant cryptographic device or application, and the keys are relatively short-term and are



                                                   36
employed for protection within a client node or between communicating pairs, it may not be
practical or necessary to document or audit those keys.
3.2.2.12 Keying Material Destruction
The KMPS should prescribe the roles, responsibilities, facilities, and procedures for any routine
destruction of revoked or expired keys required at all KMI elements. Zeroization conditions and
procedures may also be included. Part 1, Sections 7.3.4 and 7.4 include general guidelines that
should be included or referenced in the KMPS. Note that the destruction of keying material is
not accomplished until all copies are destroyed (including backups and archives).
3.2.2.13 Key Backup and Recovery
OMB Guidance to Federal Agencies on Data Availability and Encryption, 26 November 2001,
states that agencies must address information availability and assurance requirements through
appropriate data recovery mechanisms such as cryptographic key recovery. The KMPS should
prescribe, for each KMI element, any roles, responsibilities, facilities, and procedures necessary
for all organizational elements to backup and recover critical data, with necessary integrity
mechanisms intact, in the event of the loss of the operational copy of cryptographic keys under
which the data is protected. Key backup and recovery is normally the responsibility of the central
oversight authority, or its organizational equivalent, although mechanisms to support recovery
are likely to be included in client node, service agent, and especially key processing facilities (or
their organizational equivalents). Part 1, Sections 7.2.2.2 and 8.7.2 contain general key recovery
guidelines that should be included in or referenced by the KMPS.
3.2.2.14 Compromise Recovery
The KMPS should prescribe, for all KMI elements, any roles, responsibilities, facilities, and
procedures required for recovery from compromise of cryptographic keying material at any
phase in its lifecycle. Compromise recovery includes 1) the timely and secure notification of
users of compromised keys that the compromise has occurred and 2) the timely and secure
replacement of the compromised keys. Emergency key revocation and the generation and
processing of CRLs and/or CKLs are elements of compromise recovery, but compromise
recovery also includes:
   •   The recognition and reporting of the compromise,
   •   The identification and/or distribution of replacement keying material,
   •   Recording the compromise and compromise recovery actions (may use existing audit
       mechanisms and procedures), and
   •   The destruction and/or de-registration of compromised keying material, as appropriate.
Part 1, Sections 7.3 and 8.4 of this guideline contain general guidelines regarding compromise
recovery that should be included in or referenced by the KMPS.
3.2.2.15 Policy Violation Consequences
The KMPS should prescribe any roles, responsibilities, and procedures required for establishing
and carrying out disciplinary consequences for the willful or negligent mishandling of keying
material. The consequences should be commensurate with the potential harm that the policy


                                                 37
violation can result in for the organization, its mission, and/or other affected organizations.
While the procedures apply to all KMI elements, the responsibility for establishing and enforcing
the procedures rests at the central oversight authority or its organizational equivalent.
Consequences prescribed in a KMPS shall be enforced if they are to be effective. Note also that
it is necessary to correlate compromise records and the associated audit logs to disciplinary
actions that are taken as a result of violations of policies or procedures.
3.2.2.16 Documentation
The KMPS should prescribe any roles, responsibilities, and procedures required for the
generation, approval, and maintenance of the KMPS. The generation, approval, and maintenance
of KMPSs are normally the responsibilities of the central oversight authority or its organizational
equivalent. The generation and maintenance of audit records are also normally responsibilities of
the central oversight authority or its organizational equivalent. The generation and maintenance
of registration, de-registration, revocation and compromise lists, and accounting documentation
should be accomplished at the key processing facility(ies), service agent(s), and client nodes (or
their organizational equivalents), as required by the KMPS.

4      Information Technology Systems Security Plans
Information Technology Systems Security Plans are required for general support systems and
major applications by OMB Circular A-130. Key management information should be
incorporated into the security plans for the Federal government’s general support systems and
major applications that employ cryptography.
NIST Special Publication 800-18 Revision 1 [SP800-18], Guide for Developing Security Plans
for Federal Information Systems [SP800-18], suggests content for these system security plans.
Organizations that have already developed security plans in accordance with [SP 800-18] can
simply modify their plans to include key management. Key management-related additions to
these plans are suggested below, and a template for an information system security plan is
provided with key management enhancements in Appendix D.

4.1 General Support System
As defined in [SP800-18], general support systems are interconnected information resources that
share a common direct management control and common functionality. General support systems
normally include hardware, software, information, data applications, communications facilities,
and people, and provide support for a variety of users and/or applications. Examples of general
support systems include LANs, network backbones, data processing centers, tactical radio
networks, and shared information processing service organizations. Most general support
systems employ cryptography to support access control, authorization, information content
integrity, and/or information confidentiality. Some systems employ cryptography for non-
repudiation or similar assurance purposes. The improper generation or handling of the keying
material associated with cryptography endangers or eliminates the security services that the
cryptography is employed to provide.

4.2 Major Application Security Plans
As defined in [SP800-18], major applications are applications that require special management
oversight because of the information they contain, process, or transmit; or because of their
criticality to the organization’s mission(s). These applications are systems that perform clearly
defined functions for which there are readily identifiable security considerations and needs (e.g.,
an electronic funds transfer system). A major application may consist of many individual
programs and hardware, software, and telecommunications components. These components can
be a single software application, or combinations of hardware and software that are focused on
supporting a specific mission-related function.
Many major applications employ cryptography to support access control, authorization,
information content integrity, and/or information confidentiality. Some systems employ
cryptography for non-repudiation or similar assurance purposes. As in the case of general
support systems, the improper generation or handling of the keying material associated with
cryptography endangers or eliminates the security services that the cryptography is employed to
provide. Major applications can run on a general support system. In such cases, the major
applications security plan should provide a reference in a Key Management Appendix to the
appropriate general support system security plan. Otherwise, it is recommended that a Key
Management Appendix be added to the plan. The content of a Key Management Appendix to the
major applications security plan is identified in Section 4.3.


                                                39
4.3 Key Management Additions to System Security Plans
According to [SP800-18], security plans for major applications and general support systems
should include system identification information (including system purpose, environment,
attributes, and the controls contained in NIST Special Publication 800-53 [SP800-53]). It is
recommended that a Key Management Appendix be added to any security plan that identifies
key management roles and responsibilities for systems that employ cryptography. Additionally,
the following key management-related information and controls should be included in the bodies
of the system security plans.
   •   System Identification: System identification information should identify configurable
       information security mechanisms. This should include the identification of security
       hardware and software upon which the security of sensitive information will depend. The
       functions of the mechanisms should be related to the information security services to be
       provided (confidentiality, integrity, and availability). Configurable information security
       mechanisms should also include the identification of configuration requirements for each
       security mechanism (e.g., key variables, firewall protocol and access settings, operating
       system and access control lists). The sources and managers responsible for configuration
       variables should be identified.
   •   Control Families: Cryptographic and key management material should be added for
       physical and environmental protection; configuration management; contingency
       planning, and system and information integrity control families:
          -   Physical and Environmental Protection – This subsection should identify any
              cryptographic mechanisms employed, together with any applicable
              implementation or environmental standards (e.g., FIPS 140-2).
          -   Configuration Management - This subsection should specify key management
              procedures. The subsection entry may simply refer to a Key Management
              Appendix).
          -   Contingency Planning - This subsection should specify any key archiving and
              recovery procedures employed to support the recovery of encrypted files. This
              should include the location(s) of stored and archived cryptographic keys.
          -   System and Information Integrity - This subsection should identify any digital
              signature or other cryptographic authentication or authorization mechanisms
              installed in the system. It should indicate whether or not digital signature and/or
              other integrity keying materials are validated (certification authority and
              completeness/correctness).
   •   Access Control: The subsection of the plan that addresses logical access controls should
       describe any cryptographic mechanisms employed, the applicable standards for their
       implementation and operation, and key variable sources and guidelines (may refer to a
       Key Management Appendix).
   •   Key Management Appendix: It is recommended that a Key Management Appendix be
       added to the plan that identifies key management roles and responsibilities. Some
       organizations may have well-defined key management infrastructures and up-to-date and


                                               40
comprehensive key management policies and practices documents. In such cases, the
appendix may simply reference the appropriate sections of the documents that define key
management policies, practices and infrastructure. In any event, the following
information should be included in a Key Management Appendix, either in detail or by
reference.
   -   Identification of the Keying Material Manager (The keying material manager
       should report directly to the organization’s chief executive officer, chief
       operations executive, or chief information systems officer. The keying material
       manager is a key employee who should have the capabilities and trustworthiness
       that are commensurate with the responsibility for maintaining the authority and
       integrity of all formal electronic transactions, and the confidentiality of all
       information that is sufficiently sensitive to warrant cryptographic protection.)
   -   Identification of the title, role, or individual on behalf of which an organization’s
       Certification Authority (CA) signs certificates (where applicable where public key
       cryptography is employed). This should normally be either the keying material

                                42
4.4 Documentation Required for Security Evaluation
Key management systems that support protection of Federal government information require
certification and accreditation as specified in NIST Special Publication 800-37, Federal
Guidelines for Security Certification and Accreditation of Information Systems [SP800-37]. Key
generation, establishment, agreement, and transport mechanisms shall conform to FIPS 140-2.
Data processing components of Information Technology (IT) systems employed in support of
these key management functions will need to satisfy the operational environment requirements
stated in terms of the Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation
[ISO15408] where required by FIPS 140-2. Data processing components of IT systems that
support other key management functions may also need to have been evaluated under the
Common Criteria. (See NIST Special Publication 800-23, Guidelines to Federal Organizations
on Security Assurance and Acquisition/Use of Tested/Evaluated Products.) The overall IT system
or set of systems that perform key management for a Federal government organization is
required to be certified and accredited under SP 800-37. The documentation required for
certification and accreditation under SP 800-37, includes that specified under SP 800-18
Revision 1, plus a security assessment report and a plan of action and milestones. Where
certification and accreditation of a key management system is required, the KMP and KMPS
should specify conformance to SP 800-37 by validating compliance with key management
control objectives contained in Appendix D of this document (i.e., SP 800-57, Part 2).




                                             43
5    Key Management Planning for Cryptographic Components
Federal government organizations are required by statutory and administrative rules and
guidelines to protect the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive information and processes. If
cryptography is used to satisfy this requirement, it is necessary for developers, integrators, and
managers to ensure that each cryptographic implementation satisfies all system security,
compatibility, and interoperability requirements that are associated with the system into which it
is being integrated. For any cryptographic device employed by the Federal government, there
should be a specification of the keying material that the device requires, an identification of
whether the keying material is internally or externally generated, a specification of keying
material input/output interfaces, and a description of interfaces to any required validation process
(see Part 1, Section 8 of this guideline). Development of the specification should be initiated
before any cryptographic procurement is initiated. Algorithms, key lengths, cryptoperiods, key
sources, and keying material access and handling requirements should also be specified (See
Section 4). These specifications are required by system developers as well as by the managers of
systems into which cryptographic components are integrated. They are also required by program
managers who are responsible for the security of system implementations. Program managers
who oversee the implementation of cryptography in Federal systems are responsible for ensuring
that the systems include all necessary mechanisms, interfaces, policies, and procedures that are
necessary to generate or otherwise acquire, distribute, replace or update, account for, and protect
keying material that is required for system cryptographic operations in accordance with the
guidelines presented in Part 1 and the policies and practices identified in Part 2 of this
Recommendation for Key Management.

All cryptographic development activities and cryptographic applications programs should
involve key management planning. In the case of planning for the acquisition and use of existing
cryptographic devices or software, key management planning should begin during the initial
discussion stages for cryptographic applications or implementation efforts. The planning should
be evolutionary in nature, maturing as the cryptographic application matures, and should be
consistent with NIST key management guidance. Key management plans should ensure that the
key management products and services that are proposed for the cryptographic device or
application are provided with adequate security, and are supportable and operationally suitable.
For cryptographic development efforts, a key specification and acquisition process should begin
as soon as the algorithm and, if appropriate, the media and format have been identified. For the
application of existing cryptographic products for which no key management plan exists, the
process should begin as soon as the product is selected for the application. In both cases, the
specification and acquisition process should be an initial step in the evolution of a Key
Management Plan. For the application of existing cryptographic products for which a key
management plan does exist, the existing plan should be reviewed in the context of the
application's environment, and requirements and should be amended as necessary. Such a review
process should begin as soon as the product is selected for the application.
The types of key management products and services that are produced for a specific
cryptographic device and/or for suites of devices used by organizations should be standardized
to the maximum possible extent, and new cryptographic application development efforts should
comply with NIST key management recommendations. Accordingly, NIST criteria for the


                                                44
security, accuracy, and utility of key management products and services in electronic and
physical forms should be met. The methods used in the design, evaluation, programming,
generation, production, distribution, quality assurance, and inspection procedures for key
management products and services should be structured to satisfy such criteria. The utility of
key management products and services will be improved by employing uniform key
management products and services, with a minimum of variation within each type of key
technique, and by employing those types that have been accepted and successfully implemented
by users.
Where the criteria for security, accuracy, and utility can be satisfied with any of the
organization’s existing suite of key management products and services, one of those products
and services should be used. Where the application of current key management products and
services results in reduced security, accuracy, utility, or added cost to a cryptographic
application, then an organization may initiate efforts to develop and implement other key
management products and services types, variations, and, as necessary, production processes.
However, such efforts should conform as closely as possible to established key management
recommendations.

5.1 Key Management Planning Documents
The document that describes the management of all key management products and services used
by a cryptographic product (cryptographic engine, cryptographic device, cryptographic
application, or user entity) throughout its lifetime is the Key Management Specification. Key
Management Specifications are generally produced by developers or (where developers have
failed to produce adequate specifications) by integrators. Organizational key management plans
(e.g., Key Management Appendices to System Security Plans) document the capabilities that
cryptographic applications require from the organization’s Key Management Infrastructure
(KMI). The purpose of these organizational key management plans is to ensure that any lifecycle
key management services are supportable by and available from the KMI in a secure and timely
manner. If a KMP exists for an organization, the Key Management Specification needs to be in
conformance with the KMP. The KMPS should support both the KMPS and the Key
Management Specification.

5.2 Key Management Planning Process
When developing a Key Management Specification for a cryptographic product, the unique key
management products and services needed from the KMI to support the operation of the
cryptographic product need to be defined. The checklist provided in Appendix E may be used to
document information about cryptographic products used by an organization and, as applicable,
their development and implementation processes.
Specification of cryptographic mechanisms, including key management mechanisms, shall
necessarily take into account the organization’s resource limitations and procedural environment.
For example, an organization that lacks the physical protection facilities, security clearances for
support personnel, and procedures and resources required for managing national security
cryptographic material, might find it difficult to satisfy the policies and procedures required for
the classified cryptography that is generally required for the protection of national security
information. Before either approving or rejecting specifications requiring national security
cryptography, the organization should consider the resource and operational implications of the


                                                45
decision. A contrasting example is that of an organization that must exchange information that is
assigned a moderate or high FIPS 199 information security risk level specifying a FIPS 140-2
Level 1 cryptographic module. Such a decision could adversely affect the organization’s ability
to be permitted to continue to engage in mission-critical processing and communications
partnerships.
The planning process must account for both availability of critical resources and for assurance
requirements implied by the organization’s critical mission functions.

5.3 Key Management Planning Information Requirements
The level of key management planning detail required for cryptographic applications can be
tailored, depending upon the scope and complexity of the application. Obviously, if an
organization’s cryptographic support requirements are limited to e-mail security for a small
number of employees, extensive planning documentation is neither feasible nor cost-effective.
On the other hand, cryptographic security for a collection of networks that support thousands or
tens of thousands of users require the kind of extensive documentation described in Section 4
and Appendix D. Regardless of the size and complexity of a cryptographic application,
documentation of some basic key management characteristics and requirements is strongly
recommended. Some basic information that needs to be documented for all applications is as
follows.
5.3.1      Key Management Products and Services Requirements
The key management product and service requirements describe the types, quantities,
cryptoperiod (lifetime), algorithms, and additional information that define the cryptographic
application’s keying material requirements. Cryptographic applications using public key
certificates (i.e., X.509 certificates) should describe the class of certificates, and whether
certificates and tokens already issued to subscribers will be used for the cryptographic
application, or whether the cryptographic application will require additional certificates and
tokens. If additional certificates and tokens are required, key management documentation should
describe a rough order of magnitude for the quantity of certificates required. If certificates and
tokens already issued (or planned to be issued) by the KMI are adequate for the cryptographic
application described in the Key Management Specification, then the Key Management
Specification should so state. Otherwise, any new or additional certificate or tokens features
(e.g., new certificate extensions or formats) should be described.
The requirement information for the cryptographic application's key management products and
services may be included in table format. The following information should be included11:
     •   The types of key management products and services (keys, certificates, tokens for various
         purposes),
     •   The quantity of key management products and services required (per device to be keyed),
     •   The projected quantity of devices to be employed in the application,


11
  Note that some of this material may be included by reference (e.g., distribution of cryptography by the using
organization’s KMI).


                                                         46
       •   The algorithm employed to provide each key management product and service being
           implemented (the applicable FIPS),
       •   The keying material format(s) (reference existing key specifications if applicable),
       •   Cryptoperiods to be enforced (a general recommendation or specific to application or
           organization),
       •   PKI certificate classes (as applicable),
       •   Tokens or software modules to be used (as applicable),
       •   Dates when keying material is needed (initial plans and plan revisions),
       •   The projected duration of the need (for applications or organizations)12, and
       •   The anticipated Keying Material Manager (as applicable).
The description of the key management products and services format generally references an
existing Key Specification. If the format of the keying material is not already specified
elsewhere, then the format and medium should be specified.
5.3.2        Key Management Products and Services Ordering
A description of the procedures for ordering keying material within a specified KMI is required.
Details should be included that are sufficient to permit a determination of the requirements for
long-term support by the KMI.
5.3.3        Keying Material Distribution
Describe the distribution and transport encapsulation (where employed) of key management
products and services within the cryptographic application. The distribution information will
normally include when and where the key management products and services are encrypted or
unencrypted, the physical form (electronic, PROM, disk, paper, etc.) and how they are identified
during the distribution process.
5.3.4        Keying Material Storage
Documentation should address the method for storing and identifying keying material during its
storage life (e.g., Distinguished Name). The storage capacity capabilities for key management
products and services should be included.
5.3.5        Access Control
Documentation should address how access to the cryptographic application will be authorized,
controlled, and validated for the request, generation, handling, distribution, storage, and/or use of
key management products and services. The use of passwords, personal identification numbers
(PINs), and their expiration dates shall be included. For PKI cryptographic applications, access
privileges based on roles and the use of tokens shall be described.



12
     This can affect strength of mechanism, affect when the system must be replaced, etc.


                                                           47
5.3.6    Accounting
There needs to be a description of the accounting for key management products and services
used by the cryptographic application. The use of logs to support the tracking of key
management products and services generation, distribution, storage, use and/or destruction
should be detailed. The use of appropriate access privileges to support the control of key
management products and services used by the cryptographic application should also be
described, in addition to the directory capabilities used to support PKI cryptographic
applications, if applicable. There should be an identification of where human and automated
tracking actions are performed and where two-person integrity is required, if applicable. Note
that some of this material may, under some circumstances, be included by reference (e.g.,
reference to Department of Defense (DoD) Cryptographic Material System (CMS)
documentation where the keying material is distributed by a DoD KMI).
5.3.7    Compromise Management and Recovery
How protected communications can be restored in the event of the compromise of keying
material needs to be described. The recovery process description should include the methods for
re-key or replacement. For PKI cryptographic applications, the implementation of Certificate
Revocation Lists (CRLs) and Compromised Key Lists (CKLs) should be detailed. A description
of how certificates will be reissued and renewed within the cryptographic application should
also be included.
5.3.8    Key Recovery
Key recovery addresses how currently unavailable keying material can be recovered. A key
recovery process description should include a discussion of the generation (e.g., whether or not
the material was centrally-generated), storage, and access for long-term storage keys. The
process of transitioning from the current to future long-term storage keys should also be
included.
5.3.9    KMI Enhancements Requirements (optional)
The use of standard key management products and services provided by an organization’s KMI
is highly encouraged. Such use reduces the documentation requirements and facilitates both
systems integration and logistics support. It also encourages the feedback of locally specific
requirements to the KMI planning process. However, a cryptographic application may identify
requirements that are currently not supported by the appropriate KMI. If applicable, it would be
useful to address where improvements to the KMI are required in order to achieve the needed
cryptographic application functionality. This will assist in identifying requirements for current
and/or planned capability increments of the KMI. Even if a cryptographic application can be
fully supported by the current or planned KMI, improvements to the KMI should also be
identified if they improve the functionality of the cryptographic application, reduce user
workload, or improve/reduce KMI functionality. Requirements identified can be analyzed for
potential upgrades to the KMI, based on available cost, schedule, and performance constraints.

 Appendix A: Notional Key Management Infrastructure (KMI)

This appendix identifies the elements of a representative key management infrastructure and
suggests functions of and relationships among the organizational elements. This "notional"
infrastructure builds on the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), Kerberos, and US Government KMI
components and mechanisms. The organizational elements and functions support all lifecycle
stages of the keys necessary to the security functions identified in Part 1, Section 2.1, Security
Services. Following the definition of KMI elements and functions, examples are provided for the
distribution and management of both symmetrical and asymmetrical keys in a KMI environment.

A.1 Notional Key Management Infrastructure
This subsection presents a “notional” KMI as an example to illustrate common key management
functions and requirements. A KMI is designed to incorporate a set of functional key
management elements, or nodes, that collectively provide a unified and seamless infrastructure.
Five distinct functional elements are identified for the generation, distribution, and management
of cryptographic keys: the central oversight authority, key processing facility, service agents,
client nodes, and user entities (encryption devices). Figure 2 illustrates a notional KMI structure.

A.1.1    Central Oversight Authority (COAs)
The COA 1) coordinates protection policy and practices (procedures) documentation, 2) serves
as the source for common and system level information required by service agents (SAs), and 3)
may function as a holder of data provided by SAs. Examples of system-level data required by
SAs may include: 1) product and registration information, 2) directory data, system policy
specifications, and 3) system-wide key compromise and certificate revocation information. The
COA is the central oversight authority that provides overall KMI data synchronization and
system security oversight for an organization or set of organizations. As required by survivability
or continuity of operations policies, the COA may be replicated at an appropriate remote site to
function as a system back-up.
A.1.2    Key Processing Facilities (KPFs)
KPFs provide key production and storage services. These services include:
    •   The acquisition or generation of public key certificates (where applicable),
    •   The initial generation and distribution of keying material,
    •   The maintenance of a database that maps user entities to an organization’s certificate/key
        structure,
    •   The maintenance and distribution of nodal key compromise lists (CKLs) and/or
        certificate revocation lists (CRLs), and
    •   The generation of audit requests and the processing audit responses as necessary for the
        prevention of undetected compromises.
An organization may employ the services of more than one KPF (e.g., for purposes of inter-
organizational interoperation). KPFs can be added to meet new requirements or deleted when no
longer needed. KPFs may support both public key and symmetric key establishment techniques.
KPFs will typically serve as the source of symmetric keys for an organization. KPFs may also
generate or obtain asymmetric or public key pairs. Where public key cryptography is employed,
the KPF would generally perform most PKI registration authority, repository, and archive
functions. The KPF also performs at least some PKI certification authority functions. Actual
X.509 public key certificates may be obtained from a government source (government-managed
certification authorities generating identification, attribute, or encryption certificates) or an
external commercially managed certification authority (usually a commercial infrastructure/CA
vendor that supplies/sells X.509 certificates). Commercial external certification authority
certificates should be cross-certified by a government root CA.
KPFs may include intermediary redistribution facilities that maintain stores of products that are
produced in physical form (e.g., magnetic media, smart cards). KPFs may also serve as a source
for non-cryptographic products and services (e.g., software downloads for KMI-reliant users,
usage documents, or policy authority).
All keys and products that originate at KPFs for electronic distribution shall be encrypted for the
end user or for intermediary redistribution services before transmission. Keys that are manually
distributed shall either be encrypted or receive physical protection and be subject to controlled
distribution (e.g., registered mail) between the KPF and the user. Part 1, Section 2.3.1 provides


                                                50
general guidance for key distribution. A KPF may be composed of electronic and manual
systems that generate a variety of cryptographic keying materials. KPFs should be designed to
support legacy and existing system requirements and should be designed to support future
network services as they become available. Some organizations may establish manual source
KPF components that are capable of generating and producing human-readable key information
and other key-related products that require physical distribution.
A.1.3    Service Agents (SAs)
SAs support organizations’ KMIs as single points of access for other KMI nodes, including CNs
and KPFs. All transactions initiated by user CNs are either processed by a SA directly or
forwarded on to other nodes for processing. The SA directs service requests from its CNs to the
KPF(s), and when services are required from multiple KPFs, coordinates services among the
KPFs to which it is connected. SAs offer users a single interface point and common tools to
order products and services, retrieve products and services, and manage cryptographic material
and public key certificates. A SA may provide cryptographic material and/or certificates by
utilizing product-specific KPFs for key and/or certificate generation. A SA that supports a major
organizational unit or geographic region may either access an inter-organizational KPF or central
KPF, or deploy its own KPF(s), as required, to support survivability, performance, or
availability, requirements (e.g., a commercial external KPF that provides Certificate Authority
services).
SAs may perform the following functions:
   •    Provide registration services,
   •    Provide directory services,
   •    Provide support for data recovery services (i.e. key recovery),
   •    Provide access to relevant documentation, such as policy statements and infrastructure
        devices,
   •    Process requests for products (e.g., user identification credentials),
   •    Assign and manage KMI user roles and privileges, and
   •    Provide interactive help desk services as required.
A.1.4    Client Nodes (CNs)
CNs provide interfaces for managers, devices, and applications to access KMI functions,
including the requesting of certificates and other keying material. CNs interact with SAs to
obtain cryptographic key services. CNs act as interfaces to end user entities (e.g., encryption
devices) for the distribution of keying material, for the generation of requests for keying
material, for the receipt and forwarding (as appropriate) of CRLs, for the receipt of audit
requests, and for the delivery of audit responses. CNs typically initiate requests for keying
material in order to synchronize new or existing user entities with the current key structure, and
receive encrypted keying material for distribution to user entities (in which the content - the
keying material - not accessible to the CN). A CN can be a workstation executing KMI security
software or a FIPS 142-2 compliant special purpose device. Actual interactions between a CN


                                                  51
and a SA depend on whether the CN is a device, a manager, or a functional security application.
Examples of different types of CNs and their relationship to the SA follow:
   •    A manager CN might be a workstation operating KMI software that is used by
        individuals who have been assigned KMI management roles. Access to a SA through a
        client would generally require the user to be registered in (known to) the KMI and have
        one or more management assignments. A manager/user may choose to retain local
        records of KMI interactions, but the SA should retain records of all CN management
        interactions and may serve as the normal records repository for CNs.
   •    A distribution management CN would generally be capable of supporting product
        distribution from a SA and, where required by operational or organizational
        circumstances or key schemes, even provide local generation of some types of
        cryptographic keys. This type of CN can operate on a workstation or be integrated into a
        special purpose device. The distribution management CN would typically receive KMI
        products and services from a SA for distribution to a user equipment (i.e., the
        cryptographic device that uses the keying material). This type of CN might also receive
        and store products for future distribution.
   •    A device CN would usually be a KMI-enabled device (e.g., an encryption device or
        software application), known to the KMI (e.g., registered and in possession of a KMI
        credential, a certificate, or a transfer key), and capable of securely receiving keying
        material specifically for its use. These devices would be capable of interaction with a SA
        and might be capable of electronically receiving products directly from a SA. Typical
        interactions with a SA might include a request for 1) a key, re-key, and certificate
        revocation or 2) key compromise notification interactions. Distribution of keying material
        to a device CN might also be accomplished through a distribution management CN or a
        FIPS 140-2 compliant key transfer device.
   •    A user application CN would be a KMI-capable security application that functions on
        behalf of a user (e.g., a commercial e-mail application running on a PC that requires
        certification validation information from a directory service). Based on the roles and
        privileges of a user, the CN user application would access a SA and obtain required
        products and services. Interactions with the SA should normally be transparent to the
        human user. [In most cases, the user should be unambiguously and reliably identified to
        the application running on the workstation.] Interactions with the SA would occur
        automatically under the control of the cryptographically enabled application. Examples of
        user application to SA transactions might be an encapsulation type key recovery-enabled
        file encryption application’s request for key recovery information, or an electronic mail
        application’s request for directory information.
A.1.5    User Entities (UEs)
User entities are typically cryptographic devices that are employed on behalf of human users for
encryption/decryption, authentication, digital signature, or authorization purposes.

A.2 Representative Encryption Key Lifecycles
Two examples of encryption key lifecycles are presented in this section in order to illustrate the
possible functionality of interactions among KMI components. The first example is that of a key

                                                52
encrypting key in a symmetric key management scheme, and the second is a public key used in
an asymmetric scheme. These examples are provided only for the purpose of illustrating KMI
functionality, and not to illustrate key schemes themselves.
A.2.1 Example of Distribution of Symmetric Keys
In a representative symmetric encryption key life cycle, an agency may form a new operating
unit within a division that will need to communicate with other operating units within the
division and with operating units in other divisions of the organization. For purposes of this
example, the representative or example key is a master key used for the generation of symmetric
data encryption keys (DEKs). The user entity, an encryption device, is embedded in a FIPS 140-
2 compliant smart card that is installed in a laptop computer with a desktop docking station.
The new operating unit is designated “Operating Unit #3 of Division A,” (Ops A3). It will need
encrypted communications with Operating Units #1 and #2 of Division A, and Operating Unit #1
of Division B (Ops A1, Ops A2, and Ops B1). Ops A3 will also require encrypted
communications with the Division A management unit (Div A). All four Division A units are
served by SA1. Division B is served by SA2. There is only one primary Agency KPF. The KPF has
an arrangement with Company XYZ for Company XYZ to supply X.509 certificates that support
RSA 2048 digital signature and key transport functions. Company XYZ issues certificates that
incorporate the Agency identification only to the Agency KPF. Company XYZ will make changes
to the certificate issuing policy only in response to requests from the manager of the Agency
COA. The CNs are assumed to exercise distribution CN, device CN, and application CN
functionality. Figure 3 illustrates the components in the symmetric key example.
   1. At some time before the encryption key is needed by the operating unit, the Agency KPF
      generates a set of master keys that can be used by the cryptographic units in Agency-
      purchased smart cards to generate session keys. The representative key is one of these
      master keys.
   2. The manager of the new operating unit, upon realizing that keying material is needed to
      support his organization’s secure communications, requests cryptographic support by a
      hard copy request, endorsed by the Division A manager to be sent to the Division A Chief
      Information Systems Officer (CIO). The request includes the serial number of the laptop
      into which cryptographic material is to be installed.
   3. The Division A CIO authorizes an SA1 operator to send a request to the Agency KPF to
      issue CN software and a smart card (Ops A3 user entity) for use in the specified Ops A3
      laptop, and that the smart card be loaded with the following cryptographic material:
           •   A master key to be used by the Ops A3 user entity’s key derivation process for the
               derivation of symmetric data encryption keys,
           •   An RSA certificate that can be employed with the Ops A3 user entity’s key
               transport process to decrypt data encryption keys received from other user entities
               (including SA1),
           •   The RSA private key associated with the key transport certificate,




                                               53
       •   An RSA certificate that can be employed with the Ops A3 user entity’s integrity
           process to enable other user entities to verify the signed key exchange and key
           management messages, and
       •   The RSA private signing key associated with the signature certificate.




                                                                        Company
                                                                          XYZ

4. The SA1 operator establishes a CNA3 audit record and enters the request into the SA1 audit
   record. The KPF sends the software and loaded smart card to Ops A3. The KPF sends a
   record of the shipment to SA1. The record of the shipment is entered into the CNA3 audit
   record at SA1.


5. The Ops A3 user or his/her agent installs the smart card and device client software into
   the laptop previously identified to SA1. When the material is installed, the Ops A3 laptop


                                                     54
        becomes CN “A3” (CNA3). CNA3’s device client software automatically initiates a
        transport and digital signature certificate exchange with SA1 and issues a signed and
        encrypted receipt for the smart card and client node software.
   6. CNA3’s exchange of transport and signature certificates with the client nodes for user
      entities Ops A1, Ops A2, Ops B1, and Div A (CNA1, CNA2, CNB1, and CNA0); will enable
      DEK transport and signature verification that will support required encrypted
      communications with those organizations.
   7. CNA3 will also use a DEK derived from the master key for file encryption purposes.
      Under this Agency’s continuity of operations policy, this file encryption DEK shall be
      sent in encrypted form to SA1 for key recovery purposes, and back-up copies of encrypted
      files shall be stored separately from the laptop.
   8. At some time in the future, the CNA3 laptop is lost or stolen. The user of the laptop shall
      immediately notify his division manager. The division manager shall, under the
      Agency’s key management policy, notify the COA and SA1 that the cryptographic
      material contained in CNA3/user entity A3 is assumed to be compromised. Together with
      the notification, the manager requests (via CNA0) that a replacement smart card, with
      necessary keys, certificates, and software be issued to Ops A3.
   9. SA1 enters the identities of the compromised material into a CKL (for the master key) and
      a CRL (for the certificates). SA1 also enters the assumed compromise into the CNA3 audit
      log and archives CNA3’s back-up file encryption DEK and certificates.
   10. On receipt of approval from the COA, SA1 requests the replacement materials from the
       KPF, and steps 4 and 5 are repeated. CNA3 is now back in business except for the backed-
       up encrypted files.
   11. CNA3 requests the archived file encryption DEK from SA1.
   12. SA1 decrypts the old file encryption DEK and re-encrypts it using the new CNA3 public
       key. SA1 sends the re-encrypted file encryption DEK to CNA3 and destroys the old DEK
       and certificates. The SA1 operator enters a record of the exchange and destruction into the
       CNA3 audit record.
A.2.2    Example of Distribution of Asymmetric Keys
In the asymmetric example, an organizational structure similar to that of the symmetric example
is assumed. In this example, however, the Agency performs its own certification functions,
independent of external sources (e.g., XYZ Corporation). The KPF generates certificates for keys
generated by user entities within CNs. The KPF, SAs, and CNs have digital signature
certificates. The CNs also have key transport public key certificates. Also in this asymmetric
example, each CN includes two user entities (cryptographic devices). One of the devices
performs key transport (among other encryption-related functions), and the other is used to
generate and verify digital signatures. Figure 4 illustrates the KMI organizational elements
involved in the example.

                        Figure 4: Distribution of Asymmetric Keys




1. The user of CNA1, needing new keys to support key transport and digital signature
   capabilities, instructs his CN device software to have his cryptographic devices (UEA1a
   and UEA1b) generate public key/private key pairs. The key pair generated by UEA1a will
   be used by that device for key transport operations. The key pair generated by UEA1b will
   be used by that device for digital signature and verification operations.
2. CNA1 sends the UEA1 key transport public key and the UEA1b signature verification public
   key to the SA1 with a request for public key certificates. The request shall have integrity
   protection. Both CNA1 and SA1 log the request in their respective audit records.
3. SA1 forwards the request for certificates to the KPF. The forwarding message shall also
   have integrity protection assuring the KPF that the request was received correctly from
   SA1. The forwarding of the request to the KPF is logged in the SA1 audit records, and the
   request is logged in the KPF audit record as having come from CNA1 through SA1.



                                                   56
     4. The KPF verifies the request. Assuming that the request is verified as having been
        correctly received, having originated with CNA1, and as having been forwarded by SA1,
        the KPF generates certificates for the public key to be used for key transport and for the
        signature verification public key. The KPF signs both certificates using its signing private
        key and sends the certificates to CNA1 via SA1. The issuing of the certificates is logged in
        the KPF audit record.
     5. The user of CNA1 causes CNA1 to send the certificates to other entities with which the user
        of CNA1 will need to communicate securely (e.g., CNA0 and CNB1). Note that the signing
        private key and the key transport private key never leave CNA1. This preserves the
        potential for non-repudiation and secure key transport. Also note that users such as CNA0
        and CNB1 will need to possess the KPF’s signature verification key in order to establish
        the validity of the certificates.
     6. After one year, the certificate for the CNA1 key transport public key expires. The KPF
        includes the identity of the key in a CRL and distributes the CRL. The KPF shall retain a
        record of the CRL and forward a copy of the CRL to the COA. CNA1 destroys the key
        transport private key, logs the destruction in its audit record, and sends a notification of
        the destruction to the KPF via SA1. Records of the destruction report are logged at SA1
        and the KPF. It is assumed that a new key transport key pair will have been generated at
        CNA1, and a request for a new certificate will have been forwarded to the KPF via SA1.

A.3 Integration of the KMI Into Organizations
In the real world, organizations are not built around key management infrastructures; rather
KMIs are integrated into existing organizational structures. Existing organizational relationships
can affect the notional KMI. This can result in some duplication of KMI functionality within the
organization and/or a division of the functions of notional KMI elements among multiple
organizational elements. Figure 5 depicts a hypothetical organization. Note that the structure of
the organization depicted is not a recommended structure. It is provided only to illustrate how an
organization’s underlying structure can affect the structure of a KMI.
A.3.1 Key Management Elements of the Hypothetical Organization
The hypothetical organization is assumed to have placed telecommunications responsibilities in
its Information Technology Directorate rather than in an administrative or services directorate.13
The Director of Information Technology is also the CIO. In this case, the CIO also serves as the
organization’s COA. General cryptographic support is obtained from the Information Services
Division of the Information Technology Directorate. The KPF is located in the Information
Services Division, and training for operation and maintenance of cryptographic components is
also obtained from the Information Services Division. The hypothetical organization’s



13
  This organizational idiosyncrasy is relatively common. In many technical organizations, in-house IT expertise and
support facilities develop in the course of business or mission operations. Budget and other resource constraints
then cause management to use these in-house resources for general organizational support. Often, IT support
remains within the major administrative unit within which it evolved rather than being established as a separate
dedicated IT capability within an administrative or facility support department. Budgetary and political
considerations can dominate principles of administrative efficiency.

Information Services Division has not yet organized a cryptographic facilities group, so services
and support are actually obtained from its Computer Facilities Group. SAs are supposed to be
located at the group level throughout the hypothetical agency, though where organizations lack
Service Agent hardware and software, they may apply to the Information Services Division for
permission to use the Computer Facilities Group’s capabilities.
Ideally, a single cryptographic services group would support all of an organization’s key
management needs. However, this is often not the case. In the hypothetical organization
depicted in Figure 5, the element that originally processed classified Federal government
information was the Mail and Reproduction Group within the Administration Directorate’s
Facilities Services Division. Other agency-wide personnel security, physical security, and police
support resources were also assigned to this Facilities Services Division. So, even though other
IT security management responsibilities fall under the Information Technology Directorate, the
office responsible for requesting and managing classified cryptographic services is still that of
the Chief, Facilities Service Division. Note that this activity is administratively independent
from that of the KMI.
A.3.2 Key Management Operations Within the Hypothetical Organization
The hypothetical organization is assumed to use128-bit AES [FIPS-197] for encryption, 1024-bit
DSA [FIPS 186-3] for digital signature, and 1024-bit RSA for key transport purposes. SHA-1
[FIPS 180-2] is the hash function employed with DSA. CNs generate their own symmetric keys
for AES and distribute them encrypted under RSA. The DSA and RSA key pairs have three-year

                                                    58
cryptoperiods. The hypothetical organization is assumed to possess a CA for certificate
generation licensed from a vendor. The CA is operated by the Computer Facilities Group within
the Information Technology Directorate’s Information Services Division. The operators and
facilities associated with the CA are also responsible for CN operator training, and for
distribution and maintenance of UEs and other CN assets. Thus, these personnel and facilities are
responsible to the Information Services Division Chief for carrying out KPF functions.
   1. When a potential user is initially presented with a requirement for cryptographic services,
      the user (or an administrative functionary acting on the user’s behalf) applies to an SA for
      the cryptographic application and related facilities and/or support.
   2. On receipt of the request, the SA prepares and submits a request for service to the KPF.
      [Note that in the hypothetical organization steps 1 and 2 may be combined. For example,
      a group supervisor may decide that an employee should be using an application that
      includes cryptographic processes. The supervisor may direct an administrative assistant
      to arrange for the employee to be set up with the necessary capabilities. The
      administrative assistant may then, using a secure client node connection and SA software,
      submit a request for service to the KPF located in the Information Services Division’s
      Computer Facilities Group.]
   3. KPF personnel then take the following actions:
           (a) Obtain approval for the request from the KPF manager (Chief, Information
               Services Division. Allocate a CN for the user that includes the necessary
               cryptographic UE, associated software, and other software necessary to run the
               application for which cryptography is required. Copies of the request and
               approval action are provided to the COA (Office of the CIO).
           (b) Schedule training for the user.
   4. At the time of user training, KPF personnel take the following additional actions:
           (a) Verify the identity of the user, requiring an authorization memorandum from the
               requesting group and two picture IDs.
           (b) Create a user account in the KPF server.
           (c) Assist the user in selecting a password/passphrase that will be used for encryption
               of private contents of a key profile diskette to be used in the user’s CN.
           (d) Generate a DSA key pair.
           (e) Send the DSA public key to the CA. Encrypt the DSA private key and store it on
               the user’s key profile diskette.
           (f) Use the CA to generate a certificate containing the user ID and DSA public
               verification key.
           (g) Add the DSA certificate to the user’s account in the server.




                                                 59
   (h) Cause the CA to generate an RSA key pair and RSA certificate. Retain a copy of
       the RSA certificate and private decryption key in the CA. Encrypt a copy of the
       RSA private decryption key.
   (i) Add the RSA certificate and a copy of the encrypted RSA decryption key to the
       user’s account in the server.
   (j) Cause copies of the DSA and RSA certificates and the encrypted RSA decryption
       key to be sent to the CN and stored on the key profile diskette.
   (k) Assist the user in adding additional information necessary to complete the
       cryptographic profile diskette.
5. Following training, the user is encouraged to change the password/passphrase prior to
   operational use of the CN.
6. Prior to entering into integrity-protected exchanges with other parties, the user causes
   his/her CN to send a copy of his/her DSA certificate to the other party(ies). This will
   permit the other party(ies) to verify that the certificate was generated for the sending
   party’s ID by a CA with which the recipient(s) has/have a relationship and to verify
   the DSA signature of the data.
7. Prior to entering into encrypted exchanges with other parties, the user causes his/her
   CN to send a copy of his/her RSA certificate to the other party(ies) and requests that
   the other party(ies) send copies of their RSA certificates. This will permit each party
   to verify each other’s RSA public (encryption) keys and to encrypt AES encryption
   keys.
8. In the case of encrypted exchanges the UE associated with each CN in a
   communicating pair generates an AES key, RSA-encrypts the key using the other
   party’s RSA public key and sends the encrypted value to the other party. The
   encrypted values are decrypted, and the two original 128-bit values are exclusive-
   ORed. The resulting value becomes the AES key for the encrypted exchange.
9. After three years, the user’s DSA and RSA certificates expire. The KPF includes the
   identity of the keys in a CRL and distributes the CRL. The KPF should retain a
   record of the CRL and forward a copy of the CRL to the COA. The user instructs
   his/her CN to destroy the DSA and RSA private keys, log the destruction in its audit
   record, and send a notification of the destruction to the KPF via the local SA. Records
   of the destruction report are logged at the SA and the KPF. The user will need to
   repeat the process described above (less the training component) prior to receiving
   replacement certificates and private keys.

Appendix B: Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate Policy
   and Certification Practices Framework

Where all keys employed in a system are PKI keys issued by a Certificate Authority that is part
of the Federal Bridge, a PKI Certificate Policy (CP) may serve as the Key Management Policy
(KMP), and a PKI Certification Practices Statement (CPS) may serve as a Key Management
Practices Statement (KMPS). Where other types of keys are used, a separate document is
required. The standard format for developing both the PKI CP and CPS is contained in RFC
3647, the Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate Policy and Certification Practices
Framework [RFC3647]14. The RFC 3647 format should be used for CPs and CPSs. As stated in
Section 3.1.2, most of the elements of the RFC 3647 format are also applicable to non-PKI
environments, though a number of adaptations are required to accommodate symmetric key
management characteristics (e.g., identification of key management message and CKL profiles
rather than certificate and CRL profiles called for by Section 4.7 of the RFC).
RFC 3647 proposes an outline with eight major sections and 185 second- and third-level topics.
The topics identified in this appendix are candidate topics for inclusion in either a certificate
policy definition or a CPS. While many topics are identified, it is not necessary for a CP or a
CPS to include a concrete statement for every such topic. Rather, a particular CP or CPS may
state "no stipulation" for a component, subcomponent, or element on which the particular CP or
CPS imposes no requirements. In this sense, the list of topics can be considered a checklist of
topics for consideration by the CP or CPS author. It is recommended that each topic and
subtopic be included in a CP or CPS, even if there is "no stipulation"; this will indicate to the
reader that a conscious decision was made to include or exclude that topic. This protects against
inadvertent omission of a topic, while facilitating comparison of different CPs or CPSs, e.g.,
when making policy-mapping decisions.
In a certificate policy definition, it is possible to leave certain topics, subtopics, and/or elements
unspecified, and to stipulate that the required information will be indicated in a policy qualifier.
Such certificate policy definitions can be considered as parameterized definitions. The set of
provisions should reference or define the required policy qualifier types and should specify any
applicable default values.
Although the same general format is used for both the CP and CPS, the two documents are very
different in character and content. While the CP is a high-level document that describes a
security policy for issuing certificates and maintaining certificate status information, the CPS is a
highly detailed document that describes how a CA implements a specific CP. The CPS identifies
the CP that it implements and specifies the mechanisms and procedures that are used to achieve
the security policy. The CPS includes sufficient operational detail to demonstrate that the CP
can be satisfied by this combination of mechanisms and procedures.

                                                             61
Each CPS applies to a single CA15. The CPS may be the overall operations manual for the CA.
Specific portions of the CPS may be extracted to form the CA Operations Guide, RA Manual,
PKI Users Guide, or other role-specific documentation. Auditors and accreditors may use the
CPS to supplement the CP during reviews of CA operations. Note that a CPS does not need to
be published. The combination of a CP and the results of an accreditation process are often
sufficient for to satisfy the needs of most external parties. [PKI 01]

B.1 Introduction
The introduction provides an overview of the use of certificates to be issued under the CP and
explains how to identify certificates issued under the policy (e.g., by an object identifier [OID] in
a certificate policy extension or, in the case of a CA or a sub-tree of a hierarchical PKI that issues
certificates under a single policy, the issuer name). The introduction also identifies the user
community and major applications that the policy is to support, and describes the types of
entities involved in the operation of the CA and the roles that they perform. Although not
required by RFC 3647, the introduction may also include general security objectives (e.g., Items
(b), (c), and (f) identified in Subsection 3.1.2.1.1). Operational entities may include CAs,
Registration Authorities (RAs), subscribers and relying parties, overseers of operations, those
responsible for maintenance of the policy documentation, and other key management
administrators. Finally, the introduction contains contact information for organizations that
administer the CA, maintain the policy documentation, and approve the corresponding detailed
practice statements (i.e., CPS). This contact information should identify the telephone numbers
or mail addresses associated with the organizations that perform these functions. The CP need
not identify individuals.

B.2 General Provisions
The “General Provisions” section captures legal and general practices information, including the
obligations imposed by the policy on the CA, its RAs, subscribers, relying parties, and
repositories. This section describes the frequency of compliance audits, who performs the audits,
the necessary qualifications for auditors, the relationship of the auditor(s) to the CA, topics
covered by the audit, actions to be taken as a result of any deficiencies identified by the audit,
and communication of the results of the audit. The “General Provisions” section also describes
the obligations, liabilities, and financial responsibilities of the various PKI components and
specifies legal jurisdiction and dispute resolution procedures. This section describes methods,
circumstances, and destinations for the dissemination of the CP, CPS(s), certificates, certificate
status, and other information. Finally, this section covers financial charges (e.g., fees,
reimbursement, refund policies) and warranties (including limits on liability).

B.3 Identification and Authentication
The “Identification and Authentication” section describes the procedures used to authenticate a
certificate applicant to a CA or RA prior to certificate issuance. It also describes how parties
requesting re-key or revocation are authenticated. This component also addresses naming
practices, including name ownership recognition and name dispute resolution.

15
  A large PKI may have several CAs that are practically clones. In such cases, it may be more efficient to develop a
single CPS that applies to all the “clone” CAs. However, this specification must include separate information (e.g.,
location, contact information) for each CA within the PKI. [PKI 01]


                                                        62
B.4 Operational Requirements
The “Operational Requirements” section specifies requirements imposed upon issuing CA,
subject CAs, RAs, or end entities with respect to various operational activities. This section
addresses the following subtopics:
       (1) Certificate Application;
       (2) Certificate Issuance;
       (3) Certificate Acceptance;
       (4) Certificate Suspension and Revocation;
       (5) Security Audit Procedures;
       (6) Records Archival;
       (7) Key Changeover;
       (8) Compromise and Disaster Recovery; and
       (9) CA Termination.
Within each subtopic, separate consideration may need to be given to issuing CA, repository,
subject CAs, RAs, and end entities.

B.5 Minimum Baseline Security Controls
Minimum Special Publication 800-53 baseline controls are described in this section.
Procedural control requirements for recognizing trusted CA and RA roles should be described,
together with the responsibilities for each role. The policy document should state, for each task
identified for each role, the number of individuals that are required to perform the task.
Identification and authentication requirements for each role may also be defined. Procedural
controls should be designed to enforce the concepts of least privilege and separation of duties.
No single individual should be able to generate a new CA key pair. Regular audit trail reviews
should be conducted. Individuals who authorize the issuing certificates to a subject should not
be relied upon to verify the subject’s identity.
CA and RA personnel security controls should include 1) background checks and clearance
procedures required for the personnel having access to security-relevant PKI facilities and
processes, 2) training requirements and training procedures for each role; 3) frequency and
sequence for job rotation among various roles; 4) sanctions against personnel for unauthorized
actions, unauthorized use of authority, and unauthorized use of entity systems; 5) controls on
contracting personnel; and 6) documentation to be supplied to personnel.
This section can also be used to define other technical security controls on repositories, subject
CAs, RAs, and end entities.
This section should address the following considerations:
   •   Key Pair Generation and Installation (e.g., key sizes, private key protection, public key
       protection during distribution, quality control);


                                                 63
   •   Private Key Protection (e.g., FIPS 140-2 compliance, backup, archiving, entry
       techniques, activation/deactivation, destruction);
   •   Other Aspects of Key Pair Management (e.g., archiving, periods of use, tamper
       protection of archives);
   •   Other critical security parameters? (e.g., protection employed through life cycle);
   •   Computer Security Controls (e.g., Common Criteria rating/profile requirements);
   •   Life-Cycle Security Controls (e.g., system development and security management
       controls);
   •   Network Security Controls (e.g., use of firewalls); and
   •   Cryptographic Module Engineering Controls (e.g., module boundaries, FIPS 140-2
       compliance).

B.7 Certificate and CRL Profiles
This section is used to specify the certificate format and, if CRLs are used, the CRL format.
Assuming the use of the X.509 certificate and CRL formats, this includes information on
profiles, versions, and the extensions used. The Certificate Profile component of this section
addresses topics such as the following:
   •   Version number(s) supported;
   •   Certificate extensions populated and their criticality;
   •   Cryptographic algorithm object identifiers;
   •   Name forms used for the CA, RA, and end entity names;
   •   Name constraints used, and the name forms used in the name constraints;
   •   Applicable certificate policy Object Identifier(s);
   •   Usage of the policy constraints extension;
   •   Policy qualifiers syntax and semantics; and
   •   Processing semantics for the critical certificate policy extension.
The CRL Profile subsection addresses such topics as version numbers that are supported for
CRLs and CRL and CRL entry extensions populated and their criticality.
[Note that the topics in this section may be addressed simply by reference to a separate profile
definition, such as the PKIX Part I profile).]

B.8 Specification Administration
The “Specification Administration” section of the policy document prescribes who has change
control for the document, describes publication and notification procedures for new versions, and
lists the CPS approval procedures.

APPENDIX C: Evaluator Checklist
Evaluators should determine that key management systems conform to minimum
baseline security controls contained in NIST SP 800-53. Additionally, the evaluators
shall follow the assessment criteria contained in NIST Special Publication 800-53A
[SP800-53A], Guide for Assessing the Security Controls in Federal Information Systems,
and employ the evaluator’s checklist for determining the adequacy of the policies and
practices of key management systems.

C.1 Policy
The term key management policy has more than one meaning. Policy consists of the
directives by senior management to create a key management program, establish its
goals, and assign responsibilities. The term policy is also used to refer to the specific key
management implementation rules for particular systems. Finally, policy may refer to
matters such as the specific managerial decisions that establish key management
infrastructures and the generation, distribution, securing, and accounting for keying
materials.
C.1.1       Policy Content
Evaluators should ensure that the organization’s key management policy documentation
includes at least the following information.
   •    Statement of security objectives,
   •    Identification of the Keying Material Manager,
   •    Provisions for the assignment of responsibilities for:
        -    Key generation or acquisition;
        -    Agreements with partner organizations regarding the cross certification of
             keying material and/or key agreement, as appropriate;
        -    Key distribution and revocation tree design and management;
        -    Establishment of cryptoperiods;
        -    Distribution of and accounting for keying material;
        -    Protection of secret and private keys and related materials;
        -    Emergency and routine revocation of keying material;
        -    Auditing of keying material and related records;
        -    Destruction of revoked or expired keys;
        -    Key recovery;
        -    Compromise recovery;
        -    Disciplinary consequences for willful or negligent mishandling of keying
             material; and

                                               65
        -    Generation, approval, and maintenance of key management practices
             statements.
The evaluators may also check to ensure that the policy documentation contains other
information identified in the Sample KMP Format (Section 3.1.2.1.3).
C.1.2       Policy Characteristics
Evaluators should ensure that organizations have established the following three different
types of policy: Program, Issue Specific, and System Specific. Some organizations may
refer to these types by other names such as directives, procedures, or plans.
C.1.2.1 Program Policy
Evaluators should verify that the organization has established a program policy that
performs the following functions.
C.1.2.1.1 Create and Define a Key Management Policy
 Program policy should be clear as to the numbers, distribution, and sensitivities of
various classes of keys required; and which resources – including facilities, hardware,
and software, information and personnel – are required to implement, manage, and
operate the key management program.
C.1.2.1.2 Set Organizational Strategic Directions
This may include defining the goals of the program. For instance, in an organization
responsible for maintaining large mission-critical databases, re-keying, key update and
key derivation strategies and key recovery issues might be specifically stressed.
C.1.2.1.3 Assign Responsibilities
Responsibilities should be assigned to the key management organization for direct
program implementation, and other responsibilities should be assigned to related
organizations (such as system administration and information systems security
organizations).
C.1.2.1.4 Address Compliance Issues
Program policies should typically address two compliance issues: 1) meeting the
requirements to establish a key management program and the responsibilities assigned
therein to various organizational components, and 2) the use of specified penalties and
disciplinary actions.
C.1.2.2 Issue-Specific Policy
Evaluators should verify that the organization’s issue-specific policies exhibit the
following properties.
C.1.2.2.1 Address Specific Areas
Topics of current relevance and concern to the organization should be addressed. For
example, an organization’s management may find it appropriate to issue a policy
regarding how the cross certification of keys is to be authorized to permit secure
communication with other organizations.

                                            66
C.1.2.2.2 Be Updated With Sufficient Frequency
Policy modifications are likely to be required by 1) changes in technology, 2) changing
perceptions if the sensitivity or criticality of an organization’s information changes, 3)
changes in security services that are required, 4) changes in an organization’s information
exchange structure, and 5) changes in national policies.
C.1.2.2.3 Contain an Issue Statement
The organization’s key management roles and responsibilities, compliance criteria and
determination methods, and points of contact for critical functions should be clear.
C.1.2.3. Systems-Specific Policies
Evaluators should verify that the organization’s systems-specific policies exhibit the
following characteristics.
C.1.2.3.1 Focus on Decisions
The decisions taken by management to enforce specific key management policies, such
as defining the extent to which individuals will be held accountable for the protection of
keying materials to which they have access, should be explicitly stated.
C.1.2.3.2 Be Made By a Management Official
The decisions that management makes, such as the cryptoperiod length or key archiving
requirements, should be based on a technical analysis.
C.1.2.3.3 Vary From System to System
Variances in key management policies may be expected because different systems
employed for information processing within and among organizations may process
information having different levels of sensitivity, security service requirements, data
structures, exchange requirements, and managers’ acceptance of risk.
C.1.2.3.4 Be Expressed as Rules
Specify who (by job category, organization placement, or name) is permitted and/or
required to do what (e.g., order, authorize, generate, or used keys, audit records, or other
key-related material).
C.1.2.4 All Policies
Evaluators should verify that all of the organization’s policies exhibit the following
properties.
C.1.2.4.1 Be Supplemented
Because key management policy is to be written at a broad level, organizations should
also develop or adopt practices, procedures, standards, and guidelines that offer users,
managers, and others a clearer approach to implementing policy and meeting key
management and information security goals. Practices, procedures, standards, and
guidelines may be disseminated throughout the key management infrastructure via
handbooks, regulations, or manuals.



                                             67
C.1.2.4.2 Be Visible
The policy should be published in documents that receive adequate distribution.
Visibility aids the implementation of policy by helping to ensure that the policy is fully
communicated throughout the key management infrastructure.
C.1.2.4.3 Be Supported by Management
Without management support, the key management policy will not be enforced and the
availability, flow, and security of the organization’s information are likely to be severely
impaired.
C.1.2.4.4 Be Consistent
Other organizational directives, laws, organizational culture, guidelines, procedures, and
organizational mission need to be considered in the development and promulgation of an
organization’s key management policies.

C.2 Practices
Key management practice statements should specify how key management procedures
and techniques are used to enforce key management policies and satisfy the organizations
secure information processing requirements.
Evaluators should determine that key management practices documentation clearly and
accurately specify the design and implementation characteristics of the organization’s key
management system and that the practices documentation is consistent with the key
management policy documentation and exhibit the characteristics specified in C.1.2.2 for
issue-specific and systems–specific policies. Evaluators should verify that key
management practices documentation specify 1) the components, roles, and
responsibilities associated with the key management infrastructure; and 2) the roles,
responsibilities, and guidelines associated with essential key management functions.
C.2.1    Infrastructure Specification
Evaluators should determine that key management practices documentation defines any
functional elements, or nodes employed by the organization for ordering, authorization,
generation, distribution, protection, accounting, and use of the keying material necessary
to support the organization’s secure information processing requirements. The
infrastructure should accommodate the functionality of the four distinct functional nodes
identified for the generation, distribution, and management of cryptographic keys in
Section 2.1 of this Recommendation for Key Management’s “General Organization and
Management Requirements.” These four general node types are a Central Oversight
Authority (COA), Key Processing Facilities (KPFs), Service Agents (SAs), and Client
Nodes (CNs). It is noted that organizations may choose to combine the functionality of
more than one node into a single component.
C.2.2    Essential Key Management Functions
Evaluators should determine that key management practices documentation specifies
how key management procedures, and techniques are used to enforce key management
policies and functional requirements. The practices documentation should be determined


                                             68
by the evaluators to clearly identify the organization’s decisions with respect to
cryptographic design and implementation standards, information sensitivity and
criticality, and risk acceptance.
Evaluators should determine that the key management practices documentation describes
in detail any organizational structure, responsible roles, physical facilities, and detailed
procedures necessary to carrying out the functions described below.
C.2.2.1 Algorithm Selection and Key Size
Evaluators should determine that algorithms and key sizes employed to provide security
services are FIPS compliant and conform to recommendations of Part 1 of this
Recommendation for Key Management.
C.2.2.2 Key Generation or Acquisition
Evaluators should determine that key management practices documentation prescribes
key generation and acquisition facilities, functions, and procedures. The documentation
should identify 1) any management organization, roles, and responsibilities associated
with key generation and/or acquisition, 2) any standards and guidelines governing key
generation/acquisition facilities and processes, and 3) any documents required for
authorization, implementation, and accounting functions. For organizations that employ
public key cryptography, the practices document should identify the certificate issuance
elements of the CA (and its hardware, software, and human/organizational components as
appropriate). Operating procedures and quality control procedures for key generation
and/or acceptance of acquired keying material may either appear in the practices
document or in separate documents referenced by the practices document.
C.2.2.3 Key Agreement and Cross Certification Agreements
If the organization has key agreement requirements or requirements to cross certify
certificates issued by each organization, evaluators should determine that key
management practices documentation prescribes organizational authority, standards, and
procedures for authorizing and implementing the cross certification of keying material
and/or key agreement, as appropriate, between or among partner organizations.
C.2.2.4 Key Distribution and Revocation Trees
Evaluators should determine that key management practices documentation prescribes
any organizational authority, facilities, and procedures necessary to meet the
organization’s key distribution and revocation requirements. The documentation should
include or reference any guidelines for maintaining continuity of operations and
maintaining both the assurance and integrity of the revocation process. Evaluators should
determine that key management practices documentation includes necessary guidelines
for the emergency distribution of keys, compromise lists, and revocation lists, as well as
for timely and reliable routine dissemination of keying materials.
C.2.2.5 Establishment of Cryptoperiods
Evaluators should determine that key management practices documentation prescribes
cryptoperiods for keying material employed by an organization. Optionally, the



                                            69
documentation may specify or reference procedures and criteria for cryptoperiod
determination.
C.2.2.6 Distribution of and Accounting for Keying Material
Evaluators should determine that key management practices documentation prescribes
any organizational authority and procedures required for the distribution of and
accounting for keying material at each phase of the key management lifecycle. Evaluators
should determine that key management practices documentation identifies all relevant
accounting forms and database structures for 1) keying material requests, 2) keying
production authorization, 3) authorization of distribution of specific material to specific
organizational destinations for use in specific devices, 4) physical or electronic of keys or
related cryptographic materials, 5) receipting for keys or related cryptographic material,
6) reporting of receipt of keys not accompanied by authorized transmittal information,
and 7) destruction of keys or related cryptographic materials.
Note that not all keying material necessarily needs to be subject to special accounting
procedures. For example, it may not be practical or necessary to maintain records for
relatively short-lived keys (e.g., ephemeral keys), that are generated by user devices (e.g.,
user entities at CNs), and that are intended for use within the CN or are part of a
communication between pairs users.
C.2.2.7 Protection of Keying Material
Evaluators should determine that key management practices documentation prescribes
any responsibilities, facilities, and procedures necessary for the protection of secret and
private keys and related cryptographic materials.
C.2.2.8 Emergency and Routine Revocation of Keying Material
Evaluators should determine that key management practices documentation prescribes
any roles, responsibilities, and procedures required for emergency and routine revocation
of keying material.
C.2.2.9 Auditing
Evaluators should determine that key management practices documentation prescribes
any roles, responsibilities, facilities, and procedures required for the routine auditing of
keying material and related records. Evaluators should include any conditions and
procedures for unscheduled audits that might be triggered by the observed and/or
suspected unauthorized production, loss, or compromise of keys or related cryptographic
material.
C.2.2.10 Keying Material Destruction
Evaluators should determine, where applicable, that key management practices
documentation prescribes, for all key management infrastructure elements, any roles,
responsibilities, facilities, and procedures required for the routine destruction of revoked
or expired keys. In some particularly sensitive applications, provisions may need to be
verified for the emergency destruction of keys and related material to prevent 1) the
exposure of sensitive information or 2) damage to or misuse of critical resources or
processes.


                                             70
C.2.2.11 Key Recovery
Evaluators should determine, where applicable, that key management practices
documentation prescribes, for each key management infrastructure element, the roles,
responsibilities, facilities, and procedures necessary for all organizational elements to
recover critical data, with the necessary integrity mechanisms intact, in the event of the
loss of the operational copy of cryptographic keys under which the data is protected.
C.2.2.12 Compromise Recovery
Evaluators should determine, where applicable, that the key management practices
documentation prescribes, for all key management infrastructure elements, any roles,
responsibilities, facilities, and procedures required for recovery from the of compromise
of cryptographic keying material at any phase in the key's lifecycle. Compromise
recovery includes 1) the timely and secure notification of users of compromised keys that
the compromise has occurred and 2) the timely and secure replacement of the
compromised keys. Emergency key revocation, and the generation and processing of
notification lists are elements of compromise recovery, but evaluators should verify that
the practices documentation also includes any procedures for 1) the recognition and
reporting of the compromise, 2) the identification and/or distribution of replacement
keying material, 3) recording the compromise and compromise recovery actions, and 4)
the destruction and/or de-registration of compromised keying material as appropriate.
C.2.2.13 Policy Violation Consequences
Evaluators should determine that the key management practices documentation
prescribes any roles, responsibilities, and procedures required for establishing and
carrying out disciplinary consequences for the willful or negligent mishandling of keying
material. The consequences should be commensurate with the potential harm that the
policy violation can result in for the organization, its mission, and or other affected
organizations.
C.2.2.14 Documentation
Evaluators should determine that the key management practices documentation includes
the roles, responsibilities, and procedures for the generation, approval, and maintenance
of key management documentation.




                                             71
Appendix D: Key Management Inserts for Security Plan
Templates
This appendix identifies a system security plan template and key management material
that should be included in security plans. The template information has been extracted
from NIST Special Publication 800-18 Revision 1, Guide for Developing Security Plans
for Federal Information Systems [SP800-18].
Note that the following sample has been provided ONLY as one example. Agencies may
be using other formats and choose to update those to reflect any existing omissions based
on this guidance. This is not a mandatory format; it is recognized that numerous agencies
and information security service providers may have developed and implemented various
approaches for information system security plan development and presentation to suit
their own needs for flexibility.

APPENDIX E: Key Management Specification Checklist for
           Cryptographic Product Development

The following key management-related information for cryptographic products development
may be needed to determine and resolve potential impacts to the Key Management Infrastructure
or other keying material acquisition processes in a time frame that meets user requirements.
Yes/no responses should be provided to the following questions as well as additional
information for each “yes” response.
   1. Are unique key management products and services required by the cryptographic product
      for proper operation?
   2. Are there any cryptographic capabilities to be supported by the KMI that are not fully
      programmable in the cryptographic product?
   3. Does the cryptographic engine implement a software download capability for importing
      updated cryptographic functions?
   4. Does the cryptographic engine use any non-key material KMI products or services (such
      as CKL/CRLs, seed key conversion, etc.)?
   5. Does the cryptographic engine design preclude use of any FIPS approved cryptographic
      algorithm?
