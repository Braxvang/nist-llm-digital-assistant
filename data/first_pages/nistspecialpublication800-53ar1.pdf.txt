                                                Authority

This publication has been developed by NIST to further its statutory responsibilities under the
Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), Public Law (P.L.) 107-347. NIST is
responsible for developing information security standards and guidelines, including minimum
requirements for federal information systems, but such standards and guidelines shall not apply to
national security systems without the express approval of appropriate federal officials exercising
policy authority over such systems. This guideline is consistent with the requirements of the
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Section 8b(3), Securing Agency
Information Systems, as analyzed in Circular A-130, Appendix IV: Analysis of Key Sections.
Supplemental information is provided in Circular A-130, Appendix III, Security of Federal
Automated Information Resources.

Nothing in this publication should be taken to contradict the standards and guidelines made
mandatory and binding on federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory
authority. Nor should these guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing
authorities of the Secretary of Commerce, Director of the OMB, or any other federal official.
This publication may be used by nongovernmental organizations on a voluntary basis and is not
subject to copyright in the United States. Attribution would, however, be appreciated by NIST.

                     Compliance with NIST Standards and Guidelines

In accordance with the provisions of FISMA,1 the Secretary of Commerce shall, on the basis of
standards and guidelines developed by NIST, prescribe standards and guidelines pertaining to
federal information systems. The Secretary shall make standards compulsory and binding to the
extent determined necessary by the Secretary to improve the efficiency of operation or security of
federal information systems. Standards prescribed shall include information security standards
that provide minimum information security requirements and are otherwise necessary to improve
the security of federal information and information systems.
     •    Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) are approved by the Secretary of
          Commerce and issued by NIST in accordance with FISMA. FIPS are compulsory and
          binding for federal agencies.2 FISMA requires that federal agencies comply with these
          standards, and therefore, agencies may not waive their use.
     •    Special Publications (SPs) are developed and issued by NIST as recommendations and
          guidance documents. For other than national security programs and systems, federal
          agencies must follow those NIST Special Publications mandated in a Federal Information
          Processing Standard. FIPS 200 mandates the use of Special Publication 800-53, as
          amended. In addition, OMB policies (including OMB Reporting Instructions for FISMA
          and Agency Privacy Management) state that for other than national security programs
          and systems, federal agencies must follow certain specific NIST Special Publications.3
     •    Other security-related publications, including interagency reports (NISTIRs) and ITL
          Bulletins, provide technical and other information about NIST's activities. These
          publications are mandatory only when specified by OMB.
     •    Compliance schedules for NIST security standards and guidelines are established by
          OMB in policies, directives, or memoranda (e.g., annual FISMA Reporting Guidance).4




1
 The E-Government Act (P.L. 107-347) recognizes the importance of information security to the economic and
national security interests of the United States. Title III of the E-Government Act, entitled the Federal Information
Security Management Act (FISMA), emphasizes the need for organizations to develop, document, and implement an
organization-wide program to provide security for the information systems that support its operations and assets.
2
 The term agency is used in this publication in lieu of the more general term organization only in those circumstances
where its usage is directly related to other source documents such as federal legislation or policy.
3
  While federal agencies are required to follow certain specific NIST Special Publications in accordance with OMB
policy, there is flexibility in how agencies apply the guidance. Federal agencies apply the security concepts and
principles articulated in the NIST Special Publications in accordance with and in the context of the agency’s missions,
business functions, and environment of operation. Consequently, the application of NIST guidance by federal agencies
can result in different security solutions that are equally acceptable, compliant with the guidance, and meet the OMB
definition of adequate security for federal information systems. Given the high priority of information sharing and
transparency within the federal government, agencies also consider reciprocity in developing their information security
solutions. When assessing federal agency compliance with NIST Special Publications, Inspectors General, evaluators,
auditors, and assessors consider the intent of the security concepts and principles articulated within the specific
guidance document and how the agency applied the guidance in the context of its mission/business responsibilities,
operational environment, and unique organizational conditions.

  Unless otherwise stated, all references to NIST publications in this document (i.e., Federal Information Processing
Standards and Special Publications) are to the most recent version of the publication.

                 DEVELOPING COMMON INFORMATION SECURITY FOUNDATIONS
                              COLLABORATION AMONG PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR ENTITIES

  In developing standards and guidelines required by FISMA, NIST consults with other federal agencies
  and offices as well as the private sector to improve information security, avoid unnecessary and costly
  duplication of effort, and ensure that NIST publications are complementary with the standards and
  guidelines employed for the protection of national security systems. In addition to its comprehensive
  public review and vetting process, NIST is collaborating with the Office of the Director of National
  Intelligence (ODNI), the Department of Defense (DOD), and the Committee on National Security
  Systems (CNSS) to establish a common foundation for information security across the federal
  government. A common foundation for information security will provide the Intelligence, Defense,
  and Civil sectors of the federal government and their contractors, more uniform and consistent ways to
  manage the risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the
  Nation that results from the operation and use of information systems. A common foundation for
  information security will also provide a strong basis for reciprocal acceptance of security authorization
  decisions and facilitate information sharing. NIST is also working with public and private sector
  entities to establish specific mappings and relationships between the security standards and guidelines
  developed by NIST and the International Organization for Standardization and International
  Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) 27001, Information Security Management System (ISMS).

                                                      Preface

Security control assessments are not about checklists, simple pass-fail results, or generating
paperwork to pass inspections or audits—rather, security controls assessments are the principal
vehicle used to verify that the implementers and operators of information systems are meeting
their stated security goals and objectives. Special Publication 800-53A, Guide for Assessing the
Security Controls in Federal Information Systems and Organizations, is written to facilitate
security control assessments conducted within an effective risk management framework. The
assessment results provide organizational officials with:
•      Evidence about the effectiveness of security controls in organizational information systems;
•      An indication of the quality of the risk management processes employed within the
       organization; and
•      Information about the strengths and weaknesses of information systems which are supporting
       organizational missions and business functions in a global environment of sophisticated and
       changing threats.

The findings produced by assessors are used to determine the overall effectiveness of the security
controls associated with an information system (including system-specific, common, and hybrid
controls) and to provide credible and meaningful inputs to the organization’s risk management
process. A well-executed assessment helps to: (i) determine the validity of the security controls
contained in the security plan and subsequently employed in the information system and its
environment of operation; and (ii) facilitate a cost-effective approach to correcting weaknesses or
deficiencies in the system in an orderly and disciplined manner consistent with organizational
mission/business needs.

Special Publication 800-53A is a companion guideline to Special Publication 800-53,
Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations. Each
publication provides guidance for implementing specific steps in the Risk Management
Framework (RMF).5 Special Publication 800-53 covers Step 2 in the RMF, security control
selection (i.e., determining what security controls are needed to manage risks to organizational
operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation). Special Publication 800-
53A covers RMF Step 4, security control assessment, and RMF Step 6, continuous monitoring,
and provides guidance on the security assessment process. This guidance includes how to build
effective security assessment plans and how to analyze and manage assessment results.

Special Publication 800-53A allows organizations to tailor and supplement the basic assessment
procedures provided. The concepts of tailoring and supplementation used in this document are
similar to the concepts described in Special Publication 800-53. Tailoring involves scoping the
assessment procedures to more closely match the characteristics of the information system and its
environment of operation. The tailoring process gives organizations the flexibility needed to
avoid assessment approaches that are unnecessarily complex or costly while simultaneously
meeting the assessment requirements established by applying the fundamental concepts in the
RMF. Supplementation involves adding assessment procedures or assessment details to
adequately meet the risk management needs of the organization (e.g., adding organization-
specific details such as system/platform-specific information for selected security controls).
Supplementation decisions are left to the discretion of the organization in order to maximize

    Special Publication 800-37 provides guidance on applying the RMF to federal information systems.

flexibility in developing security assessment plans when applying the results of risk assessments
in determining the extent, rigor, and level of intensity of the assessments.

While flexibility continues to be an important factor in developing security assessment plans,
consistency of assessments is also an important consideration. A major design objective for
Special Publication 800-53A is to provide an assessment framework and initial starting point for
assessment procedures that are essential for achieving such consistency. In addition to the
assessment framework and initial starting point for assessment procedures, NIST initiated an
Assessment Case Development Project.6 The purpose of the project is fourfold: (i) to actively
engage experienced assessors from multiple organizations in the development of a representative
set of assessment cases corresponding to the assessment procedures in Special Publication 800-
53A; (ii) to provide organizations and the assessors supporting those organizations with an
exemplary set of assessment cases for each assessment procedure in the catalog of procedures in
this publication; (iii) to provide a vehicle for ongoing community-wide review of the assessment
cases to promote continuous improvement in the assessment process for more consistent, cost-
effective security assessments of federal information systems; and (iv) to serve as a basis for
reciprocity among various communities of interest. The Assessment Case Development Project
is described in Appendix H.

In addition to the assessment case project supporting this publication, NIST also initiated the
Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) 7 project that supports and complements the
approach for achieving consistent, cost-effective security control assessments. The primary
purpose of the SCAP is to improve the automated application, verification, and reporting of
information technology product-specific security configuration settings, enabling organizations to
identify and reduce the vulnerabilities associated with products that are not configured properly.
As part of this initiative, an Open Checklist Interactive Language (OCIL)8 provides the capability
to express the determination statements in the assessment procedures in Appendix F in a
framework that will establish interoperability with the validated tool sets supporting SCAP.

 An assessment case represents a worked example of an assessment procedure that provides specific actions that an
assessor might carry out during the assessment of a security control or control enhancement in an information system.
7
 Special Publication 800-126 provides guidance on the technical specification of the SCAP. Additional details on the
SCAP initiative, as well as freely available SCAP reference data, can be found at http://nvd.nist.gov.

  OCIL is a framework for expressing security checks that cannot be evaluated without some human interaction or
feedback. It is used to determine the state of a system by presenting one or more questionnaires to its intended users.
The language includes constructs for questions, instructions for guiding users towards an answer, responses to
questions, artifacts, and evaluation results.

                                        CAUTIONARY NOTES
     Organizations should carefully consider the potential impacts of employing the assessment
     procedures defined in this Special Publication when assessing the security controls in
     operational information systems. Certain assessment procedures, particularly those procedures
     that directly impact the operation of hardware, software, or firmware components of an
     information system, may inadvertently affect the routine processing, transmission, or storage of
     information supporting organizational missions or business functions. For example, a critical
     information system component may be taken offline for assessment purposes or a component
     may suffer a fault or failure during the assessment process. Organizations should also take
     necessary precautions during security assessment periods to ensure that organizational missions
     and business functions continue to be supported by the information system and that any potential
     impacts to operational effectiveness resulting from the assessment are considered in advance.

CHAPTER ONE

INTRODUCTION
THE NEED TO ASSESS SECURITY CONTROL EFFECTIVENESS IN INFORMATION SYSTEMS




T       oday’s information systems9 are complex assemblages of technology (i.e., hardware,
        software, and firmware), processes, and people, working together to provide organizations
        with the capability to process, store, and transmit information in a timely manner to
support various missions and business functions. The degree to which organizations have come
to depend upon these information systems to conduct routine, important, and critical missions and
business functions means that the protection of the underlying systems is paramount to the
success of the organization. The selection of appropriate security controls for an information
system is an important task that can have major implications on the operations and assets of an
organization as well as the welfare of individuals.10 Security controls are the management,
operational, and technical safeguards or countermeasures prescribed for an information system to
protect the confidentiality, integrity (including non-repudiation and authenticity), and availability
of the system and its information. Once employed within an information system, security
controls are assessed to provide the information necessary to determine their overall
effectiveness; that is, the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as
intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements
for the system. Understanding the overall effectiveness of the security controls implemented in
the information system and its environment of operation is essential in determining the risk to the
organization’s operations and assets, to individuals, to other organizations, and to the Nation
resulting from the use of the system.

1.1 PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY
The purpose of this publication is to provide guidelines for building effective security assessment
plans and a comprehensive set of procedures for assessing the effectiveness of security controls
employed in information systems supporting the executive agencies of the federal government.
The guidelines apply to the security controls defined in Special Publication 800-53 (as amended),
Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations. The
guidelines have been developed to help achieve more secure information systems within the
federal government by:
•    Enabling more consistent, comparable, and repeatable assessments of security controls with
     reproducible results;
•    Facilitating more cost-effective assessments of security controls contributing to the
     determination of overall control effectiveness;
•    Promoting a better understanding of the risks to organizational operations, organizational
     assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation resulting from the operation and use
     of federal information systems; and


9
 An information system is a discrete set of information resources organized expressly for the collection, processing,
maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of information.
10
  When selecting security controls for an information system, the organization also considers potential impacts to other
organizations and, in accordance with the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 and Homeland Security Presidential Directives,
potential national-level impacts.



CHAPTER 1                                                                                                        PAGE 1
Special Publication 800-53A                                                 Guide for Assessing the Security Controls in
                                                                          Federal Information Systems and Organizations
________________________________________________________________________________________________

•    Creating more complete, reliable, and trustworthy information for organizational officials to
     support risk management decisions, reciprocity of assessment results, information sharing,
     and FISMA compliance.

This publication satisfies the requirements of the Federal Information Security Management Act
(FISMA) and meets or exceeds the information security requirements established for executive
agencies11 by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in Circular A-130, Appendix III,
Security of Federal Automated Information Resources. The guidelines in this publication are
applicable to all federal information systems other than those systems designated as national
security systems as defined in 44 U.S.C., Section 3542. The guidelines have been broadly
developed from a technical perspective to complement similar guidelines for national security
systems and may be used for such systems with the approval of appropriate federal officials
exercising policy authority over such systems. State, local, and tribal governments, as well as
private sector organizations are encouraged to consider using these guidelines, as appropriate.12

Organizations use this publication in conjunction with an approved security plan in developing a
viable security assessment plan for producing and compiling the information necessary to
determine the effectiveness of the security controls employed in the information system. This
publication has been developed with the intention of enabling organizations to tailor and
supplement the basic assessment procedures provided. The assessment procedures are used as a
starting point for and as input to the security assessment plan. In developing effective security
assessment plans, organizations take into consideration existing information about the security
controls to be assessed (e.g., results from organizational assessments of risk, platform-specific
dependencies in the hardware, software, or firmware, and any assessment procedures needed as a
result of organization-specific controls not included in Special Publication 800-53).13

The selection of appropriate assessment procedures and the rigor, intensity, and scope of the
assessment depend on three factors:
•    The security categorization of the information system;14
•    The assurance requirements that the organization intends to meet in determining the overall
     effectiveness of the security controls; and


11
   An executive agency is: (i) an executive department specified in 5 U.S.C., Section 101; (ii) a military department
specified in 5 U.S.C., Section 102; (iii) an independent establishment as defined in 5 U.S.C., Section 104(1); and (iv) a
wholly owned government corporation fully subject to the provisions of 31 U.S.C., Chapter 91. In this publication, the
term executive agency is synonymous with the term federal agency.
12
   In accordance with the provisions of FISMA and OMB policy, whenever the interconnection of federal information
systems to information systems operated by state/local/tribal governments, contractors, or grantees involves the
processing, storage, or transmission of federal information, the information security standards and guidelines described
in this publication apply. Specific information security requirements and the terms and conditions of the system
interconnections, are expressed in the Memorandums of Understanding and Interconnection Security Agreements
established by participating organizations.
13
   For example, detailed test scripts may need to be developed for the specific operating system, network component,
middleware, or application employed within the information system to adequately assess certain characteristics of a
particular security control. Such test scripts are at a lower level of detail than provided by the assessment procedures
contained in Appendix F (Assessment Procedures Catalog) and are therefore beyond the scope of this publication.
Additional details for assessments are provided in the supporting assessment cases described in Appendix H.
14
  For national security systems, security categorization is accomplished in accordance with CNSS Instruction 1253.
For other than national security systems, security categorization is accomplished in accordance with FIPS 199 and
Special Publication 800-60.

                                                                           Federal Information Systems and Organizations

•    The selection of security controls from Special Publication 800-53 as identified in the
     approved security plan.15

The assessment process is an information-gathering activity, not a security-producing activity.
Organizations determine the most cost-effective implementation of this key element in the
organization’s information security program by applying the results of risk assessments,
considering the maturity and quality level of the organization’s risk management processes, and
taking advantage of the flexibility in the concepts described in this publication. The use of
Special Publication 800-53A as a starting point in the process of defining procedures for
assessing the security controls in information systems and organizations, promotes a consistent
level of security and offers the needed flexibility to customize the assessment based on
organizational policies and requirements, known threat and vulnerability information, operational
considerations, information system and platform dependencies, and tolerance for risk.16 The
information produced during security control assessments can be used by an organization to:
•    Identify potential problems or shortfalls in the organization’s implementation of the Risk
     Management Framework;
•    Identify information system weaknesses and deficiencies;
•    Prioritize risk mitigation decisions and associated risk mitigation activities;
•    Confirm that identified weaknesses and deficiencies in the information system have been
     addressed;
•    Support continuous monitoring activities and information security situational awareness;
•    Facilitate security authorization decisions; and
•    Inform budgetary decisions and the capital investment process.

Organizations are not expected to employ all of the assessment methods and assessment objects
contained within the assessment procedures identified in this publication for the associated
security controls deployed within or inherited by organizational information systems. Rather,
organizations have the inherent flexibility to determine the level of effort needed for a particular
assessment (e.g., which assessment methods and assessment objects are deemed to be the most
useful in obtaining the desired results). This determination is made on the basis of what will
accomplish the assessment objectives in the most cost-effective manner and with sufficient
confidence to support the subsequent determination of the resulting mission or business risk.

1.2 TARGET AUDIENCE
This publication is intended to serve a diverse group of information system and information
security professionals including:
•    Individuals with information system development and integration responsibilities (e.g.,
     program managers, information technology product developers, information system
     developers, systems integrators, information security architects);

15
   The security controls for the information system are documented in the security plan after the initial selection,
tailoring, and supplementation of the controls as described in NIST Special Publication 800-53 and CNSS Instruction
1253. The security plan is approved by the authorizing official with recommendations from other appropriate
organizational officials prior to the start of the security control assessment.
16
  In this publication, the term risk is used to mean risk to organizational operations (i.e., mission, functions, image, and
reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.

•    Individuals with information security assessment and continuous monitoring responsibilities
     (e.g., system evaluators/testers, penetration testers, security control assessors, independent
     verifiers and validators, auditors, information system owners, common control providers);
•    Individuals with information system and security management and oversight responsibilities
     (e.g., authorizing officials, senior information security officers,17 information security
     managers); and
•    Individuals with information security implementation and operational responsibilities (e.g.,
     information system owners, common control providers, information owners/stewards,
     mission owners, systems administrators, information system security officers).

1.3 RELATED PUBLICATIONS AND ASSESSMENT PROCESSES
Special Publication 800-53A is designed to support Special Publication 800-37, Guide for
Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems: A Security Life
Cycle Approach. In particular, the assessment procedures contained in this publication and the
guidelines provided for developing security assessment plans for organizational information
systems directly support the security control assessment and continuous monitoring activities that
are integral to the risk management process. This includes providing near real-time information
to organizational officials regarding the ongoing security state of their information systems.

Organizations are encouraged, whenever possible, to take advantage of the assessment results and
associated assessment-related documentation and evidence available on information system
components from previous assessments including independent third-party testing, evaluation, and
validation.18 Product testing, evaluation, and validation may be conducted on cryptographic
modules and general-purpose information technology products such as operating systems,
database systems, firewalls, intrusion detection devices, Web browsers, Web applications, smart
cards, biometrics devices, personal identity verification devices, network devices, and hardware
platforms using national and international standards. If an information system component
product is identified as providing support for the implementation of a particular security control
in Special Publication 800-53, then evidence produced during the product testing, evaluation, and
validation processes (e.g., security specifications, analyses and test results, validation reports, and
validation certificates)19 is used to the extent that it is applicable. This evidence is combined with
the assessment-related evidence obtained from the application of the assessment procedures in
this publication, to cost-effectively produce the information necessary to determine whether the
security controls are effective in their application.


17
   At the agency level, this position is known as the Senior Agency Information Security Officer. Organizations may
also refer to this position as the Chief Information Security Officer.
18
  Assessment results can be obtained from many activities that occur routinely during the system development life
cycle. For example, assessment results are produced during the testing and evaluation of new information system
components during system upgrades or system integration activities. Organizations can take advantage of previous
assessment results whenever possible, to reduce the overall cost of assessments and to make the assessment process
more efficient.
19
   Organizations review the available information from component information technology products to determine: (i)
what security controls are implemented by the product; (ii) if those security controls meet the intended control
requirements of the information system under assessment; (iii) if the configuration of the product and the environment
in which the product operates are consistent with the environmental and product configuration stated by the vendor
and/or developer; and (iv) if the assurance requirements stated in the developer/vendor specification satisfy the
assurance requirements for assessing those controls. Meeting the above criteria provides a sound rationale that the
product is suitable and meets the intended security control requirements of the information system under assessment.

CHAPTER TWO

THE FUNDAMENTALS
BASIC CONCEPTS ASSOCIATED WITH SECURITY CONTROL ASSESSMENTS




T      his chapter describes the basic concepts associated with assessing the security controls in
       organizational information systems including: (i) the integration of assessments into the
       system development life cycle; (ii) the importance of an organization-wide strategy for
conducting security control assessments; (iii) the development of effective assurance cases to help
increase the grounds for confidence in the effectiveness of the security controls; and (iv) the
format and content of assessment procedures.

2.1 ASSESSMENTS WITHIN THE SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE
Security assessments can be effectively carried out at various stages in the system development
life cycle20 to increase the grounds for confidence that the security controls employed within or
inherited by an information system are effective in their application. This publication provides a
comprehensive set of assessment procedures to support security assessment activities throughout
the system development life cycle. For example, security assessments are routinely conducted by
information system developers and system integrators during the development/acquisition and
implementation phases of the life cycle to help ensure that the required security controls for the
system are properly designed and developed, correctly implemented, and consistent with the
established organizational information security architecture. Assessment activities in the initial
system development life cycle phases include, for example, design and code reviews, application
scanning, and regression testing. Security weaknesses and deficiencies identified early in the
system development life cycle can be resolved more quickly and in a much more cost-effective
manner before proceeding to subsequent phases in the life cycle. The objective is to identify the
information security architecture and security controls up front and to ensure that the system
design and testing validate the implementation of these controls. The assessment procedures
described in Appendix F can support these types of assessments carried out during the initial
stages of the system development life cycle.

Security assessments are also routinely conducted by information system owners, common
control providers, information system security officers, independent assessors, auditors, and
Inspectors General during the operations and maintenance phase of the life cycle to ensure that
security controls are effective and continue to be effective in the operational environment where
the system is deployed. For example, organizations assess all security controls employed within
and inherited by the information system during the initial security authorization. Subsequent to
the initial authorization, the organization assesses the security controls (including management,
operational, and technical controls) on an ongoing basis. The frequency of such monitoring is
based on the continuous monitoring strategy developed by the information system owner or
common control provider and approved by the authorizing official.21 Finally, at the end of the life
cycle, security assessments are conducted as part of ensuring that important organizational
information is purged from the information system prior to disposal.


20
   There are typically five phases in a generic system development life cycle: (i) initiation; (ii) development/acquisition;
(iii) implementation; (iv) operations and maintenance; and (v) disposition (disposal).
21
     Special Publication 800-37 provides guidance on the continuous monitoring of security controls.

2.2 STRATEGY FOR CONDUCTING SECURITY CONTROL ASSESSMENTS
Organizations are encouraged to develop a broad-based, organization-wide strategy for
conducting security assessments, facilitating more cost-effective and consistent assessments
across the inventory of information systems. An organization-wide strategy begins by applying
the initial steps of the Risk Management Framework to all information systems within the
organization, with an organizational view of the security categorization process and the security
control selection process (including the identification of common controls). Categorizing
information systems as an organization-wide activity taking into consideration the enterprise
architecture and the information security architecture helps to ensure that the individual systems
are categorized based on the mission and business objectives of the organization. Maximizing the
number of common controls employed within an organization: (i) significantly reduces the cost of
development, implementation, and assessment of security controls; (ii) allows organizations to
centralize security control assessments and to amortize the cost of those assessments across all
information systems organization-wide; and (iii) increases overall security control consistency.
An organization-wide approach to identifying common controls early in the application of the
RMF facilitates a more global strategy for assessing those controls and sharing essential
assessment results with information system owners and authorizing officials. The sharing of
assessment results among key organizational officials across information system boundaries has
many important benefits including:
•   Providing the capability to review assessment results for all information systems and to make
    organization-wide, mission/business-related decisions on risk mitigation activities according
    to organizational priorities, the security categorization of the information systems supporting
    the organization, and risk assessments;
•   Providing a more global view of systemic weaknesses and deficiencies occurring in
    information systems across the organization;
•   Providing an opportunity to develop organization-wide solutions to information security
    problems; and
•   Increasing the organization’s knowledge base regarding threats, vulnerabilities, and strategies
    for more cost-effective solutions to common information security problems.

Organizations can also promote a more focused and cost-effective assessment process by: (i)
developing more specific assessment procedures that are tailored for their specific organizational
environments of operation and requirements (instead of relegating these tasks to each security
control assessor or assessment team); and (ii) providing organization-wide tools, templates, and
techniques to support more consistent assessments throughout the organization.

While the conduct of security control assessments is the primary responsibility of information
system owners and common control providers with oversight by their respective authorizing
officials, there is also significant involvement in the assessment process by other parties within
the organization who have a vested interest in the outcome of assessments. Other interested
parties include, for example, mission/business owners, information owners/stewards (when those
roles are filled by someone other than the information system owner), information security
officials, and the risk executive (function). It is imperative that information system owners and
common control providers coordinate with the other parties in the organization having an interest
in security control assessments to help ensure that the organization’s core missions and business
functions are adequately addressed in the selection of security controls to be assessed.

2.3 BUILDING AN EFFECTIVE ASSURANCE CASE
Building an effective assurance case22 for security control effectiveness is a process that involves:
(i) compiling evidence from a variety of activities conducted during the system development life
cycle that the controls employed in the information system are implemented correctly, operating
as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements
of the system; and (ii) presenting this evidence in a manner that decision makers are able to use
effectively in making risk-based decisions about the operation or use of the system. The evidence
described above comes from the implementation of the security controls in the information
system and inherited by the system (i.e., common controls) and from the assessments of that
implementation. Ideally, the assessor is building on previously developed materials that started
with the specification of the organization’s information security needs and was further developed
during the design, development, and implementation of the information system. These materials,
developed while implementing security throughout the life cycle of the information system,
provide the initial evidence for an assurance case.

Assessors obtain the required evidence during the assessment process to allow the appropriate
organizational officials to make objective determinations about the effectiveness of the security
controls and the overall security state of the information system. The assessment evidence
needed to make such determinations can be obtained from a variety of sources including, but not
limited to, information technology product and system assessments. Product assessments (also
known as product testing, evaluation, and validation) are typically conducted by independent,
third-party testing organizations. These assessments examine the security functions of products
and established configuration settings. Assessments can be conducted against industry, national,
or international information security standards as well as developer/vendor claims. Since many
information technology products are assessed by commercial testing organizations and then
subsequently deployed in millions of information systems, these types of assessments can be
carried out at a greater level of depth and provide deeper insights into the security capabilities of
the particular products.

System assessments are typically conducted by information systems developers, systems
integrators, information system owners, common control providers, assessors, auditors, Inspectors
General, and the information security staffs of organizations. The assessors or assessment teams
bring together available information about the information system such as the results from
individual component product assessments, if available, and conduct additional system-level
assessments using a variety of methods and techniques. System assessments are used to compile
and evaluate the evidence needed by organizational officials to determine how effective the
security controls employed in the information system are likely to be in mitigating risks to
organizational operations and assets, to individuals, to other organizations, and to the Nation.
The results from assessments conducted using information system-specific and organization-
specific assessment procedures derived from the guidelines in this publication contribute to
compiling the necessary evidence to determine security control effectiveness in accordance with
the assurance requirements documented in the security plan.




22
   An assurance case is a body of evidence organized into an argument demonstrating that some claim about an
information system holds (i.e., is assured). An assurance case is needed when it is important to show that a system
exhibits some complex property such as safety, security, or reliability. Additional information can be obtained at

2.4 ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES
An assessment procedure consists of a set of assessment objectives, each with an associated set of
potential assessment methods and assessment objects. An assessment objective includes a set of
determination statements related to the security control under assessment. The determination
statements are linked to the content of the security control (i.e., the security control functionality)
to ensure traceability of assessment results back to the fundamental control requirements. The
application of an assessment procedure to a security control produces assessment findings. These
assessment findings reflect, or are subsequently used, to help determine the overall effectiveness
of the security control.

Assessment objects identify the specific items being assessed and include specifications,
mechanisms, activities, and individuals. Specifications are the document-based artifacts (e.g.,
policies, procedures, plans, system security requirements, functional specifications, and
architectural designs) associated with an information system. Mechanisms are the specific
hardware, software, or firmware safeguards and countermeasures employed within an information
system.23 Activities are the specific protection-related pursuits or actions supporting an
information system that involve people (e.g., conducting system backup operations, monitoring
network traffic, exercising a contingency plan). Individuals, or groups of individuals, are people
applying the specifications, mechanisms, or activities described above.

Assessment methods define the nature of the assessor actions and include examine, interview, and
test. The examine method is the process of reviewing, inspecting, observing, studying, or
analyzing one or more assessment objects (i.e., specifications, mechanisms, or activities). The
purpose of the examine method is to facilitate assessor understanding, achieve clarification, or
obtain evidence. The interview method is the process of holding discussions with individuals or
groups of individuals within an organization to once again, facilitate assessor understanding,
achieve clarification, or obtain evidence. The test method is the process of exercising one or
more assessment objects (i.e., activities or mechanisms) under specified conditions to compare
actual with expected behavior. In all three assessment methods, the results are used in making
specific determinations called for in the determination statements and thereby achieving the
objectives for the assessment procedure. A complete description of assessment methods and
assessment objects is provided in Appendix D.

The assessment methods have a set of associated attributes, depth and coverage, which help
define the level of effort for the assessment. These attributes are hierarchical in nature, providing
the means to define the rigor and scope of the assessment for the increased assurances that may
be needed for some information systems. The depth attribute addresses the rigor of and level of
detail in the examination, interview, and testing processes. Values for the depth attribute include
basic, focused, and comprehensive. The coverage attribute addresses the scope or breadth of the
examination, interview, and testing processes including the number and type of specifications,
mechanisms, and activities to be examined or tested and the number and types of individuals to
be interviewed. Similar to the depth attribute, values for the coverage attribute include basic,
focused, and comprehensive. The appropriate depth and coverage attribute values for a particular
assessment method are based on the assurance requirements specified by the organization.24 As
assurance requirements increase with regard to the development, implementation, and operation

23
   Mechanisms also include physical protection devices associated with an information system (e.g., locks, keypads,
security cameras, fire protection devices, fireproof safes, etc.).
24
  For other than national security systems, organizations meet minimum assurance requirements specified in Special
Publication 800-53, Appendix E.



CHAPTER 2                                                                                                       PAGE 9

of security controls within or inherited by the information system, the rigor and scope of the
assessment activities (as reflected in the selection of assessment methods and objects and the
assignment of depth and coverage attribute values), tend to increase as well. Appendix D
provides a detailed description of assessment method attributes and attribute values.

While flexibility continues to be an important factor in developing security assessment plans,
consistency of assessments is also an important consideration. A major design objective for
Special Publication 800-53A is to provide an assessment framework and initial starting point for
assessment procedures that are essential for achieving such consistency. In addition to the
assessment framework and initial starting point for assessment procedures, Appendix H describes
the Assessment Case Development Project. The purpose of this project is fourfold: (i) to actively
engage experienced assessors in the development of a representative set of assessment cases
corresponding to the assessment procedures in Appendix F; (ii) to provide organizations and the
assessors supporting those organizations with an exemplary set of assessment cases for each
assessment procedure in the catalog of procedures in Appendix F; (iii) to provide a vehicle for
ongoing community-wide review of the assessment cases to promote continuous improvement in
the assessment process for more consistent, cost-effective security assessments of federal
information systems; and (iv) to serve as a basis of reciprocity among various communities of
interest. Appendix H contains several examples of assessment cases.

 CP-2             CONTINGENCY PLAN

 Supplemental     Contingency planning for information systems is part of an overall organizational
 Guidance:
                  program for achieving continuity of operations for mission/business operations.
                  Contingency planning addresses both information system restoration and implementation
                  of alternative mission/business processes when systems are compromised. Information
                  system recovery objectives are consistent with applicable laws, Executive Orders,
                  directives, policies, standards, or regulations. In addition to information system
                  availability, contingency plans also address other security-related events resulting in a
                  reduction in mission/business effectiveness, such as malicious attacks compromising the
                  confidentiality or integrity of the information system. Examples of actions to call out in
                  contingency plans include, for example, graceful degradation, information system
                  shutdown, fall back to a manual mode, alternate information flows, or operating in a
                  mode that is reserved solely for when the system is under attack. Related controls: AC-
                  14, CP-6, CP-7, CP-8, IR-4, PM-8, PM-11.


The first assessment objective for CP-2 is derived from the basic control statement. Potential
assessment methods and objects are added to the assessment procedure.

                           information system disruption, compromise, or failure; and
                       - addresses eventual, full information system restoration without deterioration of
                           the security measures originally planned and implemented; and
                       - is reviewed and approved by designated officials within the organization;
                 (ii) the organization defines key contingency personnel (identified by name and/or by
                       role) and organizational elements designated to receive copies of the contingency
                       plan; and
                 (iii) the organization distributes copies of the contingency plan to organization-defined
                       key contingency personnel and organizational elements.
                 POTENTIAL ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS:

                 (i) the organization coordinates contingency planning activities with incident handling
                       activities:
                 (ii) the organization defines the frequency of contingency plan reviews;
                 (iii) the organization reviews the contingency plan for the information system in
                       accordance with the organization-defined frequency;
                 (iv) the organization revises the contingency plan to address changes to the
                       organization, information system, or environment of operation and problems
                       encountered during contingency plan implementation, execution or testing; and
                 (v) the organization communicates contingency plan changes to the key contingency
                       personnel and organizational elements as identified in CP-2.1 (ii).
                 POTENTIAL ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS:
                 Examine: [SELECT FROM: Contingency planning policy; procedures addressing contingency operations
                          for the information system; contingency plan; security plan; other relevant documents or

                            responsibilities].



The assessment objectives within a particular assessment procedure are numbered sequentially
(e.g., CP-2.1,…, CP-2.n). If the security control has any enhancements, assessment objectives are
developed for each enhancement using the same process as for the base control. The resulting
assessment objectives within the assessment procedure are numbered sequentially (e.g., CP-2(1).1
indicating the first assessment objective for the first enhancement for security control CP-2).

CHAPTER THREE

THE PROCESS
CONDUCTING EFFECTIVE SECURITY CONTROL ASSESSMENTS




T       his chapter describes the process of assessing the security controls in organizational
        information systems including: (i) the activities carried out by organizations and assessors
        to prepare for security control assessments; (ii) the development of security assessment
plans; (iii) the conduct of security control assessments and the analysis, documentation, and
reporting of assessment results; and (iv) post-assessment report analysis and follow-on activities
carried out by organizations.

3.1 PREPARING FOR SECURITY CONTROL ASSESSMENTS
Conducting security control assessments in today’s complex environment of sophisticated
information technology infrastructures and high-visibility, mission-critical applications can be
difficult, challenging, and resource-intensive. Success requires the cooperation and collaboration
among all parties having a vested interest in the organization’s information security posture,
including information system owners, common control providers, authorizing officials, chief
information officers, senior information security officers, chief executive officers/heads of
agencies, Inspectors General, and the OMB. Establishing an appropriate set of expectations
before, during, and after the assessment is paramount to achieving an acceptable outcome—that
is, producing information necessary to help the authorizing official make a credible, risk-based
decision on whether to place the information system into operation or continue its operation.

Thorough preparation by the organization and the assessors is an important aspect of conducting
effective security control assessments. Preparatory activities address a range of issues relating to
the cost, schedule, and performance of the assessment. From the organizational perspective,
preparing for a security control assessment includes the following key activities:
•    Ensuring that appropriate policies covering security control assessments are in place and
     understood by all affected organizational elements;
•    Ensuring that all steps in the RMF prior to the security control assessment step, have been
     successfully completed and received appropriate management oversight;26
•    Ensuring that security controls identified as common controls (and the common portion of
     hybrid controls) have been assigned to appropriate organizational entities (i.e., common
     control providers) for development and implementation;27
•    Establishing the objective and scope of the security control assessment (i.e., the purpose of
     the assessment and what is being assessed);

26
  Conducting security control assessments in parallel with the development/acquisition and implementation phases of
the life cycle permits the identification of weaknesses and deficiencies early and provides the most cost-effective
method for initiating corrective actions. Issues found during these assessments can be referred to authorizing officials
for early resolution, as appropriate. The results of security control assessments carried out during system development
and implementation can also be used (consistent with reuse criteria) during the security authorization process to avoid
system fielding delays or costly repetition of assessments.
27
  Security control assessments include common controls that are the responsibility of organizational entities other than
the information system owner inheriting the controls or hybrid controls where there is shared responsibility among the
system owner and designated organizational entities.

                                                                         Federal Information Systems and Organizations
________________________________________________________________________________________________

•    Notifying key organizational officials of the impending security control assessment and
     allocating necessary resources to carry out the assessment;
•    Establishing appropriate communication channels among organizational officials having an
     interest in the security control assessment;28
•    Establishing time frames for completing the security control assessment and key milestone
     decision points required by the organization to effectively manage the assessment;
•    Identifying and selecting a competent assessor/assessment team that will be responsible for
     conducting the security control assessment, considering issues of assessor independence;
•    Collecting artifacts to provide to the assessor/assessment team (e.g., policies, procedures,
     plans, specifications, designs, records, administrator/operator manuals, information system
     documentation, interconnection agreements, previous assessment results); and
•    Establishing a mechanism between the organization and the assessor and/or assessment team
     to minimize ambiguities or misunderstandings about security control implementation or
     security control weaknesses/deficiencies identified during the assessment.

Security control assessors/assessment teams begin preparing for the assessment by:
•    Obtaining a general understanding of the organization’s operations (including mission,
     functions, and business processes) and how the information system that is the subject of the
     security control assessment supports those organizational operations;
•    Obtaining an understanding of the structure of the information system (i.e., system
     architecture);
•    Obtaining a thorough understanding of the security controls being assessed (including
     system-specific, hybrid, and common controls);
•    Identifying the organizational entities responsible for the development and implementation of
     the common controls (or the common portion of hybrid controls) supporting the information
     system;
•    Establishing appropriate organizational points of contact needed to carry out the security
     control assessment;
•    Obtaining artifacts needed for the security control assessment (e.g., policies, procedures,
     plans, specifications, designs, records, administrator/operator manuals, information system
     documentation, interconnection agreements, previous assessment results);
•    Obtaining previous assessment results that may be appropriately reused for the security
     control assessment (e.g., Inspector General reports, audits, vulnerability scans, physical
     security inspections, prior assessments, developmental testing and evaluation, vendor flaw
     remediation activities , ISO/IEC 15408 [Common Criteria] evaluations);
•    Meeting with appropriate organizational officials to ensure common understanding for
     assessment objectives and the proposed rigor and scope of the assessment; and
•    Developing a security assessment plan.

28
   Typically, these individuals include authorizing officials, information system owners, common control providers,
mission and information owners/stewards (if other than the information system owner), chief information officers,
senior information security officers, Inspectors General, information system security officers, users from organizations
that the information system supports, and assessors.

________________________________________________________________________________________________

In preparation for the assessment of security controls, the necessary background information is
assembled and made available to the assessors or assessment team.29 To the extent necessary to
support the specific assessment, the organization identifies and arranges access to: (i) elements of
the organization responsible for developing, documenting, disseminating, reviewing, and
updating all security policies and associated procedures for implementing policy-compliant
controls; (ii) the security policies for the information system and any associated implementing
procedures; (iii) individuals or groups responsible for the development, implementation,
operation, and maintenance of security controls; (iv) any materials (e.g., security plans, records,
schedules, assessment reports, after-action reports, agreements, authorization packages)
associated with the implementation and operation of security controls; and (v) the objects to be
assessed.30 The availability of essential documentation as well as access to key organizational
personnel and the information system being assessed are paramount to a successful assessment of
the security controls.

Organizations consider both the technical expertise and level of independence required in
selecting security control assessors. Organizations ensure that security control assessors possess
the required skills and technical expertise to successfully carry out assessments of system-
specific, hybrid, and common controls. This includes knowledge of and experience with the
specific hardware, software, and firmware components employed by the organization. An
independent assessor is any individual or group capable of conducting an impartial assessment of
security controls employed within or inherited by an information system. Impartiality implies
that assessors are free from any perceived or actual conflicts of interest with respect to the
development, operation, and/or management of the information system or the determination of
security control effectiveness.31 The authorizing official or designated representative determines
the required level of independence for security control assessors based on the results of the
security categorization process for the information system and the ultimate risk to organizational
operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. The authorizing official
determines if the level of assessor independence is sufficient to provide confidence that the
assessment results produced are sound and can be used to make a risk-based decision on whether
to place the information system into operation or continue its operation. Independent security
control assessment services can be obtained from other elements within the organization or can be
contracted to a public or private sector entity outside of the organization. In special situations, for
example when the organization that owns the information system is small or the organizational
structure requires that the security control assessment be accomplished by individuals that are in
the developmental, operational, and/or management chain of the system owner, independence in
the assessment process can be achieved by ensuring that the assessment results are carefully
reviewed and analyzed by an independent team of experts to validate the completeness,
consistency, and veracity of the results.32

29
  Information system owners and organizational entities developing, implementing, and/or administering common
controls (i.e., common control providers) are responsible for providing needed information to assessors.
30
   In situations where there are multiple security assessments ongoing or planned within an organization, access to
organizational elements, individuals, and artifacts supporting the assessments is centrally managed by the organization
to ensure a cost-effective use of time and resources.
31
   Contracted assessment services are considered independent if the information system owner is not directly involved
in the contracting process or cannot unduly influence the independence of the assessor(s) conducting the assessment of
the security controls.
32
  The authorizing official consults with the Office of the Inspector General, the senior information security officer, and
the chief information officer to discuss the implications of any decisions on assessor independence in the types of
special circumstances described above.

3.2 DEVELOPING SECURITY ASSESSMENT PLANS
The security assessment plan provides the objectives for the security control assessment and a
detailed roadmap of how to conduct such an assessment. The following steps are considered by
assessors in developing plans to assess the security controls in organizational information systems
or inherited by those systems:
•      Determine which security controls/control enhancements are to be included in the assessment
       based upon the contents of the security plan and the purpose/scope of the assessment;
•      Select the appropriate assessment procedures to be used during the assessment based on the
       security controls and control enhancements that are to be included in the assessment;
•      Tailor the selected assessment procedures (e.g., select appropriate assessment methods and
       objects, assign depth and coverage attribute values);
•      Develop additional assessment procedures to address any security requirements or controls
       that are not sufficiently covered by Special Publication 800-53;
•      Optimize the assessment procedures to reduce duplication of effort (e.g., sequencing and
       consolidating assessment procedures) and provide cost-effective assessment solutions; and
•      Finalize the assessment plan and obtain the necessary approvals to execute the plan.

3.2.1 Determine which security controls are to be assessed.
The security plan provides an overview of the security requirements for the information system
and describes the security controls in place or planned for meeting those requirements. The
assessor starts with the security controls described in the security plan and considers the purpose
of the assessment. A security control assessment can be a complete assessment of all security
controls in the information system or inherited by the system (e.g., during an initial security
authorization process) or a partial assessment of the security controls in the information system
or inherited by the system (e.g., during system development, during continuous monitoring where
controls are assessed on an ongoing basis and as a result of changes affecting the controls, or
where controls were previously assessed and the results accepted in the reciprocity process).33

For partial assessments, information system owners and common control providers collaborate
with organizational officials having an interest in the assessment (e.g., senior information security
officers, mission/information owners, Inspectors General, and authorizing officials) to determine
which security controls are to be assessed. The selection of the security controls depends on the
continuous monitoring strategy established by the information system owner or common control
provider to ensure that: (i) all controls are assessed during the authorization period established by
federal legislation, policies, directives, standards, and guidelines; (ii) items on the plan of action
and milestones receive adequate oversight; (iii) controls with greater volatility or importance to
the organization are assessed more frequently; and (iv) control implementations that have
changed since the last assessment are reevaluated.34




33
   Partial assessments of security controls can be conducted in the initial phases of system development life cycle to
promote early detection of weakness and deficiencies and a more cost-effective approach to risk mitigation.
34
     Special Publication 800-37 provides guidance on continuous monitoring as part of the risk management process.



CHAPTER 3                                                                                                         PAGE 16

________________________________________________________________________________________________

3.2.2 Select appropriate procedures to assess the security controls.
Special Publication 800-53A, Appendix F, provides an assessment procedure for each security
control and control enhancement in Special Publication 800-53. For each security control and
control enhancement in the security plan to be included in the assessment, assessors select the
corresponding assessment procedure from Appendix F. The selected assessment procedures vary
from assessment to assessment based on the current content of the security plan and the purpose
of the security assessment (e.g., complete security control assessment, partial security control
assessment).

3.2.3 Tailor assessment procedures.
In a similar manner to how the security controls from Special Publication 800-53 are tailored for
the organization’s mission, business functions, characteristics of the information system and
operating environment, organizations tailor the assessment procedures listed in Appendix F to
meet specific organizational needs. Organizations have the flexibility to perform the tailoring
process at the organization level for all information systems, at the individual information system
level, or using a combination of organization-level and system-specific approaches. Security
control assessors determine if the organization provides additional tailoring guidance prior to
initiating the tailoring process. Assessment procedures are tailored by:
•   Selecting the appropriate assessment methods and objects needed to satisfy the stated
    assessment objectives;
•   Selecting the appropriate depth and coverage attribute values to define the rigor and scope of
    the assessment;
•   Identifying common controls that have been assessed by a separately-documented security
    assessment plan, and do not require the repeated execution of the assessment procedures;
•   Developing information system/platform-specific and organization-specific assessment
    procedures (which may be adaptations to those procedures in Appendix F);
•   Incorporating assessment results from previous assessments where the results are deemed
    applicable; and
•   Making appropriate adjustments in assessment procedures to be able to obtain the requisite
    assessment evidence from external providers.

Assessment method and object-related considerations—
It is recognized that organizations can specify, document, and configure their information systems
in a variety of ways and that the content and applicability of existing assessment evidence will
vary. This may result in the need to apply a variety of assessment methods to various assessment
objects to generate the assessment evidence needed to determine whether the security controls are
effective in their application. Therefore, the assessment methods and objects provided with each
assessment procedure are termed potential to reflect the need to be able to choose the methods
and objects most appropriate for a specific assessment. The assessment methods and objects
chosen are those deemed as necessary to produce the evidence needed to make the determinations
described in the determination statements. The potential methods and objects in the assessment
procedure are provided as a resource to assist in the selection of appropriate methods and objects,
and not with the intent to limit the selection. Organizations use their judgment in selecting from
the potential assessment methods and the list of assessment objects associated with each selected
method. Organizations select those methods and objects that most cost-effectively contribute to



CHAPTER 3                                                                                         PAGE 17

                                                                           Federal Information Systems and Organizations
________________________________________________________________________________________________

making the determinations associated with the assessment objective.35 The measure of the quality
of assessment results is based on the soundness of the rationale provided, not the specific set of
methods and objects applied. It will not be necessary, in most cases, to apply every assessment
method to every assessment object to obtain the desired assessment results. And for certain
assessments, it may be appropriate to employ a method not currently listed in the set of potential
methods.

Depth and coverage-related considerations—
In addition to selecting appropriate assessment methods and objects, each assessment method
(i.e., examine, interview, and test) is associated with depth and coverage attributes that are
described in Appendix D. The attribute values identify the rigor and scope of the assessment
procedures executed by the assessor. The values selected by the organization are based on the
characteristics of the information system being assessed (including assurance requirements) and
the specific determinations to be made. The depth and coverage attribute values are associated
with the assurance requirements specified by the organization (i.e., the rigor and scope of the
assessment increases in direct relationship to the assurance requirements).

Common control-related considerations—
Assessors note which security controls (or parts of security controls) in the security plan are
designated as common controls.36 Since the assessment of common controls is the responsibility
of the organizational entity that developed and implemented the controls (i.e., common control
provider), the assessment procedures in Appendix F used to assess these controls incorporate
assessment results from that organizational entity. Common controls may have been previously
assessed as part of the organization’s information security program or as part of an information
system providing common controls inherited by other organizational systems. There may also be
a separate plan to assess the common controls. In either situation, information system owners
coordinate the assessment of common controls with appropriate organizational officials (e.g.,
chief information officer, senior information security officer, mission/information owners,
authorizing officials) obtaining the results of common control assessments or, if the common
controls have not been assessed or are due to be reassessed, making the necessary arrangements
to include or reference the common control assessment results in the current assessment.37

Another consideration in assessing common controls is that there are occasionally system-specific
aspects of a common control that are not covered by the organizational entities responsible for the
common aspects of the control. These types of security controls are referred to as hybrid
controls. For example, CP-2, the contingency planning security control, may be deemed a hybrid
control by the organization if there is a master contingency plan developed by the organization
for all organizational information systems. Following up on the initial master contingency plan,

35
   The selection of assessment methods and objects (including the number and type of assessment objects) can be a
significant factor in cost-effectively meeting the assessment objectives.
36
   Common controls support multiple information systems within the organization and the protection measures
provided by those controls are inherited by the individual systems. Therefore, the organization determines the
appropriate set of common controls to ensure that both the strength of the controls (i.e., security capability) and level of
rigor and intensity of the control assessments are commensurate with the criticality and/or sensitivity of the individual
information systems inheriting those controls. Weaknesses or deficiencies in common controls have the potential to
adversely affect large portions of the organization and thus require significant attention.
37
  If assessment results are not currently available for the common controls, the assessment plans for the information
systems under assessment that depend on those controls are duly noted. The assessments cannot be considered
complete until the assessment results for the common controls are made available to information system owners.



CHAPTER 3                                                                                                           PAGE 18

________________________________________________________________________________________________

information system owners are expected to adjust, tailor, or supplement the contingency plan as
necessary, when there are system-specific aspects of the plan that need to be defined for the
particular system where the control is employed. For each hybrid control, assessors include in the
assessment plan, the portions of the assessment procedures from Appendix F related to the parts
of the control that are system-specific to ensure that, along with the results from common control
assessments, all aspects of the security control are assessed.

System/platform and organization-related considerations—
The assessment procedures in Special Publication 800-53A may be adapted to address
system/platform-specific or organization-specific dependencies. This situation arises frequently
in the assessment procedures associated with the security controls from the technical families in
Special Publication 800-53 (i.e., access control, audit and accountability, identification and
authentication, system and communications protection). For example, the assessment of a UNIX
implementation of the IA-2 control for identification and authentication of users might include an
explicit examination of the .rhosts file for UNIX systems since improper entries in that file can
result in bypassing user authentication. Recent test results may also be applicable to the current
assessment if those test methods provide a high degree of transparency (e.g., what was tested,
when was it tested, how was it tested). Standards-based testing protocols such as the Security
Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) provide an example of how organizations can help achieve
this level of transparency.

Reuse of assessment evidence-related considerations—
Reuse of assessment results from previously accepted or approved assessments are considered in
the body of evidence for determining overall security control effectiveness. Previously accepted
or approved assessments include: (i) those assessments of common controls that are managed by
the organization and support multiple information systems; or (ii) assessments of security controls
that are reviewed as part of the control implementation (e.g., CP-2 requires a review of the
contingency plan). The acceptability of using previous assessment results in a security control
assessment is coordinated with and approved by the users of the assessment results. It is essential
that information system owners and common control providers collaborate with authorizing
officials and other appropriate organizational officials in determining the acceptability of using
previous assessment results. When considering the reuse of previous assessment results and the
value of those results to the current assessment, assessors determine: (i) the credibility of the
assessment evidence; (ii) the appropriateness of previous analysis; and (iii) the applicability of the
assessment evidence to current information system operating conditions. If previous assessment
results are reused, the date of the original assessment and type of assessment are documented in
the security assessment plan and security assessment report. It may be necessary, in certain
situations, to supplement previous assessment results under consideration for reuse with
additional assessment activities to fully address the assessment objectives. For example, if an
independent evaluation of an information technology product did not test a particular
configuration setting that is employed by the organization in an information system, then the
assessor may need to supplement the original test results with additional testing to cover that
configuration setting for the current information system environment. The decision to reuse
assessment results is documented in the security assessment plan and the final security
assessment report and is consistent with federal legislation, policies, directives, standards, and
guidelines with respect to the security control assessments.




CHAPTER 3                                                                                          PAGE 19

                                                                          Federal Information Systems and Organizations
________________________________________________________________________________________________

The following items are considered in validating previous assessment results for reuse:

•    Changing conditions associated with security controls over time.
Security controls that were deemed effective during previous assessments may have become
ineffective due to changing conditions within the information system or its environment of
operation. Assessment results that were found to be previously acceptable may no longer provide
credible evidence for the determination of security control effectiveness, and therefore, a
reassessment would be required. Applying previous assessment results to a current assessment
necessitates the identification of any changes that have occurred since the previous assessment
and the impact of these changes on the previous results. For example, reusing previous
assessment results from examining an organization’s security policies and procedures may be
acceptable if it is determined that there have not been any significant changes to the identified
policies and procedures. Reusing assessment results produced during the previous authorization
of an information system is a cost-effective method for supporting continuous monitoring
activities and annual FISMA reporting requirements when the related controls have not changed
and there are adequate reasons for confidence in their continued application.

•    Amount of time that has transpired since previous assessments.
In general, as the time period between current and previous assessments increases, the
credibility/utility of the previous assessment results decreases. This is primarily due to the fact
that the information system or the environment in which the information system operates is more
likely to change with the passage of time, possibly invalidating the original conditions or
assumptions on which the previous assessment was based.

•    Degree of independence of previous assessments.
Assessor independence can be a critical factor in certain types of assessments. The degree of
independence required from assessment to assessment is consistent. For example, it is not
appropriate to reuse results from a previous self-assessment where no assessor independence was
required, in a current assessment requiring a greater degree of independence.

External information system-related considerations—
The assessment procedures in Appendix F need to be adjusted as appropriate to accommodate the
assessment of external information systems.38 Because the organization does not always have
direct control over the security controls used in external information systems, or sufficient
visibility into the development, implementation, and assessment of those controls, alternative
assessment approaches may need to be applied, resulting in the need to tailor the assessment
procedures described in Appendix F. Where required assurances of agreed-upon security controls
within an information system or inherited by the system are documented in contracts or service-
level agreements, assessors review these contracts or agreements and where appropriate, tailor the
assessment procedures to assess either the security controls or the security control assessment
results provided through these agreements. In addition, assessors take into account any other
assessments that have been conducted, or are in the process of being conducted, for external
information systems that are relied upon with regard to protecting the information system under

38
  An external information system is an information system or component of an information system that is outside of
the authorization boundary established by the organization and for which the organization typically has no direct
control over the application of required security controls or the assessment of security control effectiveness. Special
Publications 800-37 and 800-53 provide additional guidance on external information systems and the effect of
employing security controls in those types of environments.



CHAPTER 3                                                                                                         PAGE 20

assessment. Applicable information from these assessments, if deemed reliable, is incorporated
into the security assessment report.

3.2.4 Develop assessment procedures for organization-specific security controls.
Based on organizational policies, mission or business function requirements, and an assessment
of risk, organizations may choose to develop and implement additional (organization-specific)
security controls or control enhancements for their information systems that are beyond the scope
of Special Publication 800-53. Such security controls are documented in the security plan for the
information system as controls not found in Special Publication 800-53. To assess the security
controls in this situation, assessors use the guidelines in Chapter Two to develop assessment
procedures for those controls and control enhancements. The assessment procedures developed
are subsequently integrated into the security assessment plan.

3.2.5 Optimize selected assessment procedures to ensure maximum efficiency.
Assessors have a great deal of flexibility in organizing a security assessment plan that meets the
needs of the organization and that provides the best opportunity for obtaining the necessary
evidence to determine security control effectiveness, while reducing overall assessment costs.
Combining and consolidating assessment procedures is one area where this flexibility can be
applied. During the assessment of an information system, assessment methods are applied
numerous times to a variety of assessment objects within a particular family of security controls.
To save time, reduce assessment costs, and maximize the usefulness of assessment results,
assessors review the selected assessment procedures for the security control families and combine
or consolidate the procedures (or parts of procedures) whenever possible or practicable. For
example, assessors may wish to consolidate interviews with key organizational officials dealing
with a variety of security-related topics. Assessors may have other opportunities for significant
consolidations and cost savings by examining all security policies and procedures from the
eighteen families of security controls at the same time or organizing groups of related policies
and procedures that could be examined as a unified entity. Obtaining and examining
configuration settings from similar hardware and software components within the information
system is another example that can provide significant assessment efficiencies.

An additional area for consideration in optimizing the assessment process is the sequence in
which security controls are assessed. The assessment of some security controls before others may
provide information that facilitates understanding and assessment of other controls. For example,
security controls such as CM-2 (Baseline Configuration), CM-8 (Information System Component
Inventory), PL-2 (System Security Plan), RA-2 (Security Categorization), and RA-3 (Risk
Assessment) produce general descriptions of the information system. Assessing these security
controls early in the assessment process may provide a basic understanding of the information
system that can aid in assessing other security controls. The supplemental guidance of many
security controls also identifies related controls that can provide useful information in organizing
the assessment procedures.39 For example, AC-19 (Access Control for Portable and Mobile
Devices) lists security controls MP-4 (Media Storage) and MP-5 (Media Transport) as being
related to AC-19. Since AC-19 is related to MP-4 and MP-5, the sequence in which assessments
are conducted for AC-19, MP-4, and MP-5 may facilitate the reuse of assessment information
from one control in assessing other related controls.



39
     Security control assessment sequencing is also addressed in the assessment cases described in Appendix H.

3.2.6 Finalize security assessment plan and obtain approval to execute plan.
After selecting the assessment procedures (including developing necessary procedures not
contained in the Special Publication 800-53A catalog of procedures), tailoring the procedures for
information system/platform-specific and organization-specific conditions, optimizing the
procedures for efficiency, and addressing the potential for unexpected events impacting the
assessment, the assessment plan is finalized and the schedule is established including key
milestones for the assessment process. Once the security assessment plan is completed, the plan
is reviewed and approved by appropriate organizational officials40 to ensure that the plan is
complete, consistent with the security objectives of the organization and the organization’s
assessment of risk, and cost-effective with regard to the resources allocated for the assessment.

3.3 CONDUCTING SECURITY CONTROL ASSESSMENTS
After the security assessment plan is approved by the organization, the assessor or assessment
team executes the plan in accordance with the agreed-upon schedule. Determining the size and
organizational makeup of the security assessment team (i.e., skill sets, technical expertise, and
assessment experience of the individuals composing the team) is part of the risk management
decisions made by the organization requesting and initiating the assessment.

The output and end result of the security control assessment is the security assessment report,
which documents the assurance case for the information system and is one of three key
documents in the security authorization package developed by information system owners and
common control providers for authorizing officials.41 The security assessment report includes
information from the assessor (in the form of assessment findings) necessary to determine the
effectiveness of the security controls employed within or inherited by the information system.
The security assessment report is an important factor in an authorizing official’s determination of
risk. Organizations may choose to develop an assessment summary from the detailed findings
that are generated by the assessor during the security control assessment. An assessment
summary can provide an authorizing official with an abbreviated version a of Security Assessment
Report focusing on the highlights of the assessment, synopsis of key findings, and/or
recommendations for addressing weaknesses and deficiencies in the security controls. Appendix
G provides additional information on the recommended content of security assessment reports.

Assessment objectives are achieved by applying the designated assessment methods to selected
assessment objects and compiling/producing the evidence necessary to make the determination
associated with each assessment objective. Each determination statement contained within an
assessment procedure executed by an assessor produces one of the following findings: (i)
satisfied (S); or (ii) other than satisfied (O). A finding of satisfied indicates that for the portion of
the security control addressed by the determination statement, the assessment information
obtained (i.e., evidence collected) indicates that the assessment objective for the control has been
met producing a fully acceptable result. A finding of other than satisfied indicates that for the
portion of the security control addressed by the determination statement, the assessment
information obtained indicates potential anomalies in the operation or implementation of the
control that may need to be addressed by the organization. A finding of other than satisfied may

  Organizations establish a security assessment plan approval process with the specific organizational officials (e.g.,
information systems owners, common control providers, information system security officers, senior information
security officers, authorizing officials) designated as approving authorities.
41
   In accordance with Special Publication 800-37, the security authorization package consists of the security plan
(including the risk assessment), the security assessment report, and the plan of action and milestones (POAM).

also indicate that for reasons specified in the assessment report, the assessor was unable to obtain
sufficient information to make the particular determination called for in the determination
statement. For assessment findings that are other than satisfied, organizations may choose to
define subcategories of findings indicating the severity and/or criticality of the weaknesses or
deficiencies discovered and the potential adverse effects on organizational operations (i.e.,
mission, functions, image, or reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations,
and the Nation. Defining such subcategories can help to establish priorities for needed risk
mitigation actions.

Assessor findings are an unbiased, factual reporting of what was found concerning the security
control assessed. For each finding of other than satisfied, assessors indicate which parts of the
security control are affected by the finding (i.e., aspects of the control that were deemed not
satisfied or were not able to be assessed) and describe how the control differs from the planned or
expected state. The potential for compromises to confidentiality, integrity, and availability due to
other than satisfied findings are also noted by the assessor in the security assessment report. This
notation reflects the lack of a specified protection and the exploitation that could occur as a result
(i.e. workstation, dataset, root level access). Risk determination and acceptance activities are
conducted by the organization post assessment as part of the risk management strategy
established by the organization. These risk management activities involve the senior leadership
of the organization including for example, heads of agencies, mission/business owners,
information owners/stewards, risk executive (function), and authorizing officials, in consultation
with appropriate organizational support staff (e.g., senior information security officers, chief
information officers, information system owners, common control providers, and assessors).
Security control assessment results are documented at the level of detail appropriate for the
assessment in accordance with the reporting format prescribed by organizational policy, NIST
guidelines, and OMB policy. The reporting format is appropriate for the type of security control
assessment conducted (e.g., self-assessments by information system owners and common control
providers, independent verification and validation, independent assessments supporting the
security authorization process, or independent audits or inspections).

Information system owners and common control providers rely on the security expertise and the
technical judgment of assessors to: (i) assess the security controls in the information system and
inherited by the system; and (ii) provide recommendations on how to correct weaknesses or
deficiencies in the controls and reduce or eliminate identified vulnerabilities. The assessment
results produced by the assessor (i.e., findings of satisfied or other than satisfied, identification of
the parts of the security control that did not produce a satisfactory result, and a description of
resulting potential for compromises to the information system or its environment of operation) are
provided to information system owners and common control providers in the initial security
assessment report. System owners and common control providers may choose to act on selected
recommendations of the assessor before the security assessment report is finalized if there are
specific opportunities to correct weaknesses or deficiencies in security controls or to correct
and/or clarify misunderstandings or interpretations of assessment results.42 Security controls that

   The correction of weaknesses or deficiencies in security controls or carrying out of selected recommendations during
the review of the initial security assessment report by information system owners or common control providers is not
intended to replace the formal risk mitigation process by the organization which occurs after the delivery of the final
report. Rather, it provides the information system owner or common control provider with an opportunity to address
weaknesses or deficiencies that may be quickly corrected. However, in situations where limited resources exist for
remediating weaknesses and deficiencies discovered during the security control assessment, organizations may decide
without prejudice that waiting for the risk assessment to prioritize remediation efforts is the better course of action.

production of the final security assessment report.

3.4 ANALYZING SECURITY ASSESSMENT REPORT RESULTS
Since results of the security control assessment ultimately influence the content of the security
plan and the plan of action and milestones, information system owners and common control
providers review the security assessment report and the updated risk assessment and with the
concurrence of designated organizational officials (e.g., authorizing officials, chief information
officer, senior information security officer, mission/information owners), determine the
appropriate steps required to correct weaknesses and deficiencies identified during the
assessment. By using the labels of satisfied and other than satisfied, the reporting format for the
assessment findings provides visibility for organizational officials into specific weaknesses and
deficiencies in security controls within the information system or inherited by the system and
facilitates a disciplined and structured approach to mitigating risks in accordance with
organizational priorities. For example, information system owners or common control providers
in consultation with designated organizational officials, may decide that certain assessment
findings marked as other than satisfied are of an inconsequential nature and present no significant
risk to the organization. Conversely, system owners or common control providers may decide
that certain findings marked as other than satisfied are significant, requiring immediate
remediation actions. In all cases, the organization reviews each assessor finding of other than
satisfied and applies its judgment with regard to the severity or seriousness of the finding and
whether the finding is significant enough to be worthy of further investigation or remedial action.

Senior leadership involvement in the mitigation process may be necessary in order to ensure that
the organization’s resources are effectively allocated in accordance with organizational priorities,
providing resources first to the information systems that are supporting the most critical and
sensitive missions for the organization or correcting the deficiencies that pose the greatest degree
of risk. Ultimately, the security control assessment findings and any subsequent mitigation
actions (informed by the updated risk assessment) initiated by information system owners or
common control providers in collaboration with designated organizational officials trigger
updates to the key documents used by authorizing officials to determine the security status of the
information system and its suitability for authorization to operate. These documents include the
security plan with updated risk assessment, security assessment report, and plan of action and
milestones.

GLOSSARY
COMMON TERMS AND DEFINITIONS




T       his appendix provides definitions for security terminology used within Special Publication
        800-53A. The terms in the glossary are consistent with the terms used in the suite of
        FISMA-related security standards and guidelines developed by NIST. Unless otherwise
stated, all terms used in this publication are also consistent with the definitions contained in the
CNSS Instruction 4009, National Information Assurance Glossary.

                                      receives protection from security controls (or portions of
                                      security controls) that are developed, implemented,
                                      assessed, authorized, and monitored by entities other than
                                      those responsible for the system or application; entities
                                      either internal or external to the organization where the
                                      system or application resides. See Common Control.
 Security Controls                    The management, operational, and technical controls
 [FIPS 199, CNSSI 4009]               (i.e., safeguards or countermeasures) prescribed for an
                                      information system to protect the confidentiality,
                                      integrity, and availability of the system and its
                                      information.

 Tailoring                            The process by which a security control baseline is
 [NIST SP 800-53, CNSSI 4009]         modified based on: (i) the application of scoping
                                      guidance; (ii) the specification of compensating security
                                      controls, if needed; and (iii) the specification of
                                      organization-defined parameters in the security controls
                                      via explicit assignment and selection statements.
 Tailoring (Assessment Procedures)    The process by which assessment procedures defined in
                                      Special Publication 800-53A are adjusted, or scoped, to
                                      match the characteristics of the information system under
                                      assessment, providing organizations with the flexibility
                                      needed to meet specific organizational requirements and
                                      to avoid overly-constrained assessment approaches.
 Tailored Security Control Baseline   A set of security controls resulting from the application
                                      of tailoring guidance to the security control baseline. See
                                      Tailoring.

 [FIPS 200]                           countermeasures) for an information system that are
                                      primarily implemented and executed by the information
                                      system through mechanisms contained in the hardware,
                                      software, or firmware components of the system.
 Test                                 A type of assessment method that is characterized by the
                                      process of exercising one or more assessment objects
                                      under specified conditions to compare actual with
                                      expected behavior, the results of which are used to
                                      support the determination of security control
                                      effectiveness over time.
 Threat                               Any circumstance or event with the potential to adversely
 [CNSSI 4009]                         impact organizational operations (including mission,
                                      functions, image, or reputation), organizational assets,

                                      service.
 Threat Assessment                    Process of formally evaluating the degree of threat to an
 [CNSSI 4009]                         information system or enterprise and describing the
                                      nature of the threat.

ASSESSMENT METHOD DESCRIPTIONS
ASSESSMENT METHOD DEFINITIONS, APPLICABLE OBJECTS, AND ATTRIBUTES




T
       his appendix defines the three assessment methods that can be used by assessors during
       security control assessments: (i) examine; (ii) interview; and (iii) test. Included in the
       definition of each assessment method are types of objects to which the method can be
applied. The application of each method is described in terms of the attributes of depth and
coverage, progressing from basic to focused to comprehensive. The attribute values correlate to
the assurance requirements specified by the organization.43 The depth attribute addresses the
rigor and level of detail of the assessment. For the depth attribute, the focused attribute value
includes and builds upon the assessment rigor and level of detail defined for the basic attribute
value; the comprehensive attribute value includes and builds upon the assessment rigor and level
of detail defined for the focused attribute value. The coverage attribute addresses the scope or
breadth of the assessment. For the coverage attribute, the focused attribute value includes and
builds upon the number and type of assessment objects defined for the basic attribute value; the
comprehensive attribute value includes and builds upon the number and type of assessment
objects defined for the focused attribute value. The use of bolded text in the assessment method
description indicates the content that was added to and appears for the first time, in the
description indicating greater rigor and detail for the attribute value.

   For other than national security systems, organizations meet minimum assurance requirements specified in Special
Publication 800-53, Appendix E.

                                                                        Federal Information Systems and Organizations
________________________________________________________________________________________________

ASSESSMENT METHOD:            Examine
ASSESSMENT OBJECTS:           Specifications (e.g., policies, plans, procedures, system requirements, designs)
                              Mechanisms (e.g., functionality implemented in hardware, software, firmware)
                              Activities (e.g., system operations, administration, management; exercises)
DEFINITION: The process of checking, inspecting, reviewing, observing, studying, or analyzing one or more
assessment objects to facilitate understanding, achieve clarification, or obtain evidence, the results of which
are used to support the determination of security control existence, functionality, correctness, completeness,
and potential for improvement over time.
SUPPLEMENTAL GUIDANCE: Typical assessor actions may include, for example: reviewing information
security policies, plans, and procedures; analyzing system design documentation and interface
specifications; observing system backup operations, reviewing the results of contingency plan exercises;
observing incident response activities; studying technical manuals and user/administrator guides; checking,
studying, or observing the operation of an information technology mechanism in the information system
hardware/software; or checking, studying, or observing physical security measures related to the operation
of an information system.
ATTRIBUTES: Depth, Coverage

•   The depth attribute addresses the rigor of and level of detail in the examination process. There are
    three possible values for the depth attribute: (i) basic; (ii) focused; and (iii) comprehensive.
    -    Basic examination: Examination that consists of high-level reviews, checks, observations, or inspections of
         the assessment object. This type of examination is conducted using a limited body of evidence or
         documentation (e.g., functional-level descriptions for mechanisms; high-level process descriptions for
         activities; and actual documents for specifications). Basic examinations provide a level of understanding of
         the security control necessary for determining whether the control is implemented and free of obvious errors.
    -    Focused examination: Examination that consists of high-level reviews, checks, observations, or inspections
         and more in depth studies/analyses of the assessment object. This type of examination is conducted using a
         substantial body of evidence or documentation (e.g., functional-level descriptions and where appropriate
         and available, high-level design information for mechanisms; high-level process descriptions and
         implementation procedures for activities; and the actual documents and related documents for
         specifications). Focused examinations provide a level of understanding of the security control necessary for
         determining whether the control is implemented and free of obvious errors and whether there are increased
         grounds for confidence that the control is implemented correctly and operating as intended.
    -    Comprehensive examination: Examination that consists of high-level reviews, checks, observations, or
         inspections and more in depth, detailed, and thorough studies/analyses of the assessment object. This type
         of examination is conducted using an extensive body of evidence or documentation (e.g., functional-level
         descriptions and where appropriate and available, high-level design information, low-level design
         information, and implementation information for mechanisms; high-level process descriptions and
         detailed implementation procedures for activities; and the actual documents and related documents for
                       44
         specifications ). Comprehensive examinations provide a level of understanding of the security control
         necessary for determining whether the control is implemented and free of obvious errors and whether there
         are further increased grounds for confidence that the control is implemented correctly and operating as
         intended on an ongoing and consistent basis, and that there is support for continuous improvement in
         the effectiveness of the control.

ASSESSMENT METHOD:            Interview
ASSESSMENT OBJECTS:           Individuals or groups of individuals.
DEFINITION: The process of conducting discussions with individuals or groups within an organization to
facilitate understanding, achieve clarification, or lead to the location of evidence, the results of which are
used to support the determination of security control existence, functionality, correctness, completeness,
and potential for improvement over time.
SUPPLEMENTAL GUIDANCE: Typical assessor actions may include, for example, interviewing agency
heads, chief information officers, senior agency information security officers, authorizing officials,
information owners, information system and mission owners, information system security officers,
information system security managers, personnel officers, human resource managers, facilities managers,
training officers, information system operators, network and system administrators, site managers, physical
security officers, and users.
ATTRIBUTES: Depth, Coverage

•    The depth attribute addresses the rigor of and level of detail in the interview process. There are three
     possible values for the depth attribute: (i) basic; (ii) focused; and (iii) comprehensive.
     -    Basic interview: Interview that consists of broad-based, high-level discussions with individuals or groups of
          individuals. This type of interview is conducted using a set of generalized, high-level questions. Basic
          interviews provide a level of understanding of the security control necessary for determining whether the
          control is implemented and free of obvious errors.
     -    Focused interview: Interview that consists of broad-based, high-level discussions and more in depth
          discussions in specific areas with individuals or groups of individuals. This type of interview is conducted
          using a set of generalized, high-level questions and more in depth questions in specific areas where
          responses indicate a need for more in depth investigation. Focused interviews provide a level of
          understanding of the security control necessary for determining whether the control is implemented and free
          of obvious errors and whether there are increased grounds for confidence that the control is
          implemented correctly and operating as intended.

ATTRIBUTES: Depth, Coverage

•    The depth attribute addresses the types of testing to be conducted. There are three possible values for
     the depth attribute: (i) basic testing; (ii) focused testing; and (iii) comprehensive testing.
     -    Basic testing: Test methodology (also known as black box testing) that assumes no knowledge of the internal
          structure and implementation detail of the assessment object. This type of testing is conducted using a
          functional specification for mechanisms and a high-level process description for activities. Basic testing
          provides a level of understanding of the security control necessary for determining whether the control is
          implemented and free of obvious errors.
     -    Focused testing: Test methodology (also known as gray box testing) that assumes some knowledge of the
          internal structure and implementation detail of the assessment object. This type of testing is conducted using
          a functional specification and limited system architectural information (e.g., high-level design) for
          mechanisms and a high-level process description and high-level description of integration into the
          operational environment for activities. Focused testing provides a level of understanding of the security
          control necessary for determining whether the control is implemented and free of obvious errors and
          whether there are increased grounds for confidence that the control is implemented correctly and
          operating as intended.
     -    Comprehensive testing: Test methodology (also known as white box testing) that assumes explicit and
          substantial knowledge of the internal structure and implementation detail of the assessment object. This
          type of testing is conducted using a functional specification, extensive system architectural information (e.g.,
          high-level design, low-level design) and implementation representation (e.g., source code, schematics)
          for mechanisms and a high-level process description and detailed description of integration into the
          operational environment for activities. Comprehensive testing provides a level of understanding of the
          security control necessary for determining whether the control is implemented and free of obvious errors and
          whether there are further increased grounds for confidence that the control is implemented correctly and
          operating as intended on an ongoing and consistent basis, and that there is support for continuous
          improvement in the effectiveness of the control.

47
   Testing is typically used to determine if mechanisms or activities meet a set of predefined specifications. Testing can
also be performed to determine characteristics of a security control that are not commonly associated with predefined
specifications, with an example of such testing being penetration testing. Guidelines for conducting penetration testing
are provided in Appendix E.

APPENDIX E

PENETRATION TESTING
ASSESSMENT TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES TO IDENTIFY INFORMATION SYSTEM WEAKNESSES




O        rganizations should consider adding controlled penetration testing to their arsenal of tools
         and techniques used to assess the security controls in organizational information systems.
         Penetration testing is a specific type of assessment in which assessors simulate the
actions of a given class of attacker by using a defined set of documentation (that is, the
documentation representative of what that class of attacker is likely to possess) and working
under other specific constraints to attempt to circumvent the security features of an information
system. Penetration testing is conducted as a controlled attempt to breach the security controls
employed within the information system using the attacker’s techniques and appropriate hardware
and software tools. Penetration testing represents the results of a specific assessor or group of
assessors at a specific point in time using agreed-upon rules of engagement. Considering the
complexity of the information technologies commonly employed by organizations today,
penetration testing should be viewed not as a means to verify the security of an information
system, but rather as a means to: (i) enhance the organization’s understanding of the system; (ii)
uncover weaknesses or deficiencies in the system; and (iii) indicate the level of effort required on
the part of adversaries to breach the system safeguards.

Penetration testing exercises can be scheduled and/or random in accordance with organizational
policy and organizational assessments of risk. Consideration should be given to performing
penetration tests: (i) on any newly developed information system (or legacy system undergoing a
major upgrade) before the system is authorized for operation; (ii) after important changes are
made to the environment in which the information system operates; and (iii) when a new type of
attack is discovered that may impact the system. Organizations actively monitor the information
systems environment and the threat landscape (e.g., new vulnerabilities, attack techniques, new
technology deployments, user security awareness and training) to identify changes that require
out-of-cycle penetration testing.

Organizations specify which components within the information system are subject to penetration
testing and the attacker’s profile to be adopted throughout the penetration testing exercises.
Organizations train selected personnel in the use and maintenance of penetration testing tools and
techniques. Effective penetration testing tools should have the capability to readily update the list
of attack techniques and exploitable vulnerabilities used during the exercises. Organizations
should update the list of attack techniques and exploitable vulnerabilities used in penetration
testing in accordance with an organizational assessment of risk or when significant new
vulnerabilities or threats are identified and reported. Whenever possible, organizations should
employ tools and attack techniques that include the capability to perform penetration testing
exercises on information systems and security controls in an automated manner.

The information obtained from the penetration testing process should be shared with appropriate
personnel throughout the organization to help prioritize the vulnerabilities in the information
system that are demonstrably subject to compromise by attackers of a profile equivalent to the
ones used in the penetration testing exercises. The prioritization helps to determine effective
strategies for eliminating the identified vulnerabilities and mitigating associated risks to the
organization’s operations and assets, to individuals, to other organizations, and to the Nation
resulting from the operation and use of the information system. Penetration testing should be

integrated into the network security testing process and the patch and vulnerability management
process. Special Publication 800-40 provides guidance on patch and vulnerability management.
Special Publication 800-42 provides guidance on network security testing. Special Publication
800-115 provides guidance on information security testing.

Penetration Testing Considerations
Organizations consider the following criteria in developing and implementing a controlled
penetration testing program. An effective penetration test:
    •    Goes beyond vulnerability scanning, to provide an explicit and often dramatic proof of
         mission risks and an indicator of the level of effort an adversary would need to expend in
         order to cause harm to the organization’s operations and assets, to individuals, to other
         organizations, or to the Nation;
    •    Approaches the information system as the adversary would, considering vulnerabilities,
         incorrect system configurations, trust relationships between organizations, and
         architectural weaknesses in the environment under test;
    •    Has a clearly defined scope and contains as a minimum:
         - A definition of the environment subject to test (e.g., facilities, users, organizational
           groups, etc.);
         - A definition of the attack surface to be tested (e.g., servers, desktop systems, wireless
           networks, Web applications, intrusion detection and prevention systems, firewalls,
           email accounts, user security awareness and training posture, incident response posture,
           etc.);
         - A definition of the threat sources to simulate (e.g., an enumeration of attacker’s profiles
           to be used: internal attacker, casual attacker, single or group of external targeted
           attackers, criminal organization, etc.);
         - A definition of level of effort (time and resources) to be expended; and
         - A definition of the rules of engagement.
    •    Thoroughly documents all activities performed during the test, including all exploited
         vulnerabilities, and how the vulnerabilities were combined into attacks;
    •    Produces results indicating a likelihood of occurrence for a given attacker by using the
         level of effort the team needed to expend in penetrating the information system as an
         indicator of the penetration resistance of the system;
    •    Validates existing security controls (including risk mitigation mechanisms such as
         firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems);
    •    Provides a verifiable and reproducible log of all the activities performed during the test;
         and
    •    Provides actionable results with information about possible remediation measures for the
         successful attacks performed.

APPENDIX F

ASSESSMENT PROCEDURE CATALOG
OBJECTIVES, METHODS, AND OBJECTS FOR ASSESSING SECURITY CONTROLS




T       his appendix provides a catalog of procedures to assess the security controls and control
        enhancements in Special Publication 800-53.49 Assessors select assessment procedures
        from the catalog in accordance with the guidance provided in Section 3.2. Since the
contents of the security plan affect the development of the security assessment plan and the
assessment, there will likely be assessment procedures in the catalog that assessors will not use
because: (i) the associated security controls or control enhancements are not contained in the
security plan for the information system;50 or (ii) the security controls or control enhancements
are not being assessed at this particular time (e.g., during an assessment of a subset of the controls
as part of continuous monitoring activities).

The same assessment object may appear in multiple object lists in a variety of assessment
procedures. The same object may be used in multiple contexts to obtain needed information or
evidence for a particular aspect of an assessment. Assessors use the general references as
appropriate to obtain the necessary information to make the specified determinations required by
the assessment objective. For example, a reference to access control policy appears in the
assessment procedures for AC-2 and AC-7. For assessment procedure AC-2, assessors use the
access control policy to find information about that portion of the policy that addresses account
management for the information system. For assessment procedure AC-7, assessors use the
access control policy to find information about that portion of the policy that addresses
unsuccessful login attempts for the information system.

Assessors are responsible for combining and consolidating the assessment procedures whenever
possible or practical. Optimizing assessment procedures can save time, reduce assessment costs,
and maximize the usefulness of assessment results. Assessors optimize assessment procedures by
determining the best sequencing of the procedures. The assessment of some security controls
before others may provide information that facilitates understanding and assessment of other
controls.




49
   In the event of any differences between the assessment objectives identified for assessing the security controls and
the underlining intent expressed by the security control statements defined in the most recent version of Special
Publication 800-53, Special Publication 800-53 remains the definitive expression of the control or enhancement.
50
  The execution of the RMF includes the selection of an initial set of security controls employed within or inherited by
an organizational information system followed by a control tailoring and supplementation process. The tailoring and
supplementation process will likely change the set of security controls that will be contained in the final security plan.
Therefore, the selection of assessment procedures from the catalog of available procedures is based solely on the
content of the security plan after the tailoring and supplementation activities are completed.

                                                Implementation Tips
  TIP #1: Select only those assessment procedures from Appendix F that correspond to the security
  controls and control enhancements in the approved security plan and that are to be included in the
  assessment.

  TIP #2: The assessment procedures selected from Appendix F are simply example procedures that
  serve as a starting point for organizations preparing for assessments. These assessment procedures
  are tailored and supplemented as necessary, in accordance with the guidance in Section 3.2 to adapt
  the procedures to specific organizational requirements and operating environments.

  TIP #3: With respect to the assessment procedures in Appendix F, assessors need apply only those
  procedures, methods, and objects necessary for making a final determination that a particular security
  control objective is satisfied or not satisfied (see Section 3.3).

  TIP #4: Assessors apply to each assessment method, values for depth and coverage (described in
  Appendix D) that are commensurate with the characteristics of the information system (including
  assurance requirements) and the specific assessment activity that supports making a determination of
  the effectiveness of the security controls under review. The values selected for the depth and coverage
  attributes indicate the relative effort required in applying an assessment method to an assessment object
  (i.e., the rigor and scope of the activities associated with the assessment). The depth and coverage
  attributes, while not repeated in every assessment procedure in this appendix, can be represented as
  follows:
  Interview: [ASSIGN ATTRIBUTE VALUES: <depth>, <coverage>].
             [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with contingency planning and plan implementation
             responsibilities].

  TIP #5: Assessors may find useful assessment-related information in the Supplemental Guidance
  section of each security control described in Special Publication 800-53. This information can be used
  to carry out more effective assessments with regard to the application of assessment procedures.


  Note: When assessing agency compliance with NIST guidance, auditors, Inspectors General, evaluators, and/or
  assessors consider the intent of the security concepts and principles articulated within the particular guidance
  document and how the agency applied the guidance in the context of its specific mission responsibilities, operational
  environments, and unique organizational conditions.

  Whereas a set of potential assessment methods have been included in the following catalog of
  assessment procedures, these are not intended to be mandatory or exclusive and, depending on
  the particular circumstances of the information system to be assessed, not all methods may be
  required or other assessment methods may also be used. In addition, the potential assessment
  objects listed are not intended to be a mandatory set, but rather a set from which the necessary
  and sufficient set of objects for a given assessment can be selected to make the appropriate
  determinations. For specific recommendations regarding current best practices for security
  control assessments, organizations can consult the assessment case development project
  described in Appendix H and the assessment cases listed on the NIST Web site.

APPENDIX G

SECURITY ASSESSMENT REPORTS
DOCUMENTING THE FINDINGS FROM SECURITY CONTROL ASSESSMENTS




T      he primary purpose of the security assessment report is to convey the results of the
       security assessment to appropriate organizational officials. The security assessment report
       is included in the security authorization package along with the security plan (including an
updated risk assessment), and the plan of action and milestones to provide authorizing officials
with the information necessary to make credible, risk-based decisions on whether to place an
information system into operation or continue its operation. As the security assessment and
authorization process becomes more dynamic in nature, relying to a greater degree on the
continuous monitoring aspects of the process as an integrated and tightly coupled part of the
system development life cycle, the ability to update the security assessment report frequently
becomes a critical aspect of an information security program.

It is important to emphasize the relationship, described in Special Publication 800-37, among the
three key documents in the authorization package (i.e., the security plan, the security assessment
report, and the plan of action and milestones). It is these documents that provide the most reliable
indication of the overall security state of the information system and the ability of the system to
protect to the degree necessary, the organization’s operations and assets, individuals, other
organizations, and the Nation. Updates to these key documents are provided on an ongoing basis
in accordance with the continuous monitoring program established by the organization.

The security assessment report provides a disciplined and structured approach for documenting
the findings of the assessor and the recommendations for correcting any weaknesses or
deficiencies in the security controls.51 This appendix provides a template for reporting the results
from security control assessments. Organizations are not restricted to the specific template
format; however, it is anticipated that the overall report of an assessment will include similar
information to that detailed in the template for each security control assessed, preceded by a
summary providing the list of all security controls assessed and the overall status of each control.

Key Elements for Assessment Reporting
The following elements are included in security assessment reports:52
•    Information system name;
•    Security categorization;
•    Site(s) assessed and assessment date(s);
•    Assessor’s name/identification;
•    Previous assessment results (if reused);

51
  While the rationale for each determination made is a part of the formal Security Assessment Report, the complete set
of records produced as a part of the assessment is likely not included in the report. However, organizations retain the
portion of these records necessary for maintaining an audit trail of assessment evidence, facilitating reuse of evidence
as appropriate, and promoting repeatability of assessor actions.
52
   Information available in other key organizational documents (e.g., security plan, risk assessment, plan of action and
milestones, or security assessment plan) need not be duplicated in the security assessment report.

                                                                      Federal Information Systems and Organizations

•      Security control or control enhancement designator;
•      Selected assessment methods and objects;
•      Depth and coverage attributes values;
•      Assessment finding summary (indicating satisfied or other than satisfied);
•      Assessor comments (weaknesses or deficiencies noted); and
•      Assessor recommendations (priorities, remediation, corrective actions, or improvements).

The Assessment Findings
Each determination statement executed by an assessor results in one of the following findings: (i)
satisfied (S); or (ii) other than satisfied (O). Consider the following example for security control
CP-2. The assessment procedure for CP-2 consists of two assessment objectives denoted CP-2.1
and CP-2.2. The assessor initially executes CP-2.1 and produces the following findings:

    CP-2.1       ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE:
                  Determine if:
                 (i) the organization develops a contingency plan for the information system that:
                       - identifies essential missions and business functions and associated contingency
                           requirements; (S)
                       - provides recovery objectives, restoration priorities, and metrics; (S)
                       - addresses contingency roles, responsibilities, assigned individuals with contact
                           information; (O)
                       - addresses maintaining essential missions and business functions despite an
                           information system disruption, compromise, or failure; (S)
                       - addresses eventual, full information system restoration without deterioration of
                           the security measures originally planned and implemented; (S) and
                       - is reviewed and approved by designated officials within the organization; (O)
                 (ii) the organization defines key contingency personnel (identified by name and/or by
                       role) and organizational elements designated to receive copies of the contingency
                       plan; (O) and
                 (iii) the organization distributes copies of the contingency plan to organization-defined
                       key contingency personnel and organizational elements. (O)
                 Comments and Recommendations:
                 CP-2.1 (i) is marked as other than satisfied because the contingency plan prepared by the
                 organization did not assign individuals to contingency roles and provide contact information.
                 There was also no evidence that the contingency plan had been reviewed and approved by
                 designated organizational officials.
                 CP-2.1 (iii) is marked as other than satisfied because the organization had not distributed
                 copies of the contingency plan to key contingency personnel and organizational elements
                 critical to executing the plan.


In a similar manner, the assessor executes CP-2.2 and produces appropriate findings. During an
actual security control assessment, the assessment findings, comments, and recommendations are
documented on a Security Assessment Reporting Form. Organizations are encouraged to develop
standard templates for reporting that contain the key elements for assessment reporting described
above. Whenever possible, automation is used to make assessment data collection and reporting
cost-effective, timely, and efficient.

APPENDIX H

ASSESSMENT CASES
WORKED EXAMPLES OF ASSESSOR ACTIONS DERIVED FROM ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES




T      o provide assessors with additional tools and techniques for implementing the assessment
       procedures in Appendix F, NIST initiated the Assessment Case Development Project.53
       The purpose of the project is fourfold: (i) to actively engage experienced assessors from
multiple organizations in recommending assessment cases that describe specific assessor actions
to implement the assessment procedures in Appendix F; (ii) to provide organizations and the
assessors supporting those organizations with an exemplary set of assessment cases for each
assessment procedure in Appendix F; (iii) to provide a vehicle for ongoing community-wide
review of the assessment cases to promote continuous improvement in the security control
assessment process for more consistent, effective, and cost-effective security assessments of
federal information systems; and (iv) to serve as a basis for reciprocity among various
communities of interest. The assessment case development process is described in this appendix
and several examples of assessment cases are provided.

Assessment Case Description and Template
The concept of assessment cases emerged during the development process of Special Publication
800-53A. Some organizations prefer the flexibility offered by the generalized assessment
procedures in Appendix F, with the opportunity to tailor the procedures for specific
organizational requirements and operational environments and to create specific assessor actions
and activities for a particular security assessment. Other organizations prefer a more prescriptive
approach and desire, to the greatest extent possible, a predefined set of specific assessor actions
and activities needed to successfully carry out a security assessment. To facilitate the specificity
of the latter approach while maintaining the flexibility of the former approach, assessment cases
have been developed for all assessment procedures in Appendix F of this document.

An assessment case represents a worked example of an assessment procedure, identifying the
specific actions that an assessor might carry out during the assessment of a security control or
control enhancement in an information system. There is one assessment case per control,
covering all assessment objectives from the assessment procedure in Appendix F for that control
(both base control and all enhancements). The assessment case provides an example by
experienced assessors of a potential set of specific assessor action steps to accomplish the
assessment that were developed with consideration for the list of potential assessment methods
and objects, and incorporating the level of coverage and depth to be applied and the specific
purpose to be achieved by each assessor action. This additional level of detail in the assessment
cases provides assessors with more prescriptive assessment information. Yet, while being more
prescriptive, the assessment cases are not intended to restrict assessor flexibility provided as part
of the design principles in Special Publication 800-53A. The assessor remains responsible for
making the specified determinations and for providing adequate rationale for the determinations
made.

53
   NIST initiated the Assessment Case Development Project in October 2007 in cooperation with the Departments of
Justice, Energy, Transportation, and the Intelligence Community. The interagency task force developed a full suite of
assessment cases based on the assessment procedures provided in Special Publication 800-53A. The assessment cases
are available to all public and private sector organizations and can be downloaded from the NIST web site at
http://csrc.nist.gov/sec-cert.

 Additional Assessment Case Information
 This section contains the additional information provided by the assessment case to help the assessor in planning and
 conducting the security control assessment.

                           This section provides some initial suggestions with regard to sequencing of assessor actions for
                           greater efficiency. Precursor controls are those controls whose assessment is likely to provide
                           information either assisting in, or required for, the assessment of this control. Concurrent
                           controls are those controls whose assessment is likely to require the assessor to assess similar
                           objects and hence, the assessor may be able to obtain evidence for multiple control assessments
                           at the same time. Successor controls are those controls whose assessment will likely need, or
                           benefit from, information obtained from the assessment of this control.

  The assessment cases developed for this project are not the only acceptable assessment cases; rather,
  the cases represent one possible set of assessor actions for organizations (and assessors supporting
  those organizations) to use in helping to determine the effectiveness of the security controls employed
  within the information systems undergoing assessments. The following assessment procedure for
  security control AC-3, illustrates how assessment cases are developed from the template on the

                      General notes to assessor for MP-2:
                      The focus of this control is the organization restricting access to information system media, and
                      not whether the media is allowed to be used (which is covered under AC-19).
                      As indicated in the supplemental guidance for this control, this control addresses both digital
                      and non-digital media.
