Welcome Letter
   The Computer Security Division (CSD), a component of the Information Technology Laboratory at the National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) is responsible for developing standards, guidelines, tests, and metrics for protection of non-national security federal information systems.
NIST standards and guidelines are developed in an open and transparent manner that enlists broad industry and academia expertise from around
the world. While developed for federal agency use, these resources are voluntarily adopted by other organizations because they are effective and
accepted throughout the world.
   The need for cybersecurity standards and best practices that address interoperability, usability and privacy continues to be critical for the Nation.
In Fiscal Year (FY) 2013, CSD continued to align its resources to enable greater development and application of practical, innovative security
technologies and methodologies that enhance our ability to address current and future computer and information security challenges. Our foundational
research and applied cybersecurity programs continue to advance in many areas including cryptography; identity and access management; cloud,
virtualization, and mobile technologies; and advanced security testing and measurement.
  Strong partnerships with diverse stakeholders are vital to the success of our technical programs. In February 2013, the President issued Executive
Order 13636 that directed NIST to work collaboratively with industry to develop a voluntary framework - based on existing standards, guidelines, and
practices - to improve critical infrastructure cybersecurity practices. NIST held several workshops, meetings, webinars, and informal sessions to
gather feedback with the goals of generating content for the framework and discuss several topics that help inform and guide NIST in this effort. In
August 2013, we produced a discussion draft of the preliminary framework.
  Working closely with standards developing organizations, industry and interagency partners, we are evolving and expanding security automation
capabilities to help organizations manage and measure the security of systems and technologies. Our cybersecurity awareness, training, and
education programs also exemplify the importance of these partnerships by engaging with academic institutions, federal agencies, small and medium
businesses and others to increase awareness and enhance the overall cybersecurity posture of the Nation.
   Active engagement with the diverse federal community continues to be critical to our success. This interaction is most prominent in our strengthened
collaborations with the Department of Defense, the Intelligence Community, and the Committee on National Security Systems to establish a common
foundation for information security across the federal government. Through this partnership, NIST released Special Publication (SP) 800-53 Revision
4, Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations, in April 2013. This guideline provides organizations with state-of-
the-practice security controls to fundamentally strengthen their systems and the environments in which those systems operate. SP 800-53 Revision
4 and other NIST standards and guidelines contribute to systems that are more resilient in the face of cyber attacks and other threats.
   Late in FY 2013, news reports about leaked classified documents caused concern from the cryptographic community about the security of NIST
cryptographic standards and guidelines. Recognizing community concern regarding some specific standards, we reopened the public comment period
for three Special Publications to give the public a second opportunity to view and comment on the documents. This initial step will be followed by a
                                       review of our cryptographic development process and NIST cryptographic standards and guidelines in FY 2014.
                                         For many years, CSD, in collaboration with our global partners across industry, academia, and government,
                                      has made great contributions to help secure the nation’s critical information and infrastructure. We look forward
                                      to furthering these relationships in FY 2014 as we lead the development and practical implementation of
                                      scalable and sustainable information security standards and practices in areas such as cyber-physical and
                                      industrial control systems, privacy engineering, security automation, and mobile technologies.
                                        To participate in any CSD research areas – whether current or future – or to learn more about our programs

    Security Testing, Validation, and Measurement
    Group (STVMG)
Mission Statement:
  Advance information security testing, measurement science,
and conformance.
Overview:
   Federal agencies, industry, and the public rely on cryptography
for the protection of information and communications used
in electronic commerce, critical infrastructure, and other
application areas. The STVMG supports testing and validation
of underlying cryptographic modules and cryptographic
algorithms in consideration of established standards. These
cryptographic modules and algorithms enable products and
systems to provide security services, such as confidentiality,
integrity, and authentication. Although cryptography provides
security, poor designs or weak algorithms can render a product
insecure and place highly sensitive information at risk. When
protecting sensitive data, Federal Government agencies require
a minimum level of assurance that cryptographic products meet
established security requirements and use only tested and
validated cryptographic modules.
  STVMG’s testing-focused activities include validating
cryptographic algorithm implementations, cryptographic
modules, and Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP)-
compliant products; developing test suites and test methods;
providing implementation guidance and technical support
to industry forums; and conducting education, training, and
outreach programs.

 infrastructure, the President issued Executive Order (EO)
 13636, Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity, in
 February 2013. This Executive Order directed NIST to work
 with stakeholders to develop a voluntary framework – based
 on existing standards, guidelines, and practices − for reducing
 cybersecurity risks to critical infrastructure.
    The Cybersecurity Framework will provide a prioritized,
 flexible, repeatable, performance-based, and cost-effective
 approach, including information security measures and controls
 to help owners and operators of critical infrastructure and other
 interested entities to identify, assess, and manage cybersecurity-
 related risk while protecting business confidentiality, individual
 privacy, and civil liberties. To enable technical innovation
 and account for organizational differences, the Cybersecurity
 Framework will not prescribe particular technological solutions
 or specifications.
   In FY 2013, NIST worked with a diverse stakeholder
 community to develop the Framework through an open public
 process. This process included:
      Issuing a Request for Information (RFI) in the Federal
        Register in February 2013

      Conducting five open workshops to provide the public
        with additional opportunities to provide input. These
        workshops were hosted at the Department of Commerce
        in Washington, D.C. (April 2013), Carnegie Mellon

   CSD has approached the challenge of network security
 analysis by capturing vulnerability interdependencies and
 measuring security based on how real attackers have penetrated
 networks. CSD’s methodology for security risk analysis is based
 on attack graphs. CSD analyzes attack paths through a network,
 providing a probabilistic metric of the overall system risk.                      Figure 22: Algorithms for Intrusion Measurement
 Through this metric, CSD analyzes trade-offs between security
 costs and security benefits.                                               The Algorithms for Intrusion Measurement (AIM) project, newly

 supported by roots of trust. Draft SP 800-164, Guidelines on
 Hardware-Rooted Security in Mobile Devices, was released for
 public comment in October 2012.
   In FY 2014, CSD will release a revised draft of SP 800-
 164, based on the feedback received during the public
 comment period. In addition, CSD is working with the National
 Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) to encourage the
 adoption of stronger security technologies in mobile devices.
 Using draft SP 800-164 as a basis for an NCCoE building block
 activity, CSD and the NCCoE will invite mobile device, operating
 system, management software vendors, and application
 developers to study, demonstrate, and document how to use
 hardware-backed security solutions.
   In FY 2013, CSD continued its work to protect fundamental
 system firmware, commonly known as Basic Input/Output
 System (BIOS). CSD has been working with key members of the
 computer industry on the use of roots of trust to improve the
 security of BIOS.
    CSD will continue its efforts to secure BIOS and other critical
 firmware in FY 2014 and will finalize a Special Publication
 covering BIOS protections for server-class systems. CSD will
 also release an updated draft of SP 800-155, BIOS Integrity
 Measurement Guidelines, which will include additional
 guidelines for server-class systems and other boot firmware. In
 order to encourage the continued adoption of BIOS protections,
 CSD also plans to submit SP 800-147, BIOS Protection
 Guidelines, to ISO for standardization.

             Leadership Award (GISLA)




   Josh Franklin and Kelley Dempsey won the (ISC)² Government
Information Security Leadership Award (GISLA) in the Process/
Policy Improvement category for their work on the Federal
Mobile Security Baseline and the Mobile Computing Decision
Framework. According to (ISC)², the award in this category
is given to “An individual or team of senior-level U.S. federal
government personnel…whose contribution to the development
or implementation of any information security policy or process
has significantly improved the security posture of a federal
agency, department or government-wide within the last 12
months.” Source: https://www.isc2.org/gisla/Default.aspx.

                                                          Security Leadership Tribute Award

                               National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Fellow Ron Ross has been awarded the
                             inaugural Lynn F. McNulty Tribute U.S. Government Information Security Leadership Award. The (ISC)2
                             U.S. Government Advisory Board for Cyber Security (GABCS) announced the award on October 29,
                             2013, in recognition of Ross’s “key role in establishing cybersecurity requirements for federal agencies
                             for decades.”
    The award was established last year after the death of (ISC)2 Fellow and IT security evangelist Lynn F. McNulty, CISSP. McNulty
  was considered by those in the community as the “pioneer” of government information security. The Tribute Award recognizes a
  member of the U.S. federal information security community who upholds McNulty’s legacy as a visionary and innovator through
  outstanding service and commitment.
    Ross worked with McNulty during the 1990s when McNulty was NIST’s Associate Director of Computer Security.
     “Ron’s insight and leadership in producing a library of guidance publications over the past decade has greatly contributed to the
  advancement of information security in government and around the world,” said Peter Gouldmann, CISSP, director of information
  risk programs, Office of Information Assurance, U.S. Department of State, and member, (ISC) 2 GABCS. “His highly collaborative
  approach, incorporating government and industry, has resulted in products that are being adopted and adapted for use on national
  security systems, transcending the unclassified and classified systems landscape.”

            The Federal Cloud Strategy, February 8, 2010,
         outlines a federal cloud computing program that
         identifies program objectives aimed at accelerating
         the adoption of cloud computing across the Federal
         Government. NIST, along with other agencies, was
         tasked with a key role and specific activities in support
         of that effort, including the delivery of the NIST Cloud
         Computing Technology Roadmap and the publication of
         other Special Publications that address the reference
         architecture, definitions, and security aspects of cloud
         computing. In order to achieve adoption of cloud
         computing for the Federal Government, it is necessary
         to address the security and privacy concerns that
         federal agencies have when migrating their services
         to a cloud environment. To further exacerbate the
         situation, there are few documented details that
         directly address how to achieve some security aspects
         in a cloud environment. The purpose of this document
         is to provide an overview of the high-priority security
         and privacy challenges perceived by federal agencies
         as impediments to the adoption of cloud computing.
         The document provides descriptions of the existing
         mitigations to these security and privacy impediments.
         If no mitigations are listed, then ongoing efforts that
         could lead to mitigations are described. In the cases
         where no ongoing efforts were identified, the document
         makes recommendations for possible mitigation or
         references existing best practices.
