                                           Abstract

The purpose of this Special Publication is to provide appropriate and useful guidelines for
assessing the reliability of issuers of Personal Identity Verification (PIV) Cards and Derived PIV
Credentials. These issuers store personal information and issue credentials based on Office of
Management and Budget (OMB) policies and on the standards published in response to
Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12) and therefore are the primary target of
the assessment and authorization under this guideline. The reliability of an issuer is of utmost
importance when one organization (e.g., a federal agency) is required to trust the identity
credentials of individuals that were created and issued by another federal agency. This trust will
only exist if organizations relying on the credentials issued by a given organization have the
necessary level of assurance that the reliability of the issuing organization has been established
through a formal authorization process.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 ([HSPD-12]), dated August 27, 2004, established a
policy for creation, issuance, and use of personal identification credentials in the Federal
Government. The Directive requires the development and use of a standard for secure and
reliable forms of identification for federal employees and contractors. The Personal Identity
Verification (PIV) specifications of the resulting standard (Federal Information Processing
Standard (FIPS) 201) is the foundation for securely identifying every individual seeking access
to valuable and sensitive federal resources, including buildings, information systems, and
computer networks. The implementation of PIV specifications, in turn, involves operations such
as the collection, access protection, and dissemination of personal information, which itself
requires privacy protection.

NIST developed and published FIPS 201, Personal Identity Verification (PIV) of Federal
Employees and Contractors, as well as several NIST Special Publications (SPs) to provide
additional specifications and supporting information in response to [HSPD-12]. These
documents provide the required foundation for standardizing the processes related to the
adoption and use of government-wide personal identification credentials as a means to verify the
identity of the credential holders.

In light of the requirements for both improved security and protection of personal privacy,
[HSPD-12] established four control objectives, one of which includes the call for forms of
identification that are “issued by providers whose reliability has been established by an official
accreditation process.” In response, Appendix A.1 of FIPS 201 specifies that NIST “…develop a
new accreditation methodology that is objective, efficient, and will result in consistent and
repeatable accreditation decisions…” This led to development of NIST SP 800-79 in 2005,
Guidelines for the Accreditation of Personal Identity Verification Card Issuers.1

The update to this Special Publication (SP) reflects the second revision of FIPS 201 published in
2013[FIPS 201-2]. It provides appropriate and useful guidelines for assessing the reliability of
issuers of PIV Cards and provides guidelines for issuers of the newly introduced Derived PIV
Credential for mobile devices.2 The reliability of an issuer is of utmost importance when an
organization (e.g., a federal agency) is required to trust the identity credentials of individuals that
were created and issued by another organization. This trust only exists if the relying organization
has the necessary level of assurance of the issuing organization that the credential is established
via a formal authorization process and thus reliable.

    NIST SP 800-37-1, Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems [SP 800-37-1] has
    deprecated the use of the term accreditation in favor of the term authorization. This is reflected in the title of the present
    revision.

    A mobile device, for the purpose of this document is a portable computing device that: (i) has a small form factor such that it
    can easily be carried by a single individual; (ii) is designed to operate without a physical connection (e.g., wirelessly transmit or
    receive information); (iii) possesses local, non-removable or removable data storage; and (iv) includes a self-contained power
    source. Mobile devices may also include voice communication capabilities, on-board sensors that allow the devices to capture
    information, and/or built-in features for synchronizing local data with remote locations. Examples include smart phones,
    tablets, and e-readers.


                                                                    IV
Special Publication 800-79-2                              Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card Issuers
                                                                           and Derived PIV Credential Issuers


This SP provides an assessment and authorization methodology for verifying that issuers are
adhering to standards and implementation directives developed under [HSPD-12]. The salient
features of the methodology are:

    (i)       Controls derived from specific requirements in FIPS 201-2 and relevant documents
              for PIV Card issuer (PCI) and Derived PIV Credential issuer (DPCI);
    (ii)      Procedures for verifying and monitoring adherence to the requirements through an
              assessment of the implementation of the controls (control assessment); and
    (iii)     Guidance for evaluating the result of an assessment in order to arrive at the
              accreditation decision.

Authorizing an issuer based on the assessment and authorization methodology in this document
establishes the reliability of the issuer.

Authorization is the basis for establishing trust in an issuer and requires that the assessment be
thorough and comprehensive. Careful planning, preparation, and commitment of time, energy,
and resources are required. These guidelines are designed to assist agencies in creating the
needed roles, assigning responsibilities, developing an acceptable operations plan, drawing the
issuer’s authorization boundary, evaluating the findings of all control assessments, and making a
proper authorization decision. Realizing that organizations may vary significantly in how they
choose to structure their operations, these guidelines have been developed to support
organizational flexibility, and are designed to minimize the effort needed to assess, authorize,
and monitor the reliability of the issuer.

In addition to flexibility and efficiency, the authorization methodology defined in these
guidelines generates assessment findings and resulting authorization decisions that are consistent
and repeatable. These characteristics provide assurance to an organization’s management that
when an issuer has been authorized based on these guidelines they can be trusted as a provider of
secure and reliable identification credentials as required by [HSPD-12].

This document shall be used by both small and large organizations and can be applied whether
issuance processes are:
          Centrally located;
          Geographically dispersed; or
          Outsourced in varying degrees to another organization(s) or service provider(s).

1. Introduction
In order to enhance security, increase Federal Government efficiency, reduce identity fraud, and
protect personal privacy, Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 ([HSPD-12]), Policy for a
Common Identification Standard for Federal Employees and Contractors was issued on August
27, 2004. This Directive established a federal policy to create and use government-wide secure
and reliable forms of identification for federal employees and contractors. It further defined
secure and reliable forms of identification as ones that—

           Are issued based on sound criteria for verifying an individual’s identity;
           Are strongly resistant to identity fraud, tampering, counterfeiting, and terrorist
            exploitation;
           Can be rapidly authenticated electronically; and
           Are issued only by providers whose reliability has been established by an official
            accreditation process.

NIST developed and published Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 201, Personal
Identity Verification (PIV) of Federal Employees and Contractors, and several Special
Publications providing additional specifications in response to [HSPD-12]. These documents
provide the foundation for Government personal identification, verification, and access control
systems.

Appendix A.1 of FIPS 201-2 states the following:

 “…[HSPD-12] requires that all cards be issued by providers whose reliability has been
established by an official accreditation process.”

To determine consistency in operations of issuers of PIV Cards, NIST developed a set of
attributes as the basis of reliability assessment and published the first version of this document in
July 2005. Subsequent lessons learned in various agencies’ implementation, experience in
credential management and PIV Card issuance together with the evolution of PIV Card issuing
organizations motivated NIST to develop an updated methodology that is objective, efficient,
and resulted in a consistent and repeatable authorization decisions. These developments led
NIST to publish the first revision to SP 800-79 (i.e., SP 800-79-1) in June 2008. In 2013, FIPS
201 was superseded by FIPS 201 revision 2 (FIPS 201-2). FIPS 201-2 incorporates additional
lessons learned from PIV Card issuers and allows for mobile device-integrated PIV credentials.
This revision reflects the update to FIPS 201-2 and its new associated publication SP 800-157,
Guidelines for Derived Personal Identity Verification (PIV) Credentials [SP800-157], which
details the issuance and use of Derived PIV Credentials3 that are integrated in mobile devices.

    The Derived PIV Credential is an additional common identity credential under HSPD-12 and FIPS 201-2 that is issued by a
    Federal department or agency and used with mobile devices. Derived PIV Credentials are based on the general concept of
    derived credential in SP 800-63-2, Electronic Authentication Guideline [SP 800-63-2], which leverages identity proofing and
    vetting results of current and valid credentials. When applied to PIV, identity proofing and vetting processes do not have to be
    repeated to issue a Derived PIV Credential. Instead, the user proves possession of a valid PIV Card to receive a Derived PIV
    Credential. To achieve interoperability with the PIV infrastructure and its applications, a Derived PIV Credential is a subset of


                                                                   1
Special Publication 800-79-2                                           Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card Issuers
                                                                                        and Derived PIV Credential Issuers



Unless there is a need to differentiate between PCIs and DPCIs, this document uses the common
term issuer to refer to both types of issuers. Similarly, Derived PIV Credential and the PIV
Card’s credentials are collectively referred to as credentials, unless a distinction is made. An
issuer is considered to be owned and managed by an organization which may be a federal
department, agency, or a private entity authorized by a federal department or agency. Ensuring
the reliability of an issuer is of critical importance in light of the security and privacy
implications of credentials used for meeting the objective of secure and reliable forms of
identification to millions of employees and contractors. [HSPD-12] and its standards and
guidelines were developed to address a range of security concerns, including those posed by
terrorists in a post-9/11 world. Providing a comprehensive set of standards for controlling access
to the physical and logical resources through the use of standard credentials, provides the
assurance that certain pre-defined levels of security can be achieved. However, it requires
organizations to implement and use the standards in a consistent and reliable manner. An
organization must have confidence in the credentials it issues to its own employees and
contractors. Possibly more importantly, since [HSPD-12] requires a common inter-agency-
interoperable standard, all organizations need to have confidence in the identity credentials
issued by other organizations. This confidence can only be established if the issuer’s functions in
those other organizations are assessed and authorized. Thus, authorization of the issuer plays a
key role in meeting the objectives of [HSPD-12].

NIST has considerable experience in the development of assessment and authorization
methodologies, most significantly with the widely accepted approach to authorization in SP 800-
37-1, Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems [SP
800-37-1], and its family of related documents. While [SP 800-37-1] is focused on the
authorization of the security of information systems, rather than the authorization of the
reliability of an issuer, it does offer a practical foundation for the authorization programs
envisioned by [HSPD-12]. This document utilizes the various aspects of [SP 800-37-1] and
applies them to authorizing the reliability of an issuer. Authorization of an issuer requires prior
assessment of the security of all information systems used by that issuer in accordance with [SP
800-37-1]. PIV Cards and Derived PIV Credentials are typically issued through the use of
information systems and hence an assessment of their security (through the methodology in [SP
800-37-1]) is critical in determining the ability to comply with [FIPS 201-2] requirements.

One difference between the authorization of the security of information systems and the
authorization of the reliability of an issuer is that an organization has considerable flexibility in
how they prepare for an [SP 800-37-1] authorization (particularly in implementing security
controls), but have little room for variation for an SP 800-79-2 authorization. Much of the
flexibility in [SP 800-37-1] comes from the necessity of acceptable variations in security
controls, since individual information systems within varied environments may have
significantly different security requirements. Conversely, the desire for standardization in
[HSPD-12] has led to the development of a stable set of requirements. There may be some
flexibility in how a requirement is met, but a majority of requirements must be satisfied in a
uniform manner in order to deem an issuer as reliable. Allowing too much latitude in how a
requirement is met undermines its reliability.

Special Publication 800-79-2                           Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card Issuers
                                                                        and Derived PIV Credential Issuers



Although organizations may feel constrained by the uniformity required by FIPS 201-2,
standardization greatly contributes to achieving the objectives of [HSPD-12] across issuer
implementations. For all organizations to accept PIV Cards or Derived PIV Credentials of other
organizations, one set of rules (i.e., FIPS 201-2) must be followed by all PIV system participants.
This Special Publication provides a way of determining if the participants are following these
rules. Assessment methods that are consistent, reliable, and repeatable provide a basis for
determining the reliability and capability of issuers of PIV Cards and Derived PIV Credentials,
which herein is defined as consistent adherence to the PIV standards. In particular, if an issuer
meets the requirements of FIPS 201-2 and relevant documents as verified through applicable
assessment procedures and maintain consistency of their operations with respect to meeting these
criteria, they can be considered reliable as is required by [HSPD-12].

The objectives of the guidelines in this document are to—

       Outline the requirements for PIV Card Issuers and for the Derived PIV Credentials
        Issuers, the rationale for the requirements and the assessment procedures required to
        determine the satisfaction of those requirements through a combination of policies,
        procedures, and operations.
       Describe an authorization methodology that provides a framework for organizing the
        requirements and assessment procedures stated above and at the same time provides
        coverage for all the control objectives stated in [HSPD-12].
       Emphasize the role of risk associated with an authorization decision, based on assessment
        outcomes that take into account the organization’s mission.

1.1 Applicability, Intended Audience, and Usage

This document is applicable to, and shall be used by all federal organizations. It may also be
used by any other organization (e.g., state and local government, educational, non-profit)
desiring close alignment with FIPS 201-2 and associated PIV credentials.

All federal organizations are required to adopt [HSPD-12] and implement FIPS 201-2. They
must use SP 800-79-2 to assess the adequacy of their implementations as well as the reliability of
either the directly-controlled or sub-contracted services involved in creating and issuing the
mandatory PIV Cards and the optional Derived PIV Credentials (if implemented).

SP 800-79-2 is consistent and compatible with the control objectives in [HSPD-12], [FIPS 201-
2], and [SP 800-37-1]. SP 800-79-2 includes a number of roles, requirements, definitions,
specifications, and procedures needed to assess the reliability of an issuing organization. In
situations where an issuer fails to meet the assessment criteria in SP 800-79-2, they must
immediately halt operations.

Once an issuer is authorized to operate using the guidelines from 800-79-2, trust can be
established in the issued PIV Card or Derived PIV Credential throughout its lifecycle. Hence,
organizations that accept PIV Cards or Derived PIV Credentials that do not follow these
guidelines, are doing so at their own risk since the reliability of their operations cannot be
assured.

                                                                                         and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

1.2 Changes for this Revision

The major changes for this revision include additions and updates to issuer controls in response
to new or changed requirements in FIPS 201-2. These are:

        Inclusion of issuer controls for Derived PIV Credentials Issuers (DPCI),
        Addition of issuer controls for issuing PIV Cards under the grace period and for issuing
         PIV Cards to individuals under pseudonymous identity,
        Addition of issuer controls for the PIV Card’s visual topography,
        Provided detailed controls to address post-issuance updates for PIV Cards,
        Updated references to more recent credentialing guidance issued by Office of Personnel
         Management (OPM),
        Addition of issuer controls with respect to the chain-of-trust records maintained by a PIV
         Card issuer,
        Modified process to include an independent review prior to authorization of issuer.

1.3 Timelines for using the revised Guidelines

This publication is effective immediately and it supersedes the previous version.

FIPS 201-2 mandates the implementation of some PIV Card features that were previously
optional to implement. The standard also requires that all new or replacement PIV Cards include
these previously optional features beginning September 2014 (i.e., one year publication of FIPS
201-2). These new FIPS 201-2 requirements result in the following re-authorization scenarios:

        Organizations whose current Authorization to Operate (ATO) (under SP 800-79-1)
         covers issuance of PIV Cards with the new mandatory features of FIPS 201-2 do not have
         to be re-authorized under SP 800-79-2;4

        Organizations whose current ATO (under SP 800-79-1) covers issuance of PIV Cards
         without the new mandatory features are required to be re-authorized under SP 800-79-2.

Derived PIV Credentials are optional PIV credentials introduced in FIPS 201-2 and detailed in
SP 800-157 Guidelines for Derived Personal Identity Verification (PIV) Credentials [SP 800-
157]. The timeline for their use on mobile devices depends on Department and Agencies to
achieve the ATO to issue Derived PIV Credential based on this document and on the availability
of validated Derived PIV Credential tokens. No Derived PIV Credentials shall be issued unless
the issuer has met the requirements of and is operating in accordance to the guidelines of SP 800-
79-2.

 Re-Authorization using the revised guidelines (SP 800-79-2) is required within three (3) years of current Authorization to
Operate (ATO).

2. PREPARATION FOR ASSESSMENT AND AUTHORIZATION

This chapter presents the fundamentals of an authorization of a PIV Card Issuer (PCI) and a
Derived PIV Credential Issuer (DPCI). It includes: (i) definitions of an issuer and issuing
facility; (ii) outsourcing issuer services or functions; (iii) the differences between an assessment
and authorization; (iv) authorization boundaries of an issuer; (v) roles and responsibilities; (vi)
the relationship between authorization under [SP 800-37-1] and SP 800-79-2; (vii) preparing for
the assessment; (viii) types of authorization decisions; (xi) use of risk in the authorization
decision; and (x) the contents of the authorization package.

2.1 Issuer

At the highest level, an issuer provides a full set of functions required to produce, issue, and
maintain PIV Cards or Derived PIV Credentials for an organization. A PCI or DPCI is
considered operational if all relevant roles and responsibilities have been defined and appointed;
suitable policies and compliant procedures have been implemented for all relevant PIV
processes,5 including sponsorship, identity proofing/registration, adjudication, card/token
production, activation/issuance, and maintenance; and information system components that are
utilized for performing the above-mentioned functions (processes) have been assessed and
shown to meet all technical and operational requirements prescribed in FIPS 201-2 and related
documents.

In order to comply with Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 ([HSPD-12]), an
organization must first establish an issuer, to issue PIV Cards or Derived PIV Credentials, which
conforms to and satisfies the requirements of FIPS 201-2 and related documents. The issuer must
then be authorized (i.e., using the guidelines specified in this document). An organization has
certain flexibility in implementing its issuance functions. It may outsource some of the required
processes or establish multiple units for fulfilling these processes. Regardless of its structure, the
organization is responsible for the management and oversight and maintains full responsibility
for its functions as an issuer as required in [HSPD-12].

The organization must completely describe its PIV Card and/or Derived PIV Credential issuance
functions in an operations plan. This comprehensive document incorporates all the information
about the issuer that is needed for any independent party to review and assess the capability and
reliability of its operations. An operations plan includes a description of the structure of the
issuer, its facilities, any external service providers, the roles and responsibilities, policies and
procedures which govern its operations, and a description of how requirements of FIPS 201-2 are
being met. A template for an operations plan is provided in Appendix D.

2.2 Issuing Facilities

An issuing facility is a physical site or location–including all equipment, staff, and
documentation–that is responsible for carrying out one or more of the following PIV functions:
(i) identity proofing/registration; (ii) card/token6 production; (iii) activation/issuance; and (iv)
5
    Note: Some of the processes may not apply to Derived PIV Credentials Issuers.

    When the term token is used within this document it is used to refer to the various Derived PIV Credential tokens detailed in
    [SP800-157].


                                                                  7

                                                                                           and Derived PIV Credential Issuers



maintenance. An issuing facility operates under the auspices of a PIV Card or Derived PIV
Credential Issuer, and implements the policies and executes procedures prescribed by the issuer
for those functions sanctioned for the facility (e.g., an identity proofing/registration facility).

Based on certain characteristics (e.g., size, geographic locations, the organization(s) that it
supports), an issuer may have its services and functions provided centrally, distributed across
multiple locations, or may even be able to perform the entire issuance process remotely.7 For
example, in the case of PIV Card issuance, a geographically dispersed organization may decide
to have identity proofing/registration and activation/issuance functions performed in different
facilities in different parts of the country so that applicants can minimize travel. In this example,
the different issuing facilities fall under the purview (policy, management) of a single issuer
which encompasses all the functions necessary to issue PIV Cards.

Within that issuer, the geographically dispersed issuing facilities have specific responsibilities
and are under the direct management control of the issuer.

2.3 Outsourcing of Issuing Functions

An organization may outsource its issuing functions to one or more organizations. As the
complexity and cost of new technology increase, the organization may decide that the most
efficient and cost-effective solution for implementing [HSPD-12] is to seek the services of an
external service provider. An external service provider may be a Federal Government agency, a
private entity, or some other organization that offers services or functions necessary to issue PIV
Cards or Derived PIV Credentials.

Figure 1 provides an illustration of the functions that can be outsourced. Only the organization
can decide which of its employees and contractors are required to apply for a PIV Card and a
Derived PIV Credential (Sponsorship – a responsible official of the organization providing the
biographic and organizational affiliation of the applicant) and under what conditions the
application will be approved (Adjudication – the kind of background information that will form
the basis for authorization to issue the PIV Card). Therefore, these two functions cannot be
outsourced.

A PCI or DPCI which out-sources services to an external provider must make sure that all
privacy-related requirements are satisfied and as such is responsible for ensuring that privacy
requirements are being met both internally and by every external service provider.

If an issuer is considering using PIV services set up by another organization, the operations plan
and associated documents, the authorization decision and evidence of implementation of FIPS
201-2 requirements of that issuer (PCI or DPCI service provider) must be reviewed by the
Designated Authorizing Official (DAO) of the issuer. Similarly, if an issuer is using the services
of an external service provider selectively for one or more of its processes, the provider’s
capability to meet FIPS 201-2 requirements for those processes must be reviewed as well. In
both cases, the information gathered as part of this review activity must be included in the
issuer’s assessment leading to authorization. Outsourced functions must be assessed prior to
authorization of an issuer.

2.4 Assessment and Authorization

[HSPD-12] mandates that identification credentials be “issued only by providers whose
reliability has been established by an official accreditation process.” This document contains
guidelines for satisfying the requirements for an official authorization and provides a
methodology that can be utilized to formally authorize an issuer. This methodology consists of
two major sets of activities–assessment and authorization. While assessment and authorization
are very closely related, they are two very distinct activities.

Assessment occurs before authorization and is the process of gathering evidence regarding an
issuer’s satisfaction of the requirements of FIPS 201-2, both at the organization and facility level.
Assessment activities include interviews with the issuer and the issuing facility’s personnel, a
review of documentation, observation of processes, and execution of tests to determine overall
reliability of the issuer. The result of the assessment is a report that serves as the basis for an
authorization decision. The report is also the basis for developing corrective actions for removing
or mitigating discovered deficiencies.

Distinct from assessment, authorization is the decision to permit the operation of the issuer once
it has been established that the requirements of FIPS 201-2 have been met and the risks regarding
security and privacy are acceptable. The individual making the authorization decision must be
knowledgeable of [HSPD-12] and aware of the potential risks to the organization’s operations,
assets, and personnel (e.g., applicants, issuing facility staff).

The assessment and the authorization are both carried out by the organization (as per Section 5.3)
that “owns” (i.e., manages, controls, or privately owns) the issuance of PIV Cards and/or
Derived PIV Credentials9. In order to make an informed, risk-based authorization decision, the
assessment process should seek to answer the following questions:

           Has the issuer implemented the requirements of FIPS 201-2 in the manner consistent with
            the standard?

    The trust in PIV Cards and Derived PIV Credentials stems from the guidelines in Task 6 of Section 5.3.

       Do personnel understand the responsibilities of their roles and/or positions, and reliably
        perform all required activities as described in the issuer’s documentation?
       Are services and functions at the issuer and its facilities (e.g., identity
        proofing/registration, card/token production, activation/issuance) carried out in a
        consistent, reliable, and repeatable manner?
       Have deficiencies identified during the assessment been documented, current and
        potential impact on security and privacy been highlighted, and the recommendations and
        timelines for correction or mediation been included in the assessment report?

2.5 Authorization Boundary of the Issuer

The first step in authorizing an issuer is to identify the appropriate authorization boundary. The
authorization boundary defines the specific operations that are to be the target of the assessment
and authorization. A PCI comprises the complete set of functions required for the issuance and
maintenance of PIV Cards while a DPCI comprises of the complete set of functions required for
the issuance and maintenance of Derived PIV Credentials. In determining the authorization
boundary, the organization must consider if the functions are being performed identically in all
issuing facilities, are using identical information technology components, and are under the same
direct management control. For instance, an organization may have two sub-organizations, each
of which has distinct processes and management structures. The organization may decide to
establish two separate issuers, each with its own authorization boundary. In this example, two
separate assessments would be undertaken. Each assessment would result in an independent
authorization decision.

In drawing an authorization boundary, an organization may want to include only a subset of its
issuing facilities. For example, if a PCI has several facilities, some of which are ready for
operation and some that are still in the development stage, the organization may choose to define
the authorization boundary to include the PCI and only those facilities that are ready to be
assessed. If the authorization is successful, the PCI and a subset of its issuing facilities will be
authorized to operate and begin issuing PIV Cards. The remaining issuing facilities can continue
with implementation and be included in the authorization boundary at a later date.

In the case of outsourcing issuance services that are not under direct management control of the
organization nor physically located within its facilities, the organization must include the
functions provided by external service providers within the authorization boundary to make
certain that they are included within the scope of authorization. This assures that no matter how
and where the functions are performed, the organization maintains complete accountability for
the reliability of its PIV program. From an Issuer point of view, this translates to applying the
necessary due diligence process with respect to assessment of controls to ensure outsourced
functions are conducted in an acceptable and compliant manner.

Care should be used in defining the authorization boundary for the issuer. A boundary that is
unnecessarily expansive (i.e., including many dissimilar processes and business functions or
geographically dispersed facilities) makes the assessment and authorization process extremely
complex. Establishing a boundary and its subsequent authorization are organization-level
activities that should include participation of all key personnel. An organization should strive to

                                                 10
Special Publication 800-79-2                                           Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card Issuers
                                                                                        and Derived PIV Credential Issuers



define the authorization boundary of their issuer such that it strikes a balance between the costs
and benefits of assessment and authorization.

While the above considerations should be useful to an organization in determining the boundary
for purposes of authorization, they should not limit the organization’s flexibility in establishing a
practical boundary that promotes an effective [HSPD-12] compliant implementation. The scope
of an authorization is an issuer - that is a PCI or DPCI (whose boundaries are formed by included
issuing facilities) and not individual issuing facilities.

2.6 Issuer Roles and Responsibilities

PIV Card and Derived PIV Credential issuance roles and their processes are to be selected based
on the organization’s structure, its mission, and operating environment. The organization must
make sure that a separation of roles has been established and the processes are in compliance
with FIPS 201-2.

This document identifies roles and responsibilities of key personnel involved in the assessment
and authorization of an issuer.10 Recognizing that organizations have widely varying missions
and structures, there may be some differences in naming conventions for authorization-related
roles and in how the associated responsibilities are allocated among personnel (e.g. one
individual may perform multiple roles in certain circumstances).

2.6.1 Senior Authorizing Official (SAO)
The Senior Authorizing Official (see Figure 2) of an organization is responsible for all
operations. The SAO has budgetary control, provides oversight, develops policy, and has
authority over all functions and services provided by the issuer.

2.6.2 Designated Authorizing Official (DAO)
The Designated Authorizing Official has the authority within an organization to review all
assessments of an issuer and its facilities, and to provide an authorization decision as required by
[HSPD-12]. Through authorization, the DAO accepts responsibility for the operation of the
issuer at an acceptable level of risk to the organization. The SAO may also fulfill the role of the
DAO. The DAO shall not assume the role of the OIMO.

2.6.3 Organization Identity Management Official (OIMO)
The Organization Identity Management Official is responsible for implementing policies of the
organization, assuring that all PIV processes of the issuer are being performed reliably, and
providing guidance and assistance to the issuing facilities. The OIMO implements and manages
the operations plan; ensures that all roles are filled with capable, trustworthy, knowledgeable,
and trained staff; makes certain that all services, equipment, and processes meet FIPS 201-2
requirements; monitors and coordinates activities with Issuing Facility Manager(s); and supports
the authorization process.


10
  Organizations may define other significant roles (e.g., PIV System liaisons, operations managers) to support the authorization
 process.


                                                              11
Special Publication 800-79-2                                              Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card Issuers
                                                                                           and Derived PIV Credential Issuers



2.6.4 Issuing Facility Manager
An Issuing Facility Manager manages the day-to-day operations of an issuing facility. The
Issuing Facility Manager is responsible for implementing all operating procedures for those
functions that have been designated for that facility by the issuer. The Manager must ensure that
all PIV processes adhere to the requirements of FIPS 201-2, and that all PIV services performed
at the issuing facility are carried out in a consistent and reliable manner in accordance with the
organization’s policies and procedures and the OIMO’s direction. In some cases (e.g. small
organizations), the OIMO may fulfill the role of the Issuing Facility Manager.

2.6.5 Assessor
The Assessor is responsible for performing a comprehensive and 3rd-party assessment of an
issuer. The Assessor (usually supported by an assessment team) verifies the issuer’s PIV
processes comply with control objectives of FIPS 201-2. The OIMO reviews the assessment
findings and prepares recommended corrective actions to reduce or eliminate any discrepancies
or shortcomings prior to submission to the DAO for an authorization decision. The Assessor is
also responsible for providing recommendations for reducing or eliminating deficiencies and
security weaknesses, describing the potential impact of those deficiencies if not corrected. An
Assessor shall not be assigned the DAO’s role and vice versa.

To preserve the impartial and unbiased nature of the assessment, the Assessor must be a 3rd party
that is independent of the office(s) and personnel directly responsible for the day-to-day
operation of the issuer. The Assessor shall also be independent of those individuals responsible
for correcting deficiencies and discrepancies identified during the assessment phase. The
independence of the Assessor is an important factor in maintaining the credibility of the
assessment results and ensuring that the DAO receives objective information in order to make an
informed authorization decision.

2.6.6 Applicant Representative (AR)
The Applicant Representative is an optional role and may be established and used at the
discretion of the organization. The AR represents the interests of current or prospective
employees and contractors who are applicants for PIV Cards or Derived PIV Credentials. ARs
are responsible for assisting an applicant who is denied a PIV Card or Derived PIV Credential
because of missing or incorrect information, and for ensuring that all applicants obtain useful
information and assistance when needed. This role may be assigned to someone in the
organization’s personnel or human resources.

2.6.7 Privacy Official (PO)
The responsibilities of the Privacy Official are defined in FIPS 201-2. The person filling this role
shall not assume any other operational role within the issuer organization. The PO issues policy
guidelines with respect to collection and handling of personally identifiable information from
applicants so as to ensure that the issuer is in compliance with all relevant directives of the
privacy laws. The PO’s role may be filled by an organization’s existing official for privacy (e.g.,
a Chief Privacy Officer).11

11
     Privacy official refers to the Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP) or Chief Privacy Officer (CPO).



                                                                 12
Special Publication 800-79-2                                                         Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card Issuers
                                                                                                      and Derived PIV Credential Issuers



2.6.8 Role Assignment Policies
Although issuer roles are independent and should be filled by different people if feasible, there
may be a need (e.g., because of availability or economy) to have one person fill more than one
role. Except for the roles of Assessor, Privacy Official and separation of duty provision under
Section 2.6.2, one person may perform more than one role if needed. If an organization has
established multiple issuers, one person may be assigned the same role in several or all of them.
For instance, an Issuing Facility Manager may be responsible for a number of issuing facilities.
Of the roles described, the SAO, DAO, OIMO, AR, Assessor and PO must be employees of the
organization that owns the PCI or DPCI (e.g., Federal employees).

2.6.9 Assessment and Authorization Roles
Figure 2 illustrates a possible role structure when an issuer has multiple issuing facilities. The
SAO has the primary authority and responsibility for the issuing organization. Reporting to the
SAO are the OIMO and the DAO. An Issuing Facility Manager is responsible for managing
operations at each issuing facility and reports to the OIMO. The dotted lines leading to the PO
and the Assessor indicate their independence from the day to day operations of the issuer.

2.7 The Relationship between SP 800-79-2 and SP 800-37-1

While authorization is the major topic of both special publications, the goals of authorization are
different in [SP 800-37-1] and SP 800-79-2. Authorization compliant to [SP 800-37-1], as
mandated by Appendix III of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130,
focuses on “authorizing processing” of information systems based on an assessment of security
at the information system level. Authorization as discussed in this document and as mandated by
[HSPD-12] is concerned with the assessment of the “reliability” of an issuer to perform its

                                                                        13
Special Publication 800-79-2                            Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card Issuers
                                                                         and Derived PIV Credential Issuers



functions in accordance with FIPS 201-2. An authorization decision granted under [SP 800-37-1]
signifies that an organization official accepts responsibility for the security (in terms of
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information) of the information system.
Authorization of an issuer’s reliability under SP 800-79-2 indicates that the organization official
asserts that the issuer meets the control objectives and has the ability to operate within the
objectives outlined in [HSPD-12] for “secure and reliable forms of identification” within an
acceptable level of risk. However in both cases, the organization official (Authorizing Official
(AO) in the case of [SP 800-37-1], and DAO in the case of SP 800-79-2) is fully accountable for
any adverse impacts to the organization if a breach in security, privacy, or policy occurs.

SP 800-79-2 focuses on the authorization of an organization’s capability and reliability, but
depends on adequate security for all the supporting information systems that have been
authorized under [SP 800-37-1]. Therefore, before the organization official authorizes the issuer
and its facilities, all relevant PCI or DPCI information systems used must be authorized.

In many cases, authorization under [SP 800-37-1] will be granted by an organization official
different than the official responsible for authorizing the issuer. The former is an organization
official tasked with making a decision on whether to authorize operation of an information
system based on its security posture. The latter must be someone designated specifically for
authorizing the operation of an issuer after it has been assessed and determined to be compliant
with FIPS 201-2 control objectives.

2.8 Preparing for the Assessment of an Issuer

To facilitate an assessment of an issuer in a timely, efficient, and thorough manner, it is essential
that the staff of the issuer and members of the Assessment team understand their specific roles
and responsibilities, and participate as needed. The issuer, its facility personnel, and the team
responsible for performing the assessment must cooperate and collaborate to ensure the success
of the assessment. Specific responsibilities of the assessment team are listed below.

2.8.1 Issuer Duties
Before the assessment can begin, an Assessor must be designated. The Assessor conducts the
assessment and oversees the assessment team. The assessment team may be made up of
employees from the organization or personnel provided by a public or private sector entity
contracted to provide services. Members of the assessment team should have various capabilities
that are required to perform the activities specified in this document. Assessment team members
should work together to prepare for, conduct, and document the findings of the assessment
within the authorization boundary. Each team must be made up of individuals that collectively
have the knowledge, skills, training and abilities to conduct, evaluate, and document
assessments, including those performed on the information systems being used by the issuer.
Once an assessment team is in place, the OIMO and other relevant personnel should begin the
preparation for the assessment. Thorough preparations by both the issuer organization and the
assessment team are important aspects of conducting an effective assessment. The issuer sets the
stage for the assessment by identifying all appropriate personnel and making them available
during the assessment. A fundamental requirement for authorization is interviews by the
assessment team of all issuer personnel. Personnel and officials must be notified of the pending


                                                 14
Special Publication 800-79-2                           Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card Issuers
                                                                        and Derived PIV Credential Issuers



assessment, must understand their roles in the process, and must be made available in accordance
with the planned assessment schedule.

The OIMO must ensure that all relevant documentation has been completed and organized
before the assessment begins. This documentation includes policies and procedures,
organizational structure, information system architecture, product and vendor details, and
specifics regarding the implementation of all the requirements from FIPS 201-2 and related
publications. If the issuer has outsourced functions to an external service provider, all necessary
documentation must be obtained from the provider regarding the outsourced operations. Before
providing any documentation to the assessment team, the OIMO must review it to make certain it
is complete, current and approved.

Another significant activity during the assessment is the observation by the assessment team of
actual processes performed by the issuer. In order for the assessment team to confirm that
processes are implemented in accordance with the operations plan, the issuer organization will
need to ensure that assessment team members have access to facilities, and are able to observe
PIV processes in real time. This could include scheduling activities to observe identity proofing,
adjudication, card/token production, activation/issuance, and maintenance processes.

In order to aid the issuer’s planning and preparation for the assessment, Appendix C includes an
issuer readiness review checklist. This checklist contains items needed during the assessment
process. Satisfying the list of items before the assessment commences will facilitate efficient
utilization of the assessment team’s time, and will contribute towards the overall effectiveness of
the assessment activity.

2.8.2 Assessment Team Duties
The independence of the assessment team is an important factor in assessing the credibility of the
assessment results. In order to ensure that the results of the assessment are impartial and
unbiased, the members of the assessment team must not be involved in the development, day-to-
day maintenance, and operations of the issuer, or in the removal, correction, or remediation of
deficiencies.

The assessment team may obtain information during an assessment that the organization does not
want to disclose publicly. The assessment team has an obligation to safely and securely store and
protect the confidentiality of all security assessment related records and information, including
limiting access to the individuals that need to know the information. When using, storing, and
transmitting information related to the assessment, the assessment team shall follow the
guidelines established by the organization in addition to all relevant laws, regulations, and
standards regarding the need, protection, and privacy of information.

2.9 Authorization Decisions

An authorization decision is a judgment made by the DAO regarding authorizing operation of an
issuer and its facilities. The DAO reviews the results of the assessment, considers the impact to
the organization of any identified deficiencies, and then decides whether to authorize the
operation of the issuer and its facilities. In doing so, the DAO agrees to accept the security and
privacy risks of organization in issuing and maintaining PIV Cards or Derived PIV Credentials.

                                                15
Special Publication 800-79-2                                            Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card Issuers
                                                                                         and Derived PIV Credential Issuers



During the authorization decision process, the DAO must evaluate the assessment findings for
the issuer and for each issuing facility within the authorization boundary. If the issuer has
outsourced some of its services or functions, the DAO must review all relevant assessments and
authorizations that have been granted to the external service provider and include them as a part
of the overall evaluation of risk to the organization.

An authorization decision by a DAO must always be granted for a specific PCI or DPCI before
commencement of operations, and for each issuer there can be only one authorization decision.
In issuing this decision, the DAO must indicate the authorization boundary to which the
authorization applies. A DAO grants an authorization to an issuer, and then specifies which
facilities (along with any exceptions or restrictions) are permitted to operate under that
authorization. This allows the issuer and any authorized issuing facilities to begin operations
while any remaining facilities focus on addressing deficiencies identified during the assessment.
At a later date, these facilities can be reassessed. After reviewing the new findings, the DAO can
reissue the authorization for the issuer and expand the authorization boundary to which the
authorization applies by including the newly assessed facilities.

The major input to the authorization decision is the assessment report. To ensure the assessment
report is properly interpreted and the justification for the authorization decision properly
communicated, the DAO should meet with the Assessor, the OIMO, and the Issuing Facility
Manager(s) prior to issuing an authorization decision to discuss the assessment findings and the
terms and conditions of the authorization.

There are three authorization alternatives that can be rendered by the DAO:

          Authorization to operate;
          Interim authorization to operate; or
          Denial of authorization to operate.


2.9.1 Authorization to Operate (ATO)
If, after reviewing the results of the assessment phase, the DAO deems that the operations of the
issuer and its facilities conform to control objectives of FIPS 201-2 to an acceptable degree, and
will continue to do so reliably during the authorization validity period, an authorization to
operate (ATO) may be issued.12 The issuer and its issuing facilities are authorized to perform
services in compliance with all relevant policies, in conformance to all relevant standards, and in
accordance with the documented operations plan. The DAO shall indicate exactly which issuing
facilities are included in the ATO authorization decision. An ATO can only be granted to an
issuer if there are no limitations or restrictions imposed on any of its issuing facilities that are
included in the authorization boundary. The ATO is transmitted to the OIMO.

After receiving an ATO that conforms to SP 800-79-2, re-authorization shall be performed
within three (3) years or when there is a significant change in personnel or operating procedures
(includes both improvement and degradation of operations) or when additional issuing facilities

12
     Note The PCI/DPCI ATO can be affected by the underlying system authorization status (see Section 2.9.4).



                                                               16
Special Publication 800-79-2                                            Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card Issuers
                                                                                         and Derived PIV Credential Issuers



are being added to the issuer organization. There may also be cases where one or more issuing
facilities cease operation. If this situation results in a PIV service identified in the operations plan
becoming unavailable, then the DAO must issue a Denial of Authorization to Operate (DATO -
See Section 2.9.3). On the other hand, if the issuer can continue to provide all services in the
operations plan, then the authorization decision letter has to be modified to exclude those issuing
facilities that have ceased operations (thus revising the authorization boundary). The required re-
authorization activities are at the discretion of the DAO and based on the extent and type of
change.

2.9.2 Interim Authorization to Operate (IATO)
If, after reviewing the results of the assessment phase, the DAO deems the discrepancies to be
significant, but there is an overarching necessity to allow the issuer to operate, an interim
authorization to operate (IATO) may be issued.13 An interim authorization to operate is rendered
to an issuer when the identified deficiencies are significant, but can be addressed in a timely
manner. These deficiencies must be documented so that they can be addressed during the
planning of corrective actions. An interim authorization is an authorization to operate under
specific terms and conditions. The DAO shall indicate exactly which facilities are included in
the IATO authorization decision during this interim period, along with any limitations or
restrictions imposed. The maximum duration of an IATO is three (3) months. A maximum of
two (2) consecutive IATOs may be granted. Failure to correct deficiencies after the expiration of
the second IATO must result in an issuance of a denial of authorization to operate (DATO) for
the issuer. The authorization boundary may be revised to exclude issuing facilities that exhibit
significant deficiencies in performing their functions. The IATO is transmitted to the OIMO.

An issuer is not considered authorized during the period of an IATO. When the deficiencies
have been corrected, the IATO should be replaced with an ATO. Significant changes in the
status of an issuer (e.g. addition of new issuing facilities) that occur during the IATO period shall
be reported immediately to the DAO.

2.9.3 Denial of Authorization to Operate (DATO)
If, after reviewing the results of the assessment phase, the DAO deems operation of the issuer to
be unacceptable, a denial of authorization to operate (DATO) shall be transmitted to the OIMO.
Failure to receive authorization to operate indicates that there are major deficiencies in reliably
meeting the requirements of FIPS 201-2 and its related documents. The issuer is not authorized
and must not be allowed to operate. If issuance services are currently in operation, all functions
must be halted including all operations at the any issuing facility. If an issuer was previously
authorized and had issued PIV Cards or Derived PIV Credentials under an ATO, the OIMO
along with the Issuing Facility Manager(s) should consider whether a revocation of PIV Cards
and their Derived PIV Credentials are necessary. The DAO and the Assessor should work with
the OIMO and Issuing Facility Manager(s) to ensure that proactive measures are taken to correct
the deficiencies.

     Note The PCI/DPCI IATO can be affected by the underlying system authorization status (see Section 2.9.3).

                                                                                        and Derived PIV Credential Issuers



2.9.4 Authorization Impact of Information Systems under NIST SP 800-37-1
An issuer must not be authorized to operate if one or more of its critical information systems is
deemed insecure and therefore is issued a DATO according to [SP 800-37-1]. In the case where
an IATO (under [SP 800-37-1]) has been issued for an information system, the DAO may issue
no greater than an IATO for the issuer. Once the [SP 800-37-1] IATO is replaced with an [SP
800-37-1] ATO, the DAO can issue a SP 800-79-2 ATO. If the [SP 800-37-1] ATO expires for
one or more of information systems during the course of operation of an issuer, the OIMO shall
assess the criticality of the system for operations and present the analysis to the DAO. The DAO
then can exercise the following options:

        Specify a short time during which the information systems of the issuer must be re-
         authorized under [SP 800-37-1] without changing the ATO status;
        Downgrade the current SP 800-79-2 ATO to an IATO; or
        If circumstances warrant, issue a SP 800-79-2 DATO and halt all issuer operations.


2.10 The Use of Risk in the Authorization Decision

Authorization is the official management decision by the DAO to permit operation of an issuer
based on an assessment of its reliability and an acceptance of the risk inherent in that decision.
By granting an authorization to operate, the DAO accepts responsibility for the reliability of the
issuer and is fully accountable for any adverse impact to the organization or any other
organization from the use of issued PIV Card or Derived PIV Credentials.

The assessment of an issuer provides the DAO with the basis for not only determining its
reliability, but also for determining whether to accept the risk to the organization in granting an
ATO. As the requirements in FIPS 201-2 and related documents form the basis of the
authorization and are ultimately derived from the policy objectives of [HSPD-12], those not
reliably met by the issuer and its issuing facilities represent the potential for adverse impact.

Implementation of an [HSPD-12] program exposes an organization to specific risks at the
mission level of the organization. The PIV Card is used to establish assurance of an identity, and
as such, it must be trusted as a basis for granting access to the logical and physical resources of
the organization. Similarly, the Derived PIV Credential is also used to establish the assurance of
an identity, and must be trusted as a basis for granting access from mobile devices to the remote
IT resources of the organization. Any problem with an issued PIV Card or Derived PIV
Credential that undermines this assurance could expose an organization to harm. Furthermore,
the collection, processing, and dissemination of personal information is required to issue these
credentials and thereby increases the threat of this information being used for malicious
purposes14 if not secured. It is the DAO’s responsibility to weigh the risks of these and other
security and privacy impacts when making the authorization decision. Furthermore, as [HSPD-
12] is a government-wide mandate based on a standard of interoperability allowing organizations
to accept other organizations’ credentials, authorization decisions within a single organization

 process.

Special Publication 800-79-2                             Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card Issuers
                                                                          and Derived PIV Credential Issuers



directly impact other organizations. For example, an interoperable credential issued by an
authorized organization becomes the source of trust for another organization to grant access to
physical and logical resources, based on verification of that identity. The DAO’s signature on the
authorization letter thus signifies his/her acceptance of responsibility (i.e., accountability) for the
operations of the issuer, not only to the issuing organization, but also to other organizations that
are in the federated circle of trust.

2.11 Authorization Submission Package and Supporting Documentation

The authorization submission package documents the results of the assessment phase and
provides the DAO with the essential information needed to make a credible, risk-based decision
on whether to authorize operation of the issuer. Unless specifically designated otherwise by the
DAO, the OIMO is responsible for the assembly, compilation, and presentation of the
authorization submission package. The authorization submission package contains the following
documents:

       operations plan (including all Issuing Facilities Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
        and attachments);
       [SP 800-37-1] authorization letters;
       assessment report; and
       Corrective Actions Plan (CAP) (if required).

The operations plan contains the policies, procedures, and processes for all the major PIV
functional areas. The operations plan provides a complete picture of the structure, management,
and operations of an issuer to the Assessor and DAO. Appendix D provides templates of what to
include in the operations plan for PIV Card Issuers and for Derived PIV Credential Issuers. One
of the most significant pieces of information contained within the operations plan is the list of
issuer controls, how they were implemented, and who is responsible for their management. This
description of the issuer controls makes it a simple process for the Assessor to quickly ascertain
how they were implemented and by whom.

If certain functions described in the operations plan are outsourced, the operation plan can
reference or “point to” the external service provider’s operation plan and related documentation,
such as support agreements and any contracts. In this manner, the Assessor has access to the
information regarding the external service provider’s operations without requiring the issuer to
duplicate any documentation. Upon receiving and reviewing the authorization package and in
consultation with the Assessor, the DAO decides whether to authorize operations of the issuer.
The authorization decision letter transmits the authorization decision from the DAO to the
OIMO. The authorization decision letter contains the following information:

       Authorization decision;
       Supporting rationale for the decision; and
       Terms and conditions for the authorization, including which issuing facilities
        (Authorization Boundary) are included.

issuer is— (i) authorized to operate; (ii) authorized to operate on an interim basis; or (iii) not
authorized to operate. The supporting rationale includes the justification for the DAO’s decision.
The terms and conditions for the authorization provide a description of any limitations or
restrictions placed on the operation of the issuer, including which issuing facilities are included
in the decision. The authorization decision letter is attached to the authorization submission
package and becomes the authorization decision package.

The DAO sends the authorization decision package to the OIMO and retains a copy of it. The
OIMO carefully reviews the terms and conditions of authorization before initiating the necessary
steps for issuer operations. Both parties mark the authorization decision package appropriately
for storage under the organization’s record retention policy.

3. TAXONOMY OF ISSUER CONTROLS

3.1 Introducing Issuer Controls

Assessment of a PIV Card or Derived PIV Credential Issuer is a broader endeavor than
assessment of the security of an information system under [SP 800-37-1]. The requirements
specified in [FIPS201-2] cover all major aspects of an issuer, including organizational
preparedness; security management and data protection; infrastructure; and issuance processes.
Each broad area is defined herein as an Issuer Authorization Topic (IAT). In addition to
providing structure to the assessment, IATs are also used to summarize the assessment results for
reporting. In addition, they are used to structure the report to senior organization management
that provides an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses within an issuer organization.

The Issuer Authorization Topics (IAT):

          Organizational Preparedness relates to the capability, knowledge, and understanding of
           senior management regarding the formation and operation of the issuer. Roles and
           responsibilities must be clearly identified, and policies and procedures must be defined,
           documented, implemented, and enforced.

          Security Management & Data Protection involves implementing and operating
           appropriate security management procedures, operational controls, and technical
           protection measures to ensure that privacy requirements are satisfied, the rights of
           individuals are assured, and personal data is protected.

          Infrastructure Elements represents the activities required to procure, deploy, and
           maintain the information system components used for issuance of PIV Cards or Derived
           PIV Credentials tokens. These information system components (e.g., PKI, biometrics,
           card or token personalization, etc.) must meet the technical specifications defined in
           [FIPS 201-2] and related documents and need to be authorized under [SP 800-37-1] for
           FISMA compliance.

          Processes are classes of functions that collectively span the entire lifecycle activities,15
           such as sponsorship, identity proofing/registration, adjudication, card /token production,
           activation/issuance, and maintenance of the PIV Card and the Derived PIV Credential.

Each IAT is sub-divided into one or more Authorization Focus Areas. A focus area is a set of
closely-related requirements that need to be met by an issuer. Under each focus area is a
procedure or technical product (termed an “Issuer Control”) that is used to satisfy a particular
requirement listed under a focus area. However, the manner in which the requirements are
satisfied and how the specifications are implemented and managed may vary from organization
to organization.



15
     Note: Some of the processes may not apply to Derived PIV Credential issuers.



                                                                21
Special Publication 800-79-2                           Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card Issuers
                                                                        and Derived PIV Credential Issuers



For instance, each issuer (but not DPCI) is required to identity-proof their applicants (i.e., use
due diligence in validating the claimed identity of the applicant). This process can be
implemented in one of several ways, depending upon the structure, size, and geographical
distribution of the organization’s facilities. The process could be conducted at a central location
or distributed throughout the country within regional centers. It could be operated directly by the
organization or by an outside service provider. However, irrespective of the implementation
approach, this identity proofing/registration activity must be reliably and accurately performed.

The evidence that ensures the presence of issuer controls that are derived from FIPS 201-2
requirements and its related documents as well as OMB Memoranda, and verified through
appropriate assessments, establishes the capability of the issuer. However, authorization is
generally based not merely on the demonstration of capability, but also on the presence of certain
organizational characteristics that will provide a high degree of confidence to the Assessor that
the demonstrated capabilities will be carried out in a dependable and sustainable manner. This
dependability measure, or reliability (as it is generally called), has to be established by
adequately assessing that an issuer has the desired organizational characteristics, including
adequate issuing facilities, appropriate equipment, trained personnel, adequate resources,
trustworthy management, and properly vetted operations staff. Hence, the assessment and
authorization methodology includes a set of issuer controls, verification of which establishes the
reliability of the issuer. This set of controls is grouped under the IAT’s Authorization Focus Area
called - “Facility and Personnel Readiness”. These reliability-relevant issuer controls are
formulated, based on “commonly accepted security readiness measures” that have evolved in
response to lessons learned in security incidents that have taken place due to threats, such as
insider attacks, and risks, such as physical security lapses. In addition to the controls provided
herein, an organization may develop additional mission-specific controls that will contribute
towards the overall reliability of the issuer to meet the organization’s mission needs.

Table 1 provides a listing of the four Issuer Authorization Topics (IATs) and associated
Authorization Focus Areas under each topic:

                      Maintenance Process (MP)
                     Table 1 - IATs and Associated Authorization Focus Areas

Table G.1 and Table G.2 contain required issuer controls grouped by IAT and associated
Authorization Focus Area for a PCI and a DPCI respectively. Each issuer control represents how
one or more requirements from FIPS 201-2 and its related documents can be satisfied. Issuer
controls are sequentially numbered using the two-character identifier assigned to the
Authorization Focus Area under which they are listed. Identifiers for issuer controls applicable to
both PCIs and DPCIs are aligned for ease of reference. In addition, controls for DPCIs are
marked with (DC) for quick identification. For example, DO-1 applies to a PCI and DO(DC)-1
applies to a DPCI. Both these issuer controls are targeted at assessing the same requirement.

Table 2 shows the relationships between IATs, Authorization Focus Areas, and issuer controls
for a PIV Card Issuer.

Unlike for a PIV Card Issuer, not all issuer controls are applicable to a Derived PIV Credential
Issuer. Certain issuer controls are applicable to only Level of Assurance 3 (LOA-3) or to only
LOA-4 Derived PIV Credentials and therefore must be implemented by the issuer only if they
are issuing that level of a Derived PIV Credential. This is represented via the “applicability”
column within Table G.2 for DPCIs as seen in Table 3. Controls with an applicability column
marked with DPCI (e.g., without LOA-4 or 3 postfix) applies to both LOA-3 and LOA-4
Derived PIV Credential.

All issuer controls apply, regardless of an individual system’s FIPS 199 Standards for Security
Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems [FIPS199] impact level.
Furthermore, nothing precludes an issuer from implementing additional controls to ensure a
higher level of confidence in mitigating risks associated with issuing PIV Cards or Derived PIV
Credentials.

3.2 Implementing Issuer Controls

Each issuer control must be properly implemented, managed, and monitored in order for the
issuer to be authorized. Depending on how an organization decides to implement their [HSPD-
12] program, the authority to implement some of the controls may not directly come under the
management of the issuer organization (due to outsourcing of certain PIV processes or using the
issuing facilities of other organizations). However, it is still the responsibility of the
management of the issuer organization to ensure that these issuer controls are being deployed,
enforced, and maintained by its service provider.

3.2.1 Issuer Controls implemented at the Organization or Facility Level
The nature of each issuer control dictates where it is implemented. Controls that are common to
or impact multiple PIV processes are implemented at the organization level. The development of
the operations plan is an example of an issuer control implemented at the organizational level.
Generally, controls specific to a process are implemented at the issuing facility where that
process or function is carried out. For example, the control that states that a “1:1 biometric match
of the applicant against the biometric included in the PIV Card or in the PIV enrollment record


                                                      24

must be performed before releasing the PIV Card to the applicant” is implemented at an
activation/issuance facility.

For Derived PIV Credentials issued at LOA-3, an issuer may implement all the requirements
necessary to issue these credentials remotely. In such a case, the issuer may not need to have an
issuing facility and issuing facility-specific controls may not be applicable. Regardless of the
system and process architecture on how PIV Card and Derived PIV Credentials are issued, it is
the responsibility of issuer organization to ensure that all applicable controls are implemented.

4. ISSUER CONTROLS ASSESSMENT & AUTHORIZATION DECISION PROCESS

An assessment is a set of activities performed by the Assessor to gain assurance that the issuer
controls for a PIV Card Issuer or a Derived PIV Credential Issuer have been implemented
properly and meet their required function or purpose. Understanding the overall effectiveness of
the issuer controls implemented by the issuer and its facilities is essential in determining the risk
to the organization’s overall mission, and forms the basis for the authorization decision by the
Designated Authorizing Official.

An Assessor must– (i) compile evidence that the issuer controls are implemented correctly,
operating as intended, and producing the desired results; and (ii) present this evidence in a
manner such that the DAO can make a credible, risk-based decision about the operation of the
issuer.

The focus of an assessment is the issuer controls, each of which is designed to satisfy one or
more specific requirements from FIPS 201-2 and related documents. The objective for the
Assessor is to use the assessment procedures associated with each issuer control (described in
Appendix G) as a means to measure conformance to the requirements. The assessment
procedures are designed to facilitate the gathering of evidence that issuer controls are
implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome.

In preparation for an assessment, the Assessor performs the following two preparatory steps:

       Determination of the authorization boundary to understand the target of the assessment.
        The authorization boundary dictates which issuing facilities and outsourced services are
        to be included in the assessment.

       Review of the operations plan to determine which issuer controls are implemented at the
        organizational level and which at the facility level. This analysis should provide the
        Assessor with an understanding of where different responsibilities lie within the issuer
        organization and how to address them during the assessment.

In cases where PIV functions have been outsourced, the issuer is responsible for ensuring that the
external service provider has implemented the control. During the assessment, it is the service
provider’s responsibility to provide documentation to the Assessor regarding the implementation
of that control. If results from a previous assessment of the service provider (provided the current
assessment is part of re- authorization after substantial changes) can be referenced, the Assessor
may elect to incorporate these results (not exceeding one year) or re-do part or all of the
assessment. The extent of re-use of the results of the previous assessment is entirely at the
discretion of the Assessor.

Issuer controls implemented at the organizational level generally need to be assessed only once,
since these controls span across the entire issuer and its issuing facilities. In other words, these
controls may not be re-assessed when the authorization boundary changes (e.g., due to addition
of facilities). Examples of organizational level controls include the set of controls under the
authorization focus areas Preparation and Maintenance of Documentation (DO) and Assignment
of Roles and Responsibilities (RR).


                                                  26
Special Publication 800-79-2                            Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card Issuers
                                                                         and Derived PIV Credential Issuers



There are certain controls that although they are put in place at the organizational level, they
need to be reviewed at the issuing facility level. An example of such a control artifact is
“contingency/disaster recovery plan for information systems”. Though the development of the
contingency/disaster recovery plan is an organizational level control, a review of this control
artifact is needed whenever new information systems in the existing facilities or new facilities
are added to ensure that these new systems are brought within the scope of the plan.

Unlike organization level issuer controls, facility level issuer controls need to be assessed
individually at each facility. A facility is often designated based on the type of PIV process it
performs (exceptions are the Sponsorship Process and Adjudication Process). Hence, for
example, if there are multiple facilities for identify proofing/registration (e.g., multiple
registration centers), assessment of the issuer controls under the focus area identity
proofing/registration, should take place in each of the enrollment centers. However, if all
facilities are operating using uniform operational procedures and underlying information
systems, it is acceptable to perform assessments at facilities that are selected randomly or
through some other established criteria (e.g., geographical region or service provider).

Prior assessments may be used as a starting point for the assessment of an issuer. While past
assessments provide insight into the implementation and operation of an issuer, a number of
factors affect the validity of past assessments. These include updates in policies and procedures,
changes in systems/technology, and turnover in employees and contractors. Any significant
changes in one or more of these factors should trigger a new assessment. The Assessor must
validate whether the issuer is currently operating as expected using the given assessment
procedures, including specially tailored or augmented procedures. It is only through a current
valid assessment of issuer controls that the Assessor and Organization Identity Management
Official will have confidence in the reliability of the issuer and its issuing facilities.

The use of automated security controls, if reliably implemented and maintained in information
systems, results in a high assurance of the protection of information and other organizational
assets. Human involvement results in more variability in how issuer controls are implemented
and operated, as security and reliability depend on many factors, including an individual’s
training, knowledge, motivation, experience, and management. Relying on humans for data
protection, rather than on reliable, automated security mechanisms, makes it critical that trust and
reliability assessments of management, operators, and maintenance personnel are current and up-
to-date. Many of the assessment procedures rely on interactions among the Assessor, issuer
management, and facilities staff. Interviews with all involved personnel and observations of all
PIV processes are required. On-site visits, real-time observations, and reviews of processes are
essential, as the Assessor must not rely solely on documentation to determine if a given issuer
control has been implemented.

4.1 Assessment Methods

In order to assess the capability and reliability of an issuer, one or more assessment procedures
associated with each issuer control have to be completed. An assessment procedure is carried out
using one or more of the following assessment methods. (The assessment methods associated
with an assessment procedure are given in parenthesis in Table G.1 and Table G.2.)



                                                 27

                                                                                  and Derived PIV Credential Issuers



       Review – An evaluation of documentation that describes plans, policies, and procedures
        in order to verify that they are adequate, understood by management and operations
        personnel, and that they are in accordance with applicable policies, regulations,
        standards, technical guidelines, and organizational guidance.
       Interview – a directed conversation with one or more issuer personnel in which both pre-
        established and follow-on questions are asked, responses documented, discussion
        encouraged, and conclusions reached.
       Observe – a real-time viewing of PIV processes in operation, including all information
        system components of the issuer involved in creation, issuance, maintenance, and
        termination of PIV Cards or Derived PIV Credentials.
       Test – an evaluation of a component against a set of relevant PIV specifications using
        applicable test methods and metrics (as given in the associated assessment procedure in
        Table G.1 and Table G.2).

These methods are intended to provide the Assessor with sufficient, precise, accurate, and
relevant evidence regarding an IAT topic and its focus areas. One or more assessment methods
may be required to determine if the issuer has satisfactorily met the objective outlined for that
assessment procedure. Assessment results are used by the Assessor to determine the overall
effectiveness of the issuer control.

Table 4 shows an example of the relationships among an IAT, an Authorization Focus Area,
several issuer controls, and their assessment procedures. Controls with an applicability column
marked with DPCI (e.g., without LOA-4 or 3 postfix) applies to both LOA-3 and LOA-4
Derived PIV Credentials.

           Table 4 – Sample Issuer Controls with Assessment Procedures (for DPCI)

Some organizations may need to customize some of the issuer controls to meet their specific
characteristics and mission needs. In such cases, the associated assessment procedures may also
have to be customized/augmented to ensure proper implementation of these controls.

4.2 The Issuer Assessment Report

The Assessment report contains the results of the assessment in a format that facilitates
reviewing by the DAO. The DAO must evaluate the information in the Assessment Report in
order to make a sound, credible decision regarding the residual risk of authorizing the operations
of the issuer.

An Assessment Report template is provided in Appendix E. The report is organized by
Authorization Focus Area. For each issuer control, it must be documented as to which entity is

responsible for the implementation of that control (the organization or an external service
provider) and if the issuer control is at the organizational or facility level.

 Activation/Issuance Process

  Issuer Control Identifier— AI-7
 Control Description— Before the PIV Card is provided to the applicant, the issuer performs a
 1:1 biometric match of the applicant against biometrics available on the PIV Card or in the
 chain-of-trust. The 1:1 biometric match requires either a match of fingerprint(s) or, if
 unavailable, other optional biometric data that are available. If the match is unsuccessful, or if no
 biometric data is available, the cardholder provides two identity source documents (as specified
 in FIPS 201-2, Section 2.7), and an attending operator inspects these and compares the
 cardholder with the facial image printed on the PIV Card.
 Control Owner/ Control Level — External Service Provider/Facility Level
 ASSESSMENT DETAILS

          Assessment Method(s):
          Review: Operations Plan
          Observe: Activation/Issuance Process
 Assessment Result— Partially Satisfied
 Assessment Findings— There is operational evidence that a 1:1 biometric match is carried out
 before the card is released to the applicant.
 Assessment Deficiency and Potential Impact— The requirement to carry out this task is not
 documented clearly enough in the operations plan. Although personnel are knowledgeable about
 this requirement, and the task was observed to be performed correctly during card issuance, the
 lack of documentation could be a problem if there is turnover in staff. Alternate processes when
 fingerprints are unavailable are not in place.
 Recommendation— Update the issuance process description within the operations plan to
 include a clear description of this task in the process and develop alternate processes for issuance
 when fingerprints are not available.

                  Figure 4 - Sample Issuer Control Assessment Result (for PCI)

The assessment result for each issuer control shall be one of the following:
    Satisfied
    Partially Satisfied
    Not Satisfied
    Not Applicable

After carrying out an assessment procedure, the Assessor records his/her conclusion in one of
two ways: MET, NOT MET. Using the list of conclusions pertaining to assessment procedures
associated with an issuer control, the assessment result (which is one of the 4 outcomes listed
above) is arrived at as follows:
       If the conclusion from all assessment procedures is MET, then the assessment result for
        the issuer control is “Satisfied”
       If some of the conclusions are NOT MET, then the assessment result for the issuer
        control is marked as either “Partially Satisfied” or “Not Satisfied”, depending on whether
        or not any of the underlying tasks in the assessment procedures are critical (i.e., they
        represent the only way to meet the issuer control’s objective). An example of an
        assessment that resulted in “Partially Satisfied” is given in Figure 4. In this instance, there
        is an awareness of a task requirement, and the task itself is being carried out, but the
        reference to the task is missing in the document.

In drawing a conclusion after carrying out an assessment procedure, the Assessor must consider
the potential subjective and objective aspects of the assessment methods used (e.g., interviews,
document reviews, observations, and tests) for that assessment procedure. Deficiencies that
result in “Partially Satisfied” or “Not Satisfied” must be reported by the Assessor. The Assessor
must also outline the potential adverse impacts if the issuer control is deployed with the
identified deficiencies.

The assessment report template provides the means for recording the assessment result for each
issuer control. The assessment results for all issuer controls are aggregated to generate the
assessment result for an Issuer Authorization Focus area. The set of Issuer Authorization Focus
Area results are aggregated to generate Issuer Authorization Topic results. Finally, the group of
Issuer Authorization Topic results is used to generate the overall Issuer Assessment Report and
an accompanying Executive Summary (intended for Senior Management).

5.0 ASSESSMENT & AUTHORIZATION LIFECYCLE
The authorization of a PIV Card Issuer (PCI) or a Derived PIV Credential Issuer (DPCI) consists
of four phases: (i) Initiation; (ii) Assessment; (iii) Authorization; and (iv) Monitoring. Each
phase consists of tasks and sub-tasks that are to be carried out by the responsible officials (e.g.,
the Designated Authorizing Official (DAO), Assessor, Organization Identity Management
Official (OIMO), and Issuing Facility Manager(s)). Figure 5 provides a view of the
authorization phases, including the tasks associated with each phase. A table of authorization
phases, tasks, sub-tasks, and the official responsible for each is provided in Appendix H.

                      Figure 5 - Assessment & Authorization Lifecycle Phases


5.1 Initiation Phase

The Initiation Phase consists of three tasks: (i) preparation; (ii) resource identification; and (iii)
operations plan analysis and acceptance. The primary purpose of this phase is to ensure that the
issuer is prepared for the assessment, including having all the resources and documentation in
place. The other purpose of this phase is to include the DAO early in the process in order to
assure success of the assessment and authorization.
        Task 1: Preparation
The objectives of this task are to prepare for authorization by reviewing the operations plan and
confirming that the plan is consistent with [FIPS201-2] and the template provided in Appendix
D.



                                                    32
Special Publication 800-79-2                             Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card Issuers
                                                                          and Derived PIV Credential Issuers



                 Subtask 1.1: Confirm that the operations of the issuer have been fully described
                 and documented in their operations plan.
                 Responsibility: OIMO
                 Guidance: The operation plan includes, at a minimum, the sections defined in the
                 operations plan template in Appendices D.1 or D.2 depending on whether the
                 issuer is issuing PIV Cards or Derived PIV Credentials. An issuer of both PIV
                 Cards and Derived PIV Credentials may develop a single operations plan that
                 addresses both without repeating common elements. It is the OIMO’s
                 responsibility to ensure that the organization’s operations plan incorporates a
                 complete and accurate description of the issuer’s operations. If a process or
                 function is provided by an external service provider, their operating procedures
                 should be documented and incorporated by reference in the issuer’s operations
                 plan. In this case, the operations plan includes a pointer, guiding the reader to
                 additional documentation and information.

                 Subtask 1.2: Confirm that processes performed are conducted in accordance
                 with the policies and procedures specified in the issuer’s operations plan and are
                 documented in standard operating procedures.
                 Responsibility: OIMO, Issuing Facility Manager
                 Guidance: Even though an issuer may be following requirements from FIPS
                 201-2, their processes need to be consistent within their operations plan and
                 documented in standard operating procedures.

        Task 2: Resource Identification
The objectives of the resource identification task are to– (i) identify and document the resources
required for assisting with the assessment; (ii) identify the scope of the assessment and
authorization boundary; and (iii) prepare a plan of assessment activities indicating the proposed
schedule and key milestones.

                 Subtask 2.1: Identify the Senior Authorizing Official (SAO), Designated
                 Authorizing Official (DAO), Privacy Official (PO), Issuing Facility Managers,
                 Assessor, and other key personnel at the facility level who are performing
                 functions, such as identity proofing/registration, card production, and
                 activation/issuance. Maintenance personnel also should be contacted to provide
                 requested assessment information to the Assessor.
                 Responsibility: OIMO
                 Guidance: Notify these individuals of the upcoming assessment, and inform
                 them of the need for their participation during the process.

                 Subtask 2.2: Determine the authorization boundary for the issuer.
                 Responsibility: OIMO; DAO
                 Guidance: The authorization boundary determines the target of the assessment.
                 In preparation for the issuer assessment, the OIMO and DAO should identify
                 which issuing facilities and external service providers are to be included. This

                                                  33
Special Publication 800-79-2                              Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card Issuers
                                                                           and Derived PIV Credential Issuers



                 ensures that functions performed and processes managed by the external service
                 provider are considered during the authorization process. An organization may
                 want to include only those issuing facilities that are ready to operate; other
                 facilities can be assessed at a later date.

                 Subtask 2.3: Determine the resources and the time needed for the assessment of
                 the issuer, and prepare a plan for execution of the assessment.
                 Responsibility: OIMO; DAO
                 Guidance: The level of effort required for an assessment depends on numerous
                 factors— (i) the size of the issuer; (ii) the location and number of its facilities;
                 (iii) the level of outsourcing utilized by the issuer; and (iv) the number of cards
                 and/or derived credentials being, or to be issued. By examining factors that could
                 influence the complexity of the assessment, the organization can make informed
                 judgments about the size of the assessment team, the resources needed to support
                 the assessment, and the time-frame for completing it.

        Task 3: Operations Plan Analysis and Acceptance
The objectives of the operations plan analysis and acceptance task are: (i) determine if the
requirements of FIPS 201-2 have been implemented; (ii) evaluate the operations plan and revise
as needed; and (iii) obtain acceptance of the plan by the DAO prior to conducting an assessment
of the issuer controls.

                 Subtask 3.1: Review the list of required issuer controls documented in the
                 organization’s operation plan and then confirm that they have been implemented
                 properly.
                 Responsibility: DAO; OIMO
                 Guidance: Since the issuer controls serve as the basis for the assessment, review
                 the operations plan and supporting documentation to identify the controls that
                 must be implemented before investing time in assessment activities such as
                 interviews or testing. The operations plan must document each issuer control,
                 whether it is organization or facility specific, the owner of the issuer control, and
                 how the control is implemented.

                 Subtask 3.2: Analyze the operations plan to determine if there are deficiencies
                 in satisfying all the policies, procedures, and other requirements in FIPS 201-2
                 that could result in a Denial of Authorization to Operate (DATO) being issued.
                 After discussing the discovered deficiencies in the documentation and operations
                 plan with the OIMO, the organization may still want to continue with the
                 assessment, if it has determined that it can address all deficiencies within the time
                 period of the current assessment. In this situation, the DAO can either authorize
                 continuation of the assessment or terminate the assessment effort depending upon
                 the evaluation of the issuer’s ability to address the deficiencies.
                 Responsibility: DAO, OIMO
                 Guidance: The operations plan should adequately specify the policies,
                 procedures, and processes of the issuer so that, subsequent to an initial review,
                                                   34
Special Publication 800-79-2                             Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card Issuers
                                                                          and Derived PIV Credential Issuers



                 deficiencies that could lead to an eventual DATO may be identified and
                 remediated as soon as possible.

                 Subtask 3.3: Verify that the operations plan is acceptable.
                 Responsibility: DAO
                 Guidance: If the operations plan is deemed acceptable, the DAO should
                 authorize the authorization processes to advance to the next phase. Acceptance of
                 the operations plan signifies that the resources required to initiate and complete
                 the authorization activities may be deployed.

5.2 Assessment Phase

The Assessment Phase consists of two tasks— (i) issuer control assessment; and (ii) assessment
documentation. The purpose of this phase is to determine the extent to which the requirements of
FIPS 201-2 are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired
outcomes. This phase also specifies actions to be taken to correct all identified deficiencies. An
analysis of the impact of identified deficiencies that cannot be corrected or mitigated efficiently
on the reliable operation of the issuer should be conducted and documented. Successful
completion of this phase should provide the DAO with the information needed to make an
appropriate authorization decision.

        Task 4: Issuer Control Assessment
The objectives of this task are to— (i) initiate and conduct an assessment of the issuer controls;
and (ii) document the results of the assessment. The Assessor shall first verify the acceptability
of all documentation, including the operations plan and previous assessments, along with all
relevant Federal laws, regulations, standards, and directives. Issuer control assessment should
then commence. The Assessor should schedule interviews, schedule real-time observations of
issuance processes, and initiate all needed testing of the PIV Card, Derived PIV Credential and
relevant information system components. Once the Assessor has gathered the results of the
assessment procedures, descriptions of all discovered deficiencies shall be prepared, along with
recommendations for removing these deficiencies.

                 Subtask 4.1: Review the suggested and selected assessment methods for each
                 issuer control in preparation for the assessment.
                 Responsibility: Assessor
                 Guidance: Based on the authorization boundary, the scope of the assessment
                 should be established. The Assessor should review the selected assessment
                 procedures (based on the scope of the assessment) in order to plan and coordinate
                 activities for the assessment. For instance, if a particular issuer control requires
                 the observation of a particular process, the Assessor will need to schedule this
                 activity in a timely fashion after coordinating it with the issuing facility
                 management. The Assessor, as directed by the DAO, may supplement the
                 assessment methods and procedures recommended in these guidelines.
                 Assessment methods and procedures may be created or tailored for a particular
                 issuer.

                                                  35
Special Publication 800-79-2                              Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card Issuers
                                                                           and Derived PIV Credential Issuers



                 Subtask 4.2: Assemble all documentation and supporting materials necessary
                 for the assessment of the issuer; if these documents include previous assessments,
                 review the findings and determine if they are applicable to the current assessment.
                 Responsibility: OIMO; Assessor
                 Guidance: The OIMO assists the Assessor in gathering all relevant documents
                 and supporting materials from the organization that will be required during the
                 assessment of the issuer. Central to this effort is the operations plan. The issuer’s
                 operations shall be completely described in the operations plan. The operations
                 plan may include by reference, or point to, the supporting materials. In this case,
                 the OIMO will also need to gather this supporting material for the Assessor.
                 Examples of other documentation include: (i) letters of appointment; (ii) privacy-
                 related documentation; (iii) information forms utilized by the issuer; (iv)
                 documentation from each outsourced service provider, including control
                 implementation specifics, support and service level agreements, and contracts; (v)
                 standard operating procedures for the issuing facilities within the authorization
                 boundary is; and (vi) signed authorization letters under [SP 800-37-1] for all
                 information systems.
                 When previous assessments exist, including the one on which the current
                 Authorization to Operate (ATO) is based, the Assessor is strongly encouraged to
                 review these results. The Assessor may satisfy some of the issuer control
                 assessment requirements by reviewing and referencing previous assessment
                 report(s). Although previous assessments cannot be used as a substitute for the
                 current assessment, they provide a snapshot view of the issuer and highlight
                 problems that may have existed in the past.

                 Subtask 4.3: Assess the required issuer controls using the prescribed assessment
                 procedures found in Table G.1 and Table G.2 based on the scope of the issuance
                 functions.
                 Responsibility: Assessor
                 Guidance: The Assessor performs the assessment procedures selected for each
                 issuer control to assess if they have been implemented correctly, are operating as
                 intended, and producing the desired outcomes. The Assessor uses the assessment
                 methods specified in Section 4.1. Documentation collected in the previous task is
                 reviewed, and any deficiencies are identified. Interviews can be used as an
                 opportunity to clarify issues encountered during a review of the issuer’s
                 documentation, as well as to determine the expertise of the personnel performing
                 key PIV functions. Processes need to be observed to ensure that they are being
                 followed as documented and tests executed to determine if the PIV components
                 have been configured and are operating in a PIV-compliant manner.
                 As part of an assessment all applicable issuer controls need to be assessed. If PIV
                 services have been outsourced to an external provider, the Assessor shall verify
                 that the issuer controls applying to those services have been assessed, and the
                 reliability of the service provider has been found satisfactory. If an issuer and its
                 facilities have already been assessed and are operating under a current ATO, and
                 the purpose of the assessment is to add a facility(s) to the authorization letter, the
                                                   36
Special Publication 800-79-2                            Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card Issuers
                                                                         and Derived PIV Credential Issuers



                 Assessor may reuse the results of a previous assessment for the organization level
                 issuer controls and then assess a random sample of the new issuing facilities.

                 Subtask 4.4: Prepare the assessment report.
                 Responsibility: Assessor
                 Guidance: The assessment report contains— (i) the results of the assessment; (ii)
                 recommendations for correcting deficiencies; and (iii) the residual risk to the
                 organization if those deficiencies are not corrected or mitigated. The assessment
                 report is the Assessor’s statement of the results of analyzing and evaluating the
                 issuer’s implementation of controls. The sample assessment report template in
                 Appendix E should be used as a format for documenting the results after assessing
                 the issuer controls.
        Task 5: Assessment Documentation
This task consists of the Assessor submitting the assessment report to the OIMO and the latter
adding the issuer’s operations plan (revised if necessary) and the corrective actions plan (CAP)
to generate an authorization submission package for the DAO. In situations where the assessment
report contains deficiencies, the OIMO may choose to address some deficiencies based on the
recommendations by the Assessor and revise the operations plan (if needed), even before
submitting the package for authorization.

                 Subtask 5.1: Provide the OIMO with the assessment report.
                 Responsibility: Assessor
                 Guidance: The OIMO relies on the expertise, experience, and judgment of the
                 Assessor to: (i) provide recommendations on how to correct deficiencies in the
                 planned or performed operations; and (ii) to understand the potential impacts of
                 those deficiencies. The OIMO may choose to act on selected recommendations of
                 the Assessor before the authorization package is finalized. To optimize the
                 utilization of resources organization-wide, any actions taken by the OIMO prior to
                 the final authorization decision must be coordinated with the DAO. The Assessor
                 reviews any changes made in response to the corrective actions and revises the
                 assessment report, as appropriate.

                 Subtask 5.2: Revise the operations plan (if necessary) and implement its new
                 provisions.
                 Responsibility: OIMO
                 Guidance: The revised operations plan must include all changes made in
                 response to recommendations for corrective actions from the Assessor.

                 Subtask 5.3: Prepare the corrective actions plan (CAP).
                 Responsibility: OIMO
                 Guidance: The CAP, one of the three primary documents in the authorization
                 submission package, describes actions that must be taken by the OIMO to correct
                 deficiencies identified in the Assessment phase. The CAP identifies— (i) the

                                                 37
Special Publication 800-79-2                              Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card Issuers
                                                                           and Derived PIV Credential Issuers



                 tasks to be accomplished; (ii) the resources required to accomplish the tasks; (iii)
                 scheduled completion dates for the tasks, and (iv) the person designated as
                 responsible for completing each of the tasks.

                 Subtask 5.4: Assemble the authorization submission package and submit to the
                 DAO.
                 Responsibility: OIMO
                 Guidance: The OIMO is responsible for the assembly and compilation of the
                 authorization submission package with inputs from the OIMO. The authorization
                 submission package shall contain: (i) the final assessment report; (ii) the CAP;
                 (iii) the revised operations plan; and (iv) the [SP 800-37-1] authorization letters
                 for all information systems used by the issuer. The OIMO may wish to consult
                 other key organization participants (e.g., the Assessor, PO) prior to submitting the
                 authorization submission package to the DAO. The authorization submission
                 package can be submitted in either paper or electronic form. The contents of the
                 authorization submission package must be protected in accordance with
                 organization policy.

5.3 Authorization Phase

The Authorization Phase consists of two tasks— (i) making an appropriate authorization
decision; and (ii) completing the authorization documentation. Upon completion of this phase,
the OIMO will have— (i) an authorization to operate the issuer’s services as defined in its
operations plan; (ii) an interim authorization to operate under specific terms and conditions; or
(iii) a denial of authorization to operate.

        Task 6: Authorization Decision
The authorization decision task determines if the assessment phase has been satisfactorily
completed so that a recommendation concerning the operation of the issuer can be made with
assurance. The DAO, working with the Assessor, reviews the contents of the assessment
submission package, the identified and uncorrected or un-correctable deficiencies, the potential
impacts on each organization using the issuer’s services, and the CAP in determining the final
risk to the organization(s) and the acceptability of that risk in light of the organization’s mission.

                 Subtask 6.1: Review the authorization decision package to see if it is complete
                 and that all applicable issuer controls have been fully assessed using the
                 designated assessment procedures.
                 Responsibility: DAO
                 Guidance: Coverage for all issuer controls and proper adherence to assessment
                 procedures and appropriate assessment methods helps to create confidence in
                 assessment findings and is the main objective of the assessment review. Part of
                 the assessment review also includes understanding the impact of the identified
                 deficiencies on the organization’s operations, assets, and individuals.
                 Subtask 6.2: Determine if the risk to the organization’s operations, assets, or
                 potentially affected individuals is acceptable.

                                                   38
Special Publication 800-79-2                             Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card Issuers
                                                                          and Derived PIV Credential Issuers



                 Responsibility: DAO
                 Guidance: After the completion of the assessment review, the DAO has a clear
                 understanding of the impact of deficiencies. This helps the DAO to judge which
                 deficiencies are of greatest concern to the organization and which can be tolerated
                 without creating unreasonable organization-level risk. The CAP is also considered
                 in determining the risk to the organization in terms of when and how the OIMO
                 intends to address the known deficiencies. The DAO may consult the OIMO,
                 Assessor, or other organization officials before completing the final risk
                 evaluation. This risk evaluation in turn determines the degree of acceptability of
                 issuer operations. The logic for using the latter as the basis for an authorization
                 decision is described in Section 2.9.

                 Subtask 6.3: Provide the authorization package to an independent party for
                 review and arrive at an authorization decision.
                 Responsibility: DAO
                 Guidance: Before providing the final authorization decision, the DAO seeks an
                 independent review of the risks involved its issuer operations. The DAO shares
                 the results of the assessment and the perceived risks with another issuer (e.g.,
                 another agency that issues PIV Cards or Derived PIV Credentials) to get their
                 opinion and establish trustworthiness in the issued credentials.


        Task 7: Authorization Documentation
The authorization documentation task includes— (i) completing and transmitting the
authorization decision package to the appropriate individuals and organizations; and (ii) updating
the issuer’s operations plan.

                 Subtask 7.1: Provide copies of the authorization decision package, in either
                 paper or electronic form, to the OIMO and any other organization officials having
                 interests, roles, or responsibilities in the issuer’s operations.
                 Responsibility: DAO
                 Guidance: The authorization decision package, including the authorization
                 decision letter, should be transmitted to the OIMO. Upon receipt of the
                 authorization decision package, the OIMO must review the authorization and its
                 terms and conditions. The original authorization decision package must be kept on
                 file by the OIMO. The DAO shall retain copies of the contents of the
                 authorization decision package. The authorization decision package must be
                 appropriately safeguarded and stored, whenever possible, in a centralized
                 organization filing system to ensure accessibility. The authorization decision
                 package shall be available to authorized auditors and oversight organizations upon
                 request. The authorization decision package must be retained in accordance with
                 the organization’s records retention policy. The issuer and specific facilities are
                 authorized for a maximum of three (3) years from the date of the ATO. After the
                 period ends, re-authorization must be performed.

                                                                          and Derived PIV Credential Issuers



                 Subtask 7.2: Update the operations plan.
                 Responsibility: OIMO
                 Guidance: The operations plan must be updated to reflect all changes made as the
                 result of assessment and authorization. All conditions of issuer’s operations that
                 are set forth in the authorization decision must also be noted in the plan.

5.4 Monitoring Phase

The Monitoring Phase consists of two tasks— (i) operations plan maintenance; and (ii) annual
lifecycle walkthrough. Based on the importance of reliably creating and issuing PIV Cards and
Derived PIV Credentials, it is imperative that once the authorization is completed, the issuer is
monitored to ensure that policies, procedures, and processes remain in effect as originally
intended. There can be significant changes in an issuer’s policies, management, operations
personnel, and available technology during a three-year ATO. These changes must be monitored
so that the organization minimizes exposing itself to security and privacy threats existing or
arising after the authorization. For example, if there is a significant staff turnover, the
organization must be sure that the new staff is performing the PIV functions using the same
reliable processes that were previously approved. The overall responsibility for monitoring lies
with the OIMO and the DAO.

In order to facilitate the monitoring of an issuer without undue burden in activities and
paperwork, only two activities are required during this phase: maintenance of the operations plan
and an annual lifecycle walkthrough of issuer operations. The latter entails reviewing all the
services and functions of an issuer and its facilities for continued reliability. The annual
walkthrough must cover a PIV Card’s and/or Derived PIV Credential’s lifecycle from
sponsorship to maintenance. Observation of the full lifecycle ensures that all processes are still
reliably operating as assessed during the authorization.

        Task 8: Operations Plan Update
An operations plan is the primary description of what and how PIV Card and/or Derived PIV
Credential issuing services are provided by the issuer. It is essential that this document be
updated as changes occur in the issuer’s operations. Management will be able to analyze the
impact of changes as they occur and will be significantly better prepared when re-authorization is
required.

                 Subtask 8.1: Document all relevant changes in the issuance processes within the
                 operations plan.
                 Responsibility: OIMO
                 Guidance: In addition to the policies, procedures, and processes that must be
                 documented if changes are made, the organization shall update the operations plan
                 if changes to the information system, the PIV Card, Derived PIV Credential,
                 privacy policies, roles and responsibilities, or issuer controls are made.
                 Subtask 8.2: Analyze the proposed or actual changes to the issuer and determine
                 the impact of such changes.
                 Responsibility: OIMO
                                                  40

                                                                            and Derived PIV Credential Issuers



                 Guidance: If the results of the impact analysis indicate that changes to the issuer
                 could affect the reliability of its operations, the changes and impact on the issuer
                 must be reported to the DAO, corrective actions must be initiated, and the CAP
                 must be updated. In instances where major changes have occurred, the issuer
                 must be re-authorized.
        Task 9: Annual Lifecycle Walkthrough
The annual lifecycle walkthrough is a monitoring activity to be performed initially by the issuer
when its PIV Card and/or Derived PIV Credential issuing services begin, and annually thereafter.
The OIMO (or designated appointee) is responsible for observing and reviewing the entire
lifecycle of the PIV Card and/or the Derived PIV Credential. This walkthrough should provide
an accurate snapshot of the issuer’s operations and reliability at a point in time. By walking
through the lifecycle, from sponsorship to issuance, including maintenance, the operations of an
issuer can be examined as an integrated entity. During the walkthrough, the OIMO (or
designated appointee) shall observe all processes involving the PIV Card or Derived PIV
Credential, comparing them against the requirements defined in the issuer controls. This activity
shall be performed every year after each authorization until re- authorization begins. All
identified deficiencies in reliable operations shall be sent to the DAO for review and analysis.
Any potential impact to the reliability of the issuer’s operations and risk to the organization shall
be documented and presented to the OIMO and the DAO.

                 Subtask 9.1: Observe all the processes involved in getting a PIV Card or a
                 Derived PIV Credential, including those from sponsorship to maintenance.
                 Observe each process and compare its controls against the applicable list of
                 required issuer controls. If an issuer has several facilities, this process should be
                 repeated using randomly selected issuing facilities.
                 Responsibility: OIMO (or designated appointee)
                 Guidance: As part of the walkthrough, the OIMO (or designated appointee)
                 observes the processes followed for new employees and contractors (if different)
                 as well any maintenance processes, such as termination, reissuance, or renewals.
                 The OIMO (or designated appointee) observes each process and compares it
                 against the documented steps for the issuer and the associated issuer controls. An
                 annual walkthrough is required until re-authorization is initiated.
                 Subtask 9.2: The results of the lifecycle walkthrough are summarized in a report
                 to the DAO. Deficiencies must be highlighted, along with corrective actions that
                 must be implemented to correct any deficiencies.
                 Responsibility: OIMO, DAO
                 Guidance: The OIMO (or designated appointee) shall document the results of
                 the walkthrough. The results shall be recorded in the assessment report template
                 included in Appendix E. All deficiencies should be highlighted, and a plan for
                 correcting each deficiency shall be documented. The DAO shall decide if any
                 deficiency is significant enough to require a change of the issuer’s authorization-
                 to-operate status.

APPENDIX D: OPERATIONS PLAN TEMPLATES

Appendices D.1 and D.2 are suggested outlines for a PIV Card Issuer (PCI) and a Derived PIV
Credential Issuer (DPCI) respectively. It is highly recommended that an organization follow
these templates to document its operations comprehensively and to the full extent as needed to
support a successful authorization. An issuer of both PIV Cards and Derived PIV Credentials
may develop a single operations plan that addresses all requirements without repeating common
elements of the plan.

APPENDIX E: ASSESSMENT REPORT TEMPLATE

Below is a template to use when generating the assessment report. This is to be completed for
each issuer control. An example using a specific issuer control follows.

Issuer Control Identifier— AI-7
Control Description— Before the PIV Card is provided to the applicant, the issuer performs a 1:1
biometric match of the applicant against biometrics available on the PIV Card or in the chain-of-
trust. The 1:1 biometric match requires either a match of fingerprint(s) or, if unavailable, other
optional biometric data that are available. If the match is unsuccessful, or if no biometric data is
available, the cardholder provides two identity source documents (as specified in [FIPS 201-2],
Section 2.7), and an attending operator inspects these and compares the cardholder with the
facial image printed on the PIV Card.

Assessment Result— Partially Satisfied
Assessment Findings— There is operational evidence that a 1:1 biometric match is carried out
before the card is released to the applicant.
Assessment Deficiency and Potential Impact— The requirement to carry out this task is not
documented clearly enough in the operations plan. Although personnel are knowledgeable about
this requirement, and the task was observed to be performed correctly during card issuance, the
lack of documentation could be a problem if there is turnover in staff. Alternate processes when
fingerprints are unavailable are not in place.
Recommendation— Update the issuance process description within the operations plan to
include a clear description of this task in the process and develop alternate processes for issuance
when fingerprints are not available.

Subject: Authorization Submission Package for [PCI / DPCI]


An assessment of the [PCI/DPCI NAME] located at [PCI/DPCI Location and Issuing Facility
Locations] has been conducted in accordance with NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-79-2,
Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card Issuers and Derived PIV Credential Issuer and the
[ORGANIZATION] policy on authorization. The attached authorization package contains— (i) the
operations plan; (ii) the assessment report; (iii) a corrective actions plan (CAP); and (iv) an [SP
800-37-1] authorization letter for each information system within the [PCI/DPCI].

The operations plan, its policies, procedures, and processes have been assessed by [ASSESSOR]
using the assessment methods and procedures defined in SP 800-79-2 and specified in the
assessment report to determine the extent to which the requirements under [HSPD-12] and [FIPS
201-2] are exhibited. The CAP describes the corrective actions that we plan to perform to
remove or reduce any remaining deficiencies detected in our operations.

To: Organization Identity Management Official

Subject: Authorization Decision for [PCI / DPCI]


After reviewing the results of the authorization package of the [PCI / DPCI], I have determined
that its policies, procedures, and processes are in compliance both with [FIPS 201-2] and our
organization’s own policies, regulations and standards. Accordingly, I am issuing an
authorization to operate (ATO). [PIV Card and/or Derived PIV Credential] issuance services are
authorized without any restrictions or limitations. This authorization is my formal declaration
that the requirements of [HSPD-12] are being satisfied.

This ATO also applies to issuing facilities under this [PCI / DPCI]. Included is a list of facilities
authorized to operate under this authorization decision.

This authorization and ATO will remain in effect for 3 years from the date of this letter if— (i)
all required documentation is updated annually; (ii) a lifecycle walkthrough is completed
annually and the results sent to me within thirty (30) days of completion; and (iii) no deficiencies
are identified during the walkthrough that would increase the risk to the organization’s mission.

A copy of this letter and all supporting authorization documentation shall be retained in
accordance with the organization’s record retention schedule.

To: Organization Identity Management Official

Subject: Authorization Decision for [PCI / DPCI]

After reviewing the results of the assessment of the [PCI / DPCI], I have determined that the
requirements identified in [FIPS 201-2] and the organization’s policies, regulations, and
standards have not been implemented satisfactorily. However, I have determined that there is an
overarching need for the issuance services to continue due to mission necessity and other
considerations. Accordingly, I am issuing an interim authorization to operate (IATO). Operation
of the [PCI /DPCI] shall be performed in accordance with the enclosed terms and conditions
during the IATO period. The [PCI / DPCI] is not considered authorized during the IATO period.

This IATO also applies to facilities under the [PCI / DPCI]. Included is a list of facilities
authorized to operate during this interim period, along with specific limitations or restrictions
that apply.

This interim authorization to operate is valid for a maximum till close of business on <date [not
to exceed three months]. This interim authorization will remain in effect as long as— (i) the
required status reports for the [PCI / DPCI] are submitted to this office every month; (ii) the
problems or deficiencies reported from the authorization do not result in additional risk that is
deemed unacceptable; and (iii) continued progress is being made in reducing or eliminating the
deficiencies in accordance with the corrective actions plan (CAP). At the end of IATO period,
the [PCI / DPCI] must be ready to receive an authorization to operate. A second IATO will be
granted only in extenuating circumstances. This office will review the CAP submitted with the
authorization package during the IATO period and monitor progress on removal or reduction of
concerns and discrepancies before re-authorization is initiated.

A copy of this letter and all supporting authorization documentation shall be retained in
accordance with the organization’s record retention schedule.

To: Organization Identity Management Official

Subject: Authorization Decision for [PCI / DPCI]

After reviewing the results of the assessment of the [PCI / DPCI] and the supporting evidence
provided in the associated authorization package, I have determined that the requirements
identified in [FIPS 201-2] and the organization’s policies, regulations, and standards are not
being exhibited by the [PCI / DPCI]. Accordingly, I am issuing a denial of authorization to
operate (DATO) to the [PCI / DPCI] and its issuing facilities. The [PCI / DPCI] is not authorized
and [MAY NOT BE PLACED INTO OPERATION or ALL CURRENT OPERATIONS MUST BE HALTED].

The corrective actions plan (CAP) is to be pursued immediately to ensure that proactive
measures are taken to correct the deficiencies found during the assessment. Re- authorization is
to be initiated at the earliest opportunity to determine the effectiveness of correcting the
deficiencies.

A copy of this letter and all supporting authorization documentation shall be retained in
accordance with the organization’s record retention schedule.

issuers that intend to issue both types of credentials. Unlike for a PIV Card Issuer, not all issuer
controls are applicable to a Derived PIV Credential Issuer. Certain issuer controls are applicable
to only LOA-3 or to only LOA-4 Derived PIV Credentials and therefore must be implemented
by the issuer only if they are issuing that level of a Derived PIV Credential. This is represented
via the “applicability” column within this table. Controls with an applicability column marked
with DPCI (e.g., without LOA-4 or 3 postfix) apply to both LOA-3 and LOA-4 Derived PIV
Credential.
