                                            Abstract

The protection of Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) while residing in nonfederal
information systems and organizations is of paramount importance to federal agencies and can
directly impact the ability of the federal government to successfully carry out its designated
missions and business operations. This publication provides federal agencies with recommended
requirements for protecting the confidentiality of CUI: (i) when the CUI is resident in nonfederal
information systems and organizations; (ii) when the information systems where the CUI resides
are not used or operated by contractors of federal agencies or other organizations on behalf of
those agencies; and (iii) where there are no specific safeguarding requirements for protecting the
confidentiality of CUI prescribed by the authorizing law, regulation, or governmentwide policy
for the CUI category or subcategory listed in the CUI Registry. The requirements apply to all
components of nonfederal information systems and organizations that process, store, or transmit
CUI, or provide security protection for such components. The CUI requirements are intended for
use by federal agencies in contractual vehicles or other agreements established between those
agencies and nonfederal organizations.

                                            Cautionary Note

    The Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) requires federal agencies to identify
    and provide information security protections commensurate with the risk resulting from the
    unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of: (i) information
    collected or maintained by or on behalf of an agency; or (ii) information systems used or operated
    by an agency or by a contractor of an agency or other organization on behalf of an agency. This
    publication focuses on protecting the confidentiality of Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) in
    nonfederal information systems and organizations, and recommending security requirements to
    achieve that objective. It does not change, in any manner, the information security requirements
    set forth in FISMA, nor does it alter the responsibility of federal agencies to comply with the full
    provisions of the statute, the policies established by OMB, and the supporting security standards
    and guidelines developed by NIST.

    The CUI requirements recommended for use in this publication are derived from FIPS Publication
    200 and the moderate security control baseline in NIST Special Publication 800-53 and based on
    the proposed CUI regulation (32 CFR Part 2002, Controlled Unclassified Information). The security
    requirements and controls have been determined over time to provide the necessary protection
    for federal information and information systems that are covered under the FISMA. The tailoring
    criteria applied to the FIPS Publication 200 security requirements and the NIST Special Publication
    800-53 security controls should not be interpreted as an endorsement for the elimination of those
    requirements and controls—rather, the tailoring criteria focuses on the protection of CUI from
    unauthorized disclosure in nonfederal information systems and organizations. Moreover, since the
    CUI requirements are derivative from the NIST publications listed above, organizations should not
    assume that satisfying those requirements will automatically satisfy the security requirements and
    controls in FIPS Publication 200 and Special Publication 800-53.

    In addition to the security objective of confidentiality, the objectives of integrity and availability
    remain a high priority for organizations that are concerned with establishing and maintaining a
    comprehensive information security program. While the primary purpose of this publication is to
    define requirements to protect the confidentiality of CUI, there is a close relationship between
    confidentiality and integrity since many of the underlying security mechanisms at the information
    system level support both security objectives. Organizations that are interested in or required to
    comply with the recommendations in this publications are strongly advised to review the complete
    listing of security controls in the moderate baseline in Appendix E to ensure that their individual
    security plans and security control deployments provide the necessary and sufficient protection to
    address the range of cyber and kinetic threats to organizational missions and business operations.
    Addressing such threats is important because of the dependence many organizations have on their
    information technology infrastructures for mission and business success.

                                 Expectations for this Publication

    Executive Order 13556, Controlled Unclassified Information, November 4, 2010, establishes that
    the Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) Executive Agent designated as the National Archives
    and Records Administration (NARA), shall develop and issue such directives as are necessary to
    implement the CUI Program. Consistent with this tasking and with the CUI Program’s mission to
    establish uniform policies and practices across the federal government, NARA plans to issue a
    federal regulation in 2015 to establish the required controls and markings for CUI government-
    wide. This federal regulation, once enacted, will bind agencies throughout the executive branch to
    uniformly apply the standard safeguards, markings, dissemination, and decontrol requirements
    established by the CUI Program.

    With regard to federal information systems, requirements in the proposed federal regulation for
    protecting CUI at the moderate confidentiality impact level will be based on applicable policies
    established by OMB and applicable governmentwide standards and guidelines issued by NIST. The
    regulation will not create these policies, standards, and guidelines which are already established
    by OMB and NIST. The proposed regulation will, however, require adherence to the policies and
    use of the standards and guidelines in a consistent manner throughout the executive branch,
    thereby reducing current complexity for federal agencies and their nonfederal partners, including
    contractors.

    In addition to defining safeguarding requirements for CUI within the federal government, NARA
    has taken steps to alleviate the potential impact of such requirements on nonfederal organizations
    by jointly developing with NIST, Special Publication 800-171 — defining security requirements for
    protecting CUI in nonfederal information systems and organizations. This will help nonfederal
    entities, including contractors, to comply with the security requirements using the systems and
    practices they already have in place, rather than trying to use government-specific approaches. It
    will also provide a standardized and uniform set of requirements for all CUI security needs, tailored
    to nonfederal systems, allowing nonfederal organizations to be in compliance with statutory and
    regulatory requirements, and to consistently implement safeguards for the protection of CUI.

    Finally, NARA, in its capacity as the CUI Executive Agent, also plans to sponsor in 2016, a single
    Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause that will apply the requirements contained in the
    proposed federal CUI regulation and Special Publication 800-171 to contractors. This will further
    promote standardization to benefit a substantial number of nonfederal organizations that are
    attempting to meet the current range and type of contract clauses, where differing requirements
    and conflicting guidance from federal agencies for the same information gives rise to confusion
    and inefficiencies. Until the formal process of establishing such a single FAR clause takes place, the
    CUI requirements in NIST Special Publication 800-171 may be referenced in federal contracts
    consistent with federal law and regulatory requirements. If necessary, Special Publication 800-171
    will be updated to remain consistent with the proposed federal CUI regulation and the FAR clause.

              Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity

   Organizations that have implemented or plan to implement the NIST Framework for Improving
   Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity can find in Appendix D of this publication, a direct mapping of
   the Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) security requirements to the security controls in NIST
   Special Publication 800-53 and ISO/IEC 27001. Once identified, those controls can be located in the
   specific categories and subcategories associated with Cybersecurity Framework core functions:
   Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. The security control mapping information can be
   useful to organizations that wish to demonstrate compliance to the CUI security requirements in
   the context of their established information security programs, when such programs have been
   built around the NIST or ISO/IEC security controls. See http://www.nist.gov/cyberframework.

CHAPTER ONE

INTRODUCTION
THE NEED TO PROTECT CONTROLLED UNCLASSIFIED INFORMATION




T       oday, more than at any time in history, the federal government is relying on external
        service providers to help carry out a wide range of federal missions and business functions
        using state-of-the-practice information systems. Many federal contractors, for example,
routinely process, store, and transmit sensitive federal information in their information systems 1
to support the delivery of essential products and services to federal agencies (e.g., providing
credit card and other financial services; providing Web and electronic mail services; conducting
background investigations for security clearances; processing healthcare data; providing cloud
services; and developing communications, satellite, and weapons systems). Additionally, federal
information is frequently provided to or shared with entities such as State and local governments,
colleges and universities, and independent research organizations. The protection of sensitive
federal information while residing in nonfederal information systems 2 and organizations is of
paramount importance to federal agencies and can directly impact the ability of the federal
government to successfully carry out its designated missions and business operations, including
those missions and functions related to the critical infrastructure.

The protection of unclassified federal information in nonfederal information systems and
organizations is dependent on the federal government providing a disciplined and structured
process for identifying the different types of information that are routinely used by federal
agencies. On November 4, 2010, the President signed Executive Order 13556, Controlled
Unclassified Information. 3 The Executive Order established a governmentwide Controlled
Unclassified Information (CUI) 4 Program to standardize the way the executive branch handles
unclassified information that requires protection and designated the National Archives and
Records Administration (NARA) as the Executive Agent 5 to implement that program. Only
information that requires safeguarding or dissemination controls pursuant to federal law,
regulation, or governmentwide policy may be designated as CUI.

The CUI Program is designed to address several deficiencies in managing and protecting
unclassified information to include inconsistent markings, inadequate safeguarding, and needless
restrictions, both by standardizing procedures and by providing common definitions through a
CUI Registry. 6 The CUI Registry is the online repository for information, guidance, policy, and

 An information system is a discrete set of information resources organized expressly for the collection, processing,
maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of information. Information systems also include specialized
systems such as industrial/process control systems.
2
  A federal information system is a system that is used or operated by an executive agency, by a contractor of an
executive agency, or by another organization on behalf of an executive agency. An information system that does not
meet such criteria is a nonfederal information system.

 Controlled Unclassified Information is any information that law, regulation, or governmentwide policy requires to
have safeguarding or disseminating controls, excluding information that is classified under Executive Order 13526,
Classified National Security Information, December 29, 2009, or any predecessor or successor order, or the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended.

requirements on handling CUI, including issuances by the CUI Executive Agent. Among other
information, the CUI Registry identifies approved CUI categories and subcategories, provides
general descriptions for each, identifies the basis for controls, and sets out procedures for the use
of CUI, including but not limited to marking, safeguarding, transporting, disseminating, reusing,
and disposing of the information.

Executive Order 13556 also required that the CUI Program emphasize openness, transparency,
and uniformity of governmentwide practices, and that the implementation of the program take
place in a manner consistent with applicable policies established by the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) and federal standards and guidelines issued by the National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST). The federal CUI regulation, 7 developed by the CUI Executive
Agent, provides guidance to federal agencies on the designation, safeguarding, dissemination,
marking, decontrolling, and disposition of CUI, establishes self-inspection and oversight
requirements, and delineates other facets of the program.

1.1 PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY
The purpose of this publication is to provide federal agencies with recommended requirements
for protecting the confidentiality of CUI: (i) when the CUI is resident in nonfederal information
systems and organizations; (ii) when the information systems where the CUI resides are not used
or operated by contractors of federal agencies or other organizations on behalf of those agencies; 8
and (iii) where there are no specific safeguarding requirements for protecting the confidentiality
of CUI prescribed by the authorizing law, regulation, or governmentwide policy for the CUI
category or subcategory listed in the CUI Registry. The requirements apply only to components 9
of nonfederal information systems that process, store, or transmit CUI, or that provide security
protection for such components. The CUI requirements are intended for use by federal agencies
in appropriate contractual vehicles or other agreements established between those agencies and
nonfederal organizations. In CUI guidance and the CUI Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), 10
the CUI Executive Agent will address determining compliance with CUI requirements.

In accordance with the proposed federal CUI regulation, federal agencies using federal
information systems to process, store, or transmit CUI, as a minimum, must comply with:
•      Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) Publication 199, Standards for Security
       Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems (moderate confidentiality
       impact); 11

7
    Proposed 32 CFR Part 2002, Controlled Unclassified Information, projected for publication in 2015.
8
  Nonfederal organizations that collect or maintain information on behalf of a federal agency or that operate or use
information systems on behalf of a federal agency, must comply with the requirements in the Federal Information
Security Modernization Act (FISMA), including the minimum security requirements in FIPS Publication 200 and the
security controls in NIST Special Publication 800-53.
9
 Information system components include, for example: mainframes, workstations, servers; input/output devices;
network components; operating systems; virtual machines; and applications.
10
  NARA, in its capacity as the CUI Executive Agent, plans to sponsor in 2016, a single FAR clause that will apply the
requirements of the proposed federal CUI regulation and NIST Special Publication 800-171 to contractors. Until the
formal process of establishing such a single FAR clause takes place, the CUI requirements in NIST Special Publication
800-171 may be referenced in federal contracts consistent with federal law and regulatory requirements.
11
  FIPS Publication 199 defines three values of potential impact (i.e., low, moderate, high) on organizations, assets, or
individuals should there be a breach of security (e.g., a loss of confidentiality). The potential impact is moderate if the
loss of confidentiality could be expected to have a serious adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational
assets, or individuals.

•    NIST Special Publication 800-60, Guide for Mapping Types of Information and Information
     Systems to Security Categories. 12

The responsibility of federal agencies to protect and ensure the control of CUI does not change
when such information is shared with nonfederal partners. Therefore, a similar level of protection
is needed when CUI is processed, stored, or transmitted by nonfederal organizations using
nonfederal information systems. 13 The specific requirements for safeguarding CUI in nonfederal
information systems and organizations are derived from the above authoritative federal standards
and guidelines to maintain a consistent level of protection. However, recognizing that the scope
of the safeguarding requirements in the proposed federal CUI regulation is limited to the security
objective of confidentiality (i.e., not directly addressing integrity and availability) and that some
of the FISMA-related requirements expressed in the NIST standards and guidelines are uniquely
federal, the requirements in this publication have been tailored for nonfederal entities.

The tailoring criteria, described in Chapter Two, are not intended to reduce or minimize the
federal requirements for the safeguarding of CUI as expressed in the proposed federal CUI
regulation. Rather, the intent is to express the requirements in a manner that allows for and
facilitates the equivalent safeguarding measures within nonfederal information systems and
organizations and does not diminish the level of protection of CUI required for moderate
confidentiality. Additional or differing requirements other than those requirements described in
this publication may be applied only when such requirements are based on law, regulation, or
governmentwide policy and when indicated in the CUI Registry as CUI-specified. The provision
of safeguarding requirements for CUI in a particular specified category will be addressed by
NARA in its CUI guidance and in the CUI FAR, and reflected as specific requirements in
contracts or other agreements.

If nonfederal organizations entrusted with protecting CUI designate specific information systems
or system components for the processing, storage, or transmission of CUI, then the organizations
may limit the scope of the CUI security requirements to those particular systems or components.
Isolating CUI into its own security domain by applying architectural design principles or concepts
(e.g., implementing subnetworks with firewalls or other boundary protection devices) may be the
most cost-effective and efficient approach for nonfederal organizations to satisfy the requirements
and protect the confidentiality of CUI. Security domains may employ physical separation, logical
separation, or a combination of both. This approach can: (i) reasonably provide adequate security
for the CUI; and (ii) avoid increasing the organization’s security posture to a level beyond which
it typically requires for protecting its core missions/business operations and assets. Nonfederal
organizations may choose to use the same CUI infrastructure for multiple government contracts
or agreements, as long as the CUI infrastructure meets the safeguarding requirements for all of
the organization’s CUI-related contracts/agreements including specific safeguarding required or
permitted by the authorizing law, regulation, or governmentwide policy.

12
  NIST Special Publication 800-60 is under revision to align with the CUI categories and subcategories in the CUI
Registry.
13
   A nonfederal organization is any entity that owns, operates, or maintains a nonfederal information system. Examples
of nonfederal organizations include: State, local, and tribal governments; colleges and universities; and contractors.

1.2 TARGET AUDIENCE
This publication is intended to serve a diverse group of individuals and organizations in both the
public and private sectors including, but not limited to:
•   Individuals with information system development life cycle responsibilities (e.g., program
    managers, mission/business owners, information owners/stewards, system designers and
    developers, information system/security engineers, systems integrators);
•   Individuals with acquisition or procurement responsibilities (e.g., contracting officers);
•   Individuals with information system, security, and/or risk management and oversight
    responsibilities (e.g., authorizing officials, chief information officers, chief information
    security officers, information system owners, information security managers); and
•   Individuals with information security assessment and monitoring responsibilities (e.g.,
    auditors, system evaluators, assessors, independent verifiers/validators, analysts).

The above roles and responsibilities can be viewed from two distinct perspectives: (i) the federal
perspective as the entity establishing and conveying the CUI security requirements in contractual
vehicles or other types of inter-organizational agreements; and (ii) the nonfederal perspective as
the entity responding to and complying with the CUI security requirements set forth in contracts
or agreements.

1.3 ORGANIZATION OF THIS SPECIAL PUBLICATION
The remainder of this special publication is organized as follows:
•   Chapter Two describes the assumptions and methodology used to develop the CUI security
    requirements, the format and structure of the requirements, and the tailoring criteria applied
    to the NIST standards and guidelines to obtain the requirements.
•   Chapter Three describes the fourteen families of security requirements for protecting the
    confidentiality of CUI in nonfederal information systems and organizations.
•   Supporting appendices provide additional information related to the protection of CUI in
    nonfederal information systems and organizations including: (i) general references; (ii) a
    glossary of definitions and terms; (iii) acronyms used in this publication; (iv) mapping tables
    relating the CUI security requirements to the security controls in NIST Special Publication
    800-53 and ISO/IEC 27001; and (v) an explanation of the tailoring actions employed on the
    moderate security control baseline.

CHAPTER TWO

THE FUNDAMENTALS
ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODOLOGY FOR DEVELOPING CUI SECURITY REQUIREMENTS




T      his chapter describes: (i) the basic assumptions and methodology used to develop the
       security requirements to protect CUI in nonfederal information systems and organizations;
       and (ii) the structure of the basic and derived CUI requirements and the tailoring criteria
applied to the federal information security requirements and controls.

2.1 BASIC ASSUMPTIONS
The CUI security requirements described in this publication have been developed based on three
fundamental assumptions:
•    Statutory and regulatory requirements for the protection of CUI are consistent, whether such
     information resides in federal information systems or nonfederal information systems
     including the environments in which those systems operate;
•    Safeguards implemented to protect CUI are consistent in both federal and nonfederal
     information systems and organizations; and
•    The confidentiality impact value for CUI is no lower than moderate 14 in accordance with
     Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) Publication 199. 15

The above assumptions reinforce the concept that federal information designated as CUI has the
same intrinsic value and potential adverse impact if compromised—whether such information
resides in a federal or a nonfederal organization. Thus, protecting the confidentiality of CUI is
critical to the mission and business success of federal agencies and the economic and national
security interests of the nation. Additional assumptions also impacting the development of the
CUI security requirements and the expectation of federal agencies in working with nonfederal
entities include:
•    Nonfederal organizations have information technology infrastructures in place, and are not
     necessarily developing or acquiring information systems specifically for the purpose of
     processing, storing, or transmitting CUI;
•    Nonfederal organizations have specific safeguarding measures in place to protect their
     information which may also be sufficient to satisfy the CUI security requirements;
•    Nonfederal organizations can implement a variety of potential security solutions either
     directly or through the use of managed services, to satisfy CUI security requirements; and
•    Nonfederal organizations may not have the necessary organizational structure or resources to
     satisfy every CUI security requirement and may implement alternative, but equally effective,
     security measures to compensate for the inability to satisfy a particular requirement.


14
   The moderate impact value defined in FIPS Publication 199 may become part of a moderate impact system in FIPS
Publication 200, which in turn, requires the use of the moderate security control baseline in NIST Special Publication
800-53 as the starting point for tailoring actions.
15
   In accordance with proposed 32 CFR Part 2002, Controlled Unclassified Information, there will be only one level of
safeguarding for CUI (i.e., moderate impact for confidentiality) unless federal law, regulation, or governmentwide
policy specifies otherwise.



CHAPTER 2                                                                                                        PAGE 5

________________________________________________________________________________________________

2.2 DEVELOPMENT OF CUI REQUIREMENTS
Security requirements for protecting the confidentiality of CUI in nonfederal information systems
and organizations have a well-defined structure that consists of: (i) a basic security requirements
section; and (ii) a derived security requirements section. The basic security requirements are
obtained from FIPS Publication 200, which provides the high-level and fundamental security
requirements for federal information and information systems. The derived security requirements,
which supplement the basic security requirements, are taken from the security controls in NIST
Special Publication 800-53. Starting with the FIPS Publication 200 security requirements and the
security controls in the moderate baseline (i.e., the minimum level of protection required for CUI
in federal information systems and organizations), the requirements and controls are tailored to
eliminate requirements, controls, or parts of controls that are:
•    Uniquely federal (i.e., primarily the responsibility of the federal government);
•    Not directly related to protecting the confidentiality of CUI; or
•    Expected to be routinely satisfied by nonfederal organizations without specification. 16

Appendix E provides a complete listing of security controls that support the CUI derived security
requirements and those controls that have been eliminated from the NIST Special Publication
800-53 moderate baseline based on the CUI tailoring criteria described above.

The combination of the basic and derived security requirements captures the intent of FIPS
Publication 200 and NIST Special Publication 800-53, with respect to the protection of the
confidentiality of CUI in nonfederal information systems and organizations. Appendix D provides
informal mappings of the CUI security requirements to the relevant security controls in NIST
Special Publication 800-53 and ISO/IEC 27001. The mappings are included to promote a better
understanding of the CUI security requirements and are not intended to impose additional
requirements on nonfederal organizations.

The following example taken from the Configuration Management family illustrates the structure
of a typical CUI security requirement:
Basic Security Requirements:

-    Establish and maintain baseline configurations and inventories of organizational information systems
     (including hardware, software, firmware, and documentation) throughout the respective system
     development life cycles.
-    Establish and enforce security configuration settings for information technology products employed in
     organizational information systems.
Derived Security Requirements:

-    Track, review, approve/disapprove, and audit changes to information systems.
-    Analyze the security impact of changes prior to implementation.


16
  The CUI requirements developed from the tailored FIPS Publication 200 security requirements and the NIST Special
Publication 800-53 moderate security control baseline represent a subset of the safeguarding measures necessary for a
comprehensive information security program. The strength and quality of such programs in nonfederal organizations
depend on the degree to which the organizations implement the security requirements and controls that are expected to
be routinely satisfied without specification by the federal government. This includes implementing security policies,
procedures, and practices that support an effective risk-based information security program. Nonfederal organizations
are encouraged to refer to Appendix E and Special Publication 800-53 for a complete listing of security controls in the
moderate baseline deemed out of scope for the CUI requirements in Chapter Three.

-     Define, document, approve, and enforce physical and logical access restrictions associated with changes
      to the information system.
-     Employ the principle of least functionality by configuring the information system to provide only
      essential capabilities.
-     Restrict, disable, and prevent the use of nonessential programs, functions, ports, protocols, and services.
-     Apply deny-by-exception (blacklist) policy to prevent the use of unauthorized software or deny-all,
      permit-by-exception (whitelisting) policy to allow the execution of authorized software.
-     Control and monitor user-installed software.

For ease of use, the security requirements are organized into fourteen families. Each family
contains the requirements related to the general security topic of the family. The families are
closely aligned with the minimum security requirements for federal information and information
systems described in FIPS Publication 200. The contingency planning, system and services
acquisition, and planning requirements are not included within the scope of this publication due
to the aforementioned tailoring criteria. 17 Table 1 lists the security requirement families addressed
in this publication.

   Two exceptions include: (i) a requirement to protect the confidentiality of system backups (derived from CP-9) from
the contingency planning family; and (ii) a requirement to implement system security engineering principles (derived
from SA-8) from the system and services acquisition family. For convenience, these requirements are included with the
CUI media protection and system and communications protection requirements families, respectively.

CHAPTER THREE

THE REQUIREMENTS
SECURITY REQUIREMENTS FOR PROTECTING THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF CUI




T       his chapter describes fourteen families of security requirements (including basic and
        derived requirements) 18 for protecting the confidentiality of CUI in nonfederal information
        systems and organizations. 19 The security controls from NIST Special Publication 800-53
associated with the basic and derived requirements are also listed in Appendix D. 20 Organizations
can use Special Publication 800-53 to obtain additional, non-prescriptive information related to
the CUI security requirements (e.g., supplemental guidance related to each of the referenced
security controls, mapping tables to ISO/IEC security controls, and a catalog of optional controls
that can be used to help specify additional CUI requirements if needed). This information can
help clarify or interpret the requirements in the context of mission and business requirements,
operational environments, or assessments of risk. Nonfederal organizations can implement a
variety of potential security solutions either directly or through the use of managed services, to
satisfy CUI security requirements and may implement alternative, but equally effective, security
measures to compensate for the inability to satisfy a particular requirement. 21




18
  The security requirements identified in this publication are intended to be applied to the nonfederal organization’s
general-purpose internal information systems that are processing, storing, or transmitting CUI. Some specialized
systems such as medical devices, Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machines, or industrial control systems may
have restrictions or limitations on the application of certain CUI requirements and may be granted waivers or
exemptions from the requirements by the federal agency providing oversight.
19
   While the primary purpose of this publication is to define requirements to protect the confidentiality of CUI, there is
a close relationship between confidentiality and integrity since many of the underlying security mechanisms at the
information system level support both security objectives. Thus, the integrity requirements (either basic or derived)
may have a significant, albeit indirect, effect on the ability of an organization to protect the confidentiality of CUI.
20
  The security control references in Appendix D are included to promote a better understanding of the CUI security
requirements. The control references are not intended to impose additional requirements on nonfederal organizations.
Moreover, because the security controls were developed for federal agencies, the supplemental guidance associated
with those controls may not be applicable to nonfederal organizations.
21
  To promote consistency, transparency, and comparability, compensatory security measures selected by organizations
should be based on or derived from existing and recognized security standards and control sets, including, for example:
ISO/IEC 27001/2 or NIST Special Publication 800-53.

         external to the organization.
Derived Security Requirements:

3.6.3    Test the organizational incident response capability.




22
   Multifactor authentication requires two or more different factors to achieve authentication. Factors include: (i)
something you know (e.g., password/PIN); (ii) something you have (e.g., cryptographic identification device, token); or
(iii) something you are (e.g., biometric). The requirement for multifactor authentication should not be interpreted as
requiring federal Personal Identity Verification (PIV) card or Department of Defense Common Access Card (CAC)-
like solutions. A variety of multifactor solutions (including those with replay resistance) using tokens and biometrics
are commercially available. Such solutions may employ hard tokens (e.g., smartcards, key fobs, or dongles) or soft
tokens to store user credentials.
23
   Local access is any access to an information system by a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) communicating
through a direct connection without the use of a network. Network access is any access to an information system by a
user (or a process acting on behalf of a user) communicating through a network (e.g., local area network, wide area
network, Internet).

24
  In general, system maintenance requirements tend to support the security objective of availability. However,
improper system maintenance or a failure to perform maintenance can result in the unauthorized disclosure of CUI,
thus compromising confidentiality of that information.
25
 The implementation of this requirement is contingent on the finalization of the proposed CUI federal regulation and
marking guidance in the CUI Registry.

                         NARA, CUI Requirements, and the FAR Clause
   Executive Order 13556, Controlled Unclassified Information, November 4, 2010, established the CUI
   Program and designated the National Archives and Record Administration (NARA) as its Executive
   Agent to implement the Order and to oversee agency actions to ensure compliance with the Order.
   Regarding contractors, the CUI Executive Agent anticipates establishing a single Federal Acquisition
   Regulation (FAR) clause in 2016 to apply the requirements of NIST Special Publication 800-171 to
   the contractor environment as well as to determine oversight responsibilities and requirements.
   The CUI Executive Agent also addresses its oversight of federal agencies in the proposed regulation
   for incorporation into the Code of Federal Regulations. Approaches to oversight will be determined
   through the uniform CUI FAR clause, future understandings, and any agreements between federal
   agencies and their nonfederal information-sharing partners.

MAPPING TABLES
MAPPING CUI SECURITY REQUIREMENTS TO SECURITY CONTROLS

Tables D-1 through D-14 provide an informal mapping of the CUI security requirements to the
relevant security controls in NIST Special Publication 800-53. The mapping tables are included
for informational purposes only and are not intended to convey or impart any additional CUI
security requirements beyond those requirements defined in Chapter Three. Moreover, because
the security controls were developed for federal agencies, the supplemental guidance associated
with those controls may not be applicable to nonfederal organizations. In some cases, the relevant
security controls include additional expectations beyond those required to protect CUI and have
been tailored using the criteria in Chapter Two. Only the portion of the security control relevant
to the CUI security requirement is applicable. The tables also include a secondary mapping of the
security controls from Special Publication 800-53 to the relevant controls in ISO/IEC 27001,
Annex A. The NIST to ISO/IEC mapping is obtained from Special Publication 800-53, Appendix
H. An asterisk (*) indicates that the ISO/IEC control does not fully satisfy the intent of the NIST
control. It is also important to note that, due to the tailoring for CUI, satisfaction of a basic or
derived security requirement does not mean that the corresponding security control or control
enhancement from NIST Special Publication 800-53 has been met, since certain elements of the
control or control enhancement that are not essential to protecting the confidentiality of CUI are
not reflected in those requirements.

Organizations that have implemented or plan to implement the NIST Framework for Improving
Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity can use the mapping of the CUI security requirements to the
security controls in NIST Special Publication 800-53 and ISO/IEC 27001 to locate the equivalent
controls in the categories and subcategories associated with the core functions of the Framework:
identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover. The security control mapping information can be
useful to organizations that wish to demonstrate compliance to the CUI security requirements in
the context of their established information security programs, when such programs have been
built around the NIST or ISO/IEC security controls.

  IA-2(9) is not currently in the NIST Special Publication 800-53 moderate security control baseline although it will be
added to the baseline in the next update. Employing multifactor authentication without a replay-resistant capability for
non-privileged accounts creates a significant vulnerability for information systems transmitting CUI.

APPENDIX E

TAILORING CRITERIA
LISTING OF MODERATE SECURITY CONTROL BASELINE AND TAILORING ACTIONS

This appendix provides a complete listing of the security controls in the NIST Special Publication
800-53 moderate baseline, one of the sources along with FIPS Publication 200, for the final CUI
security requirements described in Chapter Three. Tables E-1 through E-17 contain the tailoring
actions (by family) that have been carried out on the security controls in the moderate baseline in
accordance with the tailoring criteria established by NIST and NARA. 31 The tailoring actions
facilitated the development of the CUI derived security requirements which supplement the basic
security requirements obtained from the security requirements in FIPS Publication 200. 32
There are three primary criteria for eliminating a security control or control enhancement from
the moderate baseline including—
•      The control or control enhancement is uniquely federal (i.e., primarily the responsibility of
       the federal government);
•      The control or control enhancement is not directly related to protecting the confidentiality of
       CUI; 33 or
•      The control or control enhancement is expected to be routinely satisfied by nonfederal
       organizations without specification. 34

The following symbols are used in Tables E-1 through E-17 to specify the particular tailoring
actions taken or when no tailoring actions were required.

                 CONTROL, CONTROL ENHANCEMENT, OR SPECIFIC ELEMENTS OF THE CONTROL/ENHANCEMENT.




31
  Organizations can use the information in Appendix E to build a CUI confidentiality overlay as defined in NIST
Special Publication 800-53, Appendix I.
32
   The same tailoring criteria were applied to the security requirements in FIPS Publication 200 resulting in the CUI
basic security requirements in described in Chapter Three and Appendix D.
33
   While the primary purpose of this publication is to define requirements to protect the confidentiality of CUI, there is
a close relationship between the security objectives of confidentiality and integrity. Therefore, most of security controls
in the NIST Special Publication 800-53 moderate baseline that support protection against unauthorized disclosure also
support protection against unauthorized modification.
34
  The security controls tailored out of the moderate baseline in Special Publication 800-53 with regard to the protection
of CUI (i.e., controls specifically marked as either NCO or NFO in Tables E-1 through E-17), are often included as part
of an organization’s comprehensive security program.
