This document has been developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
to further its statutory responsibilities under the Federal Information Security Management Act
(FISMA) of 2002, P.L. 107-347. NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines,
including minimum requirements, for providing adequate information security for all agency
operations and assets, but such standards and guidelines shall not apply to national security
systems. This guideline is consistent with the requirements of the Office of Management and
Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Section 8b(3), Securing Agency Information Systems, as
analyzed in A-130, Appendix IV: Analysis of Key Sections. Supplemental information is
provided in A-130, Appendix III.

This guideline has been prepared for use by federal agencies. It may also be used by
nongovernmental organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright. (Attribution
would be appreciated by NIST.)

Nothing in this document should be taken to contradict standards and guidelines made mandatory
and binding on federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory authority. Nor
should these guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the
Secretary of Commerce, Director of the OMB, or any other federal official.



 Certain commercial entities, equipment, or materials may be identified in this document in order to
 describe an experimental procedure or concept adequately. Such identification is not intended to imply
 recommendation or endorsement by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, nor is it
 intended to imply that the entities, materials, or equipment are necessarily the best available for the

                                      Executive Summary
Some federal agencies, in addition to being subject to the Federal Information Security
Management Act of 2002 (FISMA), are also subject to similar requirements of the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Security Rule (the
Security Rule), if the agency is a covered entity as defined by the rules implementing
HIPAA.
The HIPAA Security Rule specifically focuses on the safeguarding of electronic
protected health information (EPHI). Although FISMA applies to all federal agencies and
all information types, only a subset of agencies are subject to the HIPAA Security Rule
based on their functions and use of EPHI. All HIPAA covered entities, which include
some federal agencies, must comply with the Security Rule, which specifically focuses
on protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of EPHI, as defined in the
Security Rule. The EPHI that a covered entity creates, receives, maintains, or transmits
must be protected against reasonably anticipated threats, hazards, and impermissible uses
and/or disclosures. In general, the requirements, standards, and implementation
specifications of the Security Rule apply to the following covered entities:
•   Covered Healthcare Providers—Any provider of medical or other health services, or
    supplies, who transmits any health information in electronic form in connection with
    a transaction for which the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) has
    adopted a standard.
•   Health Plans—Any individual or group plan that provides, or pays the cost of,
    medical care, including certain specifically listed governmental programs (e.g., a
    health insurance issuer and the Medicare and Medicaid programs).
•   Healthcare Clearinghouses—A public or private entity that processes another entity’s
    healthcare transactions from a standard format to a nonstandard format, or vice versa.
•   Medicare Prescription Drug Card Sponsors –A nongovernmental entity that offered
    an endorsed discount drug program under the Medicare Modernization Act. This
    fourth category of “covered entity” remained in effect until the drug card program
    ended in 2006.
NIST publications, many of which are required for federal agencies, can serve as
voluntary guidelines and best practices for state, local, and tribal governments and the
private sector, and may provide enough depth and breadth to help organizations of many
sizes select the type of implementation that best fits their unique circumstances. NIST
security standards and guidelines (Federal Information Processing Standards [FIPS],
Special Publications in the 800 series), which can be used to support the requirements of
both HIPAA and FISMA, may be used by organizations to help provide a structured, yet
flexible framework for selecting, specifying, employing, and evaluating the security
controls in information systems.
This Special Publication (SP), which discusses security considerations and resources that
may provide value when implementing the requirements of the HIPAA Security Rule,
was written to:

1. Introduction
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is responsible for developing
standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements, used by federal agencies in
providing adequate information security for the protection of agency operations and
assets. Pursuant to this mission, NIST’s Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) has
developed guidelines to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of information
technology (IT) planning, implementation, management, and operation.
NIST publishes a wide variety of publications on information security. These
publications serve as a valuable resource for federal agencies, as well as public,
nonfederal agencies and private organizations, seeking to address existing and new
federal information security requirements. One such set of federal information security
requirements are the security standards adopted by the Secretary of Health and Human
Services (HHS) under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996
(HIPAA, Public Law 104-191). HIPAA required the Secretary to adopt, among other
standards, security standards for certain health information. These standards, known as
the HIPAA Security Rule (the Security Rule), were published on February 20, 2003. In
the preamble to the Security Rule, several NIST publications were cited as potentially
valuable resources for readers with specific questions and concerns about IT security.
Congress enacted the Administrative Simplification (part of Title II) provisions of
HIPAA to, among other things, promote efficiency in the healthcare industry through the
use of standardized electronic transactions, while protecting the privacy and security of
health information. Pursuant to the Administrative Simplification provisions of HIPAA,
the Secretary of HHS adopted standards relating to:
    •    Electronic healthcare transactions and code sets;
    •    Privacy of protected health information;
    •    Security of electronic protected health information (EPHI); and
    •    Unique health identifiers.
This Special Publication summarizes the HIPAA security standards and explains some of
the structure and organization of the Security Rule. The publication helps to educate
readers about information security terms used in the HIPAA Security Rule and to
improve understanding of the meaning of the security standards set out in the Security
Rule. It is also designed to direct readers to helpful information in other NIST
publications on individual topics addressed by the HIPAA Security Rule. Readers can
draw upon these publications for consideration in implementing the Security Rule. This
publication is intended as an aid to understanding security concepts discussed in the
HIPAA Security Rule, and does not supplement, replace, or supersede the HIPAA
Security Rule itself. While the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)
mentioned several NIST publications in the preamble to the HIPAA Security Rule, CMS
does not require their use in complying with the Security Rule. 1

 The HIPAA Security Rule mentions NIST documents as potentially helpful guidance but not mandatory for
compliance, at 68 Federal Register pages 8346, 8350, 8352, and 8355 (February 20, 2003).

                                                   Security Rule


This document addresses only the security standards of the Security Rule and not other
provisions adopted or raised by the Rule, such as 45 CFR § 164.105.
Figure 1 shows all the components of HIPAA and illustrates that the focus of this
document is on the security provisions of the statute and the regulatory rule.

   1.1.           Purpose and Scope
The purpose of this publication is to help educate readers about the security standards
included in the HIPAA Security Rule. It provides a brief overview of the HIPAA
Security Rule, directs the reader to additional NIST publications on information security,
and identifies typical activities an agency should consider in implementing an
information security program.

                                                    Security Rule


This publication is intended as an aid to understand security concepts discussed in the
HIPAA Security Rule and does not supplement, replace, modify, or supersede the
Security Rule itself. Anyone seeking clarifications of the HIPAA Security Rule should
contact the Office of E-Health Standards and Services (OESS) at CMS. For general
HIPAA Security Rule information, visit the CMS HIPAA Web site at:

The NIST publications available as of the publication date of SP 800-66 Revision 1 were
used in preparing this document. NIST frequently publishes new standards and
guidelines, or updates existing publications that may also serve as useful references. To
remain current with the latest available list of NIST security publications, the reader
should periodically review the NIST Computer Security Resource Center (CSRC) Web
site at http://csrc.nist.gov.

     1.2.           Applicability
The guidelines provided in this publication are applicable to all federal information
systems, 2 other than those systems designated as national security systems as defined in
44 United States Code (U.S.C.), Section 3542. 3 The guidelines included in this
publication have been broadly developed from a technical perspective so as to be
complementary to similar guidelines issued by agencies and offices operating or
exercising control over national security systems. State, local, and tribal governments, as
well as private sector organizations composing the critical health infrastructure of the
United States are encouraged to consider using these guidelines, as appropriate.
NIST publications may be useful to any agency seeking to understand the security issues
raised by the HIPAA Security Rule regardless of that agency’s size, structure, or
distribution of security responsibilities. Specific agency missions, resources, and
organizational structures, however, vary greatly, and agencies’ approaches to
implementing the HIPAA Security Rule may diverge significantly. Federal agencies use
different titles to identify roles that have security-related responsibilities and may also
assign particular responsibilities for implementing information security controls (those
required by HIPAA and others) differently. NIST SP 800-66 assists all agencies seeking
further information on the security safeguards discussed in the HIPAA Security Rule,
regardless of the particular structures, methodologies, and approaches used to address its
requirements.



2
  A federal information system is an information system used or operated by an executive agency, by a contractor of an
executive agency, or by another organization on behalf of an executive agency.
3
  A national security system is any information system (including any telecommunications system) used or operated by
an agency or by a contractor of an agency, or other organization on behalf of an agency—(i) the function, operation, or
use of which: involves intelligence activities, involves cryptographic activities related to national security; involves
command and control of military forces; involves equipment that is an integral part of a weapon or weapons system; or
is critical to the direct fulfillment of military or intelligence missions (excluding a system that is to be used for routine
administrative and business applications, for example, payroll, finance, logistics, and personnel management
applications); or (ii) is protected at all times by procedures established for information that have been specifically
authorized under criteria established by an Executive Order or an Act of Congress to be kept classified in the interest of

   1.5.           How and Why to Use This Document
Users are encouraged to use this document as a resource that provides concepts and tools
to assist covered entities, including federal agencies, to comply with the HIPAA Security
Rule.
NIST publications, many of which are required for federal agencies, can serve as
guidelines and best practices for state, local, and tribal governments, and the private
sector, and may provide enough depth and breadth to help organizations of many sizes
select the type of implementation that best fits their unique circumstances.
This document can support the compliance efforts of covered entities in many ways,
including:
   •    Ensuring that each organization is selecting methods and controls which
        adequately and appropriately protect EPHI of which they are the steward;
   •    Informing the development of compliance strategies that are in concert with the
        size and structure of the entity;
   •    Providing guidelines on best practices for developing and implementing a Risk
        Management Program; and
   •    Creating appropriate documentation that demonstrates effective compliance with
        the HIPAA Security Rule.

2. Background
       2.1.          HIPAA Security Rule
The HIPAA Security Rule specifically focuses on the safeguarding of EPHI. Although
FISMA applies to all federal agencies and all information types, only a subset of agencies
is subject to the HIPAA Security Rule based on their functions and use of EPHI. All
HIPAA covered entities, which includes some federal agencies, must comply with the
Security Rule. The Security Rule specifically focuses on protecting the confidentiality,
integrity, and availability of EPHI, as defined in the Security Rule. The EPHI that a
covered entity creates, receives, maintains, or transmits must be protected against
reasonably anticipated threats, hazards, and impermissible uses and/or disclosures. In
general, the requirements, standards, and implementation specifications of the Security
Rule apply to the following covered entities:
•      Covered Healthcare Providers— Any provider of medical or other health services,
       or supplies, who transmits any health information in electronic form in connection
       with a transaction for which HHS has adopted a standard.
•      Health Plans— Any individual or group plan that provides or pays the cost of
       medical care (e.g., a health insurance issuer and the Medicare and Medicaid
       programs).
•      Healthcare Clearinghouses— A public or private entity that processes another
       entity’s healthcare transactions from a standard format to a nonstandard format, or
       vice versa.
•      Medicare Prescription Drug Card Sponsors – A nongovernmental entity that offers
       an endorsed discount drug program under the Medicare Modernization Act.
This section identifies the main goals, explains some of the structure and organization,
and identifies the purpose of the sections of the Security Rule.

            2.1.1.                Security Rule Goals and Objectives
As required by the “Security standards: General rules” 4 section of the HIPAA Security
Rule, each covered entity must:
•      Ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of EPHI that it creates, receives,
       maintains, or transmits;
•      Protect against any reasonably anticipated threats and hazards to the security or
       integrity of EPHI; and
•      Protect against reasonably anticipated uses or disclosures of such information that are
       not permitted by the Privacy Rule.

                                                    Security Rule


In complying with this section of the Security Rule, covered entities must be aware of the
definitions provided for confidentiality, integrity, and availability as given by § 164.304:
•   Confidentiality is “the property that data or information is not made available or
    disclosed to unauthorized persons or processes.”
•   Integrity is “the property that data or information have not been altered or destroyed
    in an unauthorized manner.”
•   Availability is “the property that data or information is accessible and useable upon
    demand by an authorized person.”

         2.1.2.              Security Rule Organization
To understand the requirements of the HIPAA Security Rule, it is helpful to be familiar
with the basic security terminology it uses to describe the security standards. By
understanding the requirements and the terminology in the HIPAA Security Rule, it
becomes easier to see which NIST publications may be appropriate reference resources
and where to find more information. The Security Rule is separated into six main
sections that each include several standards and implementation specifications that a
covered entity must address. 5 The six sections are listed below.
•   Security standards: General Rules - includes the general requirements all covered
    entities must meet; establishes flexibility of approach; identifies standards and
    implementation specifications (both required and addressable); outlines decisions a
    covered entity must make regarding addressable implementation specifications; and
    requires maintenance of security measures to continue reasonable and appropriate
    protection of electronic protected health information.
•   Administrative Safeguards - are defined in the Security Rule as the “administrative
    actions and policies, and procedures to manage the selection, development,
    implementation, and maintenance of security measures to protect electronic protected
    health information and to manage the conduct of the covered entity's workforce in
    relation to the protection of that information.”
•   Physical Safeguards - are defined as the “physical measures, policies, and
    procedures to protect a covered entity's electronic information systems and related
    buildings and equipment, from natural and environmental hazards, and unauthorized
    intrusion.”
•   Technical Safeguards - are defined as the “the technology and the policy and
    procedures for its use that protect electronic protected health information and control
    access to it.”

                                                    Security Rule


•   Organizational Requirements - includes standards for business associate contracts
    and other arrangements, including memoranda of understanding between a covered
    entity and a business associate when both entities are government organizations; and
    requirements for group health plans.
•   Policies and Procedures and Documentation Requirements - requires
    implementation of reasonable and appropriate policies and procedures to comply with
    the standards, implementation specifications and other requirements of the Security
    Rule; maintenance of written (which may be electronic) documentation and/or
    records that includes policies, procedures, actions, activities, or assessments required
    by the Security Rule; and retention, availability, and update requirements related to
    the documentation.
Within the Security Rule sections are standards and implementation specifications. Each
HIPAA Security Rule standard is required. A covered entity is required to comply with
all standards of the Security Rule with respect to all EPHI.
Many of the standards contain implementation specifications. An implementation
specification is a more detailed description of the method or approach covered entities
can use to meet a particular standard. 6 Implementation specifications are either required
or addressable. However, regardless of whether a standard includes implementation
specifications, covered entities must comply with each standard.
•   A required implementation specification is similar to a standard, in that a covered
    entity must comply with it.
•   For addressable implementation specifications, covered entities must perform an
    assessment to determine whether the implementation specification is a reasonable and
    appropriate safeguard for implementation in the covered entity’s environment. In
    general, after performing the assessment, a covered entity decides if it will implement
    the addressable implementation specification; implement an equivalent alternative
    measure that allows the entity to comply with the standard; or not implement the
    addressable specification or any alternative measures, if equivalent measures are not
    reasonable and appropriate within its environment. Covered entities are required to
    document these assessments and all decisions. For federal agencies, however, all of
    the HIPAA Security Rule’s addressable implementation specifications will most
    likely be reasonable and appropriate safeguards for implementation, given their sizes,
    missions, and resources.
Where there are no implementation specifications identified in the Security Rule for a
particular standard, such as for the “Assigned Security Responsibility” and “Evaluation”
standards, compliance with the standard itself is required.
Appendix D of this document provides a crosswalk of the HIPAA Security Rule
standards and implementation specifications to relevant NIST publications and security
controls detailed in NIST SP 800-53.

    2.2.          NIST and its Role in Information Security
Founded in 1901, NIST is a non-regulatory federal agency within the U.S. Department of
Commerce. NIST’s mission is to promote U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness
by advancing measurement science, standards, and technology in ways that enhance
economic security and improve our quality of life. NIST is composed of several
laboratories that conduct research in a wide variety of physical and engineering sciences.
Lab researchers respond to industry needs for measurement methods, tools, data, and
technology, and collaborate with colleagues in industry, academic institutions, and other
government agencies.
The Computer Security Division (CSD), a component within NIST’s Information
Technology Laboratory (ITL), provides standards and technology to protect information
systems against threats to the confidentiality of information, the integrity of information
and processes, and the availability of information and services in order to build trust and
confidence in IT systems.
CSD develops and issues standards, guidelines, and other publications to assist federal
agencies in implementing the requirements of FISMA and in managing cost-effective
security programs to protect their information and information systems. Table 1
identifies and describes the types of NIST publications.

(FIPS)                             binding for federal agencies. Since FISMA requires that federal
                                   agencies comply with these standards, agencies may not waive their
                                   use. FIPS may be used voluntarily by nonfederal organizations
                                   (e.g., state/local/tribal governments, industry).

3. A Framework for Managing Risk
The HIPAA Security Rule is all about implementing effective risk management to
adequately and effectively protect EPHI. The assessment, analysis, and management of
risk provides the foundation of a covered entity’s Security Rule compliance efforts,
serving as tools to develop and maintain a covered entity’s strategy to protect the
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of EPHI.
All EPHI created, received, maintained, or transmitted by a covered entity is subject to
the Security Rule. Covered entities are required to implement reasonable and appropriate
security measures to protect against reasonably anticipated threats or vulnerabilities to the
security of EPHI. Under the Security Rule, covered entities are required to evaluate risks
and vulnerabilities in their environments and to implement security controls to address
those risks and vulnerabilities.
The selection and specification of security controls can be accomplished as part of an
organization-wide information security program that involves the management of
organizational risk - that is, the risk to information, individuals, and the organization as a
whole. The management of risk is a key element in the organization's information
security program and provides an effective framework for selecting the appropriate
security controls for an information system - the security controls necessary to protect
individuals and the operations and assets of the organization.
This section describes a process of managing risk to organizational missions and business
functions that arise from the operation and use of information systems by discussing each
phase of the NIST Risk Management Framework 7 and providing a mapping of this
framework to complementary requirements of the HIPAA Security Rule.

       3.1.          NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)
The NIST RMF, illustrated in Figure 2, provides the covered entity with a disciplined,
structured, extensible, and repeatable process for achieving risk-based protection related
to the operation and use of information systems and the protection of EPHI. It represents
an information security life cycle that facilitates continuous monitoring and improvement
in the security state of the information systems within the organization.
The activities that compose the NIST RMF are paramount to an effective information
security program and can be applied to both new and legacy information systems within
the context of a system development life cycle. A risk-based approach to security control
selection and specification considers effectiveness, efficiency, and constraints due to
applicable laws, directives, Executive Orders, policies, standards, or regulations.
The flexible nature of the NIST RMF allows other communities of interest (e.g., state,
local, and tribal governments and private sector entities) to use the framework voluntarily
either with the NIST security standards and guidelines or with industry-specific standards
and guidelines. The RMF provides organizations with the flexibility needed to apply the
right security controls to the right information systems at the right time to adequately

   3.2.           The NIST RMF and Links to the Security Rule
The NIST RMF consists of six steps that are paramount to the effective management of
risk resulting from the operation and use of information systems. Many Security Rule
standards and implementation specifications correspond to the steps of the NIST RMF.
Using these corresponding requirements in an integrated fashion can provide a
methodical, repeatable, risk-based approach for selecting, specifying, and implementing
security controls to adequately protect EPHI. Table 2 describes each step in the NIST
RMF as well as the related standards and implementation specifications found in the

4. Considerations when Applying the HIPAA Security Rule
In this section, security measures from NIST publications that are relevant to each section of the
Security Rule are presented. Each standard is presented in a consistent tabular format.
The following tables, organized by HIPAA Security Rule standard, are designed to initiate the
thought process for implementing the requirements of the Security Rule. These tables highlight
information a covered entity may wish to consider when implementing the Security Rule; they
are not meant to be prescriptive. The tables may also not be considered all-inclusive of the
information available in NIST publications.
In addition to the HIPAA Security Rule standard name and description, each table includes the
following information:

      standard, actions that are usually associated with the security function or functions suggested
      by that standard. Some of these key activities are also the implementation specifications for
      that particular standard. Each key activity that is also an implementation specification has
      been identified as such in the table (in italics in the Description section of the table), along
      with a note as to whether the implementation specification is required or addressable. Other
      key activities would normally be performed as part of one or more of the related
      implementation specifications under the standard, but are listed separately for clarity of
      presentation. Where such a relationship exists, it is indicated in an accompanying footnote.
      Other key activities are not implementation specifications. These activities are not
      specifically discussed or required by the HIPAA Security Rule, and their inclusion here is in
      no way meant to expand upon the intent or requirements of the Security Rule. Many of these
      activities, however, are usually included in a robust security process, and many will be
      required of federal entities under other federal laws, regulations, or procedures that may or
      may not be discussed within this document.
      The tables address all HIPAA Security Rule standards and all associated implementation
      specifications, both required and addressable. Seven of the standards include all the
      necessary instructions for implementation and have no associated implementation
      specifications. 8 However, as noted earlier in this document, even if there are no
      implementation specifications outlined in the Security Rule, such as with Assigned Security
      Responsibility and Evaluation, compliance with the standard itself is still required.
      The key activities are illustrative and not all-inclusive. There may be many additional
      activities an organization will need to consider, specific to its own operations, which are not
      included in the key activities of the tables. Each entity will need to identify what activities
      beyond those listed in the tables are necessary and appropriate in its environment, implement
      those activities, and document them.

 Standards that do not contain implementation specifications—that “themselves also serve as the implementation specification,”
as stated in the preamble to the HIPAA Security Rule—are those described in Sections 4.2 (HIPAA Standard: Assigned Security
Responsibility); 4.8 (HIPAA Standard: Evaluation); 4.11 (HIPAA Standard: Workstation Use); 4.12 (HIPAA Standard:
Workstation Security), 4.15 (HIPAA Standard: Audit Controls); 4.17 (HIPAA Standard: Person or Entity Authentication); and
4.21 (HIPAA Standard: Policies and Procedures).

      The tables are meant to serve as only a general introduction to the security topics raised by
      the HIPAA Security Rule. For more detailed information about the key activities, consult
      one or more NIST publications referenced for the subject HIPAA standard.
•     Description - The Description column in each table includes an expanded explanation about
      the key activities. The descriptions include types of activities an organization may pursue in
      addressing a specific security function. These are abbreviated explanations designed to help
      get an organization started in addressing the HIPAA Security Rule. The first description
      bullet of each key activity that is also an implementation specification includes the Security
      Rule implementation specification text in italics. When relationships exist between
      description bullets and other Security Rule standards or implementation specifications, it is
      indicated in an accompanying footnote.
•     Sample Questions - The Sample Questions column includes some questions to determine
      whether or not the elements described have actually been considered or completed. These
      sample questions are not exhaustive but merely indicative of relevant questions that could be
      asked. Affirmative answers to these questions do not imply that an organization is meeting
      all of the requirements of the HIPAA security standards. Negative answers to these
      questions should prompt the covered entity to consider whether it needs to take further action
      in order to comply with the standards. In fact, it is expected that many organizations with
      existing information security infrastructure already in place will have considered most of the
      Sample Questions. The questions an organization asks in assessing and developing its
      security program should be tailored to fit the unique circumstances of each entity.
This document does not discuss Section 164.105 of the HIPAA Security Rule, Organizational
Requirements, in detail as they do not set out general security principles. HIPAA covered
entities are encouraged to review this section of the HIPAA Security Rule in full and seek further
guidance.

Appendix D: Security Rule Standards and
Implementation Specifications Crosswalk
Appendix D provides a catalog (see Table 4) of the HIPAA Security Rule standards and
implementation specifications within the Administrative, Physical, and Technical
Safeguards sections of the Security Rule. Additionally, this catalog crosswalks, or maps,
those Security Rule standards and implementation specifications to NIST publications
relevant to each Security Rule standard, and to applicable security controls detailed in
NIST SP 800-53, Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems.
Readers may draw upon these NIST publications and security controls for consideration
in implementing the Security Rule.
The catalog is organized according to the categorization of standards within each of the
safeguards sections in the Security Rule. Table 3 provides an overview of the catalog
content.

The mapping of SP 800-53 security controls to Security Rule standards and
implementation specifications is of particular importance because it allows for the
traceability of legislative and regulatory directives, such as HIPAA and FISMA, to
underlying technical security configurations. This mapping can also enable standards-
based measurement and monitoring of technical security safeguards and computer
security configurations; facilitate compliance management by automating portions of



                                               D-1
compliance demonstration and reporting; and reduce the chance of misinterpretation
between auditors and operations teams.
To accomplish this automation, NIST has defined, and maintains, the Security Content
Automation Protocol (SCAP), 121 a suite of selected and integrated open standards that
enable standards-based communication of vulnerability data, customizing and managing
configuration baselines for various IT products, assessing information systems and
reporting compliance status, using standard measures to weigh and aggregate potential
vulnerability impact, and remediating identified vulnerabilities.

Appendix E: Risk Assessment Guidelines
This appendix incorporates risk assessment concepts and processes described in NIST SP
800-30 Revision 1, Effective Use of Risk Assessments in Managing Enterprise Risk, the
NIST Risk Management Framework, and the HIPAA Security Series: Basics of Risk
Analysis and Risk Management. It is intended to assist covered entities in identifying and
mitigating risks to acceptable levels.
The purpose of a risk assessment is to identify conditions where EPHI could be disclosed
without proper authorization, improperly modified, or made unavailable when needed.
This information is then used to make risk management decisions on whether the
HIPAA-required implementation specifications are sufficient or what additional
addressable implementation specifications are needed to reduce risk to an acceptable
level.

Key Terms Defined
When talking about risk, it is important that terminology be defined and clearly
understood. This section defines important terms associated with risk assessment and
management.
   •   Risk is the potential impact that a threat can have on the confidentiality, integrity,
       and availability on EPHI by exploiting a vulnerability.
   •   Threats are anything that can have a negative impact on EPHI. Threats are:
           o Intentional (e.g., malicious intent); or
           o Unintentional (e.g., misconfigured server, data entry error).
   •   Threat sources are:
           o Natural (e.g., floods, earthquakes, storms, tornados);
           o Human (e.g., intentional such as identity thieves, hackers, spyware
             authors; unintentional such as data entry error, accidental deletions); or
           o Environmental (e.g., power surges and spikes, hazmat contamination,
             environmental pollution).
   •   Vulnerabilities are a flaw or weakness in a system security procedure, design,
       implementation, or control that could be intentionally or unintentionally exercised
       by a threat.
   •   Impact is a negative quantitative and/or qualitative assessment of a vulnerability
       being exercised on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of EPHI.
It can be easy to confuse vulnerabilities and threats. An organization may be vulnerable
to damage from power spikes. The threats that could exploit this vulnerability may be
overloaded circuits, faulty building wiring, dirty street power, or too much load on the
local grid. It is important to separate these two terms in order to assist in proper security
control selection. In this example, security controls could range from installing UPS
systems, additional fuse boxes, or standby generators, or rewiring the office. These


                                             E-1
additional security controls may help to mitigate the vulnerability but not necessarily for
each threat.

HIPAA Risk Assessment Requirements
Standard 164.308(a)(1)(i), Security Management Process, requires covered entities to:
            Implement policies and procedures to prevent, detect, contain, and correct
            security violations.
The Security Management Process standard includes four required implementation
specifications. Two of these specifications deal directly with risk analysis and risk
management.
       1. Risk Analysis (R 123 ) – 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A): Conduct an accurate and thorough
          assessment of the potential risks and vulnerabilities to the confidentiality,
          integrity, and availability of electronic protected health information held by the
          covered entity.
       2. Risk Management (R) – 163.308(a)(1)(ii)(B): Implement security measures
          sufficient to reduce risks and vulnerabilities to a reasonable and appropriate level
          to comply with Section 164.306(a).

How to Conduct the Risk Assessment:
Risk assessments can be conducted using many different methodologies. There is no
single methodology that will work for all organizations and all situations. The following
steps represent key elements in a comprehensive risk assessment program, and provide an
example of the risk assessment methodology described in NIST SP 800-30. It is
expected that these steps will be customized to most effectively identify risk for an
organization based on its own uniqueness. Even though these items are listed as steps,
they are not prescriptive in the order that they should be conducted. Some steps can be
conducted simultaneously rather than sequentially.

       1. Scope the Assessment. The first step in assessing risk is to define the scope of
          the effort, resulting in a general characterization of the information system, its
          operating environment, and its boundary. To do this, it is necessary to identify
          where EPHI is created, received, maintained, processed, or transmitted.
            The scope of a risk assessment should include both the physical boundaries of a
            covered entity’s location as well as a logical boundary covering the media
            containing EPHI, regardless of its location. Ensure that the risk assessment scope
            takes into consideration the remote work force and telecommuters, and removable
            media and portable computing devices (e.g., laptops, removable media, and
            backup media).
       2. Gather Information. During this step, the covered entity should identify:
                 •    The conditions under which EPHI is created, received, maintained,
                      processed, or transmitted by the covered entity; and

123
      “R” indicates a required implementation specification.


                                                               E-2
           •     The security controls currently being used to protect the EPHI.
     This step is essential to ensure that vulnerabilities and threats are correctly
     identified. For example, an invalidated belief that a policy is being followed can
     miss a potential vulnerability, and not knowing about portable media containing
     EPHI can miss a threat to that environment. The level of effort needed to gather
     the necessary information depends heavily on the scope of the assessment and the
     size of the covered entity.
  3. Identify Realistic Threats. Often performed simultaneously with step 4, Identify
     Potential Vulnerabilities, the goal of this step is to identify the potential threat
     sources and compile a threat statement listing potential threat-sources that are
     applicable to the covered entity and its operating environment. The listing of
     threat sources should include realistic and probable human and natural incidents
     that can have a negative impact on an organizations ability to protect EPHI.
     Threats can be easily identified by examining the environments where EPHI is
     being used.
     Many external sources can be used for threat identification. Internet searches,
     vendor information, insurance data, and crime statistics are all viable sources of
     threat data. Examples of some common threat sources are listed in Table 5 below.
                             Table 5. Common Threat Sources

          Type                                        Examples
Natural                    Floods, earthquakes, tornados, landslides, avalanches, electrical
                           storms, and other such events
Human                      Events that are either enabled by or caused by human beings,
                           such as unintentional acts (inadvertent data entry) or deliberate
                           actions (network-based attacks, malicious software upload, and
                           unauthorized access to confidential information)
Environmental              Long-term power failure, pollution, chemicals, liquid leak

  4. Identify Potential Vulnerabilities. Often performed simultaneously with step 3,
     Identify Realistic Threats, the goal of this step is to develop a list of
     vulnerabilities (flaws or weaknesses) that could be exploited by potential threat
     sources. This list should focus on realistic technical and nontechnical areas where
     EPHI can be disclosed without proper authorization, improperly modified, or
     made unavailable when needed.
     Covered entities should use internal and external sources to identify potential
     vulnerabilities. Internal sources may include previous risk assessments,
     vulnerability scan and system security test results, and audit reports. External
     sources may include Internet searches, vendor information, insurance data, and
     vulnerability databases such as the National Vulnerability Database
     (http://nvd.nist.gov). At the end of this appendix, a suggested (but not all-
     inclusive) source list is provided that organizations may wish to use to help in
     vulnerability identification.


                                             E-3
   5. Assess Current Security Controls. Often performed simultaneously with step 2,
      Gather Information, the purpose of this step is to determine if the implemented or
      planned security controls will minimize or eliminate risks to EPHI. A thorough
      understanding of the actual security controls in place for a covered entity will
      reduce the list of vulnerabilities, as well as the realistic probability, of a threat
      attacking (intentionally or unintentionally) EPHI.
       Covered entities should evaluate technical and nontechnical security controls at
       all places where EPHI is created, received, maintained, processed, or transmitted.
       This evaluation should determine whether the security measures implemented or
       planned are adequate to protect EPHI, and whether those measures required by
       the Security Rule are in place, configured, and used properly. The
       appropriateness and adequacy of security measures may vary depending on the
       structure, size, and geographical dispersion of the covered entity.

   6. Determine the Likelihood and the Impact of a Threat Exercising a
      Vulnerability. The next major step in measuring the level of risk is to determine
      the likelihood and the adverse impact resulting from a threat successfully
      exploiting a vulnerability. This information can be obtained from existing
      organizational documentation, such as business impact and asset criticality
      assessments. A business impact assessment prioritizes the impact levels
      associated with the compromise of an organization’s information assets based on
      a qualitative or quantitative assessment of the sensitivity and criticality of those
      assets. An asset criticality assessment identifies and prioritizes the sensitive and
      critical organization information assets (e.g., hardware, software, systems,
      services, and related technology assets) that support the organization’s critical
      missions.
       If these organizational documents do not exist, the system and data sensitivity can
       be determined based on the level of protection required to maintain the EPHI’s
       confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The adverse impact of a security event
       can be described in terms of loss or degradation of any, or a combination of any,
       of the following three security objectives: integrity, availability, and
       confidentiality. Table 6 provides a brief description of each security objective
       and the consequence (or impact) of its not being met.
                      Table 6. Security Objectives and Impacts

 Security Objective                                   Impacts

Loss of Confidentiality System and data confidentiality refers to the protection of
                        information from unauthorized disclosure. The impact of
                        unauthorized disclosure of confidential information can range
                        from the jeopardizing of national security to the disclosure of
                        Privacy Act data. Unauthorized, unanticipated, or unintentional
                        disclosure could result in loss of public confidence,
                        embarrassment, or legal action against the organization.

 Security Objective                                   Impacts

Loss of Integrity        System and data integrity refers to the requirement that
                         information be protected from improper modification. Integrity
                         is lost if unauthorized changes are made to the data or IT system
                         by either intentional or accidental acts. If the loss of system or
                         data integrity is not corrected, continued use of the
                         contaminated system or corrupted data could result in
                         inaccuracy, fraud, or erroneous decisions. Also, violation of
                         integrity may be the first step in a successful attack against
                         system availability or confidentiality. For all these reasons, loss
                         of integrity reduces the assurance of an IT system.

Loss of Availability     If a mission-critical IT system is unavailable to its end users, the
                         organization’s mission may be affected. Loss of system
                         functionality and operational effectiveness, for example, may
                         result in loss of productive time, thus impeding the end users’
                         performance of their functions in supporting the organization’s
                         mission.

       Some tangible impacts can be measured quantitatively in terms of lost revenue,
       the cost of repairing the system, or the level of effort required to correct problems
       caused by a successful threat action. Other impacts, such as the loss of public
       confidence, the loss of credibility, or damage to an organization’s interest, cannot
       be measured in specific units but can be qualified or described in terms of high,
       medium, and low impacts. Qualitative and quantitative methods can be used to
       measure the impact of a threat occurring
   7. Determine the Level of Risk. The purpose of this step is to assess the level of
      risk to the IT system. The determination of risk takes into account the
      information gathered and determinations made during the previous steps. The
      level of risk is determined by analyzing the values assigned to the likelihood of
      threat occurrence and resulting impact of threat occurrence. The risk-level
      determination may be performed by assigning a risk level based on the average of
      the assigned likelihood and impact levels. A risk-level matrix, such as the sample
      depicted in Table 7, can be used to assist in determining risk levels.
                          Table 7. Sample Risk-Level Matrix
                                                      Impact
 Threat Likelihood
                               Low                   Moderate                  High
        High                   Low                   Moderate                  High
     Moderate                  Low                   Moderate                Moderate
        Low                    Low                     Low                     Low




                                            E-5
   8. Recommend Security Controls. During this step, security controls that could
      mitigate the identified risks, as appropriate to the organization’s operations, are
      recommended. The goal of the recommended controls is to reduce the level of
      risk to the IT system and its data to an acceptable level. Security control
      recommendations provide input to the risk mitigation process, during which the
      recommended security controls are evaluated, prioritized, and implemented.
       It should be noted that not all possible recommended security controls can be
       implemented to reduce loss. To determine which ones are required and
       appropriate for a specific organization, a cost-benefit analysis should be
       conducted for the proposed recommended controls, to demonstrate that the costs
       of implementing the controls can be justified by the reduction in the level of risk.
       In addition to cost, organizations should consider the operational impact and
       feasibility of introducing the recommended security controls into the operating
       environment.

   9. Document the Risk Assessment Results.
       Once the risk assessment has been completed (threat sources and vulnerabilities
       identified, risks assessed, and security controls recommended), the results of each
       step in the risk assessment should be documented. NIST SP 800-30 provides a
       sample risk assessment report outline that may prove useful to covered entities.

Risk Assessment Results Affect Risk Management
The results of a risk assessment play a significant role in executing an organization’s risk
management strategy. In the context of the HIPAA Security Rule, the security control
baseline, which consists of the standards and required implementation specifications,
should be viewed as the foundation or starting point in the selection of adequate security
controls necessary to protect EPHI. In many cases, additional security controls or control
enhancements will be needed to protect EPHI or to satisfy the requirements of applicable
laws, policies, standards, or regulations.
The risk assessment provides important inputs to determine the sufficiency of the security
control baseline. The risk assessment results, coupled with the security control baseline,
should be used to identify which addressable implementation specifications should be
implemented to adequately mitigate identified risks.

performing risk assessment, analysis, and management activities, and demonstrate
compliance with the Security Management Process standard and related implementation

Appendix F: Contingency Planning Guidelines
Information technology (IT) and automated information systems are vital elements in
most business processes. Because these IT resources are so essential to an organization’s
success, it is critical that the services provided by these systems are able to operate
effectively without excessive interruption. Contingency planning supports this
requirement by establishing thorough plans and procedures and technical measures that
can enable a system to be recovered quickly and effectively following a service
disruption or disaster. Interim measures may include the relocation of IT systems and
operations to an alternate site, the recovery of IT functions using alternate equipment, or
the performance of IT functions using manual methods.
IT systems are vulnerable to a variety of disruptions, ranging from mild (e.g., short-term
power outage, disk drive failure) to severe (e.g., equipment destruction, fire).
Vulnerabilities may be minimized or eliminated through technical, management, or
operational solutions as part of the organization’s risk management effort. However, it is
virtually impossible to completely eliminate all risks. Contingency planning is designed
to mitigate the risk of system and service unavailability by focusing efficient and
effective recovery solutions.
Within the context of HIPAA, the goal of contingency planning is to adequately protect
EPHI during a contingency event, and to ensure that organizations have their EPHI
available when it is needed.
This appendix, Contingency Planning Guidelines, will identify fundamental planning
principles and practices to help personnel develop and maintain effective information
system contingency plans. This section will be based on NIST Special Publication 800-
34, Contingency Planning Guide for Information Technology Systems.




Contingency Planning Defined
IT contingency planning refers to a coordinated strategy involving plans, procedures, and
technical measures that enable the recovery of IT systems, operations, and data after a
disruption. Contingency planning generally includes one or more of the approaches to
restore disrupted IT services:
   •   Restoring IT operations at an alternate location;
   •   Recovering IT operations using alternate equipment; and


                                            F-1
    •   Performing some or all of the affected business processes using non-IT (manual)
        means (typically acceptable for only short-term disruptions).

Types of Contingency-Related Plans
IT contingency planning represents a broad scope of activities designed to sustain and
recover critical IT services following an emergency. IT contingency planning fits into a
much broader emergency preparedness environment that includes organizational and
business process continuity and recovery planning. Ultimately, an organization would use
a suite of plans to properly prepare response, recovery, and continuity activities for
disruptions affecting the organization’s IT systems, business processes, and the facility.
Because there is an inherent relationship between an IT system and the business process
it supports, there should be coordination between each plan during development and
updates to ensure that recovery strategies and supporting resources neither negate each
other nor duplicate efforts.

                                Table 8. Types of Contingency Plans

Type of Plan                       Description                             Scope
Contingency Plan (CP)              Management policy and                   Addresses IT system disruptions;

                                   including computer operations,
                                   possibly at an alternate location, in
                                   the event of emergencies, system

IT Contingency Planning Process
To develop and maintain an effective IT contingency plan, organizations should consider
using the approach discussed in NIST SP 800-34, Contingency Planning Guide for
Information Technology Systems, which proposes a step-by-step contingency planning
process, and provides an in-depth discussion of technical contingency planning
considerations for specific types of information technology systems. A summary of this
process is detailed below.

   1. Develop the Contingency Planning Policy Statement. To be effective and to
      ensure that personnel fully understand the agency’s contingency planning
      requirements, the contingency plan must be based on a clearly defined policy
      supported by organizational leadership. The contingency planning policy
      statement should define the organization’s overall contingency objectives and
      establish the organizational framework and responsibilities for IT contingency
      planning. Key policy elements include:
          •   Roles and responsibilities
          •   Scope as applies to the type(s) of platform(s) and organization functions
              subject to contingency planning
          •   Resource requirements
          •   Training requirements
          •   Exercise and testing, and plan maintenance schedules
          •   Frequency of backups and storage of backup media.

   2. Conduct the Business Impact Analysis (BIA). The BIA is a key step in the
      contingency planning process. The BIA enables the organization to fully
      characterize information system requirements, processes, and interdependencies
      and use this information to determine contingency requirements and priorities.


                                           F-3
   The purpose of the BIA is to correlate specific system components with the
   critical services that they provide and, based on that information, to characterize
   the consequences of a disruption to the system components. Key steps include
   identifying critical IT resources, disruption impacts and allowable outage times,
   and developing recovery priorities. Results from the BIA should be appropriately
   incorporated into the analysis and strategy development efforts for the
   organization’s other continuity and recovery plans, including disaster recovery
   and emergency mode operations plans.

3. Identify Preventive Controls. In some cases, the outage impacts identified in
   the BIA may be mitigated or eliminated through preventive measures that deter,
   detect, and/or reduce impacts to the system. Where feasible and cost-effective,
   preventive methods are preferable to actions that may be necessary to recover the
   system after a disruption. Preventive controls should be documented in the
   contingency plan, and personnel associated with the system should be trained on
   how and when to use the controls.
   A variety of preventive controls are available, depending on system type and
   configuration; however, some common measures are listed below:
       •   Appropriately sized uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) to provide
           short-term backup power to all system components (including
           environmental and safety controls)
       •   Gasoline- or diesel-powered generators to provide long-term backup
           power
       •   Air-conditioning systems with adequate excess capacity to permit failure
           of certain components, such as a compressor
       •   Fire suppression systems
       •   Fire and smoke detectors
       •   Water sensors in the computer room ceiling and floor
       •   Plastic tarps that may be unrolled over IT equipment to protect it from
           water damage
       •   Heat-resistant and waterproof containers for backup media and vital
           nonelectronic records
       •   Emergency master system shutdown switch
       •   Offsite storage of backup media, nonelectronic records, and system
           documentation
       •   Technical security controls, such as cryptographic key management and
           least-privilege access controls
       •   Frequent scheduled backups.




                                       F-4
4. Develop Recovery Strategies. Recovery strategies provide a means to restore IT
   operations quickly and effectively following a service disruption. Strategies
   should address disruption impacts and allowable outage times identified in the
   BIA. Several alternatives should be considered when developing the strategy,
   including cost, allowable outage time, security, and integration with larger
   organization-level contingency plans.
   The selected recovery strategy should address the potential impacts identified in
   the BIA and should be integrated into the system architecture during the design
   and implementation phases of the system life cycle.
   The strategy should include a combination of methods that complement one
   another to provide recovery capability over the full spectrum of incidents, ranging
   from minor service disruption to a partial or total loss of primary system
   operations requiring operational resumption at another location. A wide variety
   of recovery approaches may be considered; the appropriate choice depends on the
   incident, type of system, and its operational requirements, including retention
   requirements. Specific recovery methods may include commercial contracts with
   cold, warm, or hot site vendors, mobile sites, mirrored sites, reciprocal
   agreements with internal or external organizations, and service-level agreements
   (SLAs) with the equipment vendors. In addition, high-availability technologies
   such as Redundant Arrays of Independent Disks (RAID), automatic fail-over,
   uninterruptible power supply (UPS), mirrored systems, and multisite data
   archiving systems should be considered when developing a system recovery
   strategy.

5. Develop an IT Contingency Plan. IT contingency plan development is a critical
   step in the process of implementing a comprehensive contingency planning
   program. The plan contains detailed roles, responsibilities, teams, and procedures
   associated with restoring an IT system following a disruption. The contingency
   plan should document technical capabilities designed to support contingency
   operations. Plans need to balance detail with flexibility; usually the more detailed
   the plan, the less scalable and versatile the approach.
   Following the approach described in NIST SP 800-34, the contingency plan
   comprises five main components: Supporting Information, Notification and
   Activation, Recovery, Reconstitution, and Plan Appendices. The first and last
   components provide essential information to ensure a comprehensive plan. The
   Notification and Activation, Recovery, and Reconstitution phases address specific
   actions that the organization should take following a system disruption or
   emergency.
       •   The Supporting Information component includes an introduction and
           concept of operations section that provides essential background or
           contextual information that makes the contingency plan easier to
           understand, implement, and maintain. These details aid in understanding
           the applicability of the guidance, in making decisions on how to use the
           plan, and in providing information on where associated plans and
           information outside the scope of the plan may be found.


                                        F-5
   •   The Notification and Activation Phase defines the initial actions taken
       once a system disruption or emergency has been detected or appears to be
       imminent. This phase includes activities to notify recovery personnel,
       assess system damage, and implement the plan. At the completion of the
       Notification and Activation Phase, recovery staff will be prepared to
       perform contingency measures to restore system functions on a temporary
       basis.
   •   The Recovery Phase begins after the contingency plan has been activated,
       damage assessment has been completed (if possible), personnel have been
       notified, and appropriate teams have been mobilized. Recovery phase
       activities focus on contingency measures to execute temporary IT
       processing capabilities, repair damage to the original system, and restore
       operational capabilities at the original or new facility. At the completion of
       the Recovery Phase, the IT system will be operational and performing the
       functions designated in the plan. Depending on the recovery strategies
       defined in the plan, these functions could include temporary manual
       processing, recovery and operation at an alternate system, or relocation
       and recovery at an alternate site. Teams with recovery responsibilities
       should understand and be able to perform these recovery strategies well
       enough that if the paper plan is unavailable during the initial stages of the
       event, they can still perform the necessary activities.
   •   In the Reconstitution Phase, recovery activities are terminated, and normal
       operations are transferred back to the organization’s facility. If the
       original facility is unrecoverable, the activities in this phase can also be
       applied to preparing a new facility to support system processing
       requirements. Until the primary system is restored and tested, the
       contingency system should continue to be operated. The Reconstitution
       Phase should specify teams responsible for restoring or replacing both the
       site and the information system.
Contingency Plan Appendices should provide key details not contained in the
main body of the plan. The appendices should reflect the specific technical,
operational, and management contingency requirements of the information system
and the larger organization. Appendices can include, but are not limited to,
contact information for contingency planning team personnel; vendor contact
information, including offsite storage and alternate site points of contact; standard
operating procedures and checklists for system recovery or processes; equipment
and system requirements lists of the hardware, software, firmware, and other
resources required to support system operations; vendor agreements, reciprocal
agreements with other organizations, and other vital records; description of, and
directions to, the alternate site; and the BIA.
Plans should be formatted to provide quick and clear direction in the event those
personnel unfamiliar with the plan or the systems are called on to perform
recovery operations. Plans should be clear, concise, and easy to implement in an
emergency. Where possible, checklists and step-by-step procedures should be



                                    F-6
   used. A concise and well-formatted plan reduces the likelihood of creating an
   overly complex or confusing plan.

6. Plan Testing, Training, and Exercises. Plan testing is a critical element of a
   viable contingency capability. Testing enables plan deficiencies to be identified
   and addressed. Testing also helps evaluate the ability of the recovery staff to
   implement the plan quickly and effectively. Each IT contingency plan element
   should be tested to confirm the accuracy of individual recovery procedures and
   the overall effectiveness of the plan. The following areas should be addressed in a
   contingency test:
       •   System recovery on an alternate platform from backup media
       •   Coordination among recovery teams
       •   Internal and external connectivity
       •   System performance using alternate equipment
       •   Restoration of normal operations
       •   Notification procedures.
   Training for personnel with contingency plan responsibilities should complement
   testing. Training should be provided at least annually; new hires with plan
   responsibilities should receive training shortly after they are hired. Ultimately,
   contingency plan personnel should be trained to the extent that that they are able
   to execute their respective recovery procedures without aid of the actual
   document. This is an important goal in the event that paper or electronic versions
   of the plan are unavailable for the first few hours resulting from the extent of the
   disaster. Recovery personnel should be trained on the following plan elements:
       •   Purpose of the plan
       •   Cross-team coordination and communication
       •   Reporting procedures
       •   Security requirements
       •   Team-specific processes (Notification/Activation, Recovery, and
           Reconstitution Phases)
       •   Individual responsibilities (Notification/ Activation, Recovery, and
           Reconstitution Phases).

7. Maintain the plan. To be effective, the plan must be maintained in a ready state
   that accurately reflects system requirements, procedures, organizational structure,
   and policies. IT systems undergo frequent changes because of shifting business
   needs, technology upgrades, or new internal or external policies. Therefore, it is
   essential that the contingency plan be reviewed and updated regularly, as part of
   the organization’s change management process, to ensure that new information is
   documented and contingency measures are revised if required. As a general rule,


                                       F-7

1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 PURPOSE
This {system name} Contingency Plan establishes procedures to recover the {system
name} system following a disruption. The following objectives have been established for
this plan:
   •   Maximize the effectiveness of contingency operations through an established plan
       that consists of the following phases:
           − Notification/Activation phase to detect and assess damage and to activate
           the plan;
           − Recovery phase to restore temporary IT operations and recover damage
           done to the original system; and
           − Reconstitution phase to restore IT system processing capabilities to normal
           operations.
   •   Identify the activities, resources, and procedures needed to carry out {system
       name} processing requirements during prolonged interruptions to normal
       operations.
   •   Assign responsibilities to designated {Organization name} personnel and provide
       guidance for recovering {system name} during prolonged periods of interruption
       to normal operations.
   •   Ensure coordination with other {Organization name} staff who will participate in
       the contingency planning strategies. Ensure coordination with external points of
       contact and vendors who will participate in the contingency planning strategies.

1.2 APPLICABILITY
The {system name} Contingency Plan applies to the functions, operations, and resources
necessary to restore and resume {Organization name}’s {system name} operations as it is
installed at its primary location: {Name, City, State}. The {system name} Contingency
Plan applies to {Organization name} and all other persons associated with {system
name} as identified under Section 2.3, Responsibilities.




                                           G-1
1.3 SCOPE
1.3.1 Planning Principles
Various scenarios were considered to form a basis for the plan, and multiple assumptions
were made. The applicability of the plan is predicated on two key principles:
   •   The {Organization name}’s facility in {City, State}, is inaccessible; therefore,
       {Organization name} is unable to perform {system name} processing for the
       organization.
   •   A valid contract exists with the alternate site that designates that site in {City,
       State}, as {Organization name}’s alternate operating facility.
           – {Organization name} will use the alternate site building and IT resources to
           recover {system name} functionality during an emergency situation that
           prevents access to the original facility.
           – The designated computer system at the alternate site has been configured to
           begin processing {system name} information.
           – The alternate site will be used to continue {system name} recovery and
           processing throughout the period of disruption, until the return to normal
           operations.
1.3.2 Assumptions
Based on these principles, the following assumptions were used when developing the IT
Contingency Plan:
   •   The {system name} is inoperable at the {Organization name} computer center
       and cannot be recovered within {XX} hours.
   •   Key {system name} personnel have been identified and trained in their
       emergency response and recovery roles; they are available to activate the {system
       name} Contingency Plan.
   •   Preventive controls (e.g., generators, environmental controls, waterproof tarps,
       sprinkler systems, fire extinguishers, and fire department assistance) are fully
       operational at the time of the contingency event.
   •   Computer center equipment, including components supporting {system name},
       are connected to an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) that provides {XX}
       minutes/hours of electricity during a power failure.
   •   {System name} hardware and software at the {Organization name} original site
       are unavailable for at least {XX} hours.
   •   Current backups of the application software and data are intact and available at
       the offsite storage facility.
   •   The equipment, connections, and capabilities required to operate {system name}
       are available at the alternate site in {City, State}.




                                            G-2
   •   Service agreements are maintained with {system name} hardware, software, and
       communications providers to support the system recovery.
The {system name} Contingency Plan does not apply to the following situations:
   •   Overall recovery and continuity of business operations. The Business
       Resumption Plan (BRP) and Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP) are appended
       to the plan.
   •   Emergency evacuation of personnel. The Occupant Evacuation Plan (OEP) is
       appended to the plan.
   •   Any additional constraints should be added to this list.

Appendix H: Resources for Secure Remote Use and
Access
The HIPAA Security Rule requires all covered entities to protect the EPHI that they use
or disclose to business associates, trading partners, or other entities. New technologies,
such as remote access and removable media technologies, have significantly simplified
the way in which data is transmitted throughout the healthcare industry and created
tremendous opportunities for improvements and greater efficiency in the healthcare
space. However, these technologies have also increased the risk of loss and unauthorized
use and disclosure of this sensitive information. Sensitive information that is accessed
by, stored on, or transmitted to or from a remote device needs to be protected so that
malicious parties cannot access or alter it. An unauthorized release of sensitive
information could damage the trust in an organization, jeopardize its mission, or harm
individuals if their personal information has been released.
In December 2006, CMS issued a HIPAA security guidance document, Remote Use of
and Access to Electronic Protected Health Information, to reinforce some of the ways a
covered entity may protect EPHI when it is accessed or used outside of the organization’s
physical purview. It sets forth some strategies that may be reasonable and appropriate
under the HIPAA Security Rule, for covered entities to follow (based upon their
individual technological capabilities and operational needs), for offsite use of, or access
to, EPHI. This guidance also places significant emphasis on the importance of risk
analysis and risk management strategies, policies and procedures, and security awareness
and training on the policies and procedures for safeguarding EPHI during its remote
access, storage, and transmission.
NIST publications on remote access, storage, and transmission security technologies can
be valuable resources to support secure remote use solutions. These publications seek to
assist organizations in understanding particular technologies and to provide security
considerations and practical, real-world recommendations for implementing and securing
these technologies within an organization.
Special Publication 800-114, User’s Guide to Securing External Devices for Telework
and Remote Access, was developed to help teleworkers secure the external devices they
use for telework, such as personally owned and third-party privately owned desktop and
laptop computers and consumer devices (e.g., cell phones, personal digital assistants).
The document focuses specifically on security for telework involving remote access to
organizations’ nonpublic computing resources by providing:
   •   Recommendations for securing telework computers’ operating systems and
       applications, as well as home networks that the computers use;
   •   Basic recommendations for securing consumer devices used for telework;
   •   Advice on protecting the information stored on telework computers and
       removable media; and
   •   Tips on considering the security of a device owned by a third party before
       deciding whether it should be used for telework.

Appendix I: Telework Security Considerations
Many people telework, which is the ability for an organization’s employees and
contractors to conduct work from locations other than the organization’s facilities.
Teleworkers use various devices, such as desktop and laptop computers, cell phones, and
personal digital assistants (PDAs), to read and send email, access Web sites, review and
edit documents, and perform many other tasks. Most teleworkers use remote access,
which is the ability of an organization’s users to access its nonpublic computing
resources from locations other than the organization’s facilities. Organizations have many
options for providing remote access, including virtual private networks, remote system
control, and individual application access (e.g., Web-based email).
This appendix provides considerations and tips for securing external devices used for
telework and remote access. More detailed information on this topic is available in NIST
SP 800-114, User’s Guide to Securing External Devices for Telework and Remote
Access.

Before teleworking, users should understand their organization’s policies and
requirements, as well as appropriate ways of protecting the organization’s
information that they may access.
Teleworkers should consult their organization’s policies and requirements to provide
adequate security to protect the organization’s information. Sensitive information that is
stored on, or sent to or from, external telework devices needs to be protected so that
malicious parties can neither access nor alter it. An unauthorized release of sensitive
information could damage the public’s trust in an organization, jeopardize the mission of
an organization, or harm individuals if their personal information has been released.

Teleworkers should ensure that all the devices on their wired and wireless home
networks are properly secured, as well as the home networks themselves.
An important part of telework and remote access security is applying security measures
to the personal computers (PCs) and consumer devices using the same wired and wireless
home networks to which the telework device normally connects. If any of these other
devices become infected with malware or are otherwise compromised, they could attack
the telework device or eavesdrop on its communications. Teleworkers should also be
cautious about allowing others to place devices on the teleworkers’ home networks, in
case one of these devices is compromised.
Teleworkers should apply security measures to the home networks to which their
telework devices normally connect. One example of a security measure is using a
broadband router or firewall appliance to prevent computers outside the home network
from initiating communications with telework devices on the home network. Another
example is ensuring that sensitive information transmitted over a wireless home network
is adequately protected through strong encryption.

Teleworkers should consider the security state of a third-party device before using it
for telework.


                                            I-1
Teleworkers often want to perform remote access from third-party devices, such as
checking email from a kiosk computer at a conference. However, teleworkers typically
do not know if such devices have been secured properly or if they have been
compromised. Consequently, a teleworker could use a third-party device infected with
malware that steals information from users (e.g., passwords or email messages). Many
organizations either forbid third-party devices to be used for remote access or permit only
limited use, such as for Web-based email. Teleworkers should consider who is
responsible for securing a third-party device and who can access the device before
deciding whether or not to use it. Whenever possible, teleworkers should not use publicly
accessible third-party devices for telework, and teleworkers should avoid using any third-
party devices for performing sensitive functions or accessing sensitive information.

Secure a Telework PC
Teleworkers who use their own desktop or laptop PCs for telework should secure their
operating systems and primary applications.
   •   Use a combination of security software, such as antivirus and antispyware
       software, personal firewalls, spam and Web content filtering, and popup blocking,
       to stop most attacks, particularly malware;
   •   Restrict who can use the PC by having a separate standard user account for each
       person, assigning a password to each user account, using the standard user
       accounts for daily use, and protecting user sessions from unauthorized physical
       access;
   •   Ensure that updates and patches are regularly applied to the operating system and
       primary applications, such as Web browsers, email clients, instant messaging
       clients, and security software;
   •   Disable unneeded networking features on the PC and configure wireless
       networking securely;
   •   Configure primary applications to filter content and stop other activity that is
       likely to be malicious;
   •   Install and use only known and trusted software;
   •   Configure remote access software based on the organization’s requirements and
       recommendations; and
   •   Maintain the PC’s security on an ongoing basis, such as changing passwords
       regularly and checking the status of security software periodically.

Secure consumer devices used for telework, such as cell phones, PDAs, and video
game systems
A wide variety of consumer devices exists, and security features available for these
devices also vary widely. Some devices offer only a few basic features, whereas others
offer sophisticated features similar to those offered by PCs. This does not necessarily
imply that more security features are better; in fact, many devices offer more security
features because the capabilities they provide (e.g., wireless networking, instant


                                            I-2
messaging) make them more susceptible to attack than devices without these capabilities.
General recommendations for securing telework devices are as follows:
   •   Limit access to the device, such as setting a personal identification number (PIN)
       or password and automatically locking a device after an idle period;
   •   Disable networking capabilities, such as Bluetooth, except when they are needed;
   •   Use additional security software, such as antivirus software and personal
       firewalls, if appropriate;
   •   Ensure that security updates, if available, are acquired and installed at least
       monthly, or more frequently; and
   •   Configure applications to support security (e.g., blocking activity that is likely to
       be malicious).

Secure Information
   •   Use physical security controls for telework devices and removable media. For
       example, an organization might require that laptops be physically secured using
       cable locks when used in hotels, conferences, and other locations where third
       parties could easily gain physical access to the devices. Organizations may also
       have physical security requirements for papers and other non-computer media that
       contain sensitive information and are taken outside the organization’s facilities.
   •   Encrypt files stored on telework devices and removable media such as CDs and
       flash drives. This prevents attackers from readily gaining access to information in
       the files. Many options exist for protecting files, including encrypting individual
       files or folders, volumes, and hard drives. Generally, using an encryption method
       to protect files also requires the use of an authentication mechanism (e.g.,
       password) to decrypt the files when needed.
   •   Ensure that information stored on telework devices is backed up. If something
       adverse happens to a device, such as a hardware, software, or power failure or a
       natural disaster, the information on the device will be lost unless it has been
       backed up to another device or removable media. Some organizations permit
       teleworkers to back up their local files to a centralized system (e.g., through VPN
       remote access), whereas other organizations recommend that their teleworkers
       perform local backups (e.g., burning CDs, copying files onto removable media).
       Teleworkers should perform backups, following their organizations’ guidelines,
       and verify that the backups are valid and complete. It is important that backups
       on removable media be secured at least as well as the device that they backed up.
       For example, if a computer is stored in a locked room, then the media also should
       be in a secured location; if a computer stores its data encrypted, then the backups
       of that data should also be encrypted.
   •   Ensure that information is destroyed when it is no longer needed. For example,
       the organization’s files should be removed from a computer scheduled to be
       retired or from a third-party computer that is temporarily used for remote access.
       Some remote access methods perform basic information cleanup, such as clearing


                                            I-3
       Web browser caches that might inadvertently hold sensitive information, but more
       extensive cleanup typically requires using a special utility, such as a disk-
       scrubbing program specifically designed to remove all traces of information from
       a device. Another example of information destruction is shredding telework
       papers containing sensitive information once the papers are no longer needed.
   •   Erase information from missing cell phones and PDAs. If a cell phone or PDA is
       lost or stolen, occasionally its contents can be erased remotely. This prevents an
       attacker from obtaining any information from the device. The availability of this
       service depends on the capabilities of the product and the company providing
       network services for the product.

Adequately protect remote access-specific authenticators
   •   Teleworkers need to ensure that they adequately protect their remote access-
       specific authenticators, such as passwords, personal identification numbers
       (PINs), and hardware tokens. Such authenticators should not be stored with the
       telework computer, nor should multiple authenticators be stored with each other
       (e.g., a password or PIN should not be written on the back of a hardware token).

Social Engineering
   •   Teleworkers should be aware of how to handle threats involving social
       engineering, which is a general term for attackers trying to trick people into
       revealing sensitive information or performing certain actions, such as
       downloading and executing files that appear to be benign but are actually
       malicious. For example, an attacker might approach a teleworker in a coffee shop
       and ask to use the computer for a minute or offer to help the teleworker with using
       the computer.
   •   Teleworkers should be wary of any requests they receive that could lead to a
       security breach or to the theft of a telework device.

Handling a Security Breach
   •   If a teleworker suspects that a security breach (including loss or theft of materials)
       has occurred involving a telework device, remote access communications,
       removable media, or other telework components, the teleworker should
       immediately follow the organization’s policy and procedures for reporting the
       possible breach. This is particularly important if any of the affected telework
       components contain sensitive information such as EPHI, so that the potential
       impact of a security breach is minimized.
