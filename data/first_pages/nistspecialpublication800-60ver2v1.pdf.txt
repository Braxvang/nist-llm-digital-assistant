The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has developed this document in furtherance of its
statutory responsibilities under the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002, Public Law
107-347.

NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements, for providing
adequate information security for all agency operations and assets, but such standards and guidelines shall not
apply to national security systems. This guideline is consistent with the requirements of the Office of
Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Section 8b(3), Securing Agency Information Systems, as
analyzed in A-130, Appendix IV: Analysis of Key Sections. Supplemental information is provided A-130,
Appendix III.

This guideline has been prepared for use by Federal agencies. It may be used by non-governmental
organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright. (Attribution would be appreciated by NIST.)

Nothing in this document should be taken to contradict standards and guidelines made mandatory and binding
on Federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory authority. Nor should these guidelines be
interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the Secretary of Commerce, Director of the
OMB, or any other Federal official.

NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-60 may be used by organizations in conjunction with an emerging
family of security-related publications including:
•   FIPS Publication 199, Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information
    Systems, February 2004;
•   NIST SP 800-37, Guide for the Security Certification and Accreditation of Federal Information
    Systems (Final public draft), April 2004;
•   NIST SP 800-53, Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems, (Initial public
    draft), October 2003.
•   NIST SP 800-53A, Techniques and Procedures for Verifying the Effectiveness of Security Controls in
    Information Systems (Initial public draft), Fall 2004;
•   NIST SP 800-59, Guideline for Identifying an Information System as a National Security System,
    August 2003; and
•   FIPS Publication 200, Minimum Security Controls for Federal Information Systems, (Projected for
    publication, Fall 2005) 1
This series of seven documents, when completed, is intended to provide a structured, yet flexible
framework for selecting, specifying, employing, and evaluating the security controls in Federal
information systems—and thus, make a significant contribution toward satisfying the requirements of the
Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002. We regret that all seven publications
could not be released simultaneously. However, due to the current international climate and high priority
of information security for the Federal government, we have decided to release the individual publications
as they are completed. While the publications are mutually reinforcing and have some dependencies, in
most cases, they can be effectively used independently of one another.

This is Volume I of two volumes. It contains the basic guidelines for mapping types of information and
information systems to security categories. The appendixes, including security categorization
recommendations for mission-based information types and rationale for security categorization
recommendations, are published as a separate volume.

The SP 800-60 information types and security impact levels are based on the OMB Federal Enterprise
Architecture Program Management Office’s Business Reference Model 2.0, inputs from participants in
NIST SP 800-60 workshops, and FIPS 199. Rationale for the example impact level recommendations
provided in the appendixes have been derived from multiple sources, and as such, will require several
iterations of review, comment, and subsequent modification to achieve consistency in terminology,
structure, and content. The prerequisite role played by security categorization in selection of SP 800-53
security controls, and the importance of security controls in the protection of Federal information systems,
demands early exposure to the community who will be employing those controls and thus, motivated the
release of this document at the earliest opportunity.

  FIPS Publication 200, Minimum Security Controls for Federal Information Systems, when published in 2005, will
replace NIST Special Publication 800-53 and become a mandatory standard for Federal agencies in accordance with
the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Title III of the E-Government Act (Public Law 107-347), titled the Federal Information Security
Management Act (FISMA), tasked the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to
develop:
   •   Standards to be used by all Federal agencies to categorize all information and information
       systems collected or maintained by or on behalf of each agency based on the objectives
       of providing appropriate levels of information security according to a range of risk levels;
   •   Guidelines recommending the types of information and information systems to be
       included in each such category; and
   •   Minimum information security requirements (i.e., management, operational, and
       technical controls), for information and information systems in each such category.

In response to the second of these tasks, this guideline has been developed to assist Federal
government agencies to categorize information and information systems. The guideline’s
objective is to facilitate provision of appropriate levels of information security according to a
range of levels of impact or consequences that might result from the unauthorized disclosure,
modification, or loss of availability of the information or information system. This guideline
assumes that the user is familiar with Standards for Security Categorization of Federal
Information and Information Systems (FIPS 199). The guideline and its appendixes:

   •   Review the security categorization terms and definitions established by FIPS 199;
   •   Recommend a security categorization process;
   •   Describe a methodology for identifying types of Federal information and information
       systems;
   •   Suggest provisional security impact levels for common information types;
   •   Discuss information attributes that may result in variances from the provisional
       impact level assignment; and
   •   Describe how to establish a system security categorization based on the system’s use,
       connectivity, and aggregate information content.

Types of information can normally be divided into information associated with administrative
activities common to most agencies and information associated with an agency’s mission-
specific activities. In this guideline, administrative, management, and support information is
referred to as management and support information. This guideline is less prescriptive for
mission-based information than for administrative and support information because there is
significantly less commonality of mission information types among agencies than is the case for
administrative and support information. While specific administrative and support information
types are identified in this guideline, the treatment of mission-based information focuses on
general guidelines for identification of information types and assignment of impact levels.
(Examples of management and support impact assignments are discussed in Appendix C, and
examples of mission-based impact assignments are discussed in Appendix D.)

This document is intended as a reference resource rather than as a tutorial. Not all of the
material will be relevant to all agencies. This document includes two volumes, a basic guideline


                                                 vii
and a volume of appendixes. Users should review the guidelines provided in Volume I, then
refer to only that specific material from the appendixes that applies to their own systems and
applications.

The provisional impact assignments contained in the appendixes are only the first step in impact
assignment and subsequent risk assessment processes. The impact assignments are not intended
to be used by auditors as a definitive checklist for information types and impact assignments.

The basis employed in this guideline for the identification of information types is the Office of
Management and Budget’s Federal Enterprise Architecture Program Management Office June
2003 publication, The Business Reference Model Version 2.0 (BRM). The BRM describes
functions relating to the purpose of government (missions, or services to citizens), the
mechanisms the government uses to achieve its purpose (modes of delivery), the support
functions necessary to conduct government (support services), and the resource management
functions that support all areas of the government’s business (management of resources). The
information types associated with support services and management of resources functions are
treated as management and support types. (Although the OMB BRM is subject to revision from
time to time, not all BRM changes will result in changes to the information taxonomy employed
in this guideline.)

Some additional information types have been added at the request of Federal agencies.
Appendix C recommends provisional confidentiality, integrity, and availability information
categories for each management and support information type and provides rationale underlying
the provisional impact levels. The information types associated with services to citizens and
modes of delivery functions are treated as mission-based information. Recommended
provisional impact levels, underlying rationale, and examples of rationale for deviation from the
provisional assignments for mission-based information types are provided in Appendix D.

Some information has been established in law, by Executive Order, or by agency regulation as
requiring protection from disclosure. Appendix E addresses legal and executive sources that
establish sensitivity and/or criticality (These terms are defined in Appendix A.) characteristics
for information processed by Federal government departments and agencies. Individual citations
from the United States Code are listed in the appendix.

                        Security Categories
1.0 INTRODUCTION
Title III of the E-Government Act (Public Law 107-347), titled the Federal Information Security
Management Act (FISMA), tasked NIST to develop:
   •   Standards to be used by all Federal agencies to categorize all information and information
       systems collected or maintained by or on behalf of each agency based on the objectives
       of providing appropriate levels of information security according to a range of risk levels;
   •   Guidelines recommending the types of information and information systems to be
       included in each category; and
   •   Minimum information security requirements (i.e., management, operational, and
       technical controls), for information and information systems in each such category.
The purpose of NIST SP 800-60 is to address the second FISMA-related task— development of
guidelines recommending the types of information and information systems to be included in
each category of potential security impact. This will help agencies to map security impact levels
in a consistent manner to types of: (i) information (e.g., privacy, medical, proprietary, financial,
contractor sensitive, trade secret, investigation); and (ii) information systems (e.g., mission
critical, mission support, administrative).

Types of information can typically be divided into information associated with an agency’s
mission-specific activities and information associated with administrative, management, and
support activities common to most agencies. In this guideline, administrative, management, and
support information are referred to as management and support information. Security attributes
of information associated with mission-based activities will often vary from agency to agency
and can vary among organizations within an agency. This guideline addresses mission-based
information separately from the more agency-common management and support information.
Because the consequences of security compromise of mission-based information vary among
different operational environments, this guideline is less prescriptive in the case of mission-based
information than in the case of management and support information. Similarly, the specialized
knowledge of information types, information use, and program and mission life-cycle context on
which the sensitivity of mission-based information is dependent is concentrated within the
agency responsible for that mission information (or within responsible organizations within
agencies). While specific management and support information types are defined and discussed
the basic guideline, the treatment of mission-based information is limited to general guidelines
for identification of information types and assignment of impact levels. (Descriptions and
provisional impact assignments for both classes of information types are provided in Appendixes
C and D, respectively, together with supporting rationale).

1.1 Structure
This guideline is divided into two volumes. Volume I provides information type identification
and security categorization guidelines. Volume II consists of the appendixes, including
examples of impact assignments and security categorization rationale.


                                                 1
Volume I provides the following background information and mapping guidelines:

      •   Section 2: An overview of the security objectives and impact levels identified in the
          Federal Information Processing Standard 199, Standards for Security Categorization of
          Federal Information and Information Systems [FIPS 199];

      •   Section 3: Overview of the process used to select impact levels, general considerations
          relating to impact assignment, and guidelines for system categorization;

      •   Section 4: Guidelines for identification of mission-based information types and for
          assignment of security impact levels to mission information; and

      •   Section 5: Recommended information types for management and support information
          (administrative, management, and service information).

Volume II includes the following appendixes:

      •   Appendix A: Glossary;

      •   Appendix B: References;

      •   Appendix C: Provisional impact assignments and supporting rationale for
          management and support information (administrative, management, and service
          information);

      •   Appendix D: Provisional impact assignments and supporting rationale for mission-
          based information (mission information and services delivery mechanisms); and

      •   Appendix E: Legislative and executive sources that specify sensitivity/criticality
          properties.

This guideline is intended as a reference resource rather than as a tutorial. Not all of the material
will be relevant to all agencies. It is intended that users will review the introductory material,
terminology, and process material in the first three sections of the guideline. The users should
review the guidelines for assignment of impact levels found in Section 4, for mission
information, and Section 5, for administrative, management, and service information. The user
then needs to refer to only that material from the rest of the guideline that applies to his or her
systems and applications. Material intended to support assignment and review of provisional
impact levels is included in Appendixes C, D, and E.

1.2 Applicability
This recommendation applies to all Federal systems other than national security systems.
National security systems store, process, or communicate national security information. 2

    FISMA defines a national security system as any information system (including any telecommunications system)

assignment and should be reviewed in subsequent risk assessment processes. They are not
designed to be used by auditors as a definitive checklist for information types and impact
assignments.

2.0 SECURITY CATEGORIZATION OF INFORMATION AND
     INFORMATION SYSTEMS
Federal Information Processing Standard 199, Standards for Security Categorization of Federal
Information and Information Systems (FIPS 199), defines the security categories, security
objectives, and impact levels to which this guide maps information types. FIPS 199 also
describes the context of use for this guideline. Some of the content of FIPS 199 is included in
this section in order to simplify the use of this guideline.
Most Federal government agencies have both the expertise and information base to determine the
potential impact level or magnitude of harm that can be expected to result from a loss of
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of their information and/or information systems. FIPS
199 establishes security categories based on the magnitude of harm that can be expected to result
from compromises rather than on the results of an assessment that includes an attempt to
determine the probability of compromise.
Appendixes to this SP 800-60 guideline recommend provisional impact levels for specific
information types. They also provide some rationale for these recommended provisional levels
and discuss some of the circumstances that might result in assignment of impact levels higher or
lower than the recommended provisional levels.
The impact levels associated with the management and support information common to many
agencies are strongly affected by the mission-based information with which it is associated. That
is, agency-common information used with very sensitive or critical mission-based information
types may have higher impact levels than agency-common information used with less critical
mission-based information types. Each organization should review the provisional information
impact levels in the context of its own operational environment, then accept or revise impact
levels accordingly. The impact level of information can be defined only within the context of an
organization’s operational environment. The same information types that may have low impact
in the operational context of one organization or operation may have a high impact level in
another organizational or operational context.
Generally, information systems process many types of information. Not all of these information
types are likely to have the same impact levels. The compromise of some information types will
jeopardize system functionality and agency mission more than the compromise of other
information types. System impact levels must be assessed in the context of system mission and
function as well as on the basis of the aggregate of the component information types.

2.1 Security Categories and Objectives (Contents from FIPS 199)
2.1.1 Security Categories

FIPS 199 establishes security categories for both information 3 and information systems. The
security categories are based on the potential impact on an organization should certain events

3
  Information is categorized according to its information type. An information type is a specific category of
information (e.g., privacy, medical, proprietary, financial, investigative, contractor sensitive, security management),
defined by an organization, or in some instances, by a specific law, Executive Order, directive, policy, or regulation.


                                                           5
occur which jeopardize the information and information systems needed by the organization to
accomplish its assigned mission, protect its assets, fulfill its legal responsibilities, maintain its
day-to-day functions, and protect individuals. Security categories are to be used in conjunction
with vulnerability and threat information in assessing the risk to an organization.

FIPS 199 establishes three potential levels of impact (low, moderate, and high) relevant to
securing Federal information and information systems for each of three stated security objectives
(confidentiality, integrity, and availability).

2.1.2 Security Objectives and Types of Potential Losses

The Federal Information Security Management Act and FIPS 199 define three security objectives
for information and information systems.
2.1.2.1 Confidentiality

“Preserving authorized restrictions on information access and disclosure, including means for
protecting personal privacy and proprietary information…” [44 U.S.C., Sec. 3542]

A loss of confidentiality is the unauthorized disclosure of information.
2.1.2.2 Integrity

“Guarding against improper information modification or destruction, and includes ensuring
information non-repudiation and authenticity…” [44 U.S.C., Sec. 3542]
A loss of integrity is the unauthorized modification or destruction of information.
2.1.2.3 Availability

“Ensuring timely and reliable access to and use of information…” [44 U.S.C., SEC. 3542]
A loss of availability is the disruption of access to or use of information or an information
system.

2.2 Impact Assessment (Contents from FIPS 199)
The application of the FIPS 199 definitions for levels of potential impact on organizations or
individuals should there be a breach of security must take place within the context of each
organization and the overall national interest.

2.2.1 Levels of Impact

The potential impact is low if—




                                                  6
− The loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability could be expected to have a limited
  adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals. 4

    A limited adverse effect means that, for example, the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or
    availability might: (i) cause a degradation in mission capability to an extent and duration that
    the organization is able to perform its primary functions, but the effectiveness of the
    functions is noticeably reduced; (ii) result in minor damage to organizational assets; (iii)
    result in minor financial loss; or (iv) result in minor harm to individuals.

The potential impact is moderate if—
− The loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability could be expected to have a serious
  adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals.

    A serious adverse effect means that, for example, the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or
    availability might: (i) cause a significant degradation in mission capability to an extent and
    duration that the organization is able to perform its primary functions, but the effectiveness
    of the functions is significantly reduced; (ii) result in significant damage to organizational
    assets; (iii) result in significant financial loss; or (iv) result in significant harm to individuals
    that does not involve loss of life or serious life threatening injuries.

The potential impact is high if—
− The loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability could be expected to have a severe or
  catastrophic adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, or
  individuals.

    A severe or catastrophic adverse effect means that, for example, the loss of confidentiality,
    integrity, or availability might: (i) cause a severe degradation in or loss of mission capability
    to an extent and duration that the organization is not able to perform one or more of its
    primary functions; (ii) result in major damage to organizational assets; (iii) result in major
    financial loss; or (iv) result in severe or catastrophic harm to individuals involving loss of life
    or serious life threatening injuries.

2.2.2 Establishment of Security Categories for Information Types

In FIPS 199, the security category of an information type can be associated with both user
information and system information 5 and can be applicable to information in either electronic or
non-electronic form. It is also used as input in considering the appropriate security category for
a system. Establishing an appropriate security category for an information type simply requires
determining the potential impact for each security objective associated with the particular
information type. The generalized format for expressing the security category, or SC, of an
information type is:

4
  Adverse effects on individuals may include, but are not limited to, loss of the privacy to which individuals are
entitled under law.
5
  System information (e.g., network routing tables, password files, and cryptographic key management information)
must be protected at a level commensurate with the most critical or sensitive user information being processed by
the information system to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability.


                                                        7
Security Categoryinformation type = {(confidentiality, impact), (integrity, impact), (availability, impact)}
where the acceptable values for potential impact are low, moderate, high, or not applicable. 6




6
    The potential impact value of not applicable may be applied only to the confidentiality security objective.

3.0 ASSIGNMENT OF IMPACT LEVELS AND SECURITY
     CATEGORIZATION
3.1 Mapping Information Types to Security Controls and Impact Levels
This subsection provides a step-by-step methodology for mapping information types and
information systems to security controls and impact levels. Assignment of security levels is
based on FIPS 199, Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and
Information Systems. This document assumes that the user has read and is familiar with FIPS
199.

Figure 1 illustrates the security categorization process and how security categorization fits into
the process of selecting security controls. This process is performed for every information
system.

                                 Figure 1: SP 800-60 Security Categorization Process

      1. Identify information systems. An information system may be a general support system, a
         major application, or a local or special purpose system. Agencies should develop their
         own policies regarding system identification for security categorization purposes. The
         system is generally bounded by a security perimeter. 7

      2. Identify information types. The user should identify all of the information types that are
         input, stored, processed, and/or output from each system.7

7
    Some assumptions must be made for information types and security perimeters for planned/proposed systems.


                                                          9
   3. Select provisional impact levels. The user should select the provisional impact levels for
      each identified information type. (E.g., see Appendixes C and D.)

   4. Review and adjust provisional impact levels. The user should review the appropriateness
      of the provisional impact levels recommended for the user’s information types based on
      the organization, environment, mission, use, and connectivity associated with the system
      under review.

       After reviewing the provisional impact levels, adjustments should be made to the impact
       levels as appropriate.

   5. Assign system security category. The user now establishes the level of confidentiality
      impact, integrity impact, and availability impact associated with the system under review.
      The adjusted impact levels for information types are reviewed with respect to the
      aggregate of all information processed in or by each system. In some cases, the
      consequences of loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the information
      aggregate can be more serious than that for any single information type. In addition, a
      system’s access control information and the system software that protects and invokes it
      can both affect the integrity and availability attributes of a system and even access to
      other systems to which the system under review is connected.

Following completion of the security categorization process, the confidentiality, integrity, and
availability impact level determinations that result from this process can then be used as an input
to a system risk assessment and selection of the set of security controls necessary for each
system. The minimum security controls recommended for each system security category can be
found in NIST SP 800-53, Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems.

Figure 2 depicts the role of NIST security standards and guidelines in information security
programs. The security categorization process documented in these publications feeds the
following processes:

   •   Risk assessment as defined in NIST SP 800-30, Risk Management Guide for Information
       Technology Systems, and implemented in the certification and accreditation process as
       specified in NIST SP 800-37, Guide for the Security Certification and Accreditation of
       Federal Information Systems.

   •   Selection and implementation of security controls as defined in NIST SP 800-53,
       Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems (and the future FIPS of
       the same title).

   •   Security planning as specified in NIST SP 800-18, Guide for Developing Security Plans
       for Information Technology Systems and NIST SP 800-34, Contingency Planning Guide
       for Information Technology Systems.

3.2 Information Type Identification
The following is a suggested methodology that can be employed for identification of information
types:

   •   Identify the fundamental business areas (management and support) or mission areas
       (mission-based) supported by the system under review;

   •   Identify, for each business or mission area, the operations or lines of business that
       describe the purpose of the system in functional terms;

   •   Identify the sub-functions necessary to carry out each area of operation or line of
       business;

   •   Select basic information types associated with the identified sub-functions; and where
       appropriate,

   •   Identify any information type processed by the system that is required by statute,
       Executive Order, or agency regulation to receive special handling (e.g., with respect to




                                                   11
       unauthorized disclosure or dissemination). This information may be used to adjust the
       information type or system impact level.

“Business areas” separate government operations into high-level categories relating to the
purpose of government, the mechanisms the government uses to achieve its purposes, the support
functions necessary to conduct government operations, and resource management functions that
support all areas of the government’s business. “Business areas” are subdivided into “areas of
operation” or “lines of business.”

“Areas of operation” or “lines of business” describe the purpose of government in functional
terms or describe the support functions that the government must conduct in order to effectively
deliver services to citizens. Lines of business relating to the purpose of government and the
mechanisms the government uses to achieve its purposes tend to be mission-based. A
preliminary list of these mission-based information types is provided in Appendix D.

 Lines of business relating to support functions and resource management functions that are
necessary to conduct government operations tend to be common to most agencies. Management
and support lines of business that are identified in the Office of Management and Budget’s
(OMB’s) Federal Enterprise Architecture Program Management Office publication, The Business
Reference Model Version 2.0 (BRM) are listed in Section 5 of this document. The definition for
each of these “lines of business” is provided in Appendix C.

Sub-functions are the basic operations employed to provide the system services within each area
of operations or line of business. Some examples of sub-functions that are components of
mission-based lines of business are provided in Appendix D. Management and support sub-
functions that are identified for each line of business in the BRM are listed in Section 5 and
defined in Appendix C. An information type is identified for each sub-function listed.
(Although the OMB BRM is subject to revision from time to time, not all BRM changes will
result in changes to the information taxonomy employed in this guideline.)

Appendix E lists legislative and executive sources that establish sensitivity or criticality
protection requirements for specific information types.

Although this guideline identifies a number of information types and bases its taxonomy on
Version 2.0 of the BRM, only a few of the types identified are likely to be processed by any
single system. Also, each system may process information that does not fall neatly into one of
the listed information types. Once a set of information types identified in this guideline has been
selected, it is prudent to review the information processed by each system under review to see if
additional types need to be identified for impact assessment purposes.

3.3 Selection of Provisional Impact Levels
Appendix C suggests provisional confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact levels for
management and support information types, and Appendix D provides examples of provisional
impact level assignments for some mission-based information types. Where an information type
processed by a system is not categorized by this guideline, an initial impact determination will
need to be made based on FIPS 199 criteria.

3.3.1 FIPS 199 Security Categorization Criteria

An agency may identify information types not listed in this guideline or may choose not to select
provisional impact levels from Appendix C (for management and support information types) or
Appendix D (for mission-based information types). In such cases, the agency should employ the
FIPS 199 criteria cited in Table 1, “Categorization of Federal Information and Information
Systems,” to determine provisional impact levels.

Agencies can assign security categories to information types and information systems by
selecting and adjusting appropriate Table 1 values for the potential impact of compromises of
confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Those responsible for impact selection and subsequent
security categorization should apply the criteria provided in Table 1 to each information type
received by, processed in, stored in, and/or generated by each system for which they are
responsible. The security categorization will generally be determined based on the most
sensitive or critical information received by, processed in, stored in, and/or generated by the
system under review.

3.3.2 Examples of FIPS 199-Based Selection of Impact Levels

FIPS 199-based examples of impact selection and security categorization for sample information
types and systems follow:
 EXAMPLE 1: An organization managing public information on its web server determines that
 there is no potential impact from a loss of confidentiality (i.e., confidentiality requirements are
 not applicable), a moderate potential impact from a loss of integrity, and a moderate potential
 impact from a loss of availability. The resulting security category of this information type is
 expressed as:
 Security Category public information = {(confidentiality, n/a), (integrity, moderate), (availability, moderate)}.

 EXAMPLE 2: A law enforcement organization managing extremely sensitive investigative
 information determines that the potential impact from a loss of confidentiality is high, the
 potential impact from a loss of integrity is moderate, and the potential impact from a loss of
 availability is moderate. The resulting security category for this type of information is
 expressed as:
 Security Category investigative information = {(confidentiality, high), (integrity, moderate), (availability, high)}.

 EXAMPLE 3: A financial organization managing routine administrative information (not privacy-
 related information) determines that the potential impact from a loss of confidentiality is low,
 the potential impact from a loss of integrity is low, and the potential impact from a loss of
 availability is low. The resulting security category of this information type is expressed as:
 Security Category administrative information = {(confidentiality, low), (integrity, low), (availability, low)}.

In general, impact assessment is independent of mechanisms employed to mitigate the
consequences of a compromise.

3.3.3 Other Factors for Selection of Impact Levels

Where an agency determines impact levels and security categorization based on local application
of FIPS 199 criteria, it is recommended that the following questions and factors be considered
with respect to security impacts for each information type:

   Common Confidentiality Factors:

        Using the FIPS 199 impact criteria summarized in Table 1, each information type should
        be evaluated with respect to the low/moderate/high impact associated with the answers to
        the following questions:

        •   How can a malicious adversary use the information to do limited/serious/severe harm
            to agency operations, agency assets, or individuals?




                                                          14
   •   How can a malicious adversary use the information to gain control of agency assets
       that might result in unauthorized modification of information, destruction of
       information, or denial of system services that would result in limited/serious/severe
       harm to agency operations, agency assets, or individuals?

   •   Would unauthorized disclosure/dissemination of elements of the information type
       violate laws, executive orders, or agency regulations?

   Each use of the information type and each known variant of the information belonging to
   the type should be considered in determining the confidentiality impact level.

Common Integrity Factors:

   Using the FIPS 199 impact criteria summarized in Table 1, each information type should
   be evaluated with respect to the low/moderate/high impact associated with unauthorized
   modification or destruction of (i) each known variant of the information belonging to the
   type and (ii) each use of the information by the system under review.

   Unauthorized modification or destruction of information can take many forms. The
   changes can be subtle and hard to detect, or they can occur on a massive scale. One can
   construct an extraordinarily wide range of scenarios for modification of information and
   its likely consequences. Just a few examples include forging or modifying information
   to:

   •   Reduce public confidence in an agency;

   •   Fraudulently achieve financial gain;

   •   Create confusion or controversy by promulgating a fraudulent or incorrect procedure;

   •   Initiate confusion or controversy through false attribution of a fraudulent or false
       policy;

   •   Influence personnel decisions;

   •   Interfere with or manipulate law enforcement or legal processes;

   •   Influence legislation; or

   •   Achieve unauthorized access to government information or facilities.

   In most cases, the most serious impacts of integrity compromise occur when some action
   is taken that is based on the modified information or the modified information is
   disseminated to other organizations or the public.




                                              15
       Undetected loss of integrity can be catastrophic for many information types. The
       consequences of integrity compromise can be either direct (e.g., modification of a
       financial entry, medical alert, or criminal record) or indirect (e.g., facilitation of
       unauthorized access to sensitive or private information or deny access to information or
       information system services). Malicious use of write access to information and
       information systems can do enormous harm to an agency’s missions and can be
       employed to use an agency system as a proxy for attacks on other systems.

       In many cases, the consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of
       information to agency mission functions and public confidence in the agency can be
       expected to be limited. In other cases, integrity compromises can result in the
       endangerment of human life or other severe consequences. The impact can be
       particularly severe in the case of time-critical information.

   Common Availability Factors:

       Using the FIPS 199 impact criteria summarized in Table 1, each information type should
       be evaluated with respect to the low/moderate/high impact associated with loss of
       availability of (i) each known variant of the information belonging to the type and (ii)
       each use for the information by the system under review.

       For many information types and information systems, the availability impact level
       depends on how long the information or system remains unavailable. Undetected loss of
       availability can be catastrophic for many information types. For example, permanent loss
       of budget execution, contingency planning, continuity of operations, service recovery,
       debt collection, taxation management, personnel management, payroll management,
       security management, inventory control, logistics management, or accounting
       information databases would be catastrophic for almost any agency. Complete
       reconstruction of such databases would be time consuming and expensive. The
       disruption to agency operations would be serious to severe.

       In most cases, the adverse effects of limited-duration availability compromise on agency
       mission functions and public confidence in the agency will be limited. In contrast, for
       time-critical information types, availability is less likely to be restored before serious
       harm is done to agency assets, operations, or personnel (or to public welfare). As a result
       of this property, the rationale for most availability impact recommendations will indicate
       whether or not the information is time-critical.

3.4 Review and Adjustment/Finalization of Information Impact Levels
Particularly where security categorization impact levels recommended in Section 5 or Appendix
D are adopted as provisional levels, the agency should review the appropriateness of the
provisional impact levels in the context of the organization, environment, mission, use, and
connectivity associated with the system under review. The FIPS 199 criteria presented in
Section 3.3 of this document should be used as the basis for decisions regarding adjustment or
finalization of the provisional impact levels. The confidentiality, integrity, and availability
impact levels may be adjusted one or more times in the course of the review. Once the review


                                               16
and adjustment process is complete for all information types, the mapping of impact levels by
information type can be finalized. The impact of compromise of information of a particular type
can be different in different agencies or in different operational contexts. Also, the impact for an
information type may vary throughout the life cycle. For example, contract information that has
a moderate confidentiality impact level during the life of the contract may have a low impact
level when the contract is completed. Policy information may have moderate confidentiality and
integrity impact levels during the policy development process, low confidentiality and moderate
integrity impact levels when the policy is implemented, and low confidentiality and integrity
impact levels when the policy is no longer used.

3.5 System Security Categorization
Once the impact levels have been selected for individual information types processed by a
system, it is necessary to assign a system security category.

3.5.1 FIPS 199 Process for System Categorization

FIPS 199 recognizes that determining the security category of an information system requires
additional analysis and must consider the security categories of all information types resident on
the information system. For an information system, the potential impact values assigned to each
of the respective security objectives (confidentiality, integrity, availability) are the highest values
(i.e., high water mark) for any one of these objectives that has been determined for the types of
information resident on the information system.

Information systems are composed of both programs and information. Programs in execution
within an information system (i.e., system processes) facilitate the processing, storage, and
transmission of information and are necessary for the organization to conduct its essential
mission-related functions and operations. These system-processing functions also require
protection and could be subject to security categorization as well. However, in the interest of
simplification, it is assumed that the security categorization of all information types associated
with the information system provide an appropriate worst case potential impact for the overall
information system—thereby obviating the need to consider the system processes in the security
categorization of the information system.

This is in recognition of:

   •   The fundamental requirement to protect the integrity, availability, and, for key
       information such as passwords and encryption keys, the confidentiality of system-level
       processing functions and information at the high water mark.

   •   The strong interdependence between integrity, confidentiality, and availability.

For this reason, FIPS 199 notes that, while the value of not applicable can apply to specific
information types processed by systems, this value cannot be assigned to any security objective
for an information system. There is a minimum provisional impact (i.e., low water mark) for a
compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability for an information system. This is




                                                  17
necessary to protect the system-level processing functions and information critical to the
operation of the information system.

The generalized format for expressing the security category, or SC, of an information system is:
       SC information system = {(confidentiality, impact), (integrity, impact), (availability, impact)},
where the acceptable values for potential impact are LOW, MODERATE, or HIGH.

SYSTEM EXAMPLE 1: An information system used for large acquisitions in a contracting
organization contains both sensitive, pre-solicitation phase contract information and routine
administrative information. The management within the contracting organization determines
that: (i) for the sensitive contract information, the potential impact from a loss of confidentiality
is moderate, the potential impact from a loss of integrity is moderate, and the potential impact
from a loss of availability is low; and (ii) for the routine administrative information (non-
privacy-related information), the potential impact from a loss of confidentiality is low, the
potential impact from a loss of integrity is low, and the potential impact from a loss of
availability is low. The resulting security categories, or SC, of these information types are
expressed as:

       SC contract information = {(confidentiality, MODERATE), (integrity, MODERATE), (availability, LOW)},
and
       SC administrative information = {(confidentiality, LOW), (integrity, LOW), (availability, LOW)}.

The resulting security category of the information system is expressed as:

       SC acquisition system = {(confidentiality, MODERATE), (integrity, MODERATE), (availability, LOW)},

representing the high water mark or maximum potential impact values for each security objective
from the information types resident on the acquisition system.

SYSTEM EXAMPLE 2: A power plant contains a SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition)
system controlling the distribution of electric power for a large military installation. The SCADA
system contains both real-time sensor data and routine administrative information. The
management at the power plant determines that: (i) for the sensor data being acquired by the
SCADA system, there is no potential impact from a loss of confidentiality, a high potential
impact from a loss of integrity, and a high potential impact from a loss of availability; and (ii) for
the administrative information being processed by the system, there is a low potential impact
from a loss of confidentiality, a low potential impact from a loss of integrity, and a low potential
impact from a loss of availability. The resulting security categories, or SC, of these information
types are expressed as:
       SC sensor data = {(confidentiality, NA), (integrity, HIGH), (availability, HIGH)},
and
       SC administrative information = {(confidentiality, LOW), (integrity, LOW), (availability, LOW)}.

The resulting security category of the information system is initially expressed as:

       SC SCADA system = {(confidentiality, LOW), (integrity, HIGH), (availability, HIGH)},


                                                         18
representing the high water mark or maximum potential impact values for each security objective
from the information types resident on the SCADA system. The management at the power plant
chooses to increase the potential impact from a loss of confidentiality from low to moderate
reflecting a more realistic view of the potential impact on the information system should there be
a security breach due to the unauthorized disclosure of system-level information or processing
functions. The final security category of the information system is expressed as:

       SC SCADA system = {(confidentiality, MODERATE), (integrity, HIGH), (availability, HIGH)}.

3.5.2 Guidelines for System Categorization

The impact level for a system will generally be the highest impact level for the security
objectives (confidentiality, integrity, and availability) associated with the aggregate of system
information types. An information system usually processes several information types, (e.g.,
privacy, medical, proprietary, financial, contractor sensitive). Each of these information types is
subject to security categorization. In some cases, the security category for a system will be
higher than any impact level for any information type processed by the system. The primary
factors that most commonly raise the total system security category above that of its constituent
information types are aggregation, connectivity, and critical system functionality. This section
provides some general guidelines regarding how aggregation, critical functionality, and some
other system factors may affect system security categorization.

Variations in sensitivity/criticality with respect to time may need to be factored into the impact
assignment process. Some information loses its sensitivity in time (e.g., economic/commodity
projections after they’ve been published). Other information is particularly critical at some point
in time (e.g., weather data in the terminal approach area during aircraft landing operations).

Various stakeholders (e.g., management, operational personnel, or security experts) may need to
be involved in decisions regarding system-level impact assessments. Information aggregation,
critical system functionality and other factors should be considered in making system-level
impact decisions.
3.5.2.1 Aggregation

Some information may have little or no sensitivity in isolation but may be highly sensitive in
aggregate. In some cases, aggregation of large quantities of a single information type can reveal
sensitive patterns and/or plans, or facilitate access to sensitive or critical systems. In other cases,
aggregation of information of several different and seemingly innocuous types can have similar
effects. In general, the sensitivity of a given data element is likely to be greater in context than
in isolation (e.g., association of an account number with the identity of an individual and/or
institution). The availability, routine operational employment, and sophistication of data
aggregation and inference tools are all increasing rapidly. If review reveals increased sensitivity
or criticality associated with information aggregates, then the system categorization may need to
be adjusted to a higher level than would be indicated by the impact associated with any
individual information type.




                                                      19
3.5.2.2 Critical System Functionality

Compromise of some information types may have low impact in the context of a system’s
primary function but may have much more significance when viewed in the context of the
potential impact of compromising:

   •   Other systems to which the system in question is connected, or
   •   Other systems that are dependent on that system’s information.

Access control information for a system that processes only low impact information might
initially be thought to have only low impact attributes. However, if access to that system might
result in some form of access to other systems (e.g., over a network), the sensitivity and
criticality attributes of all systems to which such indirect access can result needs to be
considered. Similarly, some information may, in general, have low sensitivity and/or criticality
attributes. However, that information may be used by other systems to enable extremely
sensitive or critical functions (e.g., air traffic control use of weather information or use of
commercial flight information to identify military combat transport systems). Loss of data
integrity, availability, temporal context, or other context can have catastrophic consequences.
3.5.2.3 Other System Factors

Web Page Integrity

Most Federal agencies maintain web pages that are accessible to the public. The vast majority of
these public web pages permit interaction between the site and the public. In some cases, the
web site provides only information. In other cases, forms may be submitted via the web site
(e.g., applications for service or job applications). In some cases, the site is a medium for
business transactions. Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting
external communications (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect operations
and/or public confidence in the agency. In most cases, the damage can be corrected within a
relatively short period of time, and the damage is limited (impact level is low). In other cases
(e.g., very large fraudulent transactions or modification of a web page belonging to an
intelligence/security community component), the damage to mission function and/or public
confidence in the agency can be serious. In such cases, the integrity impact associated with
unauthorized modification or destruction of a public web page would be at least moderate.
Catastrophic Loss of System Availability

       Either physical or logical destruction of major assets can result in very large expenditures
       to restore the assets and/or long periods of time for recovery. Permanent
       loss/unavailability of information system capabilities can seriously hamper agency
       operations and, where direct services to the public are involved, have a severe adverse
       effect on public confidence in Federal agencies. Particularly in the case of large systems,
       FIPS 199 criteria suggest that catastrophic loss of system availability may result in a high
       availability impact. Whether or not the impact level of system availability should be
       high, (and subsequent high system security category) is dependent on the cost and




                                                20
       criticality attributes of the system rather than on the impact levels for the information
       types being processed by the system.

Critical Infrastructures and Key National Assets

       Where the mission served by an information system, or the information that the system
       processes affects the security of critical national infrastructures or key national assets, the
       harm that results from a compromise requires particularly close attention. In this case, an
       effect on security might include a significant reduction in the effectiveness of physical or
       cybersecurity protection mechanisms, or facilitation of a terrorist attack on critical
       infrastructures and/or key assets. Accordingly, the impact level should be carefully
       determined when a loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability will result in a
       negative impact on the infrastructure components and assets such as:

       Critical Infrastructures

           o   Agriculture and Food (Including farms and food processing plants)
           o   Water (Including federal reservoirs and municipal waste water facilities)
           o   Public Health (Including hospitals and federal health organizations)
           o   Emergency Services (Including federal, state, and local response units)
           o   Defense Installations and Defense Industrial Base
           o   Telecommunications (Including switching and transmission/cable facilities)
           o   Energy (Including electric, oil, and gas production and transmission facilities)
           o   Transportation (Aviation, rail, highway, pipelines, maritime, and mass transit)
           o   Banking/Finance (Including federal services and FDIC insured institutions)
           o   Chemical Industry/Hazardous Materials (e.g., chemical plants)
           o   Postal and Shipping Facilities

       Key Assets

           o   Nuclear Power Plants
           o   National Monuments and Icons
           o   Dams
           o   Government Facilities
           o   Commercial Assets

       The Critical Information Infrastructure Act of 2002, Public Law 107-296 §§ 211-215 of
       November 25, 2002 (codified as 6 U.S.C. 131-134), defines the term "critical
       infrastructure information" to mean information not customarily in the public domain and
       related to the security of critical infrastructure or protected systems. Under the act,
       critical infrastructure information (including the identity of the submitting person or
       entity) that is voluntarily submitted to a Federal agency for use by that agency regarding
       the security of critical infrastructure and protected systems, analysis, warning,
       interdependency study, recovery, reconstitution, or other informational purpose, when
       accompanied by an express statement as defined by the law:




                                                 21
        (1) Shall be exempt from disclosure under section 552 of title 5, United States Code
            (commonly referred to as the Freedom of Information Act);
        (2) Shall not be subject to any agency rules or judicial doctrine regarding ex parte
            communications with a decision making official;
        (3) Shall not, without the written consent of the person or entity submitting such
            information, be used directly by such agency, any other Federal, State, or local
            authority, or any third party, in any civil action arising under Federal or State law if
            such information is submitted in good faith;
        (4) Shall not, without the written consent of the person or entity submitting such
            information, be used or disclosed by any officer or employee of the United States for
            purposes other than the purposes of this law 8 ;
        (5) Shall not, if provided to a State or local government or government agency, be made
            available pursuant to any State or local law requiring disclosure of information or
            records, otherwise be disclosed or distributed to any party by a State or local
            government or government agency without the written consent of the person or entity
            submitting such information, or be used other than for the purpose of protecting
            critical infrastructure or protected systems, or in furtherance of an investigation or the
            prosecution of a criminal act; and
Does not constitute a waiver of any applicable privilege or protection provided under law, such
as trade secret protection.
Privacy Information

         The E-Government Act of 2002 strengthened privacy protection requirements of the
         Privacy Act of 1974. Under the terms of these public laws, Federal government agencies
         have specific responsibilities regarding collection, dissemination or disclosure of
         information regarding individuals. 9

         The September 29, 2003 OMB Memorandum, “OMB Guidance for Implementing the
         Privacy Provisions of the E-Government Act of 2002” puts the privacy provisions of the
         E-Government Act of 2002 into effect. The guidance applies to information that
         identifies individuals in a recognizable form, including name, address, telephone number,
         Social Security Number, and e-mail addresses. OMB instructed agency heads “to
         describe how the government handles information that individuals provide electronically,
         so that the American public has assurances that personal information is protected.”
         Under these public laws and executive policies, it is necessary to broaden the definition
         of “unauthorized disclosure” to encompass any sharing of privacy-protected information
         among Federal government agencies where such sharing is prohibited by privacy laws
         and policies. Since most privacy regulations focus on sharing or disclosing information,
         privacy considerations are dealt with in this guideline as special factors affecting the
         confidentiality impact level. In establishing confidentiality impact levels for each

8
  Except in furtherance of an investigation or the prosecution of a criminal act, or when disclosure of the information
would be to either House of Congress or to the Comptroller General in the course of the performance of the duties of
the General Accounting Office.
9
  The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) definition of individual is, “a citizen of the United States or an
alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.” Agencies may choose to extend the protections of the Privacy Act
and E-Government Act to businesses, sole proprietors, aliens, etc.


                                                          22
       information type, responsible parties must consider the consequences of unauthorized
       disclosure of privacy information (with respect to violations of Federal policy and/or
       law). In addition, there are four management and support information types that address
       privacy information.

       Agencies are now required to conduct new Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) before
       developing IT systems that contain identifiable information, or before collecting
       identifiable information electronically. PIAs must be updated when changes in the way
       an agency handles personally identifiable information create new privacy risks. Affected
       agencies are required to report on their e-privacy-related activities every year.

       For their websites, agencies will be required to tell visitors:

           o When it’s voluntary to submit information;
           o How to grant consent for agency use of voluntary personal data; and
           o About their rights under the Privacy Act and other applicable laws.

       Agency websites will be required to disclose:

           o   The nature of information collected;
           o   The purpose and use of the collected information;
           o   Whether and to whom the collected information will be shared; and
           o   The privacy safeguards applied to the collected information.

The impact of privacy violations will depend in part on the penalties associated with violation of
the relevant statutes and policies. In most cases, the impacts will fall into the moderate range.
Categorizations should be reviewed to ensure that the consequences of violations have been
adequately factored into impact determinations.
Trade Secrets

       There are several laws that specifically prohibit unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets
       (e.g., 7 U.S.C., Chapter 6, Subchapter II, Section 136h and 42 U.S.C., Chapter 6A,
       Subchapter XII, Part E, Section 300j-4(d)(1)). Systems that store, communicate, or
       process trade secrets will generally be assigned at least a moderate confidentiality impact
       level.

4.0 GUIDELINES FOR ASSIGNMENT OF IMPACT LEVELS TO MISSION-
     BASED INFORMATION

This section describes a process for identifying mission-based information types and for
specifying the impact of unauthorized disclosure, modification, or unavailability of this
information. Mission-based information includes both mission information and information
associated with the mechanisms that the government uses to achieve its missions. Mission-based
information types are, by definition, specific to individual departments and agencies or to
specific sets of departments and agencies. Administrative and management information types
that are common to many departments and agencies are discussed in Section 5, “Impact Levels
by Type for Management and support Information.”

4.1 Identification of Mission-based Information Types
The Federal government acquires, generates, processes, and stores a wide variety of information
types. The first step in mapping types of Federal information and information systems to
security objectives and impact levels is the development of an information taxonomy, or creation
of a catalog of information types. 10

Much Federal government information and many information systems are used directly for the
provision of services. One approach to establishing mission-based information types at an
agency level is to begin by documenting the agency’s business and mission areas. Then, the
major sub-functions that are necessary to the conduct of each business and mission area can be
defined. For example, one mission conducted by an agency might be law enforcement. Sub-
functions that are part of the agency’s law enforcement mission might include criminal
investigation and surveillance, criminal apprehension, criminal incarceration, citizen protection,
crime prevention, and property protection. Each of these sub functions could also represent an
information type. Some business and mission areas and constituent sub-functions carried out by
mission-based information systems are identified in Appendix D, “Examples of Impact
Determination for Mission-based Information and Information Systems.”

The owner of each system, or an individual designated by the owner, is responsible for
identifying the information types stored in, processed by, or generated by that system. In the
case of mission-based information, the responsible individuals, in coordination with
management, operational, and security stake holders, should compile a comprehensive set of
lines of business and mission areas conducted by the agency, as well as the functions and
sub-functions necessary to conduct agency business and/or accomplish agency missions.
Each sub-function of a line of business or mission area corresponds to an information type. 11

10
   One issue associated with the taxonomy activity is the determination of the degree of granularity. If the categories
are too broad, then the guidelines for assigning impact levels are likely to be too general to be useful. On the other
hand, if an attempt is made to provide guidelines for each element of information processed by each government
agency, the guideline is likely to be unwieldy and to require excessively frequent changes.
11
   Appendix D provides Federal government mission information types based on the lines of business and sub-
functions identified in the Office of Management and Budget’s Federal Enterprise Architecture Program
Management Office’s Business Reference Model 2.0.


                                                          25
4.2 Impact Assessment for Mission-based Information
Direct service missions provide the primary frame of reference for determining the impact levels
and security objectives for mission-based information and information systems. The
consequences of unauthorized disclosure of information, breach of integrity, and denial of
services are defined by the nature and beneficiary(ies) of the service being provided or
supported. All government agencies perform at least one of the missions and employ at least one
of the services delivery mechanisms described in Appendix D. Some perform a number of
different missions distributed among several mission areas. Direct service systems process
agency-common management and support information as well as mission-based information
(e.g., mission information).

Using the impact selection criteria identified in Section 2.2.1 for the security objectives and
types of potential losses identified in Section 2.1.2, the entity responsible for impact
determination must assign impact levels and consequent security categorization for each
mission-based information type identified for each system. The final system security
categorization is based on the impact levels for each information type stored in, processed by,
or generated by the system, plus factors that are discussed in Section 3.5.

A factor specific to the confidentiality objective is information subject to special handling
(e.g., information subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. § 552A). Regardless of other
considerations, some minimum confidentiality impact level must be assigned to any
information system that stores, processes, or generates such information. Examples of such
information include information subject to the Trade Secrets Act, Privacy Act information,
Department of Energy Safeguards information, Internal Revenue Service Official Use Only
Information, and Environmental Protection Agency Confidential Business Information (e.g.,
subject to Toxic Substances Control Act; Resource Conservation and Recovery Act;
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act). Some of these
statutory and regulatory specifications are listed in Appendix E, “Legislative and Executive
Sources Establishing Sensitivity/Criticality.”




                                                26
5.0 IMPACT LEVELS BY TYPE FOR MANAGEMENT AND SUPPORT
     INFORMATION
Much Federal government information and many systems are not employed directly to
provide services to citizens, but are primarily intended to manage resources or support
delivery of services. This section recommends a set of information types for Federal
government information. Recommended provisional security categories for management and
support information types, together with supporting rationale are presented in Appendix C.
As stated in Section 4, the basis for the identification of information types is the Office of
Management and Budget’s Federal Enterprise Architecture Program Management Office
June 2003 publication, The Business Reference Model Version 2.0 (BRM). The BRM
describes 39 lines of government business distributed among four business areas. The
business areas are high-level categories relating to the:

     •   Purpose of government (missions or services to citizens);

     •   Mechanisms the government uses to achieve its purpose (modes of delivery);

     •   Support functions necessary to conduct government (support delivery of services);
         and

     •   Resource management functions that support all areas of the government’s business
         (management of resources).

The support delivery of services and management of resources business areas are together
composed of 13 lines of business. The BRM subdivides the lines of business into 63 sub-
functions. The support delivery of services and management of resource business areas are
common to most Federal government agencies, and the information associated with each of
their sub-functions is identified in this guideline as a management and support information
type. 12 Four additional management and support information types have been defined that
address privacy information. One additional management and support information type has
been defined that addresses executive function information. Provisional confidentiality,
integrity, and availability information categories are recommended in Appendix C for all of
the management and support information types. Rationale underlying the recommended
provisional impact level suggestions is also provided in Appendix C. Agencies may find it
necessary to identify additional information types and assign impact levels to those types.

As with case of mission-based information, the first step in mapping types of management
and support information and information systems to security objectives and impact levels is
to identify the information types stored in, processed by, or generated by the system. Using
the criteria identified in Section 2.2.1 in the context of the security objectives identified in
Section 2.1.2, the next step is to select the levels of impact and consequent security category
for each applicable information type. System security categorization is based on the impact

12
  Information types associated with sub-functions of services for citizens and mode of delivery lines of business are
agency-specific and are covered in Section 4, “Guidelines for Assignment of Impact Levels to Mission-Based
Information.”


                                                         27
levels associated with each security objective for each type of information stored in,
processed by, or generated by the system plus additional factors governing determination of
system level impact. (See Section 3.5.) For example, configuration and security policy
enforcement information includes password files, network access rules, other hardware and
software configuration settings, and documentation that may affect access to the information
system’s data, programs, and/or processes. At a minimum, a low confidentiality impact
level will apply to this set of information and processes due to a potential for corruption,
misuse, or abuse of system information and processes.

Table 2 lists the management and support lines of business and information types.

5.1 Services Delivery Support Information
Most information systems employed in both service delivery support and resource management
activities engage in one or more of the eight italicized support delivery of services lines of
business identified in Table 2. Each of the information types associated with support delivery of
services sub-functions is described below. Appendix C.2, “Services Delivery Support


                                                            28
Functions,” recommends provisional impact levels for confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
These service support functions are the day-to-day activities necessary to provide the critical
policy, programmatic, and managerial foundation that support Federal government operations.
The direct service missions and constituencies ultimately being supported by service support
functions comprise a significant factor in determining the security impacts associated with
compromise of information associated with the support delivery of services business area.

5.1.1 Controls and Oversight

Controls and Oversight information is used to ensure that the operations and programs of the
Federal government and its external business partners comply with applicable laws and
regulations and prevent waste, fraud, and abuse.
5.1.1.1 Corrective Action Information Type

Corrective Action information supports the enforcement functions necessary to remedy programs
that have been found non-compliant with a given law, regulation, or policy. In most cases, the
confidentiality, integrity and availability impact levels are based on the effects of unauthorized
disclosure, modification, or loss of availability of corrective action information on the ability of
responsible agencies to remedy internal or external programs that have been found non-
compliant with a given law, regulation, or policy.
5.1.1.2 Program Evaluation Information Type

Program Evaluation information supports the analysis of internal and external program
effectiveness and the determination of corrective actions as appropriate. In most cases, the
confidentiality, integrity and availability impact levels are based on the effects of unauthorized
disclosure, modification, or loss of availability of program evaluation information on the abilities
of responsible agencies to analyze internal and external program effectiveness and to determine
appropriate corrective actions.
5.1.1.3 Program Monitoring Information Type

Program Monitoring information supports the data-gathering activities required to determine the
effectiveness of internal and external programs and the extent to which they comply with
applicable laws, regulations, and policies. In most cases, the impact levels are based on the
effects of unauthorized disclosure, modification, or loss of availability of program monitoring
information on the ability of responsible agencies to perform data-gathering activities. These
activities determine the effectiveness of internal and external programs and the extent to which
they comply with related laws, regulations, and policies.

5.1.2 Regulatory Development

Regulatory Development information supports activities associated with providing input to
the lawmaking process in developing regulations, policies, and guidance to implement laws.




                                                29
5.1.2.1 Policy and Guidance Development Information Type

Policy and Guidance Development information supports the creation and dissemination of
guidelines to assist in the interpretation and implementation of regulations. In most cases, the
effect on public welfare of a loss of policy and guidance development mission capability can be
expected to be delayed rather than immediate. As a result, the potential for consequent loss of
human life or of major national assets is relatively low. In most cases, the impact levels are
based on the effects of unauthorized disclosure, modification, or loss of availability of policy and
guidance information on the ability of responsible agencies to create and disseminate guidelines
to assist in the interpretation and implementation of regulations.
5.1.2.2 Public Comment Tracking Information Type

Public Comment Tracking information supports the activities of soliciting, maintaining, and
responding to public comments regarding proposed regulations. In most cases, the impact levels
are based on the effects of unauthorized disclosure, modification, or loss of availability of public
comment tracking information on the ability of responsible agencies to solicit, maintain, and
respond to public comments regarding proposed regulations.
5.1.2.3 Regulatory Creation Information Type

Regulatory Creation information supports the activities of researching and drafting proposed and
final regulations. In most cases, the impact levels are based on the effects of unauthorized
disclosure, modification, or loss of availability of regulatory creation information on the ability
of responsible agencies to research and draft proposed and final regulations.
5.1.2.4 Rule Publication Information Type

Rule Publication information supports all the activities associated with the publication of a
proposed or final rule in the Federal Register and Code of Federal Regulations. In most cases,
the impact levels are based on the effects of unauthorized disclosure, modification, or loss of
availability of rule publication information on the ability of responsible agencies to publish
proposed or final rules in the Federal Register and Code of Federal Regulations.

5.1.3 Planning and Resource Allocation

Planning and Resource Allocation information supports the activities of determining strategic
direction, identifying and establishing programs and processes to enable change, and
allocating resources (capital and labor) among those programs and processes.
5.1.3.1 Budget Formulation Information Type

Budget Formulation information supports all activities undertaken to determine priorities for
future spending and to develop an itemized forecast of future funding and expenditures during a
targeted period of time. This includes the collection and use of performance information to
assess the effectiveness of programs and develop budget priorities. In most cases, the impact
levels are based on the effects of unauthorized disclosure, modification, or loss of availability of
budget formulation information on the ability of responsible agencies to determine priorities for


                                                 30
future spending and to develop an itemized forecast of future funding and expenditures during a
targeted period of time.
5.1.3.2 Capital Planning Information Type

Capital Planning information supports the processes for ensuring that appropriate investments
are selected for capital expenditures. In most cases, the impact levels are based on the effects of
unauthorized disclosure, modification, or loss of availability of capital planning information on
the ability of responsible agencies to ensure that appropriate investments are selected for capital
expenditures.
5.1.3.3 Enterprise Architecture Information Type

Enterprise Architecture information supports an established process for describing the current
state and defining the target state and transition strategy for an organization’s people, processes,
and technology. In most cases, the confidential impact levels are based on the effects of
unauthorized disclosure, modification, or loss of availability of enterprise architecture
information on the ability of responsible agencies to describe the current state and define the
target state and transition strategy for an organization’s people, processes, and technology.
5.1.3.4 Strategic Planning Information Type

Strategic Planning information supports the determination of long-term goals and the
identification of the best approach for achieving those goals. In most cases, the impact levels are
based on the effects of unauthorized disclosure, modification, or loss of availability of strategic
planning information on the ability of responsible agencies to determine long-term goals and to
identify of the best approach for achieving those goals.
5.1.3.5 Budget Execution Information Type

Budget Execution information supports the day-to-day requisitions and obligations for agency
expenditures, invoices, billing dispute resolution, reconciliation, service level agreements, and
distributions of shared expenses. In most cases, the impact levels are based on the effects of
unauthorized disclosure, modification, or loss of availability of budget execution information on
the ability of responsible agencies to manage day-to-day requisitions and obligations for agency
expenditures, invoices, billing dispute resolution, reconciliation, service level agreements, and
distributions of shared expenses.
5.1.3.6 Workforce Planning Information Type

Workforce Planning information supports the processes for identifying the workforce
competencies required to meet the agency’s strategic goals and for developing the strategies to
meet these requirements. In most cases, the impact levels are based on the effects of
unauthorized disclosure, modification, or loss of availability of workforce planning information
on the ability of responsible agencies to identify workforce competencies required to meet the
agency’s strategic goals and for developing the strategies to meet these requirements.




                                                 31
5.1.3.7 Management Improvement Information Type

Management Improvement information supports all efforts to gauge the ongoing efficiency of
business processes and identify opportunities for reengineering or restructuring. In most cases,
the confidential impact levels are based on the effects of unauthorized disclosure, modification,
or loss of availability of management improvement information on the ability of responsible
agencies to gauge the ongoing efficiency of business processes and identify opportunities for
reengineering or restructuring.

5.1.4 Internal Risk Management and Mitigation

Internal Risk Management and Mitigation information supports all activities relating to the
processes of analyzing exposure to risk and determining appropriate counter-measures.
Risks to much information associated with internal risk management and mitigation activities
may inherently affect the resistance to compromise/damage and recovery from damage with
respect to a broad range of critical infrastructures and key national assets.
5.1.4.1 Contingency Planning Information Type

Contingency Planning information supports the actions required to plan for, respond to, and
mitigate damaging events. In most cases, the impact levels are based on the effects of
unauthorized disclosure, modification, or loss of availability of contingency planning
information on the ability of responsible agencies to plan for, respond to, and mitigate damaging
events.
5.1.4.2 Continuity of Operations Information Type

Continuity of Operations information supports the activities associated with the identification of
critical systems and processes, and the planning and preparation required to ensure that these
systems and processes will be available in the event of a catastrophic event. In most cases, the
impact levels are based on the effects of unauthorized disclosure, modification, or loss of

service. Impacts to information associated with the operation of IT systems generally need to
be considered even when all mission-related information processed by the system is intended
to be available to the general public. The relevant issues may be different for integrity and
availability than for confidentiality. Information that has been made public, by definition,
requires no confidentiality protection. In contrast, integrity and availability protection cannot
be maintained for copies of information that have been distributed to the public. Only by
maintaining copies of information in organization-controlled information systems can
integrity and availability assurance be maintained.
