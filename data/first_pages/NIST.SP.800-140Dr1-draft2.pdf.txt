54   Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) of 2014, 44 U.S.C. § 3551 et seq., Public Law
55   (P.L.) 113-283. NIST is responsible for developing information security standards and guidelines, including
56   minimum requirements for federal information systems, but such standards and guidelines shall not apply
57   to national security systems without the express approval of appropriate federal officials exercising policy
58   authority over such systems. This guideline is consistent with the requirements of the Office of Management
59   and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130.

60   Nothing in this publication should be taken to contradict the standards and guidelines made mandatory and
61   binding on federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory authority. Nor should these
62   guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the Secretary of Commerce,
63   Director of the OMB, or any other federal official. This publication may be used by nongovernmental

 91   The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and
 92   Technology (NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical
 93   leadership for the Nation’s measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops tests, test
 94   methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance the
 95   development and productive use of information technology. ITL’s responsibilities include the
 96   development of management, administrative, technical, and physical standards and guidelines for
 97   the cost-effective security and privacy of other than national security-related information in federal
 98   information systems. The Special Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research, guidelines, and
 99   outreach efforts in information system security, and its collaborative activities with industry,
100   government, and academic organizations.

101                                                Abstract

102   The approved sensitive security parameter generation and establishment methods listed in this
103   publication replace the ones listed in ISO/IEC 19790 Annex D and ISO/IEC 24759 paragraph
104   6.16, within the context of the Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP). As a
105   validation authority, the CMVP may supersede Annex D in its entirety.

110                                                Audience

111   This document is intended for use by vendors, testing labs, and the CMVP to address issues in
112   cryptographic module testing.

113                                        Supplemental Content

114   Special Publication 800-140D, available at https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-
115   140d/final, is the governing document until this revision is published as final. The updated final
116   may have minor changes, depending on comments received.

117                                           Note to Readers

118   Two changes were made to this document from the first draft of Revision 1 – both editorial. The
119   first was to section 6.2 (Sensitive security parameter generation and establishment methods)
120   where the security function subsections were renamed, modified, and recategorized. The second
121   was to move the following two standards from this document into SP 800-140C: SP 800-90A, SP
122   800-90B.
