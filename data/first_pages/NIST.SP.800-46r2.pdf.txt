This publication has been developed by NIST in accordance with its statutory responsibilities under the
Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) of 2014, 44 U.S.C. § 3541 et seq., Public Law
(P.L.) 113-283. NIST is responsible for developing information security standards and guidelines, including
minimum requirements for federal information systems, but such standards and guidelines shall not apply
to national security systems without the express approval of appropriate federal officials exercising policy
authority over such systems. This guideline is consistent with the requirements of the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130.

Nothing in this publication should be taken to contradict the standards and guidelines made mandatory
and binding on federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory authority. Nor should
these guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the Secretary of
Commerce, Director of the OMB, or any other federal official. This publication may be used by
nongovernmental organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright in the United States.
Attribution would, however, be appreciated by NIST.

Certain commercial entities, equipment, or materials may be identified in this document in order to describe an
experimental procedure or concept adequately. Such identification is not intended to imply recommendation or
endorsement by NIST, nor is it intended to imply that the entities, materials, or equipment are necessarily the best
available for the purpose.
There may be references in this publication to other publications currently under development by NIST in accordance
with its assigned statutory responsibilities. The information in this publication, including concepts and methodologies,
may be used by Federal agencies even before the completion of such companion publications. Thus, until each
publication is completed, current requirements, guidelines, and procedures, where they exist, remain operative. For
planning and transition purposes, Federal agencies may wish to closely follow the development of these new
publications by NIST.

                                                                                                or more applications through a single centralized interface. A teleworker uses a portal client on a telework
                                                                                                client device to access the portal. Most portals are web-based—for them, the portal client is a regular web
                                                                                                browser. Figure 2-2 shows the basic portal solution architecture. The application client software is

                                                                                                between client devices and the portal, and they can provide authentication, access control, and other

                                                                                                the application client software and associated data. In a tunnel, the software and data are on the client

                                                                                                rendered desktop screen images or web pages, but data is typically stored on the client device much more

                                                                                                more control over how the software and data is secured as opposed to more distributed remote access

                                                                                                There are a few types of portal solutions commonly used for remote access. A web-based portal provides
                                                                                                a user with access to multiple web-based applications from a single portal website. An SSL portal VPN is
                                                                                                a common form of web-based portal. Another type of portal solution is terminal server access, which
                                                                                                gives each teleworker access to a separate standardized virtual desktop. The terminal server simulates the
                                                                                                look and feel of a desktop operating system and provides access to applications. Terminal server access
                                                                                                requires the teleworker either to install a special terminal server client application on the client device or
                                                                                                to use a web-based interface, often with a browser plug-in or other additional software provided by the
                                                                                                organization. Another similar remote access method, called virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI), involves
                                                                                                the user connecting to a system that contains virtual images of standardized, non-simulated operating
                                                                                                systems and desktops. When the teleworker is finished with a remote access session, the virtual image is
                                                                                                discarded so that the next user will have a clean virtual desktop. VDI is particularly helpful for
                                                                                                safeguarding telework on BYOD and third-party-controlled devices, which are more likely than

                                                                                                Another potential problem with keeping software updated is that remote access sessions may be brief,
                                                                                                particularly if the teleworker is on travel. This might preclude larger updates from being downloaded if
                                                                                                the software performing the updates does not permit updates to be downloaded in pieces.

                                                                                                Organizations should carefully consider these issues when planning how telework PCs will be kept

                                                                                                 Have a separate user account with limited privileges for each person that will use the telework PC.
                                                                                                  Teleworkers should use their limited privilege accounts for regular work and use a separate

                                                                                                 Enforce session locking, which prevents access to the PC after it has been idle for a period of time
                                                                                                  (such as 15 minutes) or permits the user to lock a session upon demand. After a session is locked,
                                                                                                  access to the PC can only be restored through authentication. Session locking is often part of screen-

                                                                                                organization's overall security policy. If one of the forms of remote access under consideration cannot be

                                                                                                organization-controlled PCs to be used. Some organizations have tiered levels of access, such as allowing
                                                                                                organization-controlled PCs to access many resources, BYOD PCs and third-party-controlled PCs to

                                                                                                Each organization should make its own risk-based decisions about what levels of remote access should be
