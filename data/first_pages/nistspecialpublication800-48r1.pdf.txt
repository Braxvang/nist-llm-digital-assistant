Executive Summary

Wireless local area networks (WLAN) are groups of wireless networking nodes within a limited
geographic area, such as an office building or building campus, that are capable of radio communication.
WLANs are usually implemented as extensions to existing wired local area networks (LAN) to provide
enhanced user mobility and network access. The most widely implemented WLAN technologies are
based on the IEEE 802.11 standard and its amendments. This document discusses the security of legacy
IEEE 802.11 technologies—those that are not capable of using the IEEE 802.11i security standard.

Organizations employing legacy IEEE 802.11 WLANs should be aware of the limited and weak security
controls available to protect communications. Legacy WLANs are particularly susceptible to loss of
confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Unauthorized users have access to well-documented security
flaws and exploits that can easily compromise an organization’s systems and information, corrupt the
organization’s data, consume network bandwidth, degrade network performance, launch attacks that
prevent authorized users from accessing the network, or use the organization’s resources to launch attacks
on other networks.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) recommends that organizations with existing
legacy IEEE 802.11 implementations develop and implement migration strategies to move to IEEE
802.11i-based security because of its superior capabilities. IEEE 802.11i addresses the security flaws in
the original IEEE 802.11 standard with built-in features providing robust wireless communications
security, including support for Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) validated cryptographic
algorithms. While legacy IEEE 802.11 networks are still in use, organizations should follow the
recommendations in this publication to compensate for the security weaknesses inherent in legacy
WLANs. Organizations that are planning a migration from legacy WLANs to IEEE 802.11i or are
considering the deployment of new WLANs should evaluate IEEE 802.11i-based products and follow the
recommendations in NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-97, Establishing Wireless Robust Security
Networks: A Guide to IEEE 802.11i, 1 for the new WLANs.

Organizations should implement the following recommendations to improve the security of their legacy
IEEE 802.11 implementations.

Organizations should be aware of the technical and security implications of legacy WLAN
technologies.

Legacy WLAN technologies present unique security challenges beyond those encountered with their
wired network counterparts. In addition to facing the same threats that wired networks face, legacy
WLANs are also threatened by attackers that can intercept WLAN transmissions through the air. To
attempt to breach a WLAN, an attacker simply needs to be within range of the wireless transmissions.
Other challenges with legacy WLAN security is that legacy standards have several serious security flaws
involving the authentication of clients and the protection of the confidentiality and integrity of WLAN
communications. Also, the legacy WLAN standards do not define security services for auditing,
authorization, replay protection, non-repudiation, and key management. Organizations cannot rely solely
on the security features provided by legacy WLAN standards to secure the WLANs adequately.

Organizations should create a wireless networking security policy that addresses legacy IEEE
802.11 WLAN security.

A wireless networking security policy and an organization’s ability to enforce compliance with it are the
foundations for all other security countermeasures. Policy considerations should include the following:

 Roles and responsibilities, such as which parties are authorized and responsible for installing and
  configuring WLAN equipment
 WLAN infrastructure security, including physical security requirements, acceptable use guidelines,
  and requirements for the use of encryption and for cryptographic key management
 WLAN client device security, such as hardware and software configuration requirements, limitations
  on how and when WLAN client devices may be used, and guidelines for the protection of WLAN
  client devices
 WLAN security assessments, particularly the frequency and scope of assessments and the actions to
  be taken when rogue or misconfigured devices are identified.
Organizations should be aware that physical security controls are especially important in a wireless
environment.

Organizations should make sure that adequate physical security controls are in place. Additional physical
security measures may be needed to protect WLAN infrastructure components dispersed throughout
facilities, such as access points (AP), from theft, alteration, and misuse. Organizations should also
consider the range of each AP in the context of the facilities’ physical boundaries; communications that
extend beyond these boundaries are susceptible to eavesdropping by external parties. Organizations
concerned about eavesdropping threats should limit legacy WLAN signal propagation, at a minimum so
that it does not go beyond the physical control boundaries of the organization’s facilities. However, there
is always a possibility that an attacker might use a high-gain antenna from a relatively long distance to
eavesdrop, so only by using strong cryptographic means can any assurance of protection against
eavesdropping be achieved.

Organizations needing to protect the confidentiality and integrity of their legacy WLAN
communications should implement additional security controls.

The security features provided by legacy WLAN standards do not provide adequate protection for
confidentiality and integrity, so additional controls are needed. One option is establishing a virtual
private network (VPN) tunnel between the WLAN client device and a VPN concentrator located behind
the AP. Federal agencies using VPNs to protect the confidentiality and integrity of legacy WLAN
communications must configure the VPNs to use FIPS-validated encryption algorithms contained in
validated cryptographic modules. WLAN management traffic often needs to be protected as well; this
can be done through several methods, including using VPNs and placing the traffic on a dedicated wired
network or a virtual local area network (VLAN) to isolate it from WLAN users.

Organizations should configure their legacy IEEE 802.11 APs to support the WLAN’s security.

WLAN APs often have vulnerabilities and other weaknesses in their default configurations.
Organizations should ensure that AP management is configured properly. This includes configuring
administrator access, controlling the AP reset function, configuring network management protocols, and
enabling logging. Organizations should also ensure that APs are configured to support a secure WLAN
configuration. An example is changing the default channel and power output to avoid radio interference



                                                   ES-2

that could cause a denial of service. Also, organizations should ensure that APs are kept current with
security patches, upgrades, and firmware updates to eliminate known vulnerabilities.

Organizations should properly secure their legacy IEEE 802.11 client devices to enhance the
WLAN’s security posture.

Securing the WLAN infrastructure without securing the client devices renders the entire WLAN insecure.
Client device security considerations include using personal firewalls, host-based intrusion detection and
prevention systems, and antivirus software on client devices; disabling IEEE 802.11 ad hoc mode;
managing IEEE 802.11 radios, such as disabling them when not in use; and configuring client devices to
comply with WLAN policies. Client devices should also be kept current with any patches or other
updates related to legacy IEEE 802.11 security.

2.      Overview of IEEE 802.11 Wireless Local Area Networks

Wireless local area networks (WLAN) are groups of wireless networking nodes within a limited
geographic area, such as an office building or building campus, that are capable of radio communication.
WLANs are usually implemented as extensions to existing wired local area networks (LAN) to provide
enhanced user mobility and network access. This section briefly describes several commonly used forms
of WLAN technologies: IEEE 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, and 802.11n. In addition, a brief overview of
the updated security standard for IEEE 802.11 networks, IEEE 802.11i, is provided.

2.1     IEEE 802.11 Variants

WLAN technologies were first available in late 1990, when vendors began introducing products that
operated within the 900 megahertz (MHz) frequency band. These solutions, which used non-standard,
proprietary designs, provided data transfer rates of approximately 1 megabit per second (Mbps). This was
significantly slower than the 10 Mbps speed provided by most wired LANs at that time. In 1992, vendors
began selling WLAN products that used the 2.4 gigahertz (GHz) Industrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM)
band. Although these products provided higher data transfer rates than 900 MHz band products, they
were expensive, provided relatively low data rates, were prone to radio interference, and were often
designed to use proprietary radio frequency (RF) technologies.

The IEEE initiated the IEEE 802.11 project in 1990 with the objective to “develop a Medium Access
Control (MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) specification for wireless connectivity for fixed, portable, and
moving stations within an area.” 2 In 1997, IEEE first approved the IEEE 802.11 international
interoperability standard for WLANs. The IEEE 802.11 standard supports three transmission methods,
including radio transmission within the 2.4 GHz ISM band. In 1999, IEEE ratified two amendments to
the IEEE 802.11 standard—IEEE 802.11a and IEEE 802.11b—that define radio transmission methods
and modulation techniques. WLAN equipment based on IEEE 802.11b quickly became the dominant
wireless technology. IEEE 802.11b equipment transmits in the 2.4 GHz band, offering data rates of up to
11 Mbps. IEEE 802.11b was intended to provide performance, throughput, and security features
comparable to wired LANs. IEEE 802.11a operates in the 5 GHz Unlicensed National Information
Infrastructure (UNII) frequency band, delivering data rates up to 54 Mbps. In 2003, IEEE released the
IEEE 802.11g amendment, which specifies a radio transmission method that also uses the 2.4 GHz ISM
band and can support data rates of up to 54 Mbps. In addition, IEEE 802.11g-compliant products are
backward compatible with IEEE 802.11b-compliant products.

In 2006, the first IEEE 802.11n draft was introduced to enhance the range and speed of WLANs up to
theoretical speeds of 300 Mbps. IEEE 802.11n maintains backward compatibility with IEEE 802.11a/b/g
WLANs because it operates on both the 2.4 GHz ISM band and the 5.0 GHz UNII band. Throughput is
enhanced over its predecessors by using wider bandwidth channels and devices equipped with multiple
antennas to better use RF signal. In addition, IEEE 802.11n almost doubles the effective range of the
WLAN.

The IEEE 802.11 variants 3 listed in Table 2-1 all include security features known collectively as Wired
Equivalent Privacy (WEP), which were developed to provide a level of security comparable to that of
unencrypted wired LANs. As described in Section 4, IEEE 802.11 configurations that rely on WEP have
several well-documented security problems. The IEEE and the Wi-Fi Alliance acknowledged the scope

of the problems and developed short-term and long-term strategies for rectifying the situation. In early
2003, the Wi-Fi Alliance, in coordination with the IEEE 802.11 Working Group, developed the Wi-Fi
Protected Access (WPA) security enhancement to replace WEP. This was implemented as a stopgap
measure until a robust IEEE 802.11 security standard could be developed and approved. In June 2004,
the IEEE finalized the 802.11i amendment, which was designed to overcome the shortcomings of WEP,
enhance WPA, and provide IEEE 802.11 based wireless networks with a robust security mechanism.
IEEE 802.11i specifies a security framework that operates in conjunction with all the IEEE 802.11 radio
transmission standards and modulation techniques, such as IEEE 802.11a, 802.11b, and 802.11g; any
future IEEE 802.11 standard will also be compatible with IEEE 802.11i. 4

IEEE 802.11i includes many security enhancements that leverage mature and proven security
technologies. For example, IEEE 802.11i references the use of Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)
standards, some of which are capable of providing mutual authentication between wireless clients and the
WLAN infrastructure, as well as performing automatic cryptographic key distribution. In addition, IEEE
802.11i provides means for the use of accepted cryptographic practices, such as generating cryptographic
checksums through hash message authentication codes (HMAC).

The IEEE 802.11i specification introduces the concept of a Robust Security Network (RSN). RSN
networks are restricted to Robust Security Network Associations (RSNA); a RSNA is a logical
connection between communicating IEEE 802.11 entities established through the IEEE 802.11i key
management scheme, which is called the 4-Way Handshake. The handshake is a protocol that validates
that both entities share a master key, synchronizes the installation of temporal keys, and confirms the
selection and configuration of data confidentiality and integrity protocols. The master key, known as the
pairwise master key (PMK), serves as the basis for the IEEE 802.11i data confidentiality and integrity
protocols that provide enhanced security over the flawed WEP from earlier versions of IEEE 802.11.

     In 2007, an updated version of the IEEE 802.11 standard was released
     (http://standards.ieee.org/getieee802/download/802.11-2007.pdf), and the IEEE 802.11i amendment and several other
     amendments were rolled into the main IEEE 802.11 standard. For clarity, this publication still references IEEE 802.11i
     because of the brevity and clarity in doing so, as opposed to referencing the corresponding sets of features within the 2007
     version of the IEEE 802.11 standard.

WPA2 is the Wi-Fi Alliance interoperable specification for IEEE 802.11i. Organizations that are
considering the deployment of new WLANs should evaluate IEEE 802.11i/WPA2-based products and
follow the recommendations for IEEE 802.11i/WPA2 implementations presented in NIST SP 800-97,
Establishing Wireless Robust Security Networks: A Guide to IEEE 802.11i. 5 The recommendations in
NIST SP 800-97 should also be applied to existing IEEE 802.11i WLAN implementations.

2.2     IEEE 802.11 Network Components and Architectural Models

IEEE 802.11 has two fundamental architectural components:

 Station (STA). A STA is a wireless endpoint device. Typical examples of STAs are laptop
  computers, PDAs, mobile telephones, and other consumer electronic devices with IEEE 802.11
  capabilities.
 AP. 6 An AP logically connects STAs with a distribution system (DS), which is typically an
  organization’s wired infrastructure. APs can also logically connect wireless STAs with each other
  without accessing a DS. In addition, APs can function in a bridge mode, which allows APs to create
  point-to-point connections to join two separate networks.
The IEEE 802.11 standard defines two basic network topologies. The first, ad hoc mode, does not use
APs—only STAs are involved in the communications. The second, infrastructure mode, has an AP that
connects wireless STAs to each other or to a DS, typically a wired network. Infrastructure mode is the
most commonly used mode for WLANs.

The ad hoc mode is depicted conceptually in Figure 2-1. This mode of operation, also known as peer-to-
peer mode, is possible when two or more STAs are able to communicate directly to one another. Figure
2-1 shows three devices communicating with each other in a peer-to-peer fashion without any wireless
infrastructure or wired connections. A set of STAs configured in this ad hoc manner is known as an
independent basic service set (IBSS).

Today, a STA is most often thought of as a simple laptop computer using an inexpensive wireless
network interface card (NIC) that provides wireless connectivity. As IEEE 802.11 and its variants
continue to increase in popularity, many other types of devices could also be STAs, such as scanners,
printers, and digital cameras. Figure 2-1 depicts a sample IBSS that includes a mobile telephone, laptop
computer, and a PDA communicating via IEEE 802.11 technology. The circle in Figure 2-1 represents
the signal range of the devices, which is important to consider because this determines the coverage area
within which the stations can remain in communication. A fundamental property of IBSS is that it
defines no routing or forwarding, so all the devices must be within radio range of one another.

      Technically, APs are also STAs. Some literature distinguishes between AP STAs and non-AP STAs. In this document, the
      term STA refers to non-AP STAs only.

                            Figure 2-1. IEEE 802.11 Ad Hoc Mode Architecture

One of the key advantages of ad hoc WLANs is that theoretically they can be formed anytime and
anywhere, allowing multiple users to create wireless connections cheaply, quickly, and easily with
minimal hardware and user maintenance. In practice, a number of different types of ad hoc networks are
possible, and the IEEE 802.11 specification allows many of them. An ad hoc network can be created for
various reasons, such as supporting file sharing activities between two client devices. However, client
devices operating solely in ad hoc mode cannot communicate with external wireless networks. A further
complication is that an ad hoc network can interfere with the operation of an AP-based infrastructure
mode network that exists within the same wireless space.

In infrastructure mode, an IEEE 802.11 WLAN comprises one or more Basic Service Sets (BSS), the
basic building blocks of a WLAN. A BSS includes an AP and one or more STAs. The AP in a BSS
connects the STAs to the DS. The DS is the means by which STAs can communicate with an
organization’s wired LANs and external networks, such as the Internet. The IEEE 802.11 infrastructure
mode is outlined in Figure 2-2 by two BSSs connected to a DS.

                               Figure 2-2. IEEE 802.11 Infrastructure Mode

The use of multiple APs connected to a single DS allows for the creation of wireless networks of arbitrary
size and complexity. In the IEEE 802.11 specification, a multi-BSS network is referred to as an extended
service set (ESS). Figure 2-3 conceptually depicts a network with both wired and wireless capabilities,
similar to what would generally be deployed in an enterprise environment. It shows three APs with
corresponding BSSs, which comprise an ESS. The ESS is attached to the wired enterprise network or DS,
which, in turn, is connected to the Internet and other outside networks. This architecture could permit
various STAs, such as laptop computers and PDAs, to access network resources and the Internet. In
addition, the use of an ESS provides the opportunity for IEEE 802.11 WLAN STAs to roam between APs
while maintaining network connectivity.

2.3   Wireless Local Area Network Range and Use

The reliable coverage range for IEEE 802.11 WLANs depends on several factors, including data rate
requirements and capacity, sources of RF interference, physical area characteristics, power, connectivity,
and antenna usage. The typical range for connectivity of IEEE 802.11 network equipment is 50 to 100
meters (about 328 ft.) indoors, with significantly greater ranges achievable outdoors. Increased power

output and special high-gain antennas can increase the range of IEEE 802.11 network devices to several
miles.

APs may also provide a bridging function that connects two or more networks together and allows them
to communicate via the wireless radio. Bridging involves either a point-to-point or a multipoint
configuration. In a point-to-point architecture, two wired LANs are connected to each other via each
LAN’s wireless bridging device. In multipoint bridging, one subnet on a wired LAN is connected to
several other subnets on another wired LAN via each subnet’s bridging device, eliminating the need for
wired links. For example, if a computer on network A needed to connect to computers on networks B, C,
and D, network A’s wireless bridging device would connect to B’s, C’s, and D’s respective wireless
bridging devices.

Enterprises may use bridging to connect wired LANs between different buildings on corporate campuses.
Bridging devices are typically placed on top of buildings to achieve greater antenna reception. Typical
bridges may extend for several miles, but may vary depending on several factors, including the specific
receiver or transceiver being used, power-output, antenna type, and environmental conditions. Figure 2-4
illustrates a point-to-point wireless bridging between two wired LANs located in two separate buildings.
In the example, wireless data is being transmitted from a client device in Building A to a client device in
Building B, using each building’s appropriately positioned bridging device to transmit and receive data
between the two buildings. A client device in Building A connects to the wired enterprise network
located in Building A, which then transmits any data intended for a client device in Building B over the
wireless bridged link. Any data originating from a client device in Building B, intended for a client
device in Building A, will be sent by Building B’s wired LAN to the wireless bridging device and
transmitted to Building A’s wireless bridging device, which then passes the data on to Building A’s wired
enterprise network and finally to a client device in Building A. This sequence takes place for all data
traversing the bridge link.

3.     Overview of Wireless Local Area Network Security

WLAN technologies typically need to support several security objectives. The most common security
objectives for WLANs are:

 Confidentiality—ensure that communication cannot be read by unauthorized parties
 Integrity—detect any intentional or unintentional changes to data that occur in transit
 Availability—ensure that devices and individuals can access a WLAN and its resources whenever
  needed.
The security objectives for wireless and wired networks are the same, as are the major high-level
categories of threats that they face. Table 3-1 provides a list of these categories.

                             Table 3-1. Major Threats Against Network Security

     Threat Category                                           Description
 Denial of Service      Attacker prevents or limits the normal use or management of networks or network
                        devices.
 Eavesdropping          Attacker passively monitors network communications for data, including authentication
                        credentials.
 Man-in-the-Middle      Attacker actively impersonates multiple legitimate parties, such as appearing as a client to
                        an AP and appearing as an AP to a client. Allows attacker to intercept communications
                        between an AP and a client, thereby obtaining authentication credentials and data.
 Masquerading           Attacker impersonates an authorized user and gains certain unauthorized privileges.
 Message Modification   Attacker alters a legitimate message by deleting, adding to, changing, or reordering it.
 Message Replay         Attacker passively monitors transmissions and retransmits messages, acting as if the
                        attacker were a legitimate user.
 Misappropriation       Attacker steals or makes unauthorized use of a service.
 Traffic Analysis       Attacker passively monitors transmissions to identify communication patterns and
                        participants.


Most threats against wireless networks involve an attacker with access to the radio link between wireless
devices. Several of the threats listed in Table 3-1 rely on an attacker’s ability to intercept and inject
network communications. This highlights the most significant difference between protecting wireless and
wired networks: the relative ease of intercepting wireless network transmissions and inserting new or
altered transmissions from what is presumed to be the authentic source. To breach a wired network, an
attacker would have to gain physical access to the network or remotely compromise systems on the
network; for a wireless network, an attacker simply needs to be within range of the wireless
transmissions, making eavesdropping a particularly prevalent threat. (Some attackers use highly sensitive
directional antennas, which can greatly extend the effective range of attack on the wireless networks
beyond the standard range.) Another consideration in threats against wireless networks is that, in many
cases, a wireless network is logically connected to a wired network, so the wireless network should be
secured against both the threats that wired networks typically face and the threats that are specific to
wireless networks.

In addition to eavesdropping, another common threat against wireless networks is the deployment of
rogue wireless devices. For example, an attacker could deploy a wireless access point (AP) that has been
configured to appear as part of an organization’s wireless network infrastructure. This provides a
backdoor into the wired network, bypassing perimeter security mechanisms, such as firewalls. In


                                                       3-1
                                                    GUIDE TO SECURING LEGACY IEEE 802.11 WIRELESS NETWORKS



addition, if clients inadvertently connect to the rogue device, the attacker can view and manipulate the
clients’ communications.

Denial of service (DoS) situations are another threat against wireless networks. Examples are flooding
(an attacker sends large numbers of messages at a high rate to prevent the wireless network from
processing legitimate traffic) and jamming (a device emits electromagnetic energy on the wireless
network’s frequency to make it unusable). Jamming often occurs unintentionally; for example,
microwave ovens, cordless telephones, and other devices share bandwidth with certain wireless
technologies, and the devices’ operation can inadvertently make wireless networks in proximity unusable.
Denial of service conditions can also be caused through protocol manipulation, such as improper requests
or responses that cause devices to enter abnormal states.

Network security attacks against WLANs are typically divided into passive and active attacks. These two
broad classes are then subdivided into other types of attacks. All are defined below.

 Passive Attack: an attack in which an unauthorized party gains access to an asset and does not
  modify its content or actively attack or disrupt a WLAN. There are two types of passive attacks:

    –   Eavesdropping. The attacker monitors wireless data transmissions between devices for message
        content, such as authentication credentials or passwords. An example of this attack is an attacker
        listening to transmissions on a WLAN between an AP and a client.

    –   Traffic analysis (also known as traffic flow analysis). The attacker gains intelligence by
        monitoring the transmissions for patterns of communication. A considerable amount of
        information is contained in the flow of messages between communicating parties. This is a more
        subtle method than eavesdropping.
 Active Attack: an attack whereby an unauthorized party makes modifications to a message, data
  stream, or file. It is possible to detect this type of attack, but it may not be preventable. Active
  attacks may take the form of one of four types (or a combination thereof):

    –   Masquerading. The attacker impersonates an authorized user to gain access to certain
        unauthorized privileges.

    –   Replay. The attacker monitors transmissions (passive attack) and retransmits messages posing as
        the legitimate user.

    –   Message modification. The attacker alters a legitimate message by deleting, adding to,
        changing, or reordering the message.

    –   DoS. The attacker prevents or prohibits the normal use or management of a WLAN.

4.     Security of Legacy IEEE 802.11 WLAN Standards

This section describes the security features provided by legacy IEEE 802.11 WLAN standards and
explains their limitations. The section addresses WEP 7 and WPA, which are designed to protect link-
level data during wireless transmission between clients and APs. As Figure 4-1 shows, WLAN standards
cannot provide end-to-end security because they are only used for the wireless link between the AP and
STA.




                      Figure 4-1. Lack of End-to-End Security from WLAN Security Features

WEP, which is now known to have a number of security vulnerabilities, was designed by the IEEE to
provide the following three basic security services:

 Authentication: to verify the identity of communicating client stations. This controls access to the
  network by denying access to client stations that cannot authenticate properly.
 Confidentiality: to use encryption to provide wireless networks with the same or similar privacy
  achieved by an unencrypted wired network. The intent was to prevent information compromise from
  casual eavesdropping.
 Integrity: to ensure that messages were not modified in transit between wireless clients and APs.
WEP’s intended capabilities for providing authentication and protecting confidentiality and integrity are
described below, along with known weaknesses in those capabilities. It is important to note that WEP
does not address other security services such as audit, authorization, replay protection, non-repudiation,
and key management. The lack of key management services is particularly problematic, necessitating that
organizations deploying legacy WLANs determine how to generate, distribute, store, load, escrow,
archive, audit, and destroy WEP keys. Many organizations choose not to change WEP keys regularly,

7
     IEEE 802.11 specifies an optional privacy algorithm, WEP, that is designed to satisfy the goal of wired LAN “equivalent”
     privacy. The algorithm is not designed for ultimate security but rather to be “at least as secure as a wire.” Source

                                                             4-1
                                                                 GUIDE TO SECURING LEGACY IEEE 802.11 WIRELESS NETWORKS



which provides attackers with the opportunity to capture enough data to compute the WEP key and use it
to gain unauthorized access to data or perform other attacks. Many organizations also choose to use the
same key for many devices, which poses a significant risk if an attacker gains access to one of the devices
(for example, a laptop being lost, stolen, or infected with an attacker’s malware). Using the same key for
many devices also makes it easier for an attacker to perform analytic attacks to recover the key.

Also, without proper key management practices, legacy IEEE 802.11 WLANs may have key-related
vulnerabilities such as the use of non-unique keys, factory default keys, or other weak keys (e.g., all
zeroes, all ones, and other easily guessed patterns).

4.1      Authentication

In the legacy IEEE 802.11 specification, authentication between clients and APs is only one way:
authenticating the client to the AP. The client must trust that it is communicating to a legitimate, benign
AP. The legacy specification defines two authentication methods: open-system and shared-key. Open-
system authentication is the only authentication method that the legacy IEEE 802.11 specification
requires products to support. However, open-system authentication is not truly authentication; the AP
accepts the client without verifying its identity, simply by the client providing a MAC address to the AP.
There is no validation that this MAC address is not spoofed or that the client is authorized to have access,
so open-system authentication is highly vulnerable to attack and practically invites unauthorized access.

The other authentication method in the legacy specification, shared-key authentication, is a cryptographic
technique for authentication. It is a simple “challenge-response” scheme based on whether a client has
knowledge of a shared secret—the WEP key. In this scheme, as depicted in Figure 4-2, a random
challenge is generated by the AP and sent to the client in plaintext. The client then generates a
pseudorandom series of bytes known as the key stream that is XORed 8 with the AP’s plaintext challenge
and sent back to the AP as an encrypted response. The AP decrypts the result computed by the client and
allows access only if the decrypted value is the same as the random challenge transmitted. The algorithm
used in the cryptographic computation and for the generation of the 128-bit challenge text is the RC4
stream cipher, which is not FIPS-approved.

In shared-key authentication, the initial exchange of the plaintext challenge from the AP and the
encrypted response from the client is a major security design flaw. An eavesdropping attack would
capture both the AP’s plaintext challenge and the client’s encrypted response, thereby providing an
attacker with two of the three components required to determine the random key stream. An attacker can
XOR the encrypted response and the plaintext challenge to determine the random key stream, thus
enabling the attacker to authenticate to the AP.

If a legacy WLAN is limited to WEP authentication methods and employing WEP data encryption, open-
system authentication is technically more secure than shared-key authentication because shared-key
authentication can actually help facilitate an attack on the WEP encryption keys. However, neither
authentication method provides any true assurance of authentication, so organizations that want to
authenticate their legacy WLAN clients should consider separate authentication solutions and plan
migration to WLANs using IEEE 802.11i, which support multiple strong authentication options.

      XOR, or Exclusive OR, is when the bits of two bytes are compared to generate one resulting byte. If the corresponding bits
      in the original two bytes are different, the resulting byte’s corresponding value will be a one, if they are the same, the value
      will be a zero. For example, XORing a byte with value 11101001 with another byte with value 00100110 will result in the
      resulting byte value of 11001111.

4.2   Confidentiality

WEP employs the RC4 stream cipher algorithm to encrypt wireless communications to protect
transmitted data from disclosure to eavesdroppers. The standard for WEP specifies support for a 40-bit
WEP key only; many vendors offer non-standard extensions to WEP that support key lengths of up to 104
or even 232 bits. WEP also uses a 24-bit value known as an initialization vector (IV) as a seed value for
initializing the cryptographic key stream. For example, a 104-bit WEP key with a 24-bit IV becomes a
128-bit RC4 key. Ideally, larger key sizes translate to stronger protection, but the cryptographic
technique used by WEP has known flaws that are not mitigated by longer keys because the key flaws are
a result of the weak implementation of the IV and RC4 symmetric-key, stream cipher algorithm. WEP is
applied to all data above the IEEE 802.11 WLAN layers to protect traffic such as Transmission Control
Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), Internet Packet Exchange (IPX), and Hypertext Transfer Protocol
(HTTP). WEP is illustrated conceptually in Figure 4-3.




                                                  4-3
                                                   GUIDE TO SECURING LEGACY IEEE 802.11 WIRELESS NETWORKS




                                   Figure 4-3. WEP Using RC4 Algorithm

Most attacks against WEP encryption have been based on IV-related vulnerabilities. The IV portion of
the RC4 key is sent in cleartext, allowing an eavesdropper to monitor and analyze a relatively small
amount of network traffic to recover the key by taking advantage of the IV value knowledge, the
relatively small 24-bit IV key space, and a weakness in the way WEP implements the RC4 algorithm.
Also, WEP does not specify precisely how the IVs should be set or changed, so some products use a
static, well-known IV value or reset the IV to zero. If two messages have the same IV, and the plaintext
of either message is known, it is relatively trivial for an attacker to determine the plaintext of the other
message. In particular, because many messages contain common protocol headers or other easily
decipherable contents, it is often possible to identify the original plaintext contents with minimal effort.
Even traffic from products that use sequentially increasing IV values is still susceptible to attack. There
are fewer than 17 million possible IV values; on a busy WLAN, the entire IV space may be exhausted in a
few hours. When the IV is chosen randomly, which represents the best possible generic IV selection
algorithm, by the birthday paradox, two IVs already have a 50% chance of repeating after about 212 (or
4,096) frames.

Another possible threat to confidentiality is network traffic analysis. Eavesdroppers might be able to gain
information by monitoring which parties communicate at what times. Also, analyzing traffic patterns can
aid in determining the content of communications; for example, short bursts of activity might be caused
by terminal emulation or instant messaging, while steady streams of activity might be generated by video
conferencing. More sophisticated analysis might be able to determine the operating systems in use based
on the length of certain frames. Other than encrypting communications, the legacy IEEE 802.11 standard,
like most other network protocols, does not offer any features that might thwart network traffic analysis,
such as adding random lengths of padding to messages or sending additional messages with randomly
generated data.

Some legacy WLAN devices can be upgraded through firmware to support WPA. WPA includes two
main features: IEEE 802.1X and the Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP). The IEEE 802.1X port-
based access control provides a framework to allow the use of robust upper-layer authentication
protocols. It also facilitates the use of session keys that allow the rotation of cryptographic keys. TKIP
includes four new features to enhance the security of IEEE 802.11: TKIP extends the IV space, allows for
per-packet key construction, provides cryptographic integrity, and provides key derivation and
distribution. Through these features, TKIP provides protection against various security attacks discussed
earlier, including replay attacks and attacks on data integrity. In addition, it addresses the critical need to
periodically change encryption keys. However, WPA has significant flaws and does not provide the level
of security that IEEE 802.11i can. 9 Table 4-1 below outlines the various IEEE 802.11 wireless security
standards. Of the four security methods shown in the table, it is important to note that only Counter Mode
with Cipher Block Chaining MAC Protocol (CCMP) RSN, which is used by IEEE 802.11i, has a
cryptographic algorithm that is FIPS-validated. WEP and WPA only use cryptographic algorithms that
do not meet the requirements for FIPS 140-2 validation.

4.3       Integrity

WEP supports data integrity by checking messages transmitted between STAs and APs. WEP is designed
to reject any messages that have been changed in transit, such as by a man-in-the-middle attack. WEP
data integrity is based on a simple encrypted checksum—a 32-bit cyclic redundancy check (CRC-32)
computed on each payload prior to transmission. The payload and checksum are encrypted using the RC4
key stream before transmission. The receiver decrypts each transmission, recomputes the checksum on
9
       The objective of WPA was to bring a standards-based interim security solution to the marketplace to replace WEP until
       IEEE developed a new wireless security specification (IEEE 802.11i).


                                                               4-5
                                                             GUIDE TO SECURING LEGACY IEEE 802.11 WIRELESS NETWORKS



the received payload, and compares it with the transmitted checksum. If the checksums are not the same,
the transmitted data frame has been altered in transit, and the frame is discarded.

Unfortunately, the WEP integrity scheme is vulnerable to certain attacks regardless of key size because its
simple CRC is not a “cryptographically secure” mechanism such as a cryptographic hash or message
authentication code. The CRC-32 is subject to a number of security threats, including bit-flipping attacks,
which occur when an attacker knows which CRC-32 bits will change when message bits are altered.
WEP attempts to counter this problem by encrypting the CRC-32 to produce an Integrity Check Value
(ICV). While the creators of WEP believed that an encrypted CRC-32 would be more resistant to
tampering, they did not realize that a property of stream ciphers such as WEP’s RC4 is that bit flipping
survives the encryption process—the same bits flip whether or not encryption is used. Therefore, the
WEP ICV offers no additional protection against bit flipping. Cryptographic checksums prevent bit
flipping attacks because they are designed so that any change to the original message results in significant
and unpredictable changes to the resulting checksum.

4.4     Recommendations

WEP has several significant security problems, most of which cannot be solved by reconfiguration of
WEP itself. For example, increasing the length of the WEP key would only marginally increase the time
needed to decrypt packets. WEP does not provide an acceptable level of wireless transmission security,
so it should not be the sole security mechanism used in legacy IEEE 802.11 WLAN deployments. More
robust WLAN security solutions, such as those outlined in NIST SP 800-97, 10 or compensating controls
should be implemented to provide the needed security. Because of the serious security flaws in the legacy
IEEE 802.11 standard, NIST recommends that organizations with existing legacy IEEE 802.11 WLAN
implementations develop and implement migration strategies to move to IEEE 802.11i, which offers
better security.

5.       Threats and Vulnerabilities

As the number of organizations that deploy wireless networks continues to grow, it becomes even more
important to understand the types of vulnerabilities and threats facing legacy IEEE 802.11 WLANs and
implement appropriate security measures. Some of the vulnerabilities that are described in this section
are inherent in the legacy IEEE 802.11 WLAN standard, while others are relevant to WLANs or wireless
networking in general.

5.1      Loss of Confidentiality

Because of the broadcast and radio nature of wireless technology, ensuring confidentiality is significantly
more difficult in a wireless network than a wired network. Traditional wired networks provide inherent
security through the use of a physical medium to which an attacker needs to gain access. Wireless
networks propagate signals into space, making traditional physical security countermeasures less effective
and access to the network much easier, increasing the importance of adequate confidentiality on wireless
networks.

Passive eavesdropping on legacy IEEE 802.11 WLAN communications may cause significant risk to an
organization. An adversary can scan RF signals and capture data traversing the wireless medium.
Sensitive information, including proprietary information, network IDs and passwords, and configuration
data, are some examples of data that may be captured. In addition, attackers with high-gain antennas can
capture data from wireless networks beyond a network’s normal operating range, again making
confidentiality a critical security measure.

Eavesdropping performed with a wireless network analyzer tool or sniffer is particularly easy for legacy
IEEE 802.11 WLANs. Sniffers can take advantage of flaws in the key-scheduling algorithm that was
provided for the implementation of RC4 used by WEP. To exploit these weaknesses, the sniffer passively
monitors the WLAN and computes the encryption keys after a variable number of packets have been
sniffed. On a highly saturated network, collecting the amount of data required to compute the WEP keys
only takes several hours; if traffic volume is low, it may take up to one day. For example, a busy AP that
is transmitting 3,000 bytes at 11 Mbps will exhaust the 24-bit IV space after approximately 10 hours. 11
Once the attacker recovers two ciphertexts that have used the same IV, both data integrity and
confidentiality may be easily compromised. Advanced tools use methods to exploit the weakness in IEEE
802.11 security in less time. After the network packets have been received, the fundamental keys may be
guessed in less than one second. 12 Once the malicious user knows the WEP key, he or she can read any
packet traveling over the WLAN.

Another risk to WLANs is loss of confidentiality through simple eavesdropping on broadcast traffic.
Ethernet hubs generally broadcast network traffic to all physical interfaces and connected devices, which
leaves the broadcasted traffic vulnerable to unauthorized monitoring. For example, an AP connected to a
port on an Ethernet hub that is broadcasting data traffic would broadcast all of the data traffic it received
on its wired interface over its wireless interface. The use of the Ethernet hub infrastructure increases the
risk that the AP may be broadcasting proprietary or sensitive data that was transmitted through the hub.
Switches alleviate this concern by providing dedicated channels between communication devices.

A malicious or irresponsible user could surreptitiously physically insert a rogue AP into a closet, under a
conference room table, or in any other hidden area within a building. The rogue AP could then be used to
allow unauthorized individuals to gain access to an enterprise network. As long as its location is in close

      10 hours = (3,000 bytes x ((8 bits/byte) / (11 x 106 bits/sec)) x 24) = 36,600 seconds)

                                                                5-1

proximity to the users of the WLAN, and it is configured to appear as a legitimate AP to wireless clients,
the rogue AP may successfully convince wireless clients of its legitimacy and cause wireless clients to
connect and transmit traffic to the rogue AP. In this scenario, an attacker can easily capture all of the data
transmitted through the rogue AP, bypassing all wireless protocol confidentiality. It is also important to
note that not all rogue APs are deployed by malicious users. In many cases, rogue APs are deployed by
users who want to take advantage of wireless technology without the approval of the IT department.
These APs are often deployed without proper security configurations and pose significant security risks.

5.2   Loss of Integrity

Data integrity issues in wireless networks are similar to those in wired networks. Because organizations
frequently implement wireless and wired communications without adequate cryptographic protection of
data, integrity can be difficult to achieve. For example, an attacker can compromise data integrity by
deleting or modifying the data in an email via the wireless system. This can be detrimental to an
organization if important email is widely distributed among email recipients. Because the security
features of the legacy IEEE 802.11 standard do not provide strong message integrity, other kinds of active
attacks that compromise system integrity are possible. The specific weaknesses of the CRC-32 integrity
mechanism portion of WEP are outlined in Section 4.3.

5.3   Loss of Availability

A denial of WLAN availability often involves some form of DoS attack, such as jamming or flooding.
Jamming occurs when an RF signal emitted from a wireless device overwhelms other wireless devices
and signals, causing a loss of communications. Jamming may be caused deliberately by a malicious user
or caused inadvertently by emissions from other legitimate devices operating within unlicensed spectrum,
such as a cordless telephone or microwave oven. Flooding attacks are initiated using software designed
to transmit a large number of packets to an AP or other wireless device, causing the device to be
overwhelmed by packets and cease normal operation. Flooding can cause a WLAN to degrade to an
unacceptable performance level or even fail completely. Jamming and flooding threats are difficult to
counter in any radio-based communications, and the legacy IEEE 802.11 standard does not provide any
defense against them.

IEEE 802.11 management frames provide another vector for DoS attacks against WLANs. Management
frames govern the process of associating and disassociating APs and STAs from a WLAN. By design,
the IEEE 802.11 standard does not provide protection against these attacks. If an adversary forges a
disassociation frame and sends it to an AP or STA, the targeted device will grant the request and close its
communications association. Another type of attack, known as an association attack, targets an AP’s
association table, which monitors the state of STAs associated with the AP. An association attack
typically floods this table with false requests until the AP no longer allows legitimate associations. More
advanced association attacks can force STAs to connect to false APs where the victim is subject to a
variety of malicious attacks.

Another threat to legacy IEEE 802.11 WLAN availability is the use of IEEE 802.11n WLANs. IEEE
802.11n offers a Greenfield mode that disables IEEE 802.11n’s backward compatibility and requires that
all WLAN devices run in native IEEE 802.11n mode. Greenfield mode can cause significant interference
for all non-IEEE 802.11n devices within its transmission area. For example, a neighboring IEEE 802.11n
WLAN operating in Greenfield mode can unintentionally create a potential DoS for the legacy WLAN.

Users can also cause a loss of unavailability by unintentionally monopolizing the capacity of a WLAN,
such as downloading large files, effectively denying other users access to the network.

6.        WLAN Security Countermeasures

Organizations should mitigate risks to their legacy IEEE 802.11 WLANs by applying countermeasures to
address specific threats and vulnerabilities. Because of the security weaknesses inherent in legacy IEEE
802.11 WLANs, most of these countermeasures cannot be achieved through security features built into
legacy IEEE 802.11 standards. This section describes management, operational, and technical
countermeasures that can be effective in reducing the risks commonly associated with legacy IEEE
802.11 WLANs. These countermeasures do not guarantee a secure WLAN environment and cannot
prevent all adversary penetrations. Also, security comes at a cost—financial expenses related to security
equipment, inconvenience, maintenance, and operation. Each organization needs to evaluate the
acceptable level of risk based on numerous factors, which will affect the level of security implemented by
that organization. To be effective, WLAN security should be incorporated throughout the entire life cycle
of WLAN solutions. 13

FIPS Publication (PUB) 199 establishes three security categories—low, moderate, and high—based on
the potential impact of a security breach involving a particular system. NIST SP 800-53 provides
recommendations for minimum management, operational, and technical security controls for information
systems based on the FIPS PUB 199 impact categories. 14 The recommendations in NIST SP 800-53
should be helpful to organizations in identifying controls that are needed to protect WLANs in general,
which should be used in addition to the specific recommendations for legacy IEEE 802.11 WLANs listed
in this document.

6.1       Management Countermeasures

Organizations should create a wireless networking security policy that addresses legacy IEEE 802.11
WLAN security. Such a policy and an organization’s ability to enforce compliance with it are the
foundations for all other countermeasures. Policy considerations for legacy IEEE 802.11 WLANs should
include the following:

 Roles and responsibilities

      –    Which users or groups of users are and are not authorized to use organization WLANs

      –    Which parties are authorized and responsible for installing and configuring APs and other WLAN
           equipment
 WLAN infrastructure security

      –    Physical security requirements for WLANs and WLAN devices, including limitations on the
           service areas of WLANs

      –    Types of information that may and may not be sent over WLANs, including acceptable use
           guidelines

      –    How WLAN transmissions should be protected, including requirements for the use of encryption
           and for cryptographic key management

Security assessments, or audits, are an essential tool for checking the security posture of a legacy IEEE
802.11 WLAN and for determining corrective action to make sure such WLANs remain secure. 15 It is
important for organizations to perform regular audits using wireless sniffers and other tools. 16 Assessors,
such as security administrators or auditors, can use sniffers to determine whether wireless products are
transmitting correctly and on the correct channels. Assessors should periodically check within the office
building space (and campus) for rogue APs and other unauthorized access. Organizations may also
consider using an independent third party to conduct the security audits from an impartial perspective. In
some cases, compared to an organization’s own staff, a third party that specializes in wireless security
may be more up-to-date on security vulnerabilities and better equipped to assess the security of a WLAN.
A third-party assessment, which may include penetration testing, will help an organization ensure that its
WLANs are compliant with established security procedures and policies. 17 In addition to ensuring that
the wireless portion of the network is secure, organizations should also confirm the security of the wired
portion.

Other recommendations for management countermeasures are as follows:

 Consider designating an individual to track the progress of IEEE 802.11 security standards, features,
  threats, and vulnerabilities. This helps to ensure the continued secure implementation of WLAN
  technology.
 Maintain an inventory of legacy IEEE 802.11 APs and connecting devices. This inventory is useful
  when conducting audits of IEEE 802.11 technologies, particularly in identifying rogue devices.
6.2       Operational Countermeasures

Physical security is fundamental for ensuring that only authorized users have access to WLAN
equipment. Physical security combines such measures as access controls, personnel identification, and
external boundary protection. For example, photo identification, card badge readers, or biometric devices

can be used to reduce the risk of improper physical penetration of facilities containing WLAN equipment.
External boundary protection can include locking doors and installing video cameras for surveillance
around the perimeter of a site to discourage unauthorized access to WLAN components, such as APs,
from outside the organization’s facilities. In addition, additional security mechanisms should be put in
place if necessary to prevent the theft, alteration, or misuse of WLAN infrastructure components, such as
APs, which are often dispersed throughout facilities.

It is important to consider the RF range of each AP in a legacy IEEE 802.11 WLAN. If the range extends
beyond the physical boundaries of the organization’s facilities, the extension creates a security
vulnerability. An individual outside the facilities could eavesdrop on network communications by using a
wireless device to capture wireless signals and data. A similar consideration applies to the
implementation of building-to-building bridges. Ideally, the APs or bridges should be placed strategically
within a building so that the range does not exceed the physical perimeter of the building and allow
unauthorized personnel to eavesdrop near the perimeter.

Organizations can use site survey tools to measure the range of AP devices, both inside and outside the
facilities where the WLAN is located. Such tools measure and evaluate a number of WLAN
characteristics, including signal strength, range, data rate, and other factors. These measurements can be
used to map out the appropriate coverage area, capacity, and data rates for required WLAN usage. A
proper site survey can help ensure that signals for WLAN deployments do not extend beyond the
appropriate service area to unrestricted areas, such as parking lots or public areas. 18 Although mapping
the coverage area is helpful with regard to security, it is not an absolute solution. There is always a
possibility that an attacker might use a high-gain antenna from a relatively long distance to eavesdrop on
the WLAN traffic. Only by using strong cryptographic means can a user gain any assurance of protection
against eavesdropping adversaries.

Organizations concerned about eavesdropping threats should limit legacy WLAN signal propagation, at a
minimum so that it does not go beyond the physical control boundaries of the organization’s facilities.
There are various ways to meet RF containment goals, with the easiest being selecting proper antenna
types and setting appropriate power settings. For example, if the coverage area is a conference room,
setting the antenna’s power amplification to full power would not be necessary. Many tools can predict
RF propagation by calculating coverage distance based on antenna type and power input. Power
configuration settings can be changed in most APs’ management consoles. In addition, choosing the right
kinds of antennas can assist with signal containment. For example, when appropriate, using wall-
mounted antennas that propagate signal at 180 degrees or less can minimize signal leakage.

Additional recommendations for operational countermeasures involve training and awareness.
Organizations should ensure that users of legacy IEEE 802.11 WLANs are properly trained on their
secure use. Also, network administrators should be fully aware of the security risks that WLANs and
wireless devices pose. They should work to ensure security policy compliance and be aware of the steps
to take in the event of a WLAN-related security incident.

6.3     Technical Countermeasures

Technical countermeasures involve the use of hardware and software solutions to help secure the legacy
WLAN environment. The following subsections discuss possible countermeasures for legacy WLANs
and make recommendations for their use.


18
      One method of controlling WLAN signals involves the use of directional antennas to control RF emanations. Directional
      antennas do not protect network links; they merely help control coverage range by limiting signal dispersion.

6.3.1    Confidentiality and Integrity Protection

WPA was designed as the interim solution between WEP and the ratification of IEEE 802.11i. WPA is
an upgrade to existing WEP-enabled equipment to provide a higher level of security, primarily through
the use of TKIP and MIC. TKIP uses the same mechanisms as WEP to provide encryption, but TKIP
provides a higher level of security because it uses a 128-bit encryption key, as opposed to the 40-bit WEP
key, and it creates a new key for each packet (WEP encryption keys do not change). Also, using TKIP
with MIC provides stronger integrity checking than using WEP with CRC because MIC uses a stronger
cryptographic algorithm than CRC. However, it is important to note that TKIP is not FIPS-approved.
Therefore, if an organization needs to protect the confidentiality and integrity of its legacy WLAN
communications, it needs to employ additional security controls.

An alternative method of achieving confidentiality and integrity protection is using a virtual private
network (VPN). A VPN is a virtual network, built on top of existing physical networks, that can provide
a secure communications mechanism for data and IP information transmitted between networks. VPNs
are often used to facilitate the secure transfer of sensitive data across public networks, such as the
Internet, for remote access, telework, and other situations involving connecting multiple locations. VPNs
can also be established within a single network, such as a WLAN, to protect sensitive communications
from other parties on the network. A variety of VPN technologies exist, such as Internet Protocol
Security (IPsec) VPNs and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) VPNs. Federal agencies using VPNs to protect
the confidentiality of WLAN communications must configure the VPNs to use FIPS-validated encryption
algorithms contained in validated cryptographic modules. 19

One way to use VPNs to protect WLAN communications is to establish a VPN tunnel between the
WLAN client device and a VPN concentrator that is behind the AP. With an IPsec VPN, security
services are provided at the network layer of the protocol stack, which will secure all applications and
protocols operating at layer 3 and above. The VPN security services are independent of layer 2 wireless
security and are recommended to be used if the underlying wireless security mechanisms, such as WEP,
are weak. As a defense-in-depth strategy, if a VPN is in place, an organization can consider applying
both VPN security and wireless security. 20 It is important to understand that VPNs do not eliminate all
risk from wireless networking.

Organizations should also ensure that their WLAN management traffic’s confidentiality and integrity is
protected properly. This can be done through the methods described above, such as VPNs. Another
option is to place the WLAN management traffic on a dedicated wired network or a virtual local area
network (VLAN) to isolate it from WLAN users. This option also supports WLAN management
communications when a denial of service is occurring to the wireless network.

When determining how confidentiality and integrity should be protected, organizations should review
their WLAN client devices to determine the types of cryptographic algorithms that can be used, along
with key lengths and their re-keying period. Secret keys should be replaced periodically to reduce the
potential impact of a key compromise.

6.3.2    Wireless Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems

A wireless intrusion detection and prevention system (WIDPS) is an effective tool for determining
whether unauthorized users or devices are attempting to access, have already accessed, or have
compromised a WLAN. WIDPS can also detect misconfigured WLAN clients, rogue APs, ad hoc
19

     available at http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html.

networks, and other possible violations of an organization’s WLAN policy. 21 Organizations with
WLANs should consider implementing WIDPS solutions. 22

The introduction of IEEE 802.11n introduces new implications for WIDPS. Because IEEE 802.11n uses
both 20 MHz and 40 MHz channels, the WIDPS needs to dedicate more time to channel hopping and less
time to scanning each individual channel. This change in security posture weakens the WIDPS’ ability to
identify attacks while they are occurring. 23 In addition, WIDPSs that have not been updated to recognize
IEEE 802.11n may report their APs as being rogue or fail to detect them.

In some environments, WIDPS sensors have an additional function: RF insertion, which is transmitting
interference traffic to increase the difficulty of WEP cracking. RF insertion does not prevent WEP
cracking—it only deters novice attackers from cracking WEP with common tools by increasing the
amount of traffic an attacker has to sift through. An advanced attacker can fingerprint and filter insertion
packets, negating the intended effect of RF insertion. Accordingly, RF insertion provides little, if any,
protection for WLANs, while also reducing WLAN throughput.

6.3.3     Access Point Configuration

Organizations should configure their legacy IEEE 802.11 APs in accordance with established security
policies and requirements. APs can be categorized as thick or thin. A thick or intelligent AP handles
encryption and the overall management of the client devices connected to it. For a thin AP, the
processing of encryption and policy settings generally occurs in the central switch or controller. Thin
APs are generally more secure than thick APs because thin APs do not have a key that could be extracted
and also do not require the same level of physical security and other countermeasures than thick APs.

APs often have vulnerabilities and other weaknesses in their default configurations. Security
considerations for APs are described below, grouped into two categories: AP management and WLAN
configuration.

6.3.3.1 AP management

 Configuring administrator access. Each AP has its own default settings, some of which inherently
  contain security vulnerabilities. For example, on some APs the default configuration does not require
  a password or the default password is commonly known, allowing unauthorized users to easily gain
  access. AP default settings should be changed to reflect the organization’s security policy, such as
  requiring strong administrator passwords (for example, a policy might require an alphanumeric and
  special character string at least eight characters in length). 24 In addition, the AP should lock the login
  screen after a specific number of failed attempts have occurred, and the AP should log out
  administrators automatically after a defined period of inactivity. Also, it is important to ensure that


21
     Eavesdropping and other passive techniques cannot be identified by WIDPS technologies.
22
     For more information about WIDPS, see NIST SP 800-94, Guide to Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems, which is
     available at http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html.
23
     It is expected that this will be a problem primarily for early adoptions of IEEE 802.11n and that future WIDPSs will adjust
     to this change.
24
     An alternative to password authentication is two-factor authentication. One form of two-factor authentication uses a
     symmetric key algorithm to generate a new code every minute. This code is a one-time use code that is paired with the
     user’s personal identification number (PIN) for authentication. Another example of two-factor authentication is pairing the
     user’s smart card with the user’s PIN. This type of authentication requires a hardware device reader for the smart card or an
     authentication server for the PIN. While several commercial products provide this capability, use of an automated password
     generator or two-factor authentication mechanism may not be worth the investment, depending on the organization’s
     security requirements, number of users, and budget constraints.


                                                               6-5
                                                              GUIDE TO SECURING LEGACY IEEE 802.11 WIRELESS NETWORKS



     communications with the management interface have the proper cryptographic protection to prevent
     the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information.
 Controlling the reset function. An AP’s reset function may allow an individual to negate any
  security settings that administrators have configured in the AP. A specific type of reset will return the
  AP to its default factory settings. The default settings generally do not require an administrative
  password, for example, and may disable encryption. On some devices, an individual can reset an AP
  simply by inserting a pointed object such as a pen into the reset hole and pressing. A malicious user
  can exploit the reset feature to cancel out any security settings on the device. The reset function, if
  configured to erase basic operational information such as IP address or keys, can also result in a
  network DoS. Having physical access controls in place to prevent unauthorized users from resetting
  APs can mitigate the threats. In addition, resets can be invoked remotely over the management
  interface on some products. For this reason, it is imperative to have proper authentication and
  encryption on the management interface.
 Using SNMPv3. Some APs use Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) agents, which allow
  network management software tools to monitor the status of APs and clients. If SNMP is not
  required for the WLAN, it should be disabled; 25 otherwise, SNMPv3, which includes mechanisms to
  provide strong security, is highly recommended over the earlier versions of SNMP. 26 SNMPv1 and
  SNMPv2 support only trivial authentication based on plaintext community strings and are
  fundamentally insecure. The default SNMP community string that SNMPv1 and SNMPv2 agents
  commonly use is the word “public” with assigned “read” or “read and write” privileges; using this
  string leaves devices vulnerable to attack. If an unauthorized user were to gain access and had
  read/write privileges, that user could write data to the AP, compromising its original configuration.
  Organizations using SNMPv1 or SNMPv2 should change the community string as often as needed,
  taking into consideration that the string is transmitted in plaintext. For all versions of SNMP,
  privileges should be set to the least required (e.g., “read only”).
 Using HTTP. Most APs include an HTTP interface that provides administrators with a remotely
  accessible interface to manage device configuration. Normally, the only access control mechanism
  securing this interface is a user ID and password. Any user with those credentials can reconfigure the
  device to provide no security or change the encryption key so that no authorized users can associate
  with the AP. Because HTTP does not natively provide confidentiality security, it should be protected
  with SSL (i.e., HTTPS) or another encryption method. Also, administrators should consider enabling
  the HTTP interface only when it is needed (e.g., initial AP configuration) and keeping it disabled at
  all other times.
 Enabling logging. Most APs have the ability to log security events. Enabling this on APs helps to
  ensure user accountability and also provides records that can be reviewed if malicious activity has
  occurred to better understand the nature of that activity.
6.3.3.2 WLAN configuration

 Changing default channel and power output. The default channel and power output of APs should
  be configured appropriately. If APs are located near each other but are on different WLANs, a DoS
  can result from radio interference between the APs if they are operating on the same or conflicting
  channels. Organizations that incur radio interference should determine whether one or more nearby
  APs are using the same channel or a channel within five channels of their own and then choose a
  different channel. For example, channels 1, 6, and 11 can be used simultaneously by APs that are

25
     Any other management protocols on an AP that are not needed should also be disabled.
26
     See http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-snmpv3-rfc2570bis-03.txt for additional information on why using
     SNMPv3 instead of SNMPv1 or SNMPv2 is strongly recommended.


                                                              6-6

     close to each other without mutual interference. Organizations should perform a site survey to
     discover any sources of radio interference. The site survey should result in a report that proposes AP
     locations, determines coverage areas, and assigns radio channels to each AP. In addition, the power
     output of APs should be determined so that unneeded channel overlap can be minimized.
 Changing the SSID. The SSID is an identifier that is sometimes referred to as the network name.
  Clients that wish to join a network scan an area for available networks and join by providing the
  correct SSID. The SSID, typically a null-terminated ASCII string, has a range from zero to 32 bytes
  (or characters). The default SSIDs used by many IEEE 802.11 WLAN vendors have been published
  and are well-known, so the default SSID values of APs should be changed from the factory default to
  an unidentifiable value or non-discrete name to help prevent users from accidentally connecting to the
  wrong WLAN and to make it somewhat more difficult for attackers to identify the organization’s
  WLANs. Organizations should be aware that adversaries can capture the SSID by eavesdropping, so
  organizations should not rely on changing SSIDs to protect their WLANs.
 Avoiding pre-shared keys (PSK). Organizations requiring robust authentication for WLANs should
  avoid the use of PSKs. In PSK environments, a secret passphrase is shared between STAs and APs.
  The PSK is generated by combining the WLAN’s name and SSID with a passphrase, then hashing
  this multiple times. Keys derived from a passphrase shorter than approximately 20 characters provide
  relatively low levels of security and are subject to dictionary and rainbow attacks. 27 Changing the
  WLAN name or SSID will not improve the strength of the 256-bit PSK.
 Using MAC ACL functionality. Many legacy IEEE 802.11 products have capabilities for restricting
  access to the WLAN based on MAC access control lists (ACL) that are distributed across APs. The
  MAC ACL grants or denies access to a WLAN client using a list of permissions designated by MAC
  address. However, the MAC ACL does not represent a strong defense mechanism by itself, because
  MAC addresses are transmitted in the clear from WLAN clients to APs, so they can be easily
  captured. A malicious user can spoof a MAC address by changing the actual MAC address on
  another computer to a MAC address that has access to the WLAN. MAC ACLs may be effective
  against casual eavesdropping but will not be effective against determined adversaries. Organizations
  should weigh the administrative burden of using MAC ACLs against the security they provide. In a
  medium-to-large network, the burden of establishing and maintaining MAC ACLs often exceeds their
  value as a countermeasure. In addition, most products support a limited number of MAC addresses in
  the MAC ACL, which may be insufficient for medium-to-large networks.
 Using DHCP. The Dynamic Host Control Protocol (DHCP) can automatically assign IP addresses to
  devices that associate with an AP. The server assigns each device a dynamic IP address as long as the
  device’s encryption settings are compatible with the WLAN. Because a DHCP server does not
  necessarily know which devices should have access to the WLAN, the server automatically assigns
  each device a valid IP address, including unauthorized devices. This risk can be somewhat mitigated
  by disabling DHCP and using static IP addresses for the WLAN client devices, but this solution is
  similar in effectiveness to using MAC ACL functionality. It will deter casual attackers but not
  determined adversaries, who can spoof IP addresses. Also, using static IP addresses may only be
  possible for relatively small networks, given the administrative overhead involved with assigning
  static IP addresses and the possible shortage of addresses. Statically assigning IP addresses to clients
  would also negate some of the key advantages of wireless networks, such as roaming.
 Maximizing the beacon interval. The legacy IEEE 802.11 standard specifies the use of “beacon
  frames” to announce the existence of a wireless network. These beacons are transmitted from APs at
  regular intervals and allow a client station to identify and match configuration parameters to join a
27

     1128.

     WLAN. APs can be configured to change the beacon interval, with a maximum value of
     approximately 67 seconds. Lengthening the beacon interval may make it slightly more difficult to
     passively locate a WLAN because the AP is not transmitting as frequently, and an adversary might
     have to perform active scanning using Probe Request messages to locate APs. However, lengthening
     the beacon interval can also make it more difficult or time-consuming for legitimate WLAN clients to
     find the WLAN. At best, lengthening the beacon interval is a mild deterrent for casual attackers; at
     worst, it is a significant disruption to operations.
6.3.4    Wireless Client Device Security

Devices that have been granted access to a legacy IEEE 802.11 WLAN should be properly secured to
enhance the WLAN’s security posture. Securing the infrastructure without properly securing the client
devices renders the entire WLAN insecure. Client device security considerations include the following:

 Automatic connection. Client devices should be configured so that they do not automatically
  connect to WLANs. Permitting such automatic connections increases the risk of attack from
  malicious WLANs.
 Personal firewalls. Resources on WLANs have a higher risk of attack because they generally do not
  have the same degree of protection as internal resources. Personal firewalls increase device security
  by offering some protection against unwanted network connections initiated by other hosts. 28
  Personal firewalls are software-based solutions that reside on a client device and are either client-
  managed or centrally-managed. Centrally-managed solutions provide a greater degree of protection
  because IT departments configure and remotely manage these solutions as opposed to leaving the
  management to the end user. Centrally-managed solutions allow organizations to modify client
  firewalls to protect against known vulnerabilities and to maintain a consistent security policy for all
  remote users. Some personal firewalls also have VPN capabilities.
 Host-based intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS). A host-based IDPS provides
  complementary security services to personal firewalls. Host-based IDPS software monitors and
  analyzes the internal state of a client device. Some products review logs to ensure that the system and
  applications are not functioning unexpectedly, such as applications inexplicably accessing or altering
  other portions of the system. Some host-based IDPS software products also monitor network
  communications and report or possibly block suspicious activity.
 Antivirus. Antivirus software can assist in preventing the spread of viruses, worms, and other
  malware between networked devices. Client devices that are at risk from known malware threats
  should have antivirus software installed and consistently updated to ensure that the newest updates
  and signatures are loaded on the client device. Organizations should ensure that antivirus software
  installed on client devices is properly configured to automatically receive updates.
 Ad hoc mode. If a client has IEEE 802.11 ad hoc mode enabled, other users may be able to
  inadvertently or maliciously connect to the client device, so the mode should be disabled if unneeded
  and feasible. Some clients do not provide a way to disable ad hoc mode.
 IEEE 802.11 radio management. Management of IEEE 802.11 radios is a simple way to improve
  security. Clients that have no business need for legacy IEEE 802.11 should have their wireless radios
  disabled by default. If feasible, users should disable the radio when not in use. A major risk is a
  client automatically connecting to an insecure or malicious WLAN without the user’s knowledge; this
  risk can be mitigated by configuring clients so that they do not automatically connect to any WLAN

     they detect. In addition, client devices should be configured not to allow the simultaneous use of
     more than one network interface.
 Policy enforcement. Client devices should be configured to comply with implemented WLAN
  policies. Policy enforcement and compliance for client devices takes several forms. Devices can be
  configured according to policy, such as disabling services or altering default configurations. In
  addition, policy-driven software solutions can be implemented on client devices to prevent or allow
  certain actions only when specific parameters are met. This type of software assists in ensuring that
  client devices and users comply with defined policies. For example, policy-based software can
  prevent client devices from having more than one network interface enabled at a time.
In addition to these considerations for client device security, organizations should also ensure that client
devices are logically separated from the organization’s wired networks. This is most commonly done by
installing a firewall between the WLAN and the wired networks to enforce a security policy on the
information flows. For example, such a firewall might permit the client devices to access only certain
hosts or subnets on the wired networks using only particular protocols.

6.3.5    Patches, Upgrades, and Updates

Legacy IEEE 802.11 product vendors correct known software and hardware security vulnerabilities
through patches, upgrades, or firmware updates. Network administrators should regularly check with
vendors to identify new patches, upgrades, or updates and then apply them as needed, following the
organization’s procedures and processes. 29 In addition, many vendors have “security alert” email lists to
advise customers of new vulnerabilities and attacks. Administrators can also check the National
Vulnerability Database (NVD) 30 for a listing of all publicly known vulnerabilities in particular software
or hardware.

6.3.6    Authentication

In general, effective authentication solutions are a reliable way to permit only authorized users to access a
network. Authentication solutions include the use of usernames and passwords, smart cards, biometrics,
PKI, or a combination of solutions (e.g., smart cards with PKI). 31 Authentication mechanisms can be
integrated into a WLAN solution to enhance the security of the system. For example, if a VPN is being
used to provide confidentiality and integrity protection for WLAN communications, the VPN could be
configured to require user authentication.

Appendix B—Glossary of Terms

Selected terms used in the publication are defined below.

Access Point (AP): A device that logically connects wireless client devices operating in infrastructure to
one another and provides access to a distribution system, if connected, which is typically an
organization’s enterprise wired network.

Ad Hoc Network: A wireless network that dynamically connects wireless client devices to each other
without the use of an infrastructure device, such as an access point or a base station.

Flooding: An attack in which an attacker sends large numbers of wireless messages at a high rate to
prevent the wireless network from processing legitimate traffic.

Infrastructure Network: A wireless network that requires the use of an infrastructure device, such as an
access point or a base station, to facilitate communication between client devices.

Jamming: An attack in which a device is used to emit electromagnetic energy on a wireless network’s
frequency to make it unusable.

Media Access Control (MAC): A unique 48-bit value that is assigned to a particular wireless network
interface by the manufacturer.

Range: The maximum possible distance for communicating with a wireless network infrastructure or
wireless client.

Robust Security Network (RSN): A wireless security network that only allows the creation of Robust
Security Network Associations (RSNA).

Robust Security Network Association (RSNA): A logical connection between communicating IEEE
802.11 entities established through the IEEE 802.11i key management scheme, also known as the four-
way handshake.

Service Set Identifier (SSID): A name assigned to a WLAN that allows stations to distinguish one
WLAN from another.

Station (STA): A client device in a wireless network.

Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP): A security protocol, specified in the IEEE 802.11 standard, that is
designed to provide a WLAN with a level of security and privacy comparable to what is usually expected
of a wired LAN. WEP is no longer considered a viable encryption mechanism due to known weaknesses.

Wireless Bridge: A device that links two wired networks, generally operating at two different physical
locations, through wireless communications.

Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN): A group of wireless APs and associated infrastructure within a
limited geographic area, such as an office building or building campus, that is capable of radio
communications. WLANs are usually implemented as extensions of existing wired LANs to provide
enhanced user mobility.
