                                                 Authority

This publication has been developed by NIST to further its statutory responsibilities under the
Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), Public Law (P.L.) 107-347. NIST is
responsible for developing information security standards and guidelines, including minimum
requirements for federal information systems, but such standards and guidelines shall not apply to
national security systems without the express approval of appropriate federal officials exercising
policy authority over such systems. This guideline is consistent with the requirements of the
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Section 8b(3), Securing Agency
Information Systems, as analyzed in Circular A-130, Appendix IV: Analysis of Key Sections.
Supplemental information is provided in Circular A-130, Appendix III, Security of Federal
Automated Information Resources.

Nothing in this publication should be taken to contradict the standards and guidelines made
mandatory and binding on federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory
authority. Nor should these guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing
authorities of the Secretary of Commerce, Director of the OMB, or any other federal official.
This publication may be used by nongovernmental organizations on a voluntary basis and is not
subject to copyright in the United States. Attribution would, however, be appreciated by NIST.

                         Reports on Computer Systems Technology

The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical
leadership for the Nation’s measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops tests, test
methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance the
development and productive use of information technology. ITL’s responsibilities include the
development of management, administrative, technical, and physical standards and guidelines for
the cost-effective security and privacy of other than national security-related information in
federal information systems. The Special Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research,
guidelines, and outreach efforts in information system security, and its collaborative activities
with industry, government, and academic organizations.


                                              Abstract

This publication provides guidelines for applying the Risk Management Framework (RMF) to
federal information systems. The six-step RMF includes security categorization, security control
selection, security control implementation, security control assessment, information system
authorization, and security control monitoring. The RMF promotes the concept of near real-time
risk management and ongoing information system authorization through the implementation of
robust continuous monitoring processes, provides senior leaders the necessary information to
make cost-effective, risk-based decisions with regard to the organizational information systems
supporting their core missions and business functions, and integrates information security into the
enterprise architecture and system development life cycle. Applying the RMF within enterprises
links risk management processes at the information system level to risk management processes at
the organization level through a risk executive (function) and establishes lines of responsibility
and accountability for security controls deployed within organizational information systems and
inherited by those systems (i.e., common controls).

                     Compliance with NIST Standards and Guidelines

In accordance with the provisions of FISMA, 1 the Secretary of Commerce shall, on the basis of
standards and guidelines developed by NIST, prescribe standards and guidelines pertaining to
federal information systems. The Secretary shall make standards compulsory and binding to the
extent determined necessary by the Secretary to improve the efficiency of operation or security of
federal information systems. Standards prescribed shall include information security standards
that provide minimum information security requirements and are otherwise necessary to improve
the security of federal information and information systems.
     •    Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) are approved by the Secretary of
          Commerce and issued by NIST in accordance with FISMA. FIPS are compulsory and
          binding for federal agencies. 2 FISMA requires that federal agencies comply with these
          standards, and therefore, agencies may not waive their use.
     •    Special Publications (SPs) are developed and issued by NIST as recommendations and
          guidance documents. For other than national security programs and systems, federal
          agencies must follow those NIST Special Publications mandated in a Federal Information
          Processing Standard. FIPS 200 mandates the use of Special Publication 800-53, as
          amended. In addition, OMB policies (including OMB Reporting Instructions for FISMA
          and Agency Privacy Management) state that for other than national security programs
          and systems, federal agencies must follow certain specific NIST Special Publications. 3
     •    Other security-related publications, including interagency reports (NISTIRs) and ITL
          Bulletins, provide technical and other information about NIST's activities. These
          publications are mandatory only when specified by OMB.
     •    Compliance schedules for NIST security standards and guidelines are established by
          OMB in policies, directives, or memoranda (e.g., annual FISMA Reporting Guidance).




1
  The E-Government Act (P.L. 107-347) recognizes the importance of information security to the economic and
national security interests of the United States. Title III of the E-Government Act, entitled the Federal Information
Security Management Act (FISMA), emphasizes the need for organizations to develop, document, and implement an
organization-wide program to provide security for the information systems that support its operations and assets.
2
 The term agency is used in this publication in lieu of the more general term organization only in those circumstances
where its usage is directly related to other source documents such as federal legislation or policy.
3
  While federal agencies are required to follow certain specific NIST Special Publications in accordance with OMB
policy, there is flexibility in how agencies apply the guidance. Federal agencies apply the security concepts and
principles articulated in the NIST Special Publications in accordance with and in the context of the agency’s missions,
business functions, and environment of operation. Consequently, the application of NIST guidance by federal agencies
can result in different security solutions that are equally acceptable, compliant with the guidance, and meet the OMB
definition of adequate security for federal information systems. Given the high priority of information sharing and
transparency within the federal government, agencies also consider reciprocity in developing their information security
solutions. When assessing federal agency compliance with NIST Special Publications, Inspectors General, evaluators,
auditors, and assessors consider the intent of the security concepts and principles articulated within the specific
guidance document and how the agency applied the guidance in the context of its mission/business responsibilities,
operational environment, and unique organizational conditions.

                 DEVELOPING COMMON INFORMATION SECURITY FOUNDATIONS
                             COLLABORATION AMONG PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR ENTITIES

    In developing standards and guidelines required by FISMA, NIST consults with other federal
    agencies and the private sector to improve information security, avoid unnecessary and costly
    duplication of effort, and ensure that its publications are complementary with the standards and
    guidelines employed for the protection of national security systems. In addition to a comprehensive
    public review and vetting process, NIST is collaborating with the Office of the Director of National
    Intelligence (ODNI), the Department of Defense (DoD), and the Committee on National Security
    Systems (CNSS) to establish a unified information security framework for the federal government.
    A common foundation for information security will provide the Civil, Defense, and Intelligence
    sectors of the federal government and their contractors, more cost-effective and consistent ways to
    manage information security-related risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other
    organizations, and the Nation. The unified framework will also provide a strong basis for reciprocal
    acceptance of authorization decisions and facilitate information sharing. NIST is also working with

“…Through the process of risk management, leaders must consider risk to US interests from
adversaries using cyberspace to their advantage and from our own efforts to employ the global
nature of cyberspace to achieve objectives in military, intelligence, and business operations… “
 “…For operational plans development, the combination of threats, vulnerabilities, and impacts
must be evaluated in order to identify important trends and decide where effort should be applied
to eliminate or reduce threat capabilities; eliminate or reduce vulnerabilities; and assess,
coordinate, and deconflict all cyberspace operations…”
“…Leaders at all levels are accountable for ensuring readiness and security to the same degree
as in any other domain…"

                               the system. One approach is to categorize each identified subsystem (including
                               dynamic subsystems). Separately categorizing each subsystem does not change
                               the overall categorization of the information system. Rather, it allows the
                               constituent subsystems to receive a separate allocation of security controls from
 06-05-2014      Editorial     NIST Special Publication 800-53 instead of deploying higher-impact controls across          21
                               every subsystem. Another approach is to bundle smaller subsystems into larger
                               subsystems within the information system, categorize each of the aggregated
                               subsystems, and allocate security controls to the subsystems, as appropriate.
                               Security categorization information is documented in the system identification

                               Deleted “The security control selection process includes, as appropriate: (i)
                               choosing a set of baseline security controls; (ii) tailoring the baseline security

                               Added “After selecting the applicable security control baseline, organizations apply
                               the tailoring process to align the controls more closely with the specific conditions
                               within the organization (i.e., conditions related to organizational risk tolerance,
                               missions/business functions, information systems, or environments of operation).
                               The tailoring process includes: (i) identifying and designating common controls in
                               initial security control baselines; (ii) applying scoping considerations to the
                               remaining baseline security controls; (iii) selecting compensating security controls,
                               if needed; (iv) assigning specific values to organization-defined security control
                               parameters via explicit assignment and selection statements; (v) supplementing
                               baselines with additional security controls and control enhancements, if needed;
 06-05-2014      Substantive   and (vi) providing additional specification information for control implementation, if   25
                               needed. Organizations use risk assessments to inform and guide the tailoring
                               process for organizational information systems and environments of operation.
                               Threat data from risk assessments provide critical information on adversary
                               capabilities, intent, and targeting that may affect organizational decisions regarding
                               the selection of additional security controls, including the associated costs and
                               benefits. Risk assessment results are also leveraged when identifying common
                               controls to help determine if such controls available for inheritance meet the
                               security requirements for the system and its environment of operation (including
                               analyses for potential single points of failure).” to Task 2-2, Supplemental

                               Added “After risk determination, organizations can respond to risk in a variety of
                               ways, including: (i) accepting risk; (ii) avoiding risk; (iii) mitigating risk; (iv) sharing
                               risk; (v) transferring risk; or (vi) a combination of the above. Decisions on the most
                               appropriate course of action for risk response include some form of prioritization.
                               Some risks may be of greater concern than other risks. In that case, more
                               resources may need to be directed at addressing higher-priority risks than at other
 06-05-2014      Substantive   lower-priority risks. This does not necessarily mean that the lower-priority risks are         35
                               ignored. Rather, it could mean that fewer resources are directed at the lower-
                               priority risks (at least initially), or that the lower-priority risks are addressed at a
                               later time. A key part of the risk decision process is the recognition that regardless
                               of the risk decision, there typically remains a degree of residual risk. Organizations
                               determine acceptable degrees of residual risk based on organizational risk
                               tolerance.” to Task 5-3, Supplemental Guidance, paragraph 1.

 06-05-2014      Editorial     organizational policies which may establish maximum authorization periods.” to                 36

CHAPTER ONE

INTRODUCTION
THE NEED FOR INFORMATION SECURITY AND MANAGING RISK

         rganizations 4 depend on information technology and the information systems 5 that are

O        developed from that technology to successfully carry out their missions and business
         functions. Information systems can include as constituent components, a range of diverse
computing platforms from high-end supercomputers to personal digital assistants and cellular
telephones. Information systems can also include very specialized systems and devices (e.g.,
telecommunications systems, industrial/process control systems, testing and calibration devices,
weapons systems, command and control systems, and environmental control systems). Federal
information and information systems 6 are subject to serious threats that can have adverse impacts
on organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, and reputation), organizational
assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation 7 by compromising the confidentiality,
integrity, or availability of information being processed, stored, or transmitted by those systems.
Threats to information and information systems include environmental disruptions, human or
machine errors, and purposeful attacks. Cyber attacks on information systems today are often
aggressive, disciplined, well-organized, well-funded, and in a growing number of documented
cases, very sophisticated. Successful attacks on public and private sector information systems can
result in serious or grave damage to the national and economic security interests of the United
States. Given the significant and growing danger of these threats, it is imperative that leaders at
all levels of an organization understand their responsibilities for achieving adequate information
security and for managing information system-related security risks. 8

1.1 BACKGROUND
NIST in partnership with the Department of Defense (DoD), the Office of the Director of
National Intelligence (ODNI), and the Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS), has
developed a common information security framework for the federal government and its
contractors. The intent of this common framework is to improve information security, strengthen
risk management processes, and encourage reciprocity among federal agencies. This publication,
developed by the Joint Task Force Transformation Initiative Working Group, transforms the
traditional Certification and Accreditation (C&A) process into the six-step Risk Management
Framework (RMF). The revised process emphasizes: (i) building information security capabilities
into federal information systems through the application of state-of-the-practice management,
operational, and technical security controls; (ii) maintaining awareness of the security state of
information systems on an ongoing basis though enhanced monitoring processes; and (iii)

4
 The term organization is used in this publication to describe an entity of any size, complexity, or positioning within
an organizational structure (e.g., a federal agency or, as appropriate, any of its operational elements).
5
  An information system is a discrete set of information resources organized for the collection, processing, maintenance,
use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of information.
6
 A federal information system is an information system used or operated by an executive agency, by a contractor of an
executive agency, or by another organization on behalf of an executive agency.
7
  Adverse impacts to the Nation include, for example, compromises to information systems that support critical
infrastructure applications or are paramount to government continuity of operations as defined by the Department of
Homeland Security.
8
  Risk is a measure of the extent to which an entity is threatened by a potential circumstance or event, and a function of:
(i) the adverse impacts that would arise if the circumstance or event occurs; and (ii) the likelihood of occurrence.



CHAPTER 1                                                                                                           PAGE 1

providing essential information to senior leaders to facilitate decisions regarding the acceptance
of risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation
arising from the operation and use of information systems.

The RMF has the following characteristics:
•    Promotes the concept of near real-time risk management and ongoing information system
     authorization through the implementation of robust continuous monitoring processes;
•    Encourages the use of automation to provide senior leaders the necessary information to
     make cost-effective, risk-based decisions with regard to the organizational information
     systems supporting their core missions and business functions;
•    Integrates information security into the enterprise architecture and system development life
     cycle;
•    Provides emphasis on the selection, implementation, assessment, and monitoring of security
     controls, and the authorization of information systems;
•    Links risk management processes at the information system level to risk management
     processes at the organization level through a risk executive (function); and
•    Establishes responsibility and accountability for security controls deployed within
     organizational information systems and inherited by those systems (i.e., common controls).

The risk management process described in this publication changes the traditional focus of C&A
as a static, procedural activity to a more dynamic approach that provides the capability to more
effectively manage information system-related security risks in highly diverse environments of
complex and sophisticated cyber threats, ever-increasing system vulnerabilities, and rapidly
changing missions.

1.2 PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY
The purpose of this publication is to provide guidelines for applying the Risk Management
Framework to federal information systems to include conducting the activities of security
categorization, 9 security control selection and implementation, security control assessment,
information system authorization, 10 and security control monitoring. The guidelines have been
developed:
•    To ensure that managing information system-related security risks is consistent with the
     organization’s mission/business objectives and overall risk strategy established by the senior
     leadership through the risk executive (function);
•    To ensure that information security requirements, including necessary security controls, are
     integrated into the organization’s enterprise architecture and system development life cycle
     processes;




9
  FIPS 199 provides security categorization guidance for nonnational security systems. CNSS Instruction 1253 provides
similar guidance for national security systems.
10
   Security authorization is the official management decision given by a senior organizational official to authorize
operation of an information system and to explicitly accept the risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals,
other organizations, and the Nation based on the implementation of an agreed-upon set of security controls.

•    To support consistent, well-informed, and ongoing security authorization decisions (through
     continuous monitoring), transparency of security and risk management-related information,
     and reciprocity; 11 and
•    To achieve more secure information and information systems within the federal government
     through the implementation of appropriate risk mitigation strategies.

This publication satisfies the requirements of the Federal Information Security Management Act
(FISMA) and meets or exceeds the information security requirements established for executive
agencies 12 by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in Circular A-130, Appendix III,
Security of Federal Automated Information Resources. The guidelines in this publication are
applicable to all federal information systems other than those systems designated as national
security systems as defined in 44 U.S.C., Section 3542. The guidelines have been broadly
developed from a technical perspective to complement similar guidelines for national security
systems and may be used for such systems with the approval of appropriate federal officials
exercising policy authority over such systems. State, local, and tribal governments, as well as
private sector organizations are encouraged to consider using these guidelines, as appropriate.13

1.3 TARGET AUDIENCE
This publication serves individuals associated with the design, development, implementation,
operation, maintenance, and disposition of federal information systems including:
•    Individuals with mission/business ownership responsibilities or fiduciary responsibilities
     (e.g., heads of federal agencies, chief executive officers, chief financial officers);
•    Individuals with information system development and integration responsibilities (e.g.,
     program managers, information technology product developers, information system
     developers, information systems integrators, enterprise architects, information security
     architects);
•    Individuals with information system and/or security management/oversight responsibilities
     (e.g., senior leaders, risk executives, authorizing officials, chief information officers, senior
     information security officers 14);


11
  Reciprocity is the mutual agreement among participating organizations to accept each other’s security assessments in
order to reuse information system resources and/or to accept each other’s assessed security posture in order to share
information. Reciprocity is best achieved by promoting the concept of transparency (i.e., making sufficient evidence
regarding the security state of an information system available, so that an authorizing official from another organization
can use that evidence to make credible, risk-based decisions regarding the operation and use of that system or the
information it processes, stores, or transmits).
12
   An executive agency is: (i) an executive department specified in 5 U.S.C., Section 101; (ii) a military department
specified in 5 U.S.C., Section 102; (iii) an independent establishment as defined in 5 U.S.C., Section 104(1); and (iv) a
wholly owned government corporation fully subject to the provisions of 31 U.S.C., Chapter 91. In this publication, the
term executive agency is synonymous with the term federal agency.
13
   In accordance with the provisions of FISMA and OMB policy, whenever the interconnection of federal information
systems to information systems operated by state/local/tribal governments, contractors, or grantees involves the
processing, storage, or transmission of federal information, the information security standards and guidelines described
in this publication apply. Specific information security requirements and the terms and conditions of the system
interconnections, are expressed in the Memorandums of Understanding and Interconnection Security Agreements
established by participating organizations.
14
   At the agency level, this position is known as the Senior Agency Information Security Officer. Organizations also
refer to this position as the Chief Information Security Officer.

CHAPTER TWO

THE FUNDAMENTALS
MANAGING INFORMATION SYSTEM-RELATED SECURITY RISKS




T      his chapter describes the basic concepts associated with managing information system-
       related security risks. These concepts include: (i) incorporating risk management principles
       and best practices into organization-wide strategic planning considerations, core missions
and business processes, and supporting organizational information systems; (ii) integrating
information security requirements into system development life cycle processes; (iii) establishing
practical and meaningful boundaries for organizational information systems; and (iv) allocating
security controls to organizational information systems as system-specific, hybrid, or common
controls.

2.1 INTEGRATED ORGANIZATION-WIDE RISK MANAGEMENT
Managing information system-related security risks is a complex, multifaceted undertaking that
requires the involvement of the entire organization—from senior leaders providing the strategic
vision and top-level goals and objectives for the organization, to mid-level leaders planning and
managing projects, to individuals on the front lines developing, implementing, and operating the
systems supporting the organization’s core missions and business processes. Risk management
can be viewed as a holistic activity that is fully integrated into every aspect of the organization.
Figure 2-1 illustrates a three-tiered approach to risk management that addresses risk-related
concerns at: (i) the organization level; (ii) the mission and business process level; and (iii) the
information system level. 15

________________________________________________________________________________________________

Tier 1 addresses risk from an organizational perspective with the development of a comprehensive
governance structure and organization-wide risk management strategy that includes: (i) the
techniques and methodologies the organization plans to employ to assess information system-
related security risks and other types of risk of concern to the organization; 16 (ii) the methods and
procedures the organization plans to use to evaluate the significance of the risks identified during
the risk assessment; (iii) the types and extent of risk mitigation measures the organization plans to
employ to address identified risks; (iv) the level of risk the organization plans to accept (i.e., risk
tolerance); (v) how the organization plans to monitor risk on an ongoing basis given the
inevitable changes to organizational information systems and their environments of operation;
and (vi) the degree and type of oversight the organization plans to use to ensure that the risk
management strategy is being effectively carried out. As part of the overall governance structure
established by the organization, the risk management strategy is propagated to organizational
officials and contractors with programmatic, planning, developmental, acquisition, operational,
and oversight responsibilities, including for example: (i) authorizing officials; (ii) chief
information officers; (iii) senior information security officers; (iv) enterprise/information security
architects; (v) information system owners/program managers; (vi) information owners/stewards;
(vii) information system security officers; (viii) information system security engineers; (ix)
information system developers and integrators; (x) system administrators; (xi) contracting
officers; and (xii) users.

Tier 2 addresses risk from a mission and business process perspective and is guided by the risk
decisions at Tier 1. Tier 2 activities are closely associated with enterprise architecture 17 and include:
(i) defining the core missions and business processes for the organization (including any
derivative or related missions and business processes carried out by subordinate organizations);
(ii) prioritizing missions and business processes with respect to the goals and objectives of the
organization; (iii) defining the types of information that the organization needs to successfully
execute the stated missions and business processes and the information flows both internal and
external to the organization; (iv) developing an organization-wide information protection strategy
and incorporating high-level information security requirements 18 into the core missions and
business processes; and (v) specifying the degree of autonomy for subordinate organizations (i.e.,
organizations within the parent organization) that the parent organization permits for assessing,
evaluating, mitigating, accepting, and monitoring risk.

Because subordinate organizations responsible for carrying out derivative or related missions and
business processes may have already invested in their own methods of assessing, evaluating,
mitigating, accepting and monitoring risk, parent organizations may allow a greater degree of
autonomy within parts of the organization or across the entire organization in order to minimize
costs. When a diversity of risk assessment methods is allowed, organizations may choose to
employ when feasible, some means of translation and/or synthesis of the risk-related information
to ensure that the output of the different risk assessment activities can be correlated in a
meaningful manner.

   Types of risk include, for example: (i) program/acquisition risk (cost, schedule, performance); (ii) compliance and
regulatory risk; (iii) financial risk; (iv) legal risk; (v) operational (mission/business) risk; (vi) political risk; (vii) project
risk; (viii) reputational risk; (ix) safety risk; (x) strategic planning risk; and (xi) supply chain risk.

Tier 3 addresses risk from an information system perspective and is guided by the risk decisions at
Tiers 1 and 2. Risk decisions at Tiers 1 and 2 impact the ultimate selection and deployment of
needed safeguards and countermeasures (i.e., security controls) at the information system level.
Information security requirements are satisfied by the selection of appropriate management,
operational, and technical security controls from NIST Special Publication 800-53. 19 The security
controls are subsequently allocated to the various components of the information system as
system-specific, hybrid, or common controls in accordance with the information security
architecture developed by the organization. 20 Security controls are typically traceable to the
security requirements established by the organization to ensure that the requirements are fully
addressed during design, development, and implementation of the information system. Security
controls can be provided by the organization or by an external provider. Relationships with
external providers are established in a variety of ways, for example, through joint ventures,
business partnerships, outsourcing arrangements (i.e., through contracts, interagency agreements,
lines of business arrangements), licensing agreements, and/or supply chain arrangements. 21

Risk management tasks begin early in the system development life cycle and are important in
shaping the security capabilities of the information system. If these tasks are not adequately
performed during the initiation, development, and acquisition phases of the system development
life cycle, the tasks will, by necessity, be undertaken later in the life cycle and be more costly to
implement. In either situation, all tasks are completed prior to placing the information system into
operation or continuing its operation to ensure that: (i) information system-related security risks
are being adequately addressed on an ongoing basis; and (ii) the authorizing official explicitly
understands and accepts the risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other
organizations, and the Nation based on the implementation of a defined set of security controls
and the current security state of the information system.

The Risk Management Framework (RMF), illustrated in Figure 2-2, provides a disciplined and
structured process that integrates information security and risk management activities into the
system development life cycle. The RMF operates primarily at Tier 3 in the risk management
hierarchy but can also have interactions at Tiers 1 and 2 (e.g., providing feedback from ongoing
authorization decisions to the risk executive [function], dissemination of updated threat and risk
information to authorizing officials and information system owners). The RMF steps include:
•    Categorize the information system and the information processed, stored, and transmitted by
     that system based on an impact analysis. 22
•    Select an initial set of baseline security controls for the information system based on the
     security categorization; tailoring and supplementing the security control baseline as needed
     based on an organizational assessment of risk and local conditions. 23


19
  The RMF categorization step, including consideration of legislation, policies, directives, regulations, standards, and
organizational mission/business/operational requirements, facilitates the identification of security requirements.
20
   The allocation of security controls can take place at all three tiers in the risk management hierarchy. For example,
security controls that are identified as common controls may be allocated at the organization, mission/business process,
or information system level. See Section 2.4 for additional information on security control allocation.

In summary, there is a significant degree of flexibility in how organizations employ the risk
management processes described above. While it is convenient to portray the risk management
approach in Figure 2-1 as hierarchical, the reality of project and organization dynamics can be
much more complex. The organizational management style may be at one or more points on the
continuum from top-down command to consensus among peers. For risk management to succeed

at all levels of the organization, the organization must have a consistent and effective approach to
risk management that is applied to all risk management processes and procedures. Organizational
officials identify the resources necessary to complete the risk management tasks described in this
publication and ensure that those resources are made available to appropriate personnel. Resource
allocation includes both funding to carry out the risk management tasks and assigning qualified
personnel needed to accomplish the tasks. 24

2.2 SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE
All federal information systems, including operational systems, systems under development, and
systems undergoing modification or upgrade, are in some phase of a system development life
cycle. 25 Requirements definition is a critical part of any system development process and begins
very early in the life cycle, typically in the initiation phase. 26 Security requirements are a subset
of the overall functional and nonfunctional (e.g., quality, assurance) requirements levied on an
information system and are incorporated into the system development life cycle simultaneously
with the functional and nonfunctional requirements. Without the early integration of security
requirements, significant expense may be incurred by the organization later in the life cycle to
address security considerations that could have been included in the initial design. When security
requirements are considered as an integral subset of other information system requirements, the
resulting system has fewer weaknesses and deficiencies, and therefore, fewer vulnerabilities that
can be exploited in the future.

Early integration of information security requirements into the system development life cycle is
the most cost-effective and efficient method for an organization to ensure that its protection
strategy is implemented. It also ensures that information security processes are not isolated from
the other routine management processes employed by the organization to develop, implement,
operate, and maintain information systems supporting ongoing missions and business functions.
In addition to incorporating information security requirements into the system development life
cycle, security requirements are also integrated into the program, planning, and budgeting
activities within the organization to ensure that resources are available when needed and
program/project milestones are completed. The enterprise architecture provides a central record
of this integration within an organization.

Ensuring that information security requirements are integrated into the organization’s system
development life cycle processes regardless of the type of life cycle processes employed, helps
facilitate development and implementation of more resilient information systems to reduce risk to
organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. This can be
accomplished using the well-established concept of integrated project teams. 27 A responsible
organizational official (e.g., agency head, mission or business owner, integrated project team
leader, program manager, information system owner, authorizing official) ensures that security
professionals are an integral part of any information system development activities from the
initial definition of information security requirements at Tier 1 and Tier 2 to the selection of

24
  Resource requirements include funding for training organizational personnel to ensure that they can effectively carry
out their assigned responsibilities.
25
  There are typically five phases in a generic system development life cycle including: (i) initiation; (ii) development/
acquisition; (iii) implementation; (iv) operation/maintenance; and (v) disposal.
26
   Organizations may employ a variety of system development life cycle processes including, for example, waterfall,
spiral, or agile development.
27
  Integrated project teams are multidisciplinary entities consisting of a number of individuals with a range of skills and
roles to help facilitate the development of information systems that meet the requirements of the organization.

security controls at Tier 3. Such consideration is used to foster close cooperation among personnel
responsible for the design, development, implementation, operation, maintenance, and disposition
of information systems and the information security professionals advising the senior leadership
on appropriate security controls needed to adequately mitigate risk and protect critical missions
and business functions.

Finally, organizations maximize the use of security-relevant information (e.g., assessment results,
information system documentation, and other artifacts) generated during the system development
life cycle to satisfy requirements for similar information needed for information security-related
purposes. Similar security-relevant information concerning common controls, including security
controls provided by external providers, is factored into the organization’s risk management
process. The judicious reuse of security-relevant information by organizations is an effective
method to help eliminate duplication of effort, reduce documentation, promote reciprocity, and
avoid unnecessary costs that may result when security activities are conducted independently of
system development life cycle processes. In addition, reuse promotes greater consistency of
information used in the design, development, implementation, operation, maintenance, and
disposition of an information system including security-related considerations.

2.3 INFORMATION SYSTEM BOUNDARIES
One of the most challenging problems for information system owners, authorizing officials, chief
information officers, senior information security officers, and information security architects is
identifying appropriate boundaries for organizational information systems. 28 Well-defined
boundaries establish the scope of protection for organizational information systems (i.e., what the
organization agrees to protect under its direct management control or within the scope of its
responsibilities) and include the people, processes, and information technologies that are part of
the systems supporting the organization’s missions and business processes. Information system
boundaries are established in coordination with the security categorization process and before the
development of security plans. Information system boundaries that are too expansive (i.e., too
many system components and/or unnecessary architectural complexity) make the risk
management process extremely unwieldy and complex. Boundaries that are too limited increase
the number of information systems that must be separately managed and as a consequence,
unnecessarily inflate the total information security costs for the organization. The following
sections provide general guidelines to assist organizations in establishing appropriate system
boundaries to achieve cost-effective solutions for managing information security-related risks
from the operation and use of information systems.

2.3.1 Establishing Information System Boundaries
The set of information resources 29 allocated to an information system defines the boundary for
that system. Organizations have significant flexibility in determining what constitutes an
information system and its associated boundary. If a set of information resources is identified as
an information system, the resources are generally under the same direct management control.30
Direct management control does not necessarily imply that there is no intervening management.

28
   With regard to the risk management process and information security, the term information system boundary is
synonymous with authorization boundary.
29
  Information resources consist of information and related resources including personnel, equipment, funds, and
information technology.
30
   For information systems, direct management control involves budgetary, programmatic, or operational authority and
associated responsibility and accountability.



CHAPTER 2                                                                                                     PAGE 10

________________________________________________________________________________________________

It is also possible for multiple information systems to be considered as independent subsystems 31
of a more complex information system. This situation may arise in many organizations when
smaller information systems are coalesced for purposes of risk management into a larger, more
comprehensive system. On a larger scale, an organization may develop a system of systems
involving multiple independent information systems (possibly distributed across a widespread
geographic area) supporting a set of common missions and/or business functions. 32
In addition to consideration of direct management control, it may also be helpful for
organizations to determine if the information resources being identified as an information system:
•      Support the same mission/business objectives or functions and essentially the same operating
       characteristics and information security requirements; and
•      Reside in the same general operating environment (or in the case of a distributed information
       system, reside in various locations with similar operating environments). 33

Since commonality can change over time, this determination is revisited periodically as part of a
continuous monitoring process carried out by the organization (see Section 3.6). While the above
considerations may be useful to organizations in determining information system boundaries for
purposes of risk management, they are not viewed as limiting the organization’s flexibility in
establishing commonsense boundaries that promote effective information security within the
available resources of the organization. Information system owners consult with authorizing
officials, chief information officers, senior information security officers, information security
architects, and the risk executive (function) 34 when establishing or changing system boundaries.
The process of establishing information system boundaries and the associated risk management
implications is an organization-wide activity that includes careful negotiation among all key
participants—taking into account mission and business requirements, technical considerations
with respect to information security, and programmatic costs to the organization.

Software applications (e.g., database applications, Web applications) hosted by an information
system are included in the risk management process since application security is critical to the
overall security of the system. 35 Software applications depend on the resources provided by the
hosting information system and as such, can take advantage of (i.e., leverage) the security
controls provided by the system to help provide a foundational level of protection for the hosted
applications, when this type of inheritance is applicable. Additional application-level security
controls are provided by the respective software applications, as needed. Organizations ensure
that all security controls, including application-level controls employed in separate software
applications, are managed and tracked on an ongoing basis. Application owners coordinate with
information system owners to ensure that information security and risk management activities are
carried out as seamlessly as possible among applications and hosting systems. This coordination
includes, for example, consideration for: (i) the selection, implementation, assessment, and
monitoring of security controls for hosted applications; (ii) the effects of changes to hosted
applications on the overall security state of the information system and the missions and business

processes supported by that system; and (iii) the effects of changes to the information system on
hosted applications. Employing strong configuration management and control processes within
software applications and the hosting information system, and reusing security control assessment
results helps to provide the necessary protection for applications.

Security controls provided by the hosted software application are documented in the security plan
for the hosting information system and assessed for effectiveness during the risk management
process (i.e., during the initial authorization of the information system and subsequently, during
the continuous monitoring process). Application-level security controls are also assessed for
effectiveness if the applications are added after the hosting information system is authorized to
operate. Information system owners take appropriate measures to ensure that hosted applications
do not affect the security state of the hosting system and obtain the necessary information from
application owners to conduct security impact analyses, when needed.

2.3.2 Boundaries for Complex Information Systems
The application of security controls within a complex information system can present significant
challenges to an organization. From a centralized development, implementation, and operations
perspective, the information system owner, in collaboration with the authorizing official, senior
information security officer, information security architect, and information system security
engineer, examines the purpose of the information system and considers the feasibility of
decomposing the complex system into more manageable subsystems. From a distributed
development, implementation, and operations perspective, the organization recognizes that
multiple entities, possibly operating under different policies, may be contributing to the
development, implementation, and/or operations of the subsystems that compose the complex
information system. In such a scenario, the organization is responsible for ensuring that these
separate subsystems can work together in both a secure and functional manner. Treating an
information system as multiple subsystems, each with its own subsystem boundary, facilitates a
more targeted application of security controls to achieve adequate security and a more cost-
effective risk management process. Knowledge of the security properties of individual
subsystems does not necessarily provide the complete knowledge of the security properties of the
complex information system. The organization applies best practices in systems and security
engineering and documents the decomposition of the information system in the security plan.

Information security architecture plays a key part in the security control selection and allocation
process for a complex information system. This includes monitoring and controlling
communications at key internal boundaries among subsystems and providing system-wide
common controls (see Section 2.4) that meet or exceed the requirements of the constituent
subsystems inheriting those system-wide common controls. One approach to security control
selection and allocation is to categorize each identified subsystem (including dynamic subsystems
as described in Section 2.3.3). Separately categorizing each subsystem does not change the
overall categorization of the information system. Rather, it allows the subsystems to receive a
separate and more targeted allocation of security controls from NIST Special Publication 800-53
instead of deploying higher-impact controls across every subsystem. Another approach is to
bundle smaller subsystems into larger subsystems within the overall complex information system,
categorize each of the aggregated subsystems, and allocate security controls to the subsystems, as
needed. While subsystems within complex information systems may exist as complete systems,
the subsystems are, in most cases, not treated as independent entities because they are typically
interdependent and interconnected.

________________________________________________________________________________________________

When the results of security categorizations for the identified subsystems are different, the
organization carefully examines the interfaces, information flows, and security-relevant
dependencies 36 among subsystems and selects security controls for the interconnection of the
subsystems to eliminate or reduce potential vulnerabilities in this area. This helps to ensure that
the information system is adequately protected. 37 Security controls for the interconnection of
subsystems are also employed when the subsystems implement different security policies or are
administered by different authorities. The extent to which the security controls are implemented
correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the
security requirements for the complex information system, can be determined by combining
security control assessments at the subsystem level and adding system-level considerations
addressing interface issues among subsystems. This approach facilitates a more targeted and cost-
effective risk management process by scaling the level of effort of the assessment in accordance
with the subsystem security categorization and allowing for reuse of assessment results at the
information system level. Figure 2-3 illustrates the concept of decomposition for a complex
information system.

                      FIGURE 2-3: DECOMPOSITION OF COMPLEX INFORMATION SYSTEM

In the above example, an information system contains a system guard that monitors the flow of
information between two local area networks. The information system can be partitioned into
multiple subsystems: (i) local area network one; (ii) local area network two; (iii) the system guard
separating the two networks; and (iv) several dynamic subsystems that become part of the system
at various points in time (see Section 2.3.3). Each subsystem within the information system may
be categorized individually. The security categorization of the information system as a whole is
not changed by taking into consideration all of the individual subsystem categorizations. When all

36
  Subsystem interfaces include ports and protocols. Information flows address information transmitted between
subsystems. Security-relevant dependencies refer to security functions/services (e.g., encryption, auditing), performed
by one subsystem that are required by one or more of the other subsystems.
37
   The types of interfaces and couplings among subsystems may introduce inadvertent weaknesses and vulnerabilities
in a complex information system. For example, if a large organizational intranet is decomposed by enterprise services
into smaller subsystems (e.g., severable subsystems such as local area network segments) and subsequently categorized
individually, the specific protections at the subsystem level may allow a vector of attack against the intranet by
erroneously selecting and implementing security controls that are not sufficiently strong with respect to the rest of the
system. To avoid this situation, organizations carefully examine the interfaces among subsystems and take appropriate
actions to eliminate potential vulnerabilities in this area, thus helping to ensure that the information system is
adequately protected.

subsystems within the complex information system have completed an initial security control
assessment, the organization takes additional measures to ensure that: (i) security controls not
included in the subsystem assessments are assessed for effectiveness; and (ii) the subsystems
work together in a manner that meets the security requirements of the information system. 38

2.3.3 Changing Technologies and the Effect on Information System Boundaries
Changes to current information technologies and computing paradigms add complications to the
traditional tasks of establishing information system boundaries and protecting the missions and
business processes supported by organizational information systems. In particular, net-centric
architectures 39 (e.g., service-oriented architectures [SOAs], cloud computing) introduce two
important concepts: (i) dynamic subsystems; and (ii) external subsystems. While the concepts of
dynamic subsystems and external subsystems (described in the following sections) are not new,
the pervasiveness and frequency of their invocation in net-centric architectures can present
organizations with significant new challenges.

Dynamic Subsystems
For many information systems, the determination of subsystems is established at system initiation
and maintained throughout the life cycle of the system. However, there are some instances, most
notably in net-centric architectures, where the subsystems that compose the system may not be
present at all stages of the life cycle. Some subsystems may not become part of an information
system until sometime after system initiation, while other subsystems may leave the system
sometime prior to system termination. Generally, this will not impact the external boundary of the
information system if the dynamic subsystems are in the system design and the appropriate
security controls are reflected in the security plan. But it does impact the subsystems that exist
within the boundary at any given point in time.

Dynamic subsystems that become part of an organizational information system at various points
in time may or may not be under the direct control of the organization. These subsystems may be
provided by external providers (e.g., through contracts, interagency agreements, lines of business
arrangements, licensing agreements, and/or supply chain arrangements). Regardless of whether
the subsystem is or is not controlled by the organization, the expectations of its capabilities have
to be considered. The dynamic inclusion or exclusion of the subsystems may or may not require
reassessment of the information system as a whole. This is determined based on constraints and
assumptions (e.g., functions the subsystems perform, connections to other subsystems and other
information systems) imposed upon the subsystems at system design and incorporated in the
security plan. So long as the subsystems conform to the identified constraints and assumptions,
they can be dynamically added or removed from the information system without requiring
reassessments of the entire system.




38
   The organization can: (i) issue a single authorization for the entire complex information system (to include bundling
assessment results from individual subsystem assessments and any additional assessment results at the system level); or
(ii) implement a strategy for managing the risk associated with connecting separately authorized information systems
when viewed as a system of systems.
39
   A net-centric architecture is a complex system of systems comprised of subsystems and services that are part of a
continuously evolving, complex community of people, devices, information, and services interconnected by a network
that enhances information sharing and collaboration. A service-oriented architecture (SOA) is an example of a net-
centric architecture.



CHAPTER 2                                                                                                       PAGE 14

________________________________________________________________________________________________

As noted above, the assumptions and constraints on the dynamic subsystems are reflected in the
information system design and the security plan. The determination as to whether the subsystems
conform to the assumptions and constraints is addressed during the continuous monitoring phase
of the risk management process. Depending upon the nature of the subsystems (including the
functions, connections, and relative trust relationships established with the subsystem providers),
the determination of conformance may be performed in a manual or automated manner, and may
occur prior to, or during the subsystem connecting/disconnecting to the information system.

External Subsystems
Another characteristic often apparent in net-centric architectures is that some of the subsystems
(or components of subsystems) 40 are outside of the direct control of the organization that owns the
information system and authorizes its operation. The nature of such external subsystems can vary
from organizations employing external cloud computing services to process, store, and transmit
information to organizations allowing platforms under their control to host applications/services
developed by some external entity.

As noted in Appendix I (Security Controls in External Environments), FISMA and OMB policy
require external providers handling federal information or operating information systems on
behalf of the federal government to meet the same security requirements as federal agencies.
These security requirements also apply to external subsystems storing, processing, or transmitting
federal information and any services provided by or associated with the subsystem. Appendix I
further notes that the assurance or confidence that the risk from using external services is at an
acceptable level depends on the trust that the organization places in the external service provider.
In some cases, the level of trust is based on the amount of direct control the organization is able to
exert on the external service provider with regard to employment of security controls necessary
for the protection of the service and the evidence brought forth as to the effectiveness of those
controls. In other instances, trust may be based on other factors, such as the experience the
organization has with the external service provider, and the confidence (trust) the organization
has in the provider taking the correct actions. There are a variety of factors that can complicate
the level of trust issue in the case of net-centric architectures to include:
•      The delineation between what is owned by the external entity and the organization may be
       somewhat blurred (e.g., organization-owned platform executing external entity-developed
       service/application software or firmware);
•      The degree of control the organization has over the external entity providing/supporting the
       subsystems/services may be very limited;
•      The nature and content of the subsystems may be subject to rapid change; and
•      The subsystems/services may be of such critical nature that they need to be incorporated into
       organizational information systems very rapidly.

The consequence of the factors above is that some of the more traditional means of verifying the
correct functioning of a subsystem and the effectiveness of security controls (e.g., clearly defined
requirements, design analysis, testing and evaluation before deployment) may not be feasible for
a net-centric subsystem/service. As a result, organizations may be left to depend upon the nature
of the trust relationships with the suppliers of the net-centric subsystems/services as the basis for
determining whether or not to allow/include the subsystems/services (e.g., use of GSA list of
approved providers). Alternatively, organizations may allow such subsystems/services to be used

40
     In this context, the term subsystem includes the services provided by or associated with that subsystem.

only in those instances where they have constrained the nature of information or process flow
such that the organization believes that any potential adverse impact is manageable. Ultimately,
when the level of trust in the external provider of subsystems/services is below expectations, the
organization: (i) employs compensating controls; (ii) accepts a greater degree of risk; or (iii) does
not obtain the service (i.e., performs its core missions and business operations with reduced levels
of functionality or possibly no functionality at all).

2.4 SECURITY CONTROL ALLOCATION
There are three types of security controls for information systems that can be employed by an
organization: (i) system-specific controls (i.e., controls that provide a security capability for a
particular information system only); (ii) common controls (i.e., controls that provide a security
capability for multiple information systems); or (iii) hybrid controls (i.e., controls that have both
system-specific and common characteristics). 41 The organization allocates security controls to an
information system consistent with the organization’s enterprise architecture and information
security architecture. 42 This activity is carried out as an organization-wide activity involving
authorizing officials, information system owners, chief information security officer, senior
information security officer, enterprise architect, information security architect, information
system security officers, common control providers, and risk executive (function).

As part of the information security architecture, organizations are encouraged to identify and
implement security controls that can support multiple information systems efficiently and
effectively as a common capability (i.e., common controls). When these controls are used to
support a specific information system, they are referenced by that specific system as inherited
controls. Common controls promote more cost-effective and consistent information security
across the organization and can also simplify risk management activities. By allocating security
controls to an information system as system-specific controls, hybrid controls, or common
controls, the organization assigns responsibility and accountability to specific organizational
entities for the overall development, implementation, assessment, authorization, and monitoring
of those controls.

The organization has significant flexibility in deciding which families of security controls or
specific controls from selected families in NIST Special Publication 800-53 are appropriate for
the different types of allocations. Since the security control allocation process involves the
assignment and provision of security capabilities derived from security controls, the organization
ensures that there is effective communication among all entities either receiving or providing
such capabilities. This communication includes, for example, ensuring that common control
authorization results and continuous monitoring information are readily available to those
organizational entities inheriting common controls, and that any changes to common controls are
effectively communicated to those affected by such changes. 43


41
     NIST Special Publication 800-53 provides additional guidance on security controls for information systems.
42
  Allocation is a term used to describe the process an organization employs: (i) to determine whether security controls
are defined as system-specific, hybrid, or common; and (ii) to assign security controls to specific information system
components responsible for providing a particular security capability (e.g., router, server, remote sensor).
43
   Communication regarding the security status of common (inherited) controls is essential irrespective of whether the
common control provider is internal or external to the organization. Appendix I provides guidance for organizations
relying on security controls in external environments including the types of contractual agreements and arrangements
that are necessary to ensure appropriate security-relevant information is conveyed to the organization from external
providers.

CHAPTER THREE

THE PROCESS
EXECUTING THE RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK TASKS




T
       his chapter describes the process of applying the Risk Management Framework (RMF) to
       federal information systems. 44 The process includes a set of well-defined risk-related tasks
       that are to be carried out by selected individuals or groups within well-defined
organizational roles (e.g., risk executive [function], authorizing official, authorizing official
designated representative, chief information officer, senior information security officer, enterprise
architect, information security architect, information owner/steward, information system owner,
common control provider, information system security officer, and security control assessor). 45
Many risk management roles defined in this publication have counterpart roles defined in the
routine system development life cycle processes carried out by organizations. Whenever possible
and consistent with core missions/business processes, organizations align risk management roles
with similar (or complementary) roles defined for the system development life cycle. RMF tasks
are executed concurrently with or as part of system development life cycle processes, taking into
account appropriate dependencies. This helps to ensure that organizations are effectively
integrating the process of managing information system-related security risks with system
development life cycle processes.

Each RMF task description includes the individual or group with the primary responsibility for
carrying out the task, the supporting roles that may be called upon to assist in completing the task,
the system development life cycle phase most closely associated with the task, supplemental
guidance to help explain how the task is executed, and appropriate references for publications or
Web sites with information related to the task. 46 To summarize the key risk management-related
activities to be carried out by the organization, a milestone checkpoint is provided for each step in
the RMF. The milestone checkpoints contain a series of questions for the organization to help
ensure that important activities described in a particular step in the RMF have been completed
prior to proceeding to the next step.

The process of implementing the RMF tasks (i.e., the order and manner in which the tasks occur
and are executed, the names of primary/supporting roles, the names and format of artifacts) may
vary from organization to organization. The RMF tasks can be applied at appropriate phases in
the system development life cycle. While the tasks appear in sequential order, there can be many
points in the risk management process that require divergence from the sequential order including
the need for iterative cycles between tasks and revisiting tasks. For example, the results from
security control assessments can trigger remediation actions on the part of an information system
owner, which can in turn require the reassessment of selected controls. Monitoring the security

44
  The process for managing risk described in this publication can be tailored to meet the needs of many communities
of interest within the federal government including, for example, the Civil, Defense, and Intelligence Communities.
Tailoring provides flexibility in applying the risk management concepts associated with the RMF in a manner that is
most suitable for the organizations and the information systems involved.
45
 Appendix D describes the roles and responsibilities of key participants involved in an organization’s risk
management process.
46
   A reference is included in the RMF task list if: (i) the reference is generally applicable to both national security
systems and nonnational security systems; (ii) the reference for nonnational security systems has an equivalent or
supporting reference for national security systems; or (iii) the reference relates to specific national security community
guidance regarding the implementation of certain NIST standards or guidelines.

controls in an information system can also generate a potential cycle of tracking changes to the
system and its environment of operation, conducting security impact analyses, taking remediation
actions, reassessing security controls, and reporting the security status of the system. There may
also be other opportunities to diverge from the sequential nature of the tasks when it is more
efficient or cost-effective to do so. For example, while the security control assessment tasks are
listed after the security control implementation tasks, some organizations may choose to begin the
assessment of certain controls as soon as they are implemented but prior to the complete
implementation of all controls described in the security plan. This may result in the organization
assessing the physical and environmental protection controls within a facility prior to assessing
the security controls employed in the hardware and software components of the information
system (which may be implemented at a later time). Regardless of the task ordering, the last step
before an information system is placed into operation is the explicit acceptance of risk by the
authorizing official.

RMF steps and associated tasks can be applied to both new development and legacy information
systems. For legacy systems, organizations can use RMF Steps 1 through 3 to confirm that the
security categorization has been completed and is appropriate and that the requisite security
controls have been selected and allocated. Applying the first three steps in the RMF to legacy
systems can be viewed as a gap analysis to determine if the necessary and sufficient security
controls (i.e., system-specific, hybrid, and common controls) have been appropriately selected
and allocated. Security control weaknesses and deficiencies, if discovered, can be subsequently
addressed in RMF Steps 3 through 6 similar to new development systems. If no weaknesses or
deficiencies are discovered in the security controls during the gap analysis and there is a current
security authorization in effect, the organization can move directly to the last step in the RMF,
continuous monitoring. If a current security authorization is not in place, the organization
continues with RMF Steps 4 through 6.

The security categorization process influences the level of effort expended when implementing
the RMF tasks. Information systems supporting the most critical and/or sensitive operations and
assets within the organization as indicated by the security categorization, demand the greatest
level of attention and effort to ensure that appropriate information security and risk mitigation are
achieved. Most RMF tasks can be carried out by external providers with appropriate contractual
agreements or other arrangements in place (see Appendix I). A summary table of the RMF tasks
is provided in Appendix E.

________________________________________________________________________________________________



                             APPLICATION OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK
    The Risk Management Framework and associated RMF tasks apply to both information system
    owners and common control providers. In addition to supporting the authorization of information
    systems, the RMF tasks support the selection, development, implementation, assessment,
    authorization, and ongoing monitoring of common controls inherited by organizational information
    systems. Execution of the RMF tasks by common control providers, both internal and external to the
    organization, helps to ensure that the security capabilities provided by the common controls can be
    inherited by information system owners with a degree of assurance appropriate for their information
    protection needs. This approach recognizes the importance of security control effectiveness within
    information systems and the infrastructure supporting those systems.
    Since the tasks in the RMF are described in a sequential manner, organizations may choose to
    deviate from that sequential structure in order to be consistent with their established management
    and system development life cycle processes or to achieve more cost-effective and efficient
    solutions with regard to the execution of the tasks. Regardless of the task ordering, the last step
    before an information system is placed into operation is the explicit acceptance of risk by the
    authorizing official. Organizations may also execute certain RMF tasks in an iterative manner or in
    different phases of the system development life cycle. For example, security control assessments
    may be carried out during system development, system implementation, and system
    operation/maintenance (as part of continuous monitoring).
    Organizations may also choose to expend a greater level of effort on certain RMF tasks and commit
    fewer resources to other tasks based on the level of maturity of selected processes and activities
    within the organization. Since the RMF is life cycle-based, there will be a need to revisit various tasks
    over time depending on how the organization manages changes to the information systems and the
    environments in which those systems operate. Managing information security-related risks for an
    information system is viewed as part of a larger organization-wide risk management activity carried
    out by senior leaders. The RMF must simultaneously provide a disciplined and structured approach
    to mitigating risks from the operation and use of organizational information systems and the flexibility
    and agility to support the core missions and business operations of the organization in highly
    dynamic environments of operation.

3.1 RMF STEP 1 – CATEGORIZE INFORMATION SYSTEM
SECURITY CATEGORIZATION
TASK 1-1: Categorize the information system and document the results of the security categorization in the
security plan.
Primary Responsibility: Information System Owner; Information Owner/Steward.
Supporting Roles: Risk Executive (Function); Authorizing Official or Designated Representative; Chief Information
Officer; Senior Information Security Officer; Information System Security Officer.
System Development Life Cycle Phase: Initiation (concept/requirements definition).
Supplemental Guidance: The security categorization process is carried out by the information system owner and
information owner/steward in cooperation and collaboration with appropriate organizational officials (i.e., senior
leaders with mission/business function and/or risk management responsibilities). The security categorization process is
conducted as an organization-wide activity taking into consideration the enterprise architecture and the information
security architecture. This helps to ensure that individual information systems are categorized based on the mission and
business objectives of the organization. The information system owner and information owner/steward consider results
from the initial risk assessment as a part of the security categorization decision. The security categorization decision is
consistent with the organization’s risk management strategy to identify potential impact to mission/business functions
resulting from the loss of confidentiality, integrity, and/or availability. The risk management strategy provides guidance
and relevant information to authorizing officials (e.g., risk assessment methodologies employed by the organization,
evaluation of risks determined, risk mitigation approaches, organizational risk tolerance, approaches for monitoring risk
over time, known existing aggregated risks from current information systems, and other sources of risk).
The results of the security categorization process influence the selection of appropriate security controls for the
information system and also, where applicable, the minimum assurance requirements for that system. Security
categorization determinations consider potential adverse impacts to organizational operations, organizational assets,
individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. The organization may consider decomposing the information system
into multiple subsystems to more efficiently and effectively allocate security controls to the system. One approach is to
categorize each identified subsystem (including dynamic subsystems). Separately categorizing each subsystem does not
change the overall categorization of the information system. Rather, it allows the constituent subsystems to receive a
separate allocation of security controls from NIST Special Publication 800-53 instead of deploying higher-impact
controls across every subsystem. Another approach is to bundle smaller subsystems into larger subsystems within the
information system, categorize each of the aggregated subsystems, and allocate security controls to the subsystems, as
appropriate. Security categorization information is documented in the system identification section of the security plan
or included as an attachment to the plan.

INFORMATION SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
TASK 1-2: Describe the information system (including system boundary) and document the description in
the security plan.
Primary Responsibility: Information System Owner.
Supporting Roles: Authorizing Official or Designated Representative; Senior Information Security Officer;
Information Owner/Steward; Information System Security Officer.
System Development Life Cycle Phase: Initiation (concept/requirements definition).
Supplemental Guidance: Descriptive information about the information system is documented in the system
identification section of the security plan, included in attachments to the plan, or referenced in other standard sources
for information generated as part of the system development life cycle. Duplication of information is avoided,
whenever possible. The level of detail provided in the security plan is determined by the organization and is typically
commensurate with the security categorization of the information system. Information may be added to the system
description as it becomes available during the system development life cycle and execution of the RMF tasks. A system
description may include, for example:
- Full descriptive name of the information system including associated acronym;
- Unique information system identifier (typically a number or code);
- Information system owner and authorizing official including contact information;

INFORMATION SYSTEM REGISTRATION
TASK 1-3: Register the information system with appropriate organizational program/management offices.
Primary Responsibility: Information System Owner.
Supporting Roles: Information System Security Officer.
System Development Life Cycle Phase: Initiation (concept/requirements definition).
Supplemental Guidance: The registration process begins by identifying the information system (and subsystems, if
appropriate) in the system inventory and establishes a relationship between the information system and the parent or
governing organization that owns, manages, and/or controls the system. Information system registration, in accordance
with organizational policy, uses information in the system identification section of the security plan to inform the
parent or governing organization of: (i) the existence of the information system; (ii) the key characteristics of the
system; and (iii) any security implications for the organization due to the ongoing operation of the system. Information
system registration provides organizations with an effective management/tracking tool that is necessary for security
status reporting in accordance with applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, standards, guidance, or
regulations. Those subsystems that are more dynamic in nature (e.g., subsystems in net-centric architectures) may not
be present throughout all phases of the system development life cycle. Such subsystems are registered either as a subset
of a well-defined information system or a method of registration for dynamic subsystems is implemented that includes
as much information as feasible. Some information about dynamic subsystems is known prior to the subsystem
manifesting itself in the information system (e.g., assumptions and constraints specified in the security plan). However,
more detailed information may not be known until the subsystem manifests itself.

3.2 RMF STEP 2 – SELECT SECURITY CONTROLS
COMMON CONTROL IDENTIFICATION
TASK 2-1: Identify the security controls that are provided by the organization as common controls for
organizational information systems and document the controls in a security plan (or equivalent document).
Primary Responsibility: Chief Information Officer or Senior Information Security Officer; Information Security
Architect; Common Control Provider.
Supporting Roles: Risk Executive (Function); Authorizing Official or Designated Representative; Information System
Owner; Information System Security Engineer.
System Development Life Cycle Phase: Initiation (concept/requirements definition).
Supplemental Guidance: Common controls are security controls that are inherited by one or more organizational
information systems. Common controls are identified by the chief information officer and/or senior information
security officer in collaboration with the information security architect and assigned to specific organizational entities
(designated as common control providers) for development, implementation, assessment, and monitoring. Common
control providers may also be information system owners when the common controls are resident within an information
system. The organization consults information system owners when identifying common controls to ensure that the
security capability provided by the inherited controls is sufficient to deliver adequate protection. When the common
controls provided by the organization are not sufficient for information systems inheriting the controls, the system
owners supplement the common controls with system-specific or hybrid controls to achieve the required protection for
the system and/or accept greater risk. Information system owners inheriting common controls can either document the
implementation of the controls in their respective security plans or reference the controls contained in the security plans
of the common control providers. Organizations may choose to defer common control identification and security
control selection until a later phase in the system development life cycle. When common controls are not resident
within an information system (e.g., physical and environmental protection controls, personnel security controls), the
organization selects one or more senior organizational officials or executives to serve as authorizing officials for those
controls. These authorizing officials are responsible for accepting the risk to organizational operations and assets,
individuals, other organizations, and the Nation resulting from the deployment of the security controls provided by
common control providers and inherited by organizational information systems. Common control providers are
responsible for: (i) documenting common controls in a security plan (or equivalent document prescribed by the
organization); (ii) ensuring that common controls are developed, implemented, and assessed for effectiveness by
qualified assessors with a level of independence required by the organization; (iii) documenting assessment findings in
a security assessment report; (iv) producing a plan of action and milestones for all common controls deemed less than
effective (i.e., having unacceptable weaknesses or deficiencies in the controls); (v) receiving authorization for the
common controls from the designated authorizing official; and (vi) monitoring common control effectiveness on an
ongoing basis.
Security plans, security assessment reports, and plans of action and milestones for common controls (or a summary of
such information) are made available to information system owners (whose systems are inheriting the controls) after
the information is reviewed and approved by the senior official or executive responsible and accountable for the
controls. The organization ensures that common control providers keep this information current since the controls
typically support multiple organizational information systems. Security plans, security assessment reports, and plans of
action and milestones for common controls are used by authorizing officials within the organization to make risk-based
decisions in the security authorization process for their information systems. The use of common controls is
documented within the security plans for information systems inheriting those controls. Organizations ensure that
common control providers have the capability to rapidly broadcast changes in the status of common controls that
adversely affect the protections being provided by and expected of the common controls. Common control providers
are able to quickly inform information system owners when problems arise in the inherited common controls (e.g.,
when an assessment or reassessment of a common control indicates the control is flawed in some manner, when a new
threat or attack method arises that renders the common control less than effective in protecting against the new threat or
attack method). Organizations are encouraged, when feasible, to employ automated management systems to maintain
records of the specific common controls used in each organizational information system to enhance the ability of
common control providers to rapidly communicate with information system owners. If common controls are provided
to the organization (and its information systems) by entities external to the organization (e.g., shared and/or external
service providers), arrangements are made with the external/shared service providers by the organization to obtain
information on the effectiveness of the deployed controls. Information obtained from external organizations regarding
the effectiveness of common controls is factored into authorization decisions.

SECURITY CONTROL SELECTION
TASK 2-2: Select the security controls for the information system and document the controls in the security
plan.
Primary Responsibility: Information Security Architect; Information System Owner.
Supporting Roles: Authorizing Official or Designated Representative; Information Owner/Steward; Information
System Security Officer; Information System Security Engineer.
System Development Life Cycle Phase: Initiation (concept/requirements definition).
Supplemental Guidance: The security controls are selected based on the security categorization of the information
system. After selecting the applicable security control baseline, organizations apply the tailoring process to align the
controls more closely with the specific conditions within the organization (i.e., conditions related to organizational risk
tolerance, missions/business functions, information systems, or environments of operation). The tailoring process
includes: (i) identifying and designating common controls in initial security control baselines; (ii) applying scoping
considerations to the remaining baseline security controls; (iii) selecting compensating security controls, if needed; (iv)
assigning specific values to organization-defined security control parameters via explicit assignment and selection
statements; (v) supplementing baselines with additional security controls and control enhancements, if needed; and (vi)
providing additional specification information for control implementation, if needed. Organizations use risk
assessments to inform and guide the tailoring process for organizational information systems and environments of
operation. Threat data from risk assessments provide critical information on adversary capabilities, intent, and targeting
that may affect organizational decisions regarding the selection of additional security controls, including the associated
costs and benefits. Risk assessment results are also leveraged when identifying common controls to help determine if
such controls available for inheritance meet the security requirements for the system and its environment of operation
(including analyses for potential single points of failure). The security plan contains an overview of the security
requirements for the information system in sufficient detail to determine that the security controls selected would meet
those requirements. The security plan, in addition to the list of security controls to be implemented, describes the
intended application of each control in the context of the information system with sufficient detail to enable a compliant
implementation of the control. During the security control selection process organizations may begin planning for the
continuous monitoring process by developing a monitoring strategy. The strategy can include, for example, monitoring
criteria such as the volatility of specific security controls and the appropriate frequency of monitoring specific controls.
Organizations may choose to address security control volatility and frequency of monitoring during control selection as
inputs to the continuous monitoring process. The monitoring strategy can be included in the security plan to support the
concept of near real-time risk management and ongoing authorization (see Task 2-3). Information system owners
inheriting common controls can either document the implementation of the controls in their respective security plans or
reference the controls contained in the security plans of the common control providers (see Task 2-1). Information
system owners can refer to the security authorization packages prepared by common control providers when making
determinations regarding the adequacy of common controls inherited by their respective systems.
For net-centric architectures where subsystems may be added or removed from an information system dynamically, the
organization includes in the security plan for the system: (i) descriptions of the functions of the dynamic subsystems;
(ii) the security controls employed in the subsystems; (iii) constraints/assumptions regarding the functions of the
dynamic subsystems and the associated security controls in the subsystems; (iv) dependencies of other subsystems on
the proper functioning of the security controls of the dynamic subsystems; (v) procedures for determining that the
dynamic subsystems conform to the security plan, assumptions, and constraints; and (vi) the impact of the dynamic
subsystems and associated security controls on existing security controls in the information system. While inclusion of
a dynamic subsystem may impact the information system or some of the currently identified subsystems, it does not
necessarily mean the subsystem will impact the security of the system or other subsystems. That is, not all subsystems
are security relevant. Changes in the net-centric architectures that exceed the anticipated limits of the security plan may
not be allowed or may require reassessment prior to being approved. When security controls are designated as common
controls, the organization ensures that sufficient information is available to information system owners and authorizing
officials to support the risk management process. When security services are provided by external providers (e.g.,
through contracts, interagency agreements, lines of business arrangements, licensing agreements, and/or supply chain
arrangements), the organization: (i) defines the external services provided to the organization; (ii) describes how the
external services are protected in accordance with the security requirements of the organization; and (iii) obtains the
necessary assurances that the risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the
Nation arising from the use of the external services is acceptable. The organization also considers that replicated
subsystems within a complex information system may exhibit common vulnerabilities that can be exploited by a
common threat source, thereby negating the redundancy that might be relied upon as a risk mitigation measure. The
impact due to a security incident against one constituent subsystem might cascade and impact many subsystems at the
same time.

________________________________________________________________________________________________
MONITORING STRATEGY
TASK 2-3: Develop a strategy for the continuous monitoring of security control effectiveness and any
proposed or actual changes to the information system and its environment of operation.
Primary Responsibility: Information System Owner or Common Control Provider.
Supporting Roles: Risk Executive (Function); Authorizing Official or Designated Representative; Chief Information
Officer; Senior Information Security Officer; Information Owner/Steward; Information System Security Officer.
System Development Life Cycle Phase: Initiation (concept/requirements definition).
Supplemental Guidance: A critical aspect of risk management is the ongoing monitoring of security controls employed
within or inherited by the information system. An effective monitoring strategy is developed early in the system
development life cycle (i.e., during system design or COTS procurement decision) and can be included in the security
plan. The implementation of a robust continuous monitoring program allows an organization to understand the security
state of the information system over time and maintain the initial security authorization in a highly dynamic
environment of operation with changing threats, vulnerabilities, technologies, and missions/business functions. The
ongoing monitoring of security controls using automated tools and supporting databases facilitates near real-time risk
management for the information system. An effective monitoring program includes: (i) configuration management and
control processes; (ii) security impact analyses on proposed or actual changes to the information system and its
environment of operation; (iii) assessment of security controls employed within and inherited by the information
system (including controls in dynamic subsystems); and (iv) security status reporting to appropriate organizational
officials. The continuous monitoring strategy for the information system identifies the security controls to be
monitored, the frequency of monitoring, and the control assessment approach. The strategy defines how changes to the
information system will be monitored, how security impact analyses will be conducted, and the security status reporting
requirements including recipients of the status reports.
The criteria for determining the frequency with which security controls are monitored post deployment is established
by the information system owner or common control provider in collaboration with selected organizational officials
including, for example, the authorizing official or designated representative, chief information officer, senior
information security officer, and risk executive (function). The frequency criteria reflect the priorities and importance
of the information system to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.
Security controls that are volatile (i.e., most likely to change over time), critical to certain aspects of the organization’s
protection strategy, or identified in current plans of action and milestones may require more frequent assessment. The
use of automation facilitates a greater frequency and volume of security control assessments.
Determining the frequency for assessing security controls inherited by the information system (i.e., common controls)
includes the organization’s determination of the trustworthiness of the common control provider. An organizational
assessment of risk (either formal or informal) can also be used to guide the frequency of monitoring. The approach to
security control assessments during continuous monitoring may include detection of the status of information system
components and analysis of historical, operational data, as well as the reuse of assessment procedures and results that
supported the initial authorization decision.
The authorizing official or designated representative approve the monitoring strategy including the set of security
controls that are to be monitored on an ongoing basis as well as the frequency of the monitoring activities. The
approval of the monitoring strategy can be obtained in conjunction with the security plan approval. The monitoring of
security controls continues throughout the system development life cycle. For security controls employed in
information systems with dynamic subsystems, the monitoring strategy accounts for subsystems that did not exist at the
beginning of the system development life cycle. An effective monitoring strategy for dynamic subsystems achieves an
appropriate balance with regard to risk by: (i) not placing unnecessary or unrealistic burdens on the organization by
requiring reauthorization of the information system each time a new subsystem is added or removed; and (ii) not
compromising the accepted security posture of the overall system. NIST Special Publication 800-137 provides
additional guidance on continuous monitoring and continuous monitoring strategies.

________________________________________________________________________________________________
Supplemental Guidance: The independent review of the security plan by the authorizing official or designated
representative with support from the senior information security officer, chief information officer, and risk executive
(function), helps determine if the plan is complete, consistent, and satisfies the stated security requirements for the
information system. The security plan review also helps to determine, to the greatest extent possible with available
planning or operational documents, if the security plan correctly and effectively identifies the potential risk to
organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation, that would be incurred if the
controls identified in the plan were implemented as intended. Based on the results of this independent review and
analysis, the authorizing official or designated representative, chief information officer, senior information security
officer, or risk executive (function) may recommend changes to the security plan. If the security plan is deemed
unacceptable, the authorizing official or designated representative sends the plan back to the information system owner
(or common control provider) for appropriate action. If the security plan is deemed acceptable, the authorizing official
or designated representative approves the plan. The acceptance of the security plan represents an important milestone in
both the risk management process and the system development life cycle. The authorizing official or designated
representative, by approving the security plan, agrees to the set of security controls (system-specific, hybrid, and/or
common controls) proposed to meet the security requirements for the information system. This approval allows the risk
management process to advance to the next step in the RMF (i.e., the implementation of the security controls). The
approval of the security plan also establishes the level of effort required to successfully complete the remainder of the
steps in the RMF and provides the basis of the security specification for the acquisition of the information system,
subsystems, or components.

3.3 RMF STEP 3 – IMPLEMENT SECURITY CONTROLS
SECURITY CONTROL IMPLEMENTATION
TASK 3-1: Implement the security controls specified in the security plan.
Primary Responsibility: Information System Owner or Common Control Provider.
Supporting Roles: Information Owner/Steward; Information System Security Officer; Information System Security
Engineer.
System Development Life Cycle Phase: Development/Acquisition; Implementation.
Supplemental Guidance: Security control implementation is consistent with the organization’s enterprise architecture
and information security architecture. The information security architecture serves as a resource to allocate security
controls (including, for example, security mechanisms and services) to an information system and any organization-
defined subsystems. Early integration of information security requirements into the system development life cycle is
the most cost-effective method for implementing the organizational risk management strategy at Tier 3. Security
controls targeted for deployment within the information system (including subsystems) are allocated to specific system
components responsible for providing a particular security capability. Not all security controls need to be allocated to
every subsystem. Categorization of subsystems, information security architecture, and allocation of security controls
work together to help achieve a suitable balance. Allocating some security controls as common controls or hybrid
controls is part of this architectural process. Organizations use best practices when implementing the security controls
within the information system including system and software engineering methodologies, security engineering
principles, and secure coding techniques. Risk assessment may help inform decisions regarding the cost, benefit, and
risk trade-offs in using one type of technology versus another for control implementation. In addition, organizations
ensure that mandatory configuration settings are established and implemented on information technology products in
accordance with federal and organizational policies (e.g., Federal Desktop Core Configuration). Information system
security engineers with support from information system security officers employ a sound security engineering process
that captures and refines information security requirements and ensures the integration of those requirements into
information technology products and systems through purposeful security design or configuration. When available,
organizations consider the use of information technology products that have been tested, evaluated, or validated by
approved, independent, third-party assessment facilities. In addition, organizations satisfy, where applicable, minimum
assurance requirements when implementing security controls. Assurance requirements are directed at the activities and
actions that security control developers and implementers define and apply to increase the level of confidence that the
controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting
the security requirements for the information system. Assurance requirements address the quality of the design,
development, and implementation of the security functions in the information system. For higher-impact systems (i.e.,
potential high-value targets) in situations where specific and credible threat information indicates the likelihood of
advanced cyber attacks, additional assurance measures are considered. Organizations consider any implementation-
related issues associated with the integration and/or interfaces among common controls and system-specific controls.
For the identified common controls inherited by the information system, information system security engineers with
support from information system security officers coordinate with the common control provider to determine the most
appropriate way to apply the common controls to the organizational information systems. For certain management and
operational controls, formal integration into information technology products, services, and systems may not be
required. For certain types of operational and/or technical controls, implementation may require additional components,
products, or services to enable the information system to utilize the previously selected common controls to the fullest
extent. If selection of common controls previously had been deferred, identification of common controls inherited by
the information system is revisited to determine if better determinations can be made at this point in the system
development life cycle. Information system owners can refer to the authorization packages prepared by common
control providers when making determinations regarding the adequacy of the implementations of common controls for
their respective systems. For common controls that do not meet the protection needs of the information systems
inheriting the controls or that have unacceptable weaknesses or deficiencies, the system owners identify compensating
or supplementary controls to be implemented. Risk assessment may help determine how gaps in protection needs
between systems and common controls affect the overall risk associated with the system, and how to prioritize the need
for compensating or supplementary controls to mitigate specific risks. To the maximum extent and consistent with the
flexibility allowed in applying the tasks in the RMF, organizations and their contractors conduct initial security control
assessments (also referred to as developmental testing and evaluation) during information system development and
implementation. Conducting security control assessments in parallel with the development and implementation phases
of the system development life cycle facilitates the early identification of weaknesses and deficiencies and provides the
most cost-effective method for initiating corrective actions. Issues found during these assessments can be referred to
authorizing officials for early resolution, as appropriate. The results of the initial security control assessments can also
be used during the security authorization process to avoid delays or costly repetition of assessments. Assessment results

SECURITY CONTROL DOCUMENTATION
TASK 3-2: Document the security control implementation, as appropriate, in the security plan, providing a
functional description of the control implementation (including planned inputs, expected behavior, and
expected outputs).
Primary Responsibility: Information System Owner or Common Control Provider.
Supporting Roles: Information Owner/Steward; Information System Security Officer; Information System Security
Engineer.
System Development Life Cycle Phase: Development/Acquisition; Implementation.
Supplemental Guidance: Security control documentation describes how system-specific, hybrid, and common controls
are implemented. The documentation formalizes plans and expectations regarding the overall functionality of the
information system. The functional description of the security control implementation includes planned inputs,
expected behavior, and expected outputs where appropriate, typically for those technical controls that are employed in
the hardware, software, or firmware components of the information system. Documentation of security control
implementation allows for traceability of decisions prior to and after deployment of the information system. The level
of effort expended on documentation of the information system is commensurate with the purpose, scope, and impact
of the system with respect to organizational missions, business functions, and operations. To the extent possible,
organizations reference existing documentation (either by vendors or other organizations that have employed the same
or similar information systems), use automated support tools, and maximize communications to increase the overall
efficiency and cost effectiveness of security control implementation. The documentation also addresses platform
dependencies and includes any additional information necessary to describe how the security capability required by the
security control is achieved at the level of detail sufficient to support control assessment. Documentation for security
control implementation follows best practices for hardware and software development as well as for system/security
engineering disciplines and is consistent with established organizational policies and procedures for documenting
system development life cycle activities. Whenever possible and practicable for technical security controls that are
mechanism-based, organizations take maximum advantage of functional specifications provided by or obtainable from
hardware and software vendors and/or systems integrators including security-relevant documentation that may assist
the organization during the assessment and monitoring of the controls. Similarly, for management and operational
controls, organizations obtain security control implementation information from appropriate organizational entities
(e.g., facilities offices, human resource offices, physical security offices). Since the enterprise architecture and
information security architecture established by the organization significantly influence the approach used to
implement security controls, providing documentation of this process helps to ensure traceability with regard to
meeting the organization’s information security requirements.

3.4 RMF STEP 4 – ASSESS SECURITY CONTROLS
ASSESSMENT PREPARATION
TASK 4-1: Develop, review, and approve a plan to assess the security controls.
Primary Responsibility: Security Control Assessor.
Supporting Roles: Authorizing Official or Designated Representative; Chief Information Officer; Senior Information
Security Officer; Information System Owner or Common Control Provider; Information Owner/Steward; Information
System Security Officer.
System Development Life Cycle Phase: Development/Acquisition; Implementation.
Supplemental Guidance: The security assessment plan provides the objectives for the security control assessment, a
detailed roadmap of how to conduct such an assessment, and assessment procedures. The assessment plan reflects the
type of assessment the organization is conducting (e.g., developmental testing and evaluation, independent verification
and validation, assessments supporting security authorizations or reauthorizations, audits, continuous monitoring,
assessments subsequent to remediation actions). Conducting security control assessments in parallel with the
development/acquisition and implementation phases of the life cycle permits the identification of weaknesses and
deficiencies early and provides the most cost-effective method for initiating corrective actions. Issues found during
these assessments can be referred to authorizing officials for early resolution, as appropriate. The results of security
control assessments carried out during system development and implementation can also be used (consistent with reuse
criteria) during the security authorization process to avoid system fielding delays or costly repetition of assessments.
The security assessment plan is reviewed and approved by appropriate organizational officials to ensure that the plan is
consistent with the security objectives of the organization, employs state-of-the practice tools, techniques, procedures,
and automation to support the concept of continuous monitoring and near real-time risk management, and is cost-
effective with regard to the resources allocated for the assessment. The purpose of the security assessment plan
approval is two-fold: (i) to establish the appropriate expectations for the security control assessment; and (ii) to bound
the level of effort for the security control assessment. An approved security assessment plan helps to ensure that an
appropriate level of resources is applied toward determining security control effectiveness. When security controls are
provided to an organization by an external provider (e.g., through contracts, interagency agreements, lines of business
arrangements, licensing agreements, and/or supply chain arrangements), the organization obtains a security assessment
plan from the provider.
Organizations consider both the technical expertise and level of independence required in selecting security control
assessors. Organizations also ensure that security control assessors possess the required skills and technical expertise to
successfully carry out assessments of system-specific, hybrid, and common controls. This includes knowledge of and
experience with the specific hardware, software, and firmware components employed by the organization. An
independent assessor is any individual or group capable of conducting an impartial assessment of security controls
employed within or inherited by an information system. Impartiality implies that assessors are free from any perceived
or actual conflicts of interest with respect to the development, operation, and/or management of the information system
or the determination of security control effectiveness. Independent security control assessment services can be obtained
from other elements within the organization or can be contracted to a public or private sector entity outside of the
organization. Contracted assessment services are considered independent if the information system owner is not
directly involved in the contracting process or cannot unduly influence the independence of the assessor(s) conducting
the assessment of the security controls. The authorizing official or designated representative determines the required
level of independence for security control assessors based on the results of the security categorization process for the
information system and the ultimate risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and
the Nation. The authorizing official determines if the level of assessor independence is sufficient to provide confidence
that the assessment results produced are sound and can be used to support a risk-based decision on whether to place the
information system into operation or continue its operation. In special situations, for example when the organization
that owns the information system is small or the organizational structure requires that the security control assessment
be accomplished by individuals that are in the developmental, operational, and/or management chain of the system
owner, independence in the assessment process can be achieved by ensuring that the assessment results are carefully
reviewed and analyzed by an independent team of experts to validate the completeness, consistency, and veracity of the
results. The authorizing official consults with the Office of the Inspector General, the senior information security
officer, and the chief information officer to discuss the implications of any decisions on assessor independence in the
types of special circumstances described above. This discussion may occur prior to each security assessment or only
once if an organization is establishing an organizational policy and approach for specific special circumstances that will
be applied to all information systems meeting the specific special circumstance criteria. Security control assessments in
support of initial and subsequent security authorizations are conducted by independent assessors.

SECURITY CONTROL ASSESSMENT
TASK 4-2: Assess the security controls in accordance with the assessment procedures defined in the security
assessment plan.
Primary Responsibility: Security Control Assessor.
Supporting Roles: Information System Owner or Common Control Provider; Information Owner/Steward; Information
System Security Officer.
System Development Life Cycle Phase: Development/Acquisition; Implementation.
Supplemental Guidance: Security control assessments determine the extent to which the controls are implemented
correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements
for the information system. Security control assessments occur as early as practicable in the system development life
cycle, preferably during the development phase of the information system. These types of assessments are referred to as
developmental testing and evaluation and are intended to validate that the required security controls are implemented
correctly and consistent with the established information security architecture. Developmental testing and evaluation
activities include, for example, design and code reviews, application scanning, and regression testing. Security
weaknesses and deficiencies identified early in the system development life cycle can be resolved more quickly and in
a much more cost-effective manner before proceeding to subsequent phases in the life cycle. The objective is to
identify the information security architecture and security controls up front and to ensure that the system design and
testing validate the implementation of these controls.
The information system owner relies on the technical expertise and judgment of assessors to: (i) assess the security
controls employed within or inherited by the information system using assessment procedures specified in the security
assessment plan; and (ii) provide specific recommendations on how to correct weaknesses or deficiencies in the
controls and reduce or eliminate identified vulnerabilities. The assessor findings are an unbiased, factual reporting of
the weaknesses and deficiencies discovered during the security control assessment. Organizations are encouraged to
maximize the use of automation to conduct security control assessments to help: (i) increase the speed and overall
effectiveness and efficiency of the assessments; and (ii) support the concept of ongoing monitoring of the security state
of organizational information systems. When iterative development processes such as agile development are employed,
this typically results in an iterative assessment as each cycle is conducted. A similar process is used for assessing
security controls in COTS information technology products employed within the information system. Even when
iterative development is not employed, organizations may choose to begin assessing security controls prior to the
complete implementation of all security controls listed in the security plan. This type of incremental assessment is
appropriate if it is more efficient or cost-effective to do so. For example, policy, procedures, and plans may be assessed
prior to the assessment of the technical security controls in the hardware and software. In many cases, common controls
(i.e., security controls inherited by the information system) may be assessed prior to the security controls employed
within the system.
The organization ensures that assessors have access to: (i) the information system and environment of operation where
the security controls are employed; and (ii) the appropriate documentation, records, artifacts, test results, and other
materials needed to assess the security controls. In addition, assessors have the required degree of independence as
determined by the authorizing official (see Appendix D.13 and Appendix F.4). Security control assessments in support
of initial and subsequent security authorizations are conducted by independent assessors. Assessor independence during
continuous monitoring, although not mandated, facilitates reuse of assessment results when reauthorization is required.
When security controls are provided to an organization by an external provider (e.g., through contracts, interagency
agreements, lines of business arrangements, licensing agreements, and/or supply chain arrangements), the organization
ensures that assessors have access to the information system/environment of operation where the controls are employed
as well as appropriate information needed to carry out the assessment. The organization also obtains any information
related to existing assessments that may have been conducted by the external provider and reuses such assessment
information whenever possible in accordance with the reuse criteria established by the organization. Descriptive
information about the information system is typically documented in the system identification section of the security
plan or included by reference or as attachments to the plan. Supporting materials such as procedures, reports, logs, and
records showing evidence of security control implementation are identified as well. In order to make the risk
management process as timely and cost-effective as possible, the reuse of previous assessment results, when reasonable
and appropriate, is strongly recommended. For example, a recent audit of an information system may have produced
information about the effectiveness of selected security controls. Another opportunity to reuse previous assessment
results comes from programs that test and evaluate the security features of commercial information technology
products. Additionally, if prior assessment results from the system developer are available, the security control
assessor, under appropriate circumstances, may incorporate those results into the assessment. And finally, assessment
results are reused to support reciprocity where possible.

SECURITY ASSESSMENT REPORT
TASK 4-3: Prepare the security assessment report documenting the issues, findings, and recommendations
from the security control assessment.
Primary Responsibility: Security Control Assessor.
Supporting Roles: Information System Owner or Common Control Provider; Information System Security Officer.
System Development Life Cycle Phase: Development/Acquisition; Implementation.
Supplemental Guidance: The results of the security control assessment, including recommendations for correcting any
weaknesses or deficiencies in the controls, are documented in the security assessment report. The security assessment
report is one of three key documents in the security authorization package developed for authorizing officials. The
assessment report includes information from the assessor necessary to determine the effectiveness of the security
controls employed within or inherited by the information system based upon the assessor’s findings. The security
assessment report is an important factor in an authorizing official’s determination of risk to organizational operations
and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. Security control assessment results are documented at a
level of detail appropriate for the assessment in accordance with the reporting format prescribed by organizational
and/or federal policies. The reporting format is also appropriate for the type of security control assessment conducted
(e.g., developmental testing and evaluation, self-assessments, independent verification and validation, independent
assessments supporting the security authorization process or subsequent reauthorizations, assessments during
continuous monitoring, assessments subsequent to remediation actions, independent audits/evaluations).
Security control assessment results obtained during system development are brought forward in an interim report and
included in the final security assessment report. This supports the concept that the security assessment report is an
evolving document that includes assessment results from all relevant phases of the system development life cycle
including the results generated during continuous monitoring. Organizations may choose to develop an executive
summary from the detailed findings that are generated during a security control assessment. An executive summary
provides an authorizing official with an abbreviated version of the assessment report focusing on the highlights of the
assessment, synopsis of key findings, and/or recommendations for addressing weaknesses and deficiencies in the
security controls.
References: NIST Special Publication 800-53A.


REMEDIATION ACTIONS
TASK 4-4: Conduct initial remediation actions on security controls based on the findings and
recommendations of the security assessment report and reassess remediated control(s), as appropriate.
Primary Responsibility: Information System Owner or Common Control Provider; Security Control Assessor.
Supporting Roles: Authorizing Official or Designated Representative; Chief Information Officer; Senior Information
Security Officer; Information Owner/Steward; Information System Security Officer; Information System Security
Engineer; Security Control Assessor.
System Development Life Cycle Phase: Development/Acquisition; Implementation.
Supplemental Guidance: The security assessment report provides visibility into specific weaknesses and deficiencies in
the security controls employed within or inherited by the information system that could not reasonably be resolved
during system development or that are discovered post-development. Such weaknesses and deficiencies are potential
vulnerabilities if exploitable by a threat source. The findings generated during the security control assessment provide
important information that facilitates a disciplined and structured approach to mitigating risks in accordance with
organizational priorities. An updated assessment of risk (either formal or informal) based on the results of the findings
produced during the security control assessment and any inputs from the risk executive (function), helps to determine
the initial remediation actions and the prioritization of such actions. Information system owners and common control
providers, in collaboration with selected organizational officials (e.g., information system security engineer,
authorizing official designated representative, chief information officer, senior information security officer, information
owner/steward), may decide, based on an initial or updated assessment of risk, that certain findings are inconsequential
and present no significant risk to the organization. Alternatively, the organizational officials may decide that certain
findings are in fact, significant, requiring immediate remediation actions. In all cases, organizations review assessor
findings and determine the severity or seriousness of the findings (i.e., the potential adverse impact on organizational
operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation) and whether the findings are sufficiently
significant to be worthy of further investigation or remediation. Senior leadership involvement in the mitigation process
may be necessary in order to ensure that the organization’s resources are effectively allocated in accordance with
organizational priorities, providing resources first to the information systems that are supporting the most critical and

sensitive missions and business functions for the organization or correcting the deficiencies that pose the greatest
degree of risk. If weaknesses or deficiencies in security controls are corrected, the security control assessor reassesses
the remediated controls for effectiveness. Security control reassessments determine the extent to which the remediated
controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting
the security requirements for the information system. Exercising caution not to change the original assessment results,
assessors update the security assessment report with the findings from the reassessment. The security plan is updated
based on the findings of the security control assessment and any remediation actions taken. The updated security plan
reflects the actual state of the security controls after the initial assessment and any modifications by the information
system owner or common control provider in addressing recommendations for corrective actions. At the completion of
the assessment, the security plan contains an accurate list and description of the security controls implemented
(including compensating controls) and a list of residual vulnerabilities.
Organizations can prepare an optional addendum to the security assessment report that is transmitted to the authorizing
official. The optional addendum provides information system owners and common control providers an opportunity to
respond to the initial findings of assessors. The addendum may include, for example, information regarding initial
remediation actions taken by information system owners or common control providers in response to assessor findings,
or provide an owner’s perspective on the findings (e.g., including additional explanatory material, rebutting certain
findings, and correcting the record). The addendum to the security assessment report does not change or influence in
any manner, the initial assessor findings provided in the original report. Information provided in the addendum is
considered by authorizing officials in their risk-based authorization decisions. Organizations may choose to employ an
issue resolution process to help determine the appropriate actions to take with regard to the security control weaknesses
and deficiencies identified during the assessment. Issue resolution can help address vulnerabilities and associated risk,
false positives, and other factors that may provide useful information to authorizing officials regarding the security
state of the information system including the ongoing effectiveness of system-specific, hybrid, and common controls.
The issue resolution process can also help to ensure that only substantive items are identified and transferred to the plan
of actions and milestones.

3.5 RMF STEP 5 – AUTHORIZE INFORMATION SYSTEM
PLAN OF ACTION AND MILESTONES
TASK 5-1: Prepare the plan of action and milestones based on the findings and recommendations of the
security assessment report excluding any remediation actions taken.
Primary Responsibility: Information System Owner or Common Control Provider.
Supporting Roles: Information Owner/Steward; Information System Security Officer.
System Development Life Cycle Phase: Implementation.
Supplemental Guidance: The plan of action and milestones, prepared for the authorizing official by the information
system owner or the common control provider, is one of three key documents in the security authorization package and
describes the specific tasks that are planned: (i) to correct any weaknesses or deficiencies in the security controls noted
during the assessment; and (ii) to address the residual vulnerabilities in the information system. The plan of action and
milestones identifies: (i) the tasks to be accomplished with a recommendation for completion either before or after
information system implementation; (ii) the resources required to accomplish the tasks; (iii) any milestones in meeting
the tasks; and (iv) the scheduled completion dates for the milestones. The plan of action and milestones is used by the
authorizing official to monitor progress in correcting weaknesses or deficiencies noted during the security control
assessment. All security weaknesses and deficiencies identified during the security control assessment are documented
in the security assessment report to maintain an effective audit trail. Organizations develop specific plans of action and
milestones based on the results of the security control assessment and in accordance with applicable laws, Executive
Orders, directives, policies, standards, guidance, or regulations. Plan of action and milestones entries are not required
when weaknesses or deficiencies are remediated during the assessment or prior to the submission of the authorization
package to the authorizing official.
Organizations define a strategy for developing plans of action and milestones that facilitates a prioritized approach to
risk mitigation that is consistent across the organization. The strategy helps to ensure that organizational plans of action
and milestones are based on: (i) the security categorization of the information system; (ii) the specific weaknesses or
deficiencies in the security controls; (iii) the importance of the identified security control weaknesses or deficiencies
(i.e., the direct or indirect effect the weaknesses or deficiencies may have on the overall security state of the
information system, and hence on the risk exposure of the organization, or ability of the organization to perform its
mission or business functions); and (iv) the organization’s proposed risk mitigation approach to address the identified
weaknesses or deficiencies in the security controls (e.g., prioritization of risk mitigation actions, allocation of risk
mitigation resources). A risk assessment guides the prioritization process for items included in the plan of action and
milestones.

SECURITY AUTHORIZATION PACKAGE
TASK 5-2: Assemble the security authorization package and submit the package to the authorizing official
for adjudication.
Primary Responsibility: Information System Owner or Common Control Provider.
Supporting Roles: Information System Security Officer; Security Control Assessor.
System Development Life Cycle Phase: Implementation.
Supplemental Guidance: The security authorization package contains: (i) the security plan; (ii) the security assessment
report; and (iii) the plan of action and milestones. The information in these key documents is used by authorizing
officials to make risk-based authorization decisions. For information systems inheriting common controls for specific
security capabilities, the security authorization package for the common controls or a reference to such documentation
is also included in the authorization package. When security controls are provided to an organization by an external
provider (e.g., through contracts, interagency agreements, lines of business arrangements, licensing agreements, and/or
supply chain arrangements), the organization ensures that the information needed for authorizing officials to make risk-
based decisions, is made available by the provider.
Additional information can be included in the security authorization package at the request of the authorizing official
carrying out the authorization action. The contents of the security authorization package are protected appropriately in
accordance with federal and organizational policies. Organizations are strongly encouraged to use automated support
tools in preparing and managing the content of the security authorization package to help provide an effective vehicle
for maintaining and updating information for authorizing officials regarding the ongoing security status of information



CHAPTER 3                                                                                                           PAGE 34

systems within the organization. Providing orderly, disciplined, and timely updates to the security plan, security
assessment report, and plan of action and milestones on an ongoing basis, supports the concept of near real-time risk
management and ongoing authorization. It also facilitates more cost-effective and meaningful reauthorization actions, if
required. Organizations maintain strict version control as key documents in the authorization package are updated.
With the use of automated tools and supporting databases, authorizing officials and other senior leaders within the
organization are able to maintain awareness with regard to the security state of the information system including the
ongoing effectiveness of system-specific, hybrid, and common controls.

RISK DETERMINATION
TASK 5-3: Determine the risk to organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, or
reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation.
Primary Responsibility: Authorizing Official or Designated Representative.
Supporting Roles: Risk Executive (Function); Senior Information Security Officer.
System Development Life Cycle Phase: Implementation.
Supplemental Guidance: The authorizing official or designated representative, in collaboration with the senior
information security officer, assesses the information provided by the information system owner or common control
provider regarding the current security state of the system or the common controls inherited by the system and the
recommendations for addressing any residual risks. Risk assessments (either formal or informal) are employed at the
discretion of the organization to provide needed information on threats, vulnerabilities, and potential impacts as well as
the analyses for the risk mitigation recommendations. The risk executive (function) also provides information to the
authorizing official that is considered in the final determination of risk to organizational operations and assets,
individuals, other organizations, and the Nation resulting from the operation and use of the information system. Risk-
related information includes the criticality of organizational missions and/or business functions supported by the
information system and the risk management strategy for the organization. The risk management strategy typically
describes: (i) how risk is assessed within the organization (i.e., tools, techniques, procedures, and methodologies); (ii)
how assessed risks are evaluated with regard to severity or criticality; (iii) known existing aggregated risks from
organizational information systems and other sources; (iv) risk response approaches; (v) organizational risk tolerance;
and (vi) how risk is monitored over time. When making the final risk determination, the authorizing official or
designated representative considers information obtained from the risk executive (function) and the information
provided by the information system owner or common control provider in the security authorization package (i.e.,
security plan, security assessment report, and plan of action and milestones). Conversely, information system-related
security risk information derived from the execution of the RMF is available to the risk executive (function) for use in
formulating and updating the organization-wide risk management strategy. After risk determination, organizations can
respond to risk in a variety of ways, including: (i) accepting risk; (ii) avoiding risk; (iii) mitigating risk; (iv) sharing
risk; (v) transferring risk; or (vi) a combination of the above. Decisions on the most appropriate course of action for
risk response include some form of prioritization. Some risks may be of greater concern than other risks. In that case,
more resources may need to be directed at addressing higher-priority risks than at other lower-priority risks. This does
not necessarily mean that the lower-priority risks are ignored. Rather, it could mean that fewer resources are directed at
the lower-priority risks (at least initially), or that the lower-priority risks are addressed at a later time. A key part of the
risk decision process is the recognition that regardless of the risk decision, there typically remains a degree of residual
risk. Organizations determine acceptable degrees of residual risk based on organizational risk tolerance.

RISK ACCEPTANCE
TASK 5-4: Determine if the risk to organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals, other
organizations, or the Nation is acceptable.
Primary Responsibility: Authorizing Official.
Supporting Roles: Risk Executive (Function); Authorizing Official Designated Representative; Senior Information
Security Officer.
System Development Life Cycle Phase: Implementation.
Supplemental Guidance: The explicit acceptance of risk is the responsibility of the authorizing official and cannot be
delegated to other officials within the organization. The authorizing official considers many factors when deciding if



CHAPTER 3                                                                                                               PAGE 35

________________________________________________________________________________________________
the risk to organizational operations (including mission, function, image, or reputation), organizational assets,
individuals, other organizations, and the Nation, is acceptable. Balancing security considerations with mission and
operational needs is paramount to achieving an acceptable authorization decision. The authorizing official issues an
authorization decision for the information system and the common controls inherited by the system after reviewing all
of the relevant information and, where appropriate, consulting with other organizational officials, including the
organization’s risk executive (function). Security authorization decisions are based on the content of the security
authorization package and, where appropriate, any inputs received from key organizational officials, including the risk
executive (function). The authorization package provides relevant information on the security state of the information
system including the ongoing effectiveness of the security controls employed within or inherited by the system. Inputs
from the risk executive (function), including previously established overarching risk guidance to authorizing officials,
provide additional organization-wide information to the authorizing official that may be relevant and affect the
authorization decision (e.g., organizational risk tolerance, specific mission and business requirements, dependencies
among information systems, and other types of risks not directly associated with the information system). Risk
executive (function) inputs are documented and become part of the security authorization decision. Security
authorization decisions, including inputs from the risk executive (function), are conveyed to information system owners
and common control providers and made available to interested parties within the organization (e.g., information
system owners and authorizing officials for interconnected systems, chief information officers, information
owners/stewards, senior managers).
The authorization decision document conveys the final security authorization decision from the authorizing official to
the information system owner or common control provider, and other organizational officials, as appropriate. The
authorization decision document contains the following information: (i) authorization decision; (ii) terms and
conditions for the authorization; and (iii) authorization termination date. The security authorization decision indicates
to the information system owner whether the system is: (i) authorized to operate; or (ii) not authorized to operate. The
terms and conditions for the authorization provide a description of any specific limitations or restrictions placed on the
operation of the information system or inherited controls that must be followed by the system owner or common
control provider. The authorization termination date, established by the authorizing official, indicates when the
security authorization expires. Authorization termination dates are influenced by federal and/or organizational policies
which may establish maximum authorization periods. Organizations may choose to eliminate the authorization
termination date if the continuous monitoring program is sufficiently robust to provide the authorizing official with the
needed information to conduct ongoing risk determination and risk acceptance activities with regard to the security
state of the information system and the ongoing effectiveness of security controls employed within and inherited by the
system.
If the security control assessments are conducted by qualified assessors with the required degree of independence based
on federal/organizational policies, appropriate security standards and guidelines, and the needs of the authorizing
official, the assessment results can be cumulatively applied to the reauthorization, thus supporting the concept of
ongoing authorization. Organizational policies regarding ongoing authorization and formal reauthorization, if/when
required, are consistent with federal directives, regulations, and/or policies.
The authorization decision document is attached to the original security authorization package containing the
supporting documentation and transmitted to the information system owner or common control provider. Upon receipt
of the authorization decision document and original authorization package, the information system owner or common
control provider acknowledges and implements the terms and conditions of the authorization and notifies the
authorizing official. The organization ensures that authorization documents for both information systems and for
common controls are made available to appropriate organizational officials (e.g., information system owners inheriting
common controls, risk executive (function), chief information officers, senior information security officers, information
system security officers). Authorization documents, especially information dealing with information system
vulnerabilities, are: (i) marked and appropriately protected in accordance with federal and organizational policies; and
(ii) retained in accordance with the organization’s record retention policy. The authorizing official verifies, on an
ongoing basis, that the terms and conditions established as part of the authorization are being followed by the
information system owner or common control provider.

3.6 RMF STEP 6 – MONITOR SECURITY CONTROLS
INFORMATION SYSTEM AND ENVIRONMENT CHANGES
TASK 6-1: Determine the security impact of proposed or actual changes to the information system and its
environment of operation.
Primary Responsibility: Information System Owner or Common Control Provider.
Supporting Roles: Risk Executive (Function); Authorizing Official or Designated Representative; Senior Information
Security Officer; Information Owner/Steward; Information System Security Officer.
System Development Life Cycle Phase: Operation/Maintenance.
Supplemental Guidance: Information systems are in a constant state of change with upgrades to hardware, software, or
firmware and modifications to the surrounding environments where the systems reside and operate. A disciplined and
structured approach to managing, controlling, and documenting changes to an information system or its environment of
operation is an essential element of an effective security control monitoring program. Strict configuration management
and control processes are established by the organization to support such monitoring activities. It is important to record
any relevant information about specific changes to hardware, software, or firmware such as version or release numbers,
descriptions of new or modified features/capabilities, and security implementation guidance. It is also important to
record any changes to the environment of operation for the information system (e.g., modifications to hosting networks
and facilities, mission/business use of the system, threats), or changes to the organizational risk management strategy.
The information system owner and common control provider use this information in assessing the potential security
impact of the changes. Documenting proposed or actual changes to an information system or its environment of
operation and subsequently assessing the potential impact those changes may have on the security state of the system or
the organization is an important aspect of security control monitoring and maintaining the security authorization over
time. Information system changes are generally not undertaken prior to assessing the security impact of such changes.
Organizations are encouraged to maximize the use of automation when managing changes to the information system or
its environment of operation.
Security impact analysis conducted by the organization, determines the extent to which proposed or actual changes to
the information system or its environment of operation can affect or have affected the security state of the system.
Changes to the information system or its environment of operation may affect the security controls currently in place
(including system-specific, hybrid, and common controls), produce new vulnerabilities in the system, or generate
requirements for new security controls that were not needed previously. If the results of the security impact analysis
indicate that the proposed or actual changes can affect or have affected the security state of the system, corrective
actions are initiated and appropriate documents revised and updated (e.g., the security plan, security assessment report,
and plan of action and milestones). The information system owner or common control provider consults with
appropriate organizational officials/entities (e.g., configuration control board, senior information security officer,
information system security officer) prior to implementing any security-related changes to the information system or its
environment of operation. The authorizing official or designated representative uses the revised and updated security
assessment report in collaboration with the senior information security officer and risk executive (function) to
determine if a formal reauthorization action is necessary. Most routine changes to an information system or its
environment of operation can be handled by the organization’s continuous monitoring program, thus supporting the
concept of ongoing authorization and near real-time risk management. Conducting security impact analyses is part of
an ongoing assessment of risk. As risk assessments are updated and refined, organizations use the results to modify
security plans based on the most recent threat and vulnerability information available. Updated risk assessments
provide a foundation for prioritizing/planning risk responses. The authorizing official or designated representative, in
collaboration with the risk executive (function), confirms as needed, determinations of residual risk. The risk executive
(function) notifies the authorizing official of any significant changes in the organizational risk posture.

ONGOING SECURITY CONTROL ASSESSMENTS
TASK 6-2: Assess the technical, management, and operational security controls employed within and
inherited by the information system in accordance with the organization-defined monitoring strategy.
Primary Responsibility: Security Control Assessor.

________________________________________________________________________________________________
Supplemental Guidance: Subsequent to the initial authorization (i.e., during continuous monitoring), the organization
assesses all security controls (including management, operational, and technical controls) employed within and
inherited by the information system on an ongoing basis. The frequency of monitoring is based on the monitoring
strategy developed by the information system owner or common control provider and approved by the authorizing
official and senior information security officer. For ongoing security control assessments, assessors have the required
degree of independence as determined by the authorizing official (see Appendix D.13 and Appendix F.4). Security
control assessments in support of initial and subsequent security authorizations are conducted by independent assessors.
Assessor independence during continuous monitoring, although not mandated, introduces efficiencies into the process
and allows for reuse of assessment results in support of ongoing authorization and when reauthorization is required.
Organizations can use the current year’s assessment results to meet the annual FISMA security control assessment
requirement. To satisfy this requirement, organizations can draw upon the assessment results from any of the following
sources, including but not limited to: (i) security control assessments conducted as part of an information system
authorization, ongoing authorization, or formal reauthorization, if required; (ii) continuous monitoring activities; or (iii)
testing and evaluation of the information system as part of the system development life cycle process or audit (provided
that the testing, evaluation, or audit results are current, relevant to the determination of security control effectiveness,
and obtained by assessors with the required degree of independence). Existing security assessment results are reused to
the extent that they are still valid and are supplemented with additional assessments as needed. Reuse of assessment
information is critical in achieving a cost-effective, fully integrated security program capable of producing the needed
evidence to determine the security status of the information system. The use of automation to support security control
assessments facilitates a greater frequency and volume of assessments that is consistent with the monitoring strategy
established by the organization.

ONGOING REMEDIATION ACTIONS
TASK 6-3: Conduct remediation actions based on the results of ongoing monitoring activities, assessment of
risk, and outstanding items in the plan of action and milestones.
Primary Responsibility: Information System Owner or Common Control Provider.
Supporting Roles: Authorizing Official or Designated Representative; Information Owner/Steward; Information
System Security Officer; Information System Security Engineer; Security Control Assessor.
System Development Life Cycle Phase: Operation/Maintenance.
Supplemental Guidance: The assessment information produced by an assessor during continuous monitoring is
provided to the information system owner and common control provider in an updated security assessment report. The
information system owner and common control provider initiate remediation actions on outstanding items listed in the
plan of actions and milestones and findings produced during the ongoing monitoring of security controls. The security
control assessor may provide recommendations as to appropriate remediation actions. An assessment of risk (either
formal or informal) informs organizational decisions with regard to conducting ongoing remediation actions. Security
controls that are modified, enhanced, or added during the continuous monitoring process are reassessed by the assessor
to ensure that appropriate corrective actions are taken to eliminate weaknesses or deficiencies or to mitigate the
identified risk.

KEY UPDATES
TASK 6-4: Update the security plan, security assessment report, and plan of action and milestones based on
the results of the continuous monitoring process.
Primary Responsibility: Information System Owner or Common Control Provider.
Supporting Roles: Information Owner/Steward; Information System Security Officer.
System Development Life Cycle Phase: Operation/Maintenance.
Supplemental Guidance: To facilitate the near real-time management of risk associated with the operation and use of
the information system, the organization updates the security plan, security assessment report, and plan of action and
milestones on an ongoing basis. The updated security plan reflects any modifications to security controls based on risk
mitigation activities carried out by the information system owner or common control provider. The updated security
assessment report reflects additional assessment activities carried out to determine security control effectiveness based
on modifications to the security plan and deployed controls. The updated plan of action and milestones: (i) reports

________________________________________________________________________________________________
progress made on the current outstanding items listed in the plan; (ii) addresses vulnerabilities discovered during the
security impact analysis or security control monitoring; and (iii) describes how the information system owner or
common control provider intends to address those vulnerabilities. The information provided by these key updates helps
to raise awareness of the current security state of the information system (and the common controls inherited by the
system) thereby supporting the process of ongoing authorization and near real-time risk management.
The frequency of updates to risk management-related information is at the discretion of the information system owner,
common control provider, and authorizing officials in accordance with federal and organizational policies. Updates to
information regarding the security state of the information system (and common controls inherited by the system) are
accurate and timely since the information provided influences ongoing security-related actions and decisions by
authorizing officials and other senior leaders within the organization. With the use of automated support tools and
effective organization-wide security program management practices, authorizing officials are able to readily access the
current security state of the information system including the ongoing effectiveness of system-specific, hybrid, and
common controls. This facilitates near real-time management of risk to organizational operations and assets,
individuals, other organizations, and the Nation, and provides essential information for continuous monitoring and
ongoing authorization.
When updating key information in security plans, security assessment reports, and plans of action and milestones,
organizations ensure that the original information needed for oversight, management, and auditing purposes is not
modified or destroyed. Providing an effective method of tracking changes to information over time through strict
configuration management and control procedures (including version control) is necessary to: (i) achieve transparency
in the information security activities of the organization; (ii) obtain individual accountability for security-related
actions; and (iii) better understand emerging trends in the organization’s information security program.

SECURITY STATUS REPORTING
TASK 6-5: Report the security status of the information system (including the effectiveness of security
controls employed within and inherited by the system) to the authorizing official and other appropriate
organizational officials on an ongoing basis in accordance with the monitoring strategy.
Primary Responsibility: Information System Owner or Common Control Provider.
Supporting Roles: Information System Security Officer.
System Development Life Cycle Phase: Operation/Maintenance.
Supplemental Guidance: The results of monitoring activities are recorded and reported to the authorizing official on an
ongoing basis in accordance with the monitoring strategy. Security status reporting can be: (i) event-driven (e.g., when
the information system or its environment of operation changes or the system is compromised or breached); (ii) time-
driven (e.g., weekly, monthly, quarterly); or (iii) both (event- and time-driven). Security status reports provide the
authorizing official and other senior leaders within the organization, essential information with regard to the security
state of the information system including the effectiveness of deployed security controls. Security status reports
describe the ongoing monitoring activities employed by the information system owner or common control provider.
Security status reports also address vulnerabilities in the information system and its environment of operation
discovered during the security control assessment, security impact analysis, and security control monitoring and how
the information system owner or common control provider intends to address those vulnerabilities.
Organizations have significant latitude and flexibility in the breadth, depth, and formality of security status reports.
Security status reports can take whatever form the organization deems most appropriate. The goal is cost-effective and
efficient ongoing communication with senior leaders conveying the current security state of the information system and
its environment of operation with regard to organizational missions and business functions. At a minimum, security
status reports summarize key changes to security plans, security assessment reports, and plans of action and milestones.
Use of automated management tools facilitates the effectiveness and timeliness of security status reporting.
The frequency of security status reports is at the discretion of the organization and in accordance with federal and
organizational policies. Status reports occur at appropriate intervals to transmit significant security-related information
about the information system (including information regarding the ongoing effectiveness of security controls employed
within and inherited by the system), but not so frequently as to generate unnecessary work. The authorizing official
uses the security status reports in collaboration with the senior information security officer and risk executive (function)
to determine if a formal reauthorization action is necessary. Security status reports are appropriately marked, protected,
and handled in accordance with federal and organizational policies. At the discretion of the organization, security status
reports can be used to help satisfy FISMA reporting requirements for documenting remedial actions for any security-
related weaknesses or deficiencies. Note that this status reporting is intended to be ongoing, not to be interpreted as

TASK 6-6: Review the reported security status of the information system (including the effectiveness of
security controls employed within and inherited by the system) on an ongoing basis in accordance with the
monitoring strategy to determine whether the risk to organizational operations, organizational assets,
individuals, other organizations, or the Nation remains acceptable.
Primary Responsibility: Authorizing Official.
Supporting Roles: Risk Executive (Function); Authorizing Official Designated Representative; Senior Information
Security Officer.

Supplemental Guidance: The authorizing official or designated representative reviews the reported security status of
the information system (including the effectiveness of deployed security controls) on an ongoing basis, to determine the
current risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation. The authorizing
official determines, with inputs as appropriate from the authorizing official designated representative, senior
information security officer, and the risk executive (function), whether the current risk is acceptable and forwards
appropriate direction to the information system owner or common control provider. The use of automated support tools
to capture, organize, quantify, visually display, and maintain security status information promotes the concept of near
real-time risk management regarding the overall risk posture of the organization. The use of metrics and dashboards
increases an organization’s ability to make risk-based decisions by consolidating data from automated tools and
providing it to decision makers at different levels within the organization in an easy-to-understand format. The risks
being incurred may change over time based on the information provided in the security status reports. Determining how
the changing conditions affect the mission or business risks associated with the information system is essential for
maintaining adequate security. By carrying out ongoing risk determination and risk acceptance, authorizing officials
can maintain the security authorization over time. Formal reauthorization actions, if required, occur only in accordance
with federal or organizational policies. The authorizing official conveys updated risk determination and acceptance
results to the risk executive (function).

INFORMATION SYSTEM REMOVAL AND DISPOSAL
TASK 6-7: Implement an information system disposal strategy, when needed, which executes required
actions when a system is removed from service.
Primary Responsibility: Information System Owner.
Supporting Roles: Risk Executive (Function); Authorizing Official Designated Representative; Senior Information
Security Officer; Information Owner/Steward; Information System Security Officer.
System Development Life Cycle Phase: Disposal.
Supplemental Guidance: When a federal information system is removed from operation, a number of risk management-
related actions are required. Organizations ensure that all security controls addressing information system removal and
disposal (e.g., media sanitization, configuration management and control) are implemented. Organizational tracking
and management systems (including inventory systems) are updated to indicate the specific information system
components that are being removed from service. Security status reports reflect the new status of the information
system. Users and application owners hosted on the decommissioned information system are notified as appropriate,
and any security control inheritance relationships are reviewed and assessed for impact. This task also applies to
subsystems that are removed from information systems or decommissioned. The effects of the subsystem removal or
disposal are assessed with respect to the overall operation of the information system where the subsystem resided, or in
the case of dynamic subsystems, the information systems where the subsystems were actively employed.

APPENDIX D

ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
KEY PARTICIPANTS IN THE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS




T       he following sections describe the roles and responsibilities of key participants involved in
        an organization’s risk management process. 47 Recognizing that organizations have widely
        varying missions and organizational structures, there may be differences in naming
conventions for risk management-related roles and how specific responsibilities are allocated
among organizational personnel (e.g., multiple individuals filling a single role or one individual
filling multiple roles). 48 However, the basic functions remain the same. The application of the
Risk Management Framework described in this publication is flexible, allowing organizations to
effectively accomplish the intent of the specific tasks within their respective organizational
structures to best manage information system-related security risks. Many risk management roles
defined in this publication have counterpart roles defined in the routine system development life
cycle processes carried out by organizations. Whenever possible, organizations align the risk
management roles with similar (or complementary) roles defined for the system development life
cycle. 49

D.1 HEAD OF AGENCY (CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER)
The head of agency (or chief executive officer) is the highest-level senior official or executive
within an organization with the overall responsibility to provide information security protections
commensurate with the risk and magnitude of harm (i.e., impact) to organizational operations and
assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation resulting from unauthorized access, use,
disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of: (i) information collected or maintained by
or on behalf of the agency; and (ii) information systems used or operated by an agency or by a
contractor of an agency or other organization on behalf of an agency. Agency heads are also
responsible for ensuring that: (i) information security management processes are integrated with
strategic and operational planning processes; (ii) senior officials within the organization provide
information security for the information and information systems that support the operations and
assets under their control; and (iii) the organization has trained personnel sufficient to assist in
complying with the information security requirements in related legislation, policies, directives,
instructions, standards, and guidelines. Through the development and implementation of strong
policies, the head of agency establishes the organizational commitment to information security
and the actions required to effectively manage risk and protect the core missions and business
functions being carried out by the organization. The head of agency establishes appropriate
accountability for information security and provides active support and oversight of monitoring
and improvement for the information security program. Senior leadership commitment to
information security establishes a level of due diligence within the organization that promotes a
climate for mission and business success.



47
  Organizations may define other roles (e.g., facilities manager, human resources manager, systems administrator) to
support the risk management process.
48
  Caution is exercised when one individual fills multiples roles in the risk management process to ensure that the
individual retains an appropriate level of independence and remains free from conflicts of interest.
49
   For example, the system development life cycle role of system developer or program manager can be aligned with
information system owner; mission owner/manager can be aligned with authorizing official; and system/software
engineers are complementary roles to information system security engineers.

________________________________________________________________________________________________

D.2 RISK EXECUTIVE (FUNCTION)
The risk executive (function) is an individual or group within an organization that helps to ensure
that: (i) risk-related considerations for individual information systems, to include authorization
decisions, are viewed from an organization-wide perspective with regard to the overall strategic
goals and objectives of the organization in carrying out its core missions and business functions;
and (ii) managing information system-related security risks is consistent across the organization,
reflects organizational risk tolerance, and is considered along with other types of risks in order to
ensure mission/business success. The risk executive (function) coordinates with the senior
leadership of an organization to:
•    Provide a comprehensive, organization-wide, holistic approach for addressing risk—an
     approach that provides a greater understanding of the integrated operations of the
     organization;
•    Develop a risk management strategy for the organization providing a strategic view of
     information security-related risks with regard to the organization as a whole; 50
•    Facilitate the sharing of risk-related information among authorizing officials and other senior
     leaders within the organization;
•    Provide oversight for all risk management-related activities across the organization (e.g.,
     security categorizations) to help ensure consistent and effective risk acceptance decisions;
•    Ensure that authorization decisions consider all factors necessary for mission and business
     success;
•    Provide an organization-wide forum to consider all sources of risk (including aggregated risk)
     to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation;
•    Promote cooperation and collaboration among authorizing officials to include authorization
     actions requiring shared responsibility;
•    Ensure that the shared responsibility for supporting organizational mission/business functions
     using external providers of information and services receives the needed visibility and is
     elevated to the appropriate decision-making authorities; and
•    Identify the organizational risk posture based on the aggregated risk to information from the
     operation and use of the information systems for which the organization is responsible.

The risk executive (function) presumes neither a specific organizational structure nor formal
responsibility assigned to any one individual or group within the organization. The head of the
agency/organization may choose to retain the risk executive (function) or to delegate the function
to another official or group (e.g., an executive leadership council). The risk executive (function)
has inherent U.S. Government authority and is assigned to government personnel only.

D.3 CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER
The chief information officer 51 is an organizational official responsible for: (i) designating a
senior information security officer; (ii) developing and maintaining information security policies,

50
  Authorizing officials may have narrow or localized perspectives in rendering authorization decisions, in some cases
without fully understanding or explicitly accepting the risks being incurred from such decisions.
51
   When an organization has not designated a formal chief information officer position, FISMA requires the associated
responsibilities to be handled by a comparable organizational official.



APPENDIX D                                                                                                    PAGE D-2

procedures, and control techniques to address all applicable requirements; (iii) overseeing
personnel with significant responsibilities for information security and ensuring that the personnel
are adequately trained; (iv) assisting senior organizational officials concerning their security
responsibilities; and (v) in coordination with other senior officials, reporting annually to the head
of the federal agency on the overall effectiveness of the organization’s information security
program, including progress of remedial actions. The chief information officer, with the support
of the risk executive (function) and the senior information security officer, works closely with
authorizing officials and their designated representatives to help ensure that:
•    An organization-wide information security program is effectively implemented resulting in
     adequate security for all organizational information systems and environments of operation
     for those systems;
•    Information security considerations are integrated into programming/planning/budgeting
     cycles, enterprise architectures, and acquisition/system development life cycles;
•    Information systems are covered by approved security plans and are authorized to operate;
•    Information security-related activities required across the organization are accomplished in an
     efficient, cost-effective, and timely manner; and
•    There is centralized reporting of appropriate information security-related activities.

The chief information officer and authorizing officials also determine, based on organizational
priorities, the appropriate allocation of resources dedicated to the protection of the information
systems supporting the organization's missions and business functions. For selected information
systems, the chief information officer may be designated as an authorizing official or a co-
authorizing official with other senior organizational officials. The role of chief information
officer has inherent U.S. Government authority and is assigned to government personnel only.

D.4 INFORMATION OWNER/STEWARD
The information owner/steward is an organizational official with statutory, management, or
operational authority for specified information and the responsibility for establishing the policies
and procedures governing its generation, collection, processing, dissemination, and disposal. 52 In
information-sharing environments, the information owner/steward is responsible for establishing
the rules for appropriate use and protection of the subject information (e.g., rules of behavior) and
retains that responsibility even when the information is shared with or provided to other
organizations. The owner/steward of the information processed, stored, or transmitted by an
information system may or may not be the same as the system owner. A single information
system may contain information from multiple information owners/stewards. Information
owners/stewards provide input to information system owners regarding the security requirements
and security controls for the systems where the information is processed, stored, or transmitted.




52
  Federal information is an asset of the Nation, not of a particular federal agency or its subordinate organizations. In
that spirit, many federal agencies are developing policies, procedures, processes, and training needed to end the practice
of information ownership and implement the practice of information stewardship. Information stewardship is the
careful and responsible management of federal information belonging to the Nation as a whole, regardless of the entity
or source that may have originated, created, or compiled the information. Information stewards provide maximum
access to federal information to elements of the federal government and its customers, balanced by the obligation to
protect the information in accordance with the provisions of FISMA and any associated security-related federal
policies, directives, regulations, standards, and guidance.

D.5 SENIOR INFORMATION SECURITY OFFICER
The senior information security officer is an organizational official responsible for: (i) carrying
out the chief information officer security responsibilities under FISMA; and (ii) serving as the
primary liaison for the chief information officer to the organization’s authorizing officials,
information system owners, common control providers, and information system security officers.
The senior information security officer: (i) possesses professional qualifications, including
training and experience, required to administer the information security program functions; (ii)
maintains information security duties as a primary responsibility; and (iii) heads an office with
the mission and resources to assist the organization in achieving more secure information and
information systems in accordance with the requirements in FISMA. The senior information
security officer (or supporting staff members) may also serve as authorizing official designated
representatives or security control assessors. The role of senior information security officer has
inherent U.S. Government authority and is assigned to government personnel only.

D.6 AUTHORIZING OFFICIAL
The authorizing official is a senior official or executive with the authority to formally assume
responsibility for operating an information system at an acceptable level of risk to organizational
operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. 53 Authorizing officials
typically have budgetary oversight for an information system or are responsible for the mission
and/or business operations supported by the system. Through the security authorization process,
authorizing officials are accountable for the security risks associated with information system
operations. Accordingly, authorizing officials are in management positions with a level of
authority commensurate with understanding and accepting such information system-related
security risks. Authorizing officials also approve security plans, memorandums of agreement or
understanding, and plans of action and milestones and determine whether significant changes in
the information systems or environments of operation require reauthorization. Authorizing
officials can deny authorization to operate an information system or if the system is operational,
halt operations, if unacceptable risks exist. Authorizing officials coordinate their activities with
the risk executive (function), chief information officer, senior information security officer,
common control providers, information system owners, information system security officers,
security control assessors, and other interested parties during the security authorization process.
With the increasing complexity of missions/business processes, partnership arrangements, and the
use of external/shared services, it is possible that a particular information system may involve
multiple authorizing officials. If so, agreements are established among the authorizing officials
and documented in the security plan. Authorizing officials are responsible for ensuring that all
activities and functions associated with security authorization that are delegated to authorizing
official designated representatives are carried out. The role of authorizing official has inherent
U.S. Government authority and is assigned to government personnel only.

D.7 AUTHORIZING OFFICIAL DESIGNATED REPRESENTATIVE
The authorizing official designated representative is an organizational official that acts on behalf
of an authorizing official to coordinate and conduct the required day-to-day activities associated
with the security authorization process. Authorizing official designated representatives can be
empowered by authorizing officials to make certain decisions with regard to the planning and
resourcing of the security authorization process, approval of the security plan, approval and
monitoring the implementation of plans of action and milestones, and the assessment and/or

53
   The responsibility of authorizing officials described in FIPS 200, was extended in NIST Special Publication 800-53
to include risks to other organizations and the Nation.

determination of risk. The designated representative may also be called upon to prepare the final
authorization package, obtain the authorizing official’s signature on the authorization decision
document, and transmit the authorization package to appropriate organizational officials. The
only activity that cannot be delegated to the designated representative by the authorizing official
is the authorization decision and signing of the associated authorization decision document (i.e.,
the acceptance of risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations,
and the Nation).

D.8 COMMON CONTROL PROVIDER
The common control provider is an individual, group, or organization responsible for the
development, implementation, assessment, and monitoring of common controls (i.e., security
controls inherited by information systems). 54 Common control providers are responsible for: (i)
documenting the organization-identified common controls in a security plan (or equivalent
document prescribed by the organization); (ii) ensuring that required assessments of common
controls are carried out by qualified assessors with an appropriate level of independence defined
by the organization; (iii) documenting assessment findings in a security assessment report; and
(iv) producing a plan of action and milestones for all controls having weaknesses or deficiencies.
Security plans, security assessment reports, and plans of action and milestones for common
controls (or a summary of such information) is made available to information system owners
inheriting those controls after the information is reviewed and approved by the senior official or
executive with oversight responsibility for those controls.

D.9 INFORMATION SYSTEM OWNER
The information system owner is an organizational official responsible for the procurement,
development, integration, modification, operation, maintenance, and disposal of an information
system. 55 The information system owner is responsible for addressing the operational interests of
the user community (i.e., users who require access to the information system to satisfy mission,
business, or operational requirements) and for ensuring compliance with information security
requirements. In coordination with the information system security officer, the information
system owner is responsible for the development and maintenance of the security plan and
ensures that the system is deployed and operated in accordance with the agreed-upon security
controls. In coordination with the information owner/steward, the information system owner is
also responsible for deciding who has access to the system (and with what types of privileges or
access rights) 56 and ensures that system users and support personnel receive the requisite security
training (e.g., instruction in rules of behavior). Based on guidance from the authorizing official,
the information system owner informs appropriate organizational officials of the need to conduct
the security authorization, ensures that the necessary resources are available for the effort, and
provides the required information system access, information, and documentation to the security

54
   Organizations can have multiple common control providers depending on how information security responsibilities
are allocated organization-wide. Common control providers may also be information system owners when the common
controls are resident within an information system. Common controls are described in Section 2.4.
55
   The information system owner serves as the focal point for the information system. In that capacity, the information
system owner serves both as an owner and as the central point of contact between the authorization process and the
owners of components of the system including, for example: (i) applications, networking, servers, or workstations; (ii)
owners/stewards of information processed, stored, or transmitted by the system; and (iii) owners of the missions and
business functions supported by the system. Some organizations may refer to information system owners as program
managers or business/asset owners.
56
   The responsibility for deciding who has access to specific information within an information system (and with what
types of privileges or access rights) may reside with the information owner/steward.

control assessor. The information system owner receives the security assessment results from the
security control assessor. After taking appropriate steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerabilities, the
information system owner assembles the authorization package and submits the package to the
authorizing official or the authorizing official designated representative for adjudication.57

D.10 INFORMATION SYSTEM SECURITY OFFICER
The information system security officer 58 is an individual responsible for ensuring that the
appropriate operational security posture is maintained for an information system and as such,
works in close collaboration with the information system owner. The information system security
officer also serves as a principal advisor on all matters, technical and otherwise, involving the
security of an information system. The information system security officer has the detailed
knowledge and expertise required to manage the security aspects of an information system and, in
many organizations, is assigned responsibility for the day-to-day security operations of a system.
This responsibility may also include, but is not limited to, physical and environmental protection,
personnel security, incident handling, and security training and awareness. The information
system security officer may be called upon to assist in the development of the security policies
and procedures and to ensure compliance with those policies and procedures. In close
coordination with the information system owner, the information system security officer often
plays an active role in the monitoring of a system and its environment of operation to include
developing and updating the security plan, managing and controlling changes to the system, and
assessing the security impact of those changes.

D.11 INFORMATION SECURITY ARCHITECT
The information security architect is an individual, group, or organization responsible for
ensuring that the information security requirements necessary to protect the organization’s core
missions and business processes are adequately addressed in all aspects of enterprise architecture
including reference models, segment and solution architectures, and the resulting information
systems supporting those missions and business processes. The information security architect
serves as the liaison between the enterprise architect and the information system security engineer
and also coordinates with information system owners, common control providers, and
information system security officers on the allocation of security controls as system-specific,
hybrid, or common controls. In addition, information security architects, in close coordination
with information system security officers, advise authorizing officials, chief information officers,
senior information security officers, and the risk executive (function), on a range of security-
related issues including, for example, establishing information system boundaries, assessing the
severity of weaknesses and deficiencies in the information system, plans of action and milestones,
risk mitigation approaches, security alerts, and potential adverse effects of identified
vulnerabilities.




57
   Depending on how the organization has organized its security authorization activities, the authorizing official may
choose to designate an individual other than the information system owner to compile and assemble the information for
the security authorization package. In this situation, the designated individual must coordinate the compilation and
assembly activities with the information system owner.
58
   Organizations may also define an information system security manager or information security manager role with
similar responsibilities as an information system security officer or with oversight responsibilities for an information
security program. In these situations, information system security officers may, at the discretion of the organization,
report directly to information system security managers or information security managers.

D.12 INFORMATION SYSTEM SECURITY ENGINEER
The information system security engineer is an individual, group, or organization responsible for
conducting information system security engineering activities. Information system security
engineering is a process that captures and refines information security requirements and ensures
that the requirements are effectively integrated into information technology component products
and information systems through purposeful security architecting, design, development, and
configuration. Information system security engineers are an integral part of the development team
(e.g., integrated project team) designing and developing organizational information systems or
upgrading legacy systems. Information system security engineers employ best practices when
implementing security controls within an information system including software engineering
methodologies, system/security engineering principles, secure design, secure architecture, and
secure coding techniques. System security engineers coordinate their security-related activities
with information security architects, senior information security officers, information system
owners, common control providers, and information system security officers.

D.13 SECURITY CONTROL ASSESSOR
The security control assessor 59 is an individual, group, or organization responsible for conducting
a comprehensive assessment of the management, operational, and technical security controls and
control enhancements employed within or inherited by an information system to determine the
overall effectiveness of the controls (i.e., the extent to which the controls are implemented
correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the
security requirements for the system). Security control assessors also provide an assessment of
the severity of weaknesses or deficiencies discovered in the information system and its
environment of operation and recommend corrective actions to address identified vulnerabilities.
In addition to the above responsibilities, security control assessors prepare the final security
assessment report containing the results and findings from the assessment. Prior to initiating the
security control assessment, an assessor conducts an assessment of the security plan to help
ensure that the plan provides a set of security controls for the information system that meet the
stated security requirements.

The required level of assessor independence is determined by the specific conditions of the
security control assessment. For example, when the assessment is conducted in support of an
authorization decision or ongoing authorization, the authorizing official makes an explicit
determination of the degree of independence required in accordance with federal policies,
directives, standards, and guidelines. Assessor independence is an important factor in: (i)
preserving the impartial and unbiased nature of the assessment process; (ii) determining the
credibility of the security assessment results; and (iii) ensuring that the authorizing official
receives the most objective information possible in order to make an informed, risk-based,
authorization decision. The information system owner and common control provider rely on the
security expertise and the technical judgment of the assessor to: (i) assess the security controls
employed within and inherited by the information system using assessment procedures specified
in the security assessment plan; and (ii) provide specific recommendations on how to correct
weaknesses or deficiencies in the controls and address identified vulnerabilities.


59
  Security control assessors may be called certification agents in some organizations. At the discretion of the
organization, security control assessors may be given additional duties/responsibilities for the post processing and
analysis of security control assessment findings and results. This may include, for example, making specific
determinations for or recommendations to authorizing officials (known in some communities of interest as certification
recommendations or certification determinations).

SECURITY AUTHORIZATION
AUTHORIZATION DECISIONS AND SUPPORTING EVIDENCE




T      his appendix provides information on the security authorization process to include: (i) the
       content of the authorization package; (ii) types of authorization decisions; (iii) the content
       of the authorization decision document; and (iv) maintenance of authorizations through
continuous monitoring processes and conditions for reauthorization.

F.1 AUTHORIZATION PACKAGE
The security authorization package documents the results of the security control assessment and
provides the authorizing official with essential information needed to make a risk-based decision
on whether to authorize operation of an information system or a designated set of common
controls. Unless specifically designated otherwise by the chief information officer or authorizing
official, the information system owner or common control provider is responsible for the
assembly, compilation, and submission of the authorization package. The information system
owner or common control provider receives inputs from the information system security officer,
security control assessor, senior information security officer, and risk executive (function) during
the preparation of the authorization package. The authorization package 60 contains the following
documents:
•    Security plan;
•    Security assessment report; and
•    Plan of action and milestones.

The security plan, prepared by the information system owner or common control provider,
provides an overview of the security requirements and describes the security controls in place or
planned for meeting those requirements. The plan provides sufficient information to understand
the intended or actual implementation of each security control employed within or inherited by
the information system. 61 The security plan also contains as supporting appendices or as
references to appropriate sources, other risk and security-related documents such as a risk
assessment, privacy impact assessment, system interconnection agreements, contingency plan,
security configurations, configuration management plan, incident response plan, and continuous
monitoring strategy. In accordance with the near real-time risk management objectives of the
security authorization process, the security plan is updated whenever events dictate changes to the
security controls employed within or inherited by the information system. Updates to the security
plan may be triggered by a variety of events, including for example: (i) a vulnerability scan of the
information system or vulnerability assessment of the environment of operation; (ii) new threat
information; (iii) weaknesses or deficiencies discovered in currently deployed security controls

60
   The authorizing official determines what additional supporting documentation or references may be required to be
included in the security authorization package. Appropriate measures are employed to protect information contained in
security authorization packages in accordance with federal and organizational policy.
61
  The security plan is a conceptual body of information which may be accounted for within one or more repositories
and include documents (electronic or hard copy) that come from a variety of sources produced throughout the system
development life cycle. For example, information system owners inheriting common controls can either document the
implementation of the controls in their respective security plans or reference the controls contained in the security plans
of common control providers.

after an information system breach; (iv) a redefinition of mission priorities or business objectives
invalidating the results of the previous security categorization process; and (v) a change in the
information system (e.g., adding new hardware, software, or firmware; establishing new
connections) or its environment of operation (e.g., moving to a new facility).

The security assessment report, prepared by the security control assessor, provides the results of
assessing the implementation of the security controls identified in the security plan to determine
the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing
the desired outcome with respect to meeting the specified security requirements. The security
assessment report also contains a list of recommended corrective actions for any weaknesses or
deficiencies identified in the security controls. 62 Supporting the near real-time risk management
objectives of the security authorization process, the security assessment report is updated on an
ongoing basis whenever changes are made to the security controls employed within or inherited
by the information system. 63 Updates to the security assessment report help to ensure that the
information system owner, common control provider, and authorizing officials maintain the
appropriate awareness with regard to security control effectiveness. The overall effectiveness of
the security controls directly affects the ultimate security state of the information system and
decisions regarding explicit acceptance of risk.

The plan of action and milestones, prepared by the information system owner or common control
provider, describes the specific measures planned: (i) to correct weaknesses or deficiencies noted
in the security controls during the assessment; and (ii) to address known vulnerabilities in the
information system. 64 The content and structure of plans of action and milestones are informed by
the organizational risk management strategy developed as part of the risk executive (function)
and is consistent with the plans of action and milestones process established by the organization
and any specific requirements defined in federal policies, directives, memoranda, or regulations.
The most effective plans of action and milestones contain a robust set of actual weaknesses or
deficiencies identified in the security controls employed within or inherited by the information
system. Assuming that most information systems and the environments in which those systems
are deployed, have more vulnerabilities than available resources can realistically address,
organizations define a strategy for developing and implementing plans of action and milestones
that facilitates a prioritized approach to risk mitigation and that is consistent across the
organization. This strategy helps to ensure that plans of action and milestones are based on:
•      The security categorization of the information system;
•      The specific weaknesses or deficiencies in the security controls;
•      The importance of the identified security control weaknesses or deficiencies (i.e., the direct or
       indirect effect the weaknesses or deficiencies may have on the overall security state of the
       information system and hence on the risk exposure 65 of the organization);


62
  Organizations may choose to develop an executive summary from the detailed findings that are generated during a
security control assessment. An executive summary provides an authorizing official with an abbreviated version of the
security assessment report focusing on the highlights of the assessment, synopsis of key findings, and recommendations
for addressing weaknesses and deficiencies in the security controls.
63
     Organizations maintain strict version control as critical documents in the authorization package are updated.
64
  Organizations may choose to document the specific measures implemented to correct weaknesses or deficiencies in
security controls in the plan of action and milestones, thereby providing an historical record of actions completed.
65
  In general, risk exposure is the degree to which an organization is threatened by the potential adverse effects on
organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation.

•      The organization’s proposed risk mitigation approach to address the identified weaknesses or
       deficiencies in the security controls (e.g., prioritization of risk mitigation actions, allocation
       of risk mitigation resources); and
•      The organization’s rationale for accepting certain weaknesses or deficiencies in the security
       controls. 66

Organizational strategies for plans of action and milestones are guided by the security categories
of the respective information systems affected by the risk mitigation activities. Organizations may
decide, for example, to allocate the vast majority of risk mitigation resources initially to the
highest-impact information systems because a failure to correct the weaknesses or deficiencies in
those systems could potentially have the most significant adverse effects on the organization’s
missions or business operations. Organizations also prioritize weaknesses or deficiencies using
information from organizational assessments of risk and the risk management strategy developed
as part of the risk executive (function). Therefore, a high-impact system would have a prioritized
list of weaknesses or deficiencies for that system, as would moderate-impact and low-impact
systems. In general, the plan of action and milestones strategy always addresses the highest-
priority weaknesses or deficiencies within those prioritized systems.

After completion of the security plan, security assessment report, and plan of action and
milestones, the information system owner or common control provider submits the final security
authorization package to the authorizing official or designated representative. Figure F-1
illustrates the key sections of the authorization package.

F.2 AUTHORIZATION DECISIONS
Authorization decisions are based on the content of the authorization package including inputs
from the organization’s risk executive (function) and any additional supporting documentation
required by the authorizing official. The security authorization package provides comprehensive
information on the security state of the information system. Risk executive (function) inputs,
including the previously established overarching risk guidance derived from the risk management
strategy, provide additional information to the authorizing official that may be relevant and affect
the final authorization decision (e.g., organizational risk tolerance, organization’s overall risk
mitigation strategy, core mission and business requirements, dependencies among information
systems, ongoing risk monitoring requirements, and other types of risks not directly associated

66
     Organizations document their rationale for accepting security control weakness or deficiencies.

with the information system or its environment of operation). Risk executive (function) inputs are
documented and become part of the authorization decision. Organizations determine how the risk
management strategy and risk-related guidance from the risk executive (function)
influences/impacts the authorization decisions of authorizing officials. Security authorization
decisions are conveyed to information system owners and common control providers and are
made available to selected officials within the organization (e.g., information system owners
inheriting common controls, authorizing officials for interconnected systems, chief information
officers, senior information security officers, information owners/stewards). There are two types
of authorization decisions that can be rendered by authorizing officials:
•    Authorization to operate; 67 and
•    Denial of authorization to operate.

Authorization to Operate
If the authorizing official, after reviewing the authorization package and any additional inputs
provided by the risk executive (function), deems that the risk to organizational operations and
assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation is acceptable, an authorization to operate
is issued for the information system or for the common controls inherited by organizational
information systems. The information system is authorized to operate for a specified time period
in accordance with the terms and conditions established by the authorizing official. 68 For common
control providers external to an information system, the authorization decision means that the
common controls under their control are approved for inheritance by organizational information
systems. An authorization termination date is also established by the authorizing official as a
condition of authorization. The authorization termination date can be adjusted by the authorizing
official to reflect an increased level of concern regarding the security state of the information
system including the security control employed within or inherited by the system. Authorization
termination dates do not exceed the maximum allowable time periods for authorization
established by federal or organizational policy.

The authorizing official takes specific actions to reduce or eliminate vulnerabilities identified
during the execution of the Risk Management Framework unless the vulnerabilities have been
explicitly accepted as part of the authorization decision. In addition, the information system
owner or common control provider establishes a disciplined, structured, and repeatable process to
monitor the ongoing effectiveness of the deployed security controls and the progress of any
actions taken to correct or eliminate weaknesses or deficiencies. The plan of action and
milestones submitted by the information system owner is used by the authorizing official to
monitor the progress in correcting deficiencies and weaknesses noted during the security control
assessment.




67
   An interim authorization to test is a special type of authorization decision allowing an information system to operate
in an operational environment for the express purpose of testing the system with actual operational (i.e., live) data for a
specified time period. An interim authorization to test is granted by an authorizing official only when the operational
environment or live data is required to complete specific test objectives.
68
   Some organizations may choose to use the term interim authorization to operate to focus attention on the increased
risk being accepted by the authorizing official in situations where there are significant weaknesses or deficiencies in the
information system, but an overarching mission necessity requires placing the system into operation or continuing its

________________________________________________________________________________________________

Denial of Authorization to Operate
If the authorizing official, after reviewing the authorization package and any additional inputs
provided by the risk executive (function), deems that the risk to organizational operations and
assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation is unacceptable and immediate steps
cannot be taken to reduce the risk to an acceptable level, a denial of authorization to operate is
issued for the information system or for the common controls inherited by organizational
information systems. The information system is not authorized to operate and is not placed into
operation. If the system is currently in operation, all activity is halted. For common control
providers external to an information system, the authorization decision means that the common
controls under their control are not approved for inheritance by organizational information
systems. Failure to receive an authorization to operate indicates that there are major weaknesses
or deficiencies in the security controls employed within or inherited by the information system.
The authorizing official or designated representative works with the information system owner or
common control provider to revise the plan of action and milestones to ensure that appropriate
measures are taken to correct the identified weaknesses or deficiencies.

A special case of a denial of authorization to operate is an authorization rescission. Authorizing
officials can rescind a previous authorization decision at any time in situations where there is a
specific violation of: (i) federal/organizational security policies, directives, regulations, standards,
guidance, or practices; or (ii) the terms and conditions of the original authorization. For example,
failure to maintain an effective continuous monitoring program may be grounds for rescinding an
authorization decision. Authorizing officials consult with the risk executive (function) and the
senior information security officer before rescinding security authorizations.

F.3 AUTHORIZATION DECISION DOCUMENT
The authorization decision document transmits the final security authorization decision from the
authorizing official to the information system owner or common control provider and other key
organizational officials, as appropriate. The authorization decision document contains the
following information:
•      Authorization decision;
•      Terms and conditions for the authorization;
•      Authorization termination date; and
•      Risk executive (function) input (if provided).

The security authorization decision indicates whether the information system is: (i) authorized to
operate; or (ii) not authorized to operate. For common controls, the authorization decision means
that the controls are approved for inheritance by organizational information systems. The terms
and conditions for the authorization provide a description of any limitations or restrictions placed
on the operation of the information system or the implementation of common controls that must
be followed by the system owner or common control provider. The authorization termination
date, established by the authorizing official, indicates when the security authorization expires and
reauthorization is required. An authorizing official designated representative prepares the
authorization decision document for the authorizing official with authorization recommendations,
as appropriate. The authorization decision document is attached to the original authorization
package and transmitted to the information system owner or common control provider. 69

69
     Authorization decision documents may be digitally signed to ensure authenticity.

________________________________________________________________________________________________

Upon receipt of the authorization decision document and authorization package, the information
system owner or common control provider acknowledges and implements the terms and
conditions of the authorization and notifies the authorizing official. The information system
owner or common control provider retains the original authorization decision document and
authorization package. 70 The organization ensures that authorization documents for information
systems and for common controls are available to appropriate organizational officials (e.g.,
information system owners inheriting common controls, the risk executive [function], chief
information officers, senior information security officers, information system security officers).
The contents of the security authorization documentation, especially information regarding
information system vulnerabilities, are: (i) marked and appropriately protected in accordance with
federal/organizational policy; and (ii) retained in accordance with the organization’s record
retention policy. The authorizing official verifies on an ongoing basis, that the terms and
conditions established as part of the authorization are being followed by the information system
owner or common control provider.

F.4 ONGOING AUTHORIZATION
A robust and comprehensive continuous monitoring 71 strategy integrated into the organization’s
system development life cycle process, promotes risk management on an ongoing basis and can
significantly reduce the resources required for reauthorization, if required. Using automation and
state-of-the-practice tools, techniques, and procedures, risk management can become near real-
time with ongoing monitoring of security controls and changes to the information system and its
environment of operation. When monitoring is conducted in accordance with the needs of the
authorizing official, that monitoring results in the production of key information needed to
determine: (i) the current security state of the information system (including the effectiveness of
the security controls employed within and inherited by the system); (ii) the resulting risks to
organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation;
and (iii) whether to authorize continued operation of the system or continued use of common
controls inherited by organizational information systems. Organizations provide an official
designation (including any approvals required) for information systems that have transitioned
from initial authorization to operate into an ongoing authorization approach.

Continuous monitoring also helps to amortize the resource expenditures for reauthorization
activities over the authorization period. The ultimate objective is to achieve a state of ongoing
authorization where the authorizing official maintains sufficient knowledge of the current
security state of the information system (including the effectiveness of the security controls
employed within and inherited by the system) to determine whether continued operation is
acceptable based on ongoing risk determinations, and if not, which step or steps in the Risk
Management Framework needs to be re-executed in order to effectively respond to the additional
risk. Formal reauthorization actions are avoided in situations where the continuous monitoring
process provides authorizing officials the necessary information to manage the potential risk
arising from changes to the information system or its environment of operation. Organizations
maximize the use of status reports and security state information produced during the continuous
monitoring process to minimize the level of effort required if a formal reauthorization action is
required.


70
 Organizations may choose to employ automated tools to support the development, distribution, and archiving of risk
management documentation to include artifacts associated with the security authorization process.
71
   Continuous monitoring is described in Appendix G. NIST Special Publication 800-137 provides additional guidance
for Information Security Continuous Monitoring Programs.



APPENDIX F                                                                                                  PAGE F-6

________________________________________________________________________________________________

When an information system is under ongoing authorization, the system may be authorized for
ongoing operation on a time-driven or event-driven basis, leveraging the security-related
information generated by the continuous monitoring program. The system is reviewed and
authorized for ongoing operation on a time-driven basis in accordance with the authorization
frequency determined as part of the continuous monitoring strategy. The system is reviewed and
authorized for ongoing operation on an event-driven basis when pre-defined (trigger) events
occur or at the discretion of the authorizing official. Whether the authorization for ongoing
operation is time-driven or event-driven, the authorizing official acknowledges ongoing
acceptance of identified risks. The organization determines the level of formality required for
such acknowledgement by the authorizing official.

F.5 REAUTHORIZATION
Formal reauthorization actions occur at the discretion of the authorizing official in accordance
with federal or organizational policy. If a formal reauthorization action is required, organizations
maximize the use of security and risk-related information produced as part of the continuous
monitoring processes currently in effect. Formal reauthorization actions, if initiated, can be either
time-driven or event-driven. Time-driven reauthorizations occur when the authorization
termination date is reached (if one is specified). If the information system is under ongoing
authorization (i.e., a continuous monitoring program is in place that monitors all implemented
common, hybrid, and system-specific controls with the frequency specified in the continuous
monitoring strategy), time-driven reauthorizations may not be necessary. However, if the
continuous monitoring program is not yet comprehensive enough to fully support ongoing
authorization, a maximum authorization period can be specified by the authorizing official.
Authorization termination dates are influenced by federal and/or organizational policies and by
the requirements of authorizing officials which may establish maximum authorization periods.

For security control assessments associated with reauthorization, organizations leverage security-
related information generated by the existing continuous monitoring program and fill in any gaps
with manual or procedural assessments. Organizations may also supplement automatically-
generated information with manually/procedurally-generated assessment information in situations
where greater assurance is needed. If the security control assessments are conducted by qualified
assessors with the required degree of independence based on federal/organizational policies,
appropriate security standards and guidelines, and the needs of the authorizing official, the
assessment results can be cumulatively applied to the reauthorization. 72 The reauthorization action
can be as simple as updating the security status information in the authorization package (i.e., the
security plan, security assessment report, and plan of action and milestones). The authorizing
official subsequently signs an updated authorization decision document based on the current
determination and acceptance of risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other
organizations, and the Nation. 73

In the event that there is a change in authorizing officials, the new authorizing official reviews the
current authorization decision document, authorization package, and any updated documents
created as a result of the ongoing monitoring activities. If the new authorizing official is willing
to accept the currently documented risk, then the official signs a new authorization decision
document, thus formally transferring responsibility and accountability for the information system

72
   NIST Special Publication 800-53A describes the specific conditions when security-related information can be reused
in security authorizations, ongoing authorizations, and reauthorizations.
73
   Decisions to initiate a formal reauthorization action include inputs from the risk executive (function) and the senior
information security officer.



APPENDIX F                                                                                                        PAGE F-7

or the common controls inherited by organizational information systems and explicitly accepting
the risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.
If the new authorizing official is not willing to accept the previous authorization results (including
identified level of risk), a reauthorization action may need to be initiated or the new authorizing
official may instead establish new terms and conditions for continuing the original authorization,
but not extend the original authorization termination date. In all situations where there is a
decision to reauthorize an information system or the common controls inherited by organizational
information systems, the maximum reuse of authorization information is strongly encouraged to
minimize the time and expense associated with the reauthorization effort. 74

F.6 EVENT-DRIVEN TRIGGERS
Organizations may define event-driven triggers (i.e., indicators and/or prompts that cause a pre-
defined organizational reaction) for both ongoing authorization and reauthorization. Event-driven
triggers include, but are not limited to: (i) new threat/vulnerability/impact information; (ii) an
increased number of findings, weaknesses, and/or deficiencies from the continuous monitoring
program; (iii) new missions/business requirements; (iv) a change in the Authorizing Official; (v)
a significant change in risk assessment findings; (vi) significant changes to the information
system, common controls, or the environment of operation; or (vii) organizational thresholds
being exceeded.

A significant change is defined as a change that is likely to affect the security state of an
information system. Significant changes to an information system may include for example: (i)
installation of a new or upgraded operating system, middleware component, or application; (ii)
modifications to system ports, protocols, or services; (iii) installation of a new or upgraded
hardware platform; (iv) modifications to cryptographic modules or services; or (v) modifications
to security controls. Examples of significant changes to the environment of operation may include
for example: (i) moving to a new facility; (ii) adding new core missions or business functions;
(iii) acquiring specific and credible threat information that the organization is being targeted by a
threat source; or (iv) establishing new/modified laws, directives, policies, or regulations. 75

If a formal reauthorization action is initiated, the organization targets only the specific security
controls affected by the changes and reuses previous assessment results wherever possible. Most
routine changes to an information system or its environment of operation can be handled by the
organization’s continuous monitoring program, thus supporting the concept of ongoing
authorization. An effective monitoring program can significantly reduce the overall cost and level
of effort of reauthorization actions.

F.7 TYPE AUTHORIZATION
A type authorization 76 is an official authorization decision to employ identical copies of an
information system or subsystem (including hardware, software, firmware, and/or applications) in
74
   The decision to initiate a formal reauthorization action can be based on a variety of factors, including for example,
the acceptability of the previous authorization information provided in the authorization package, the length of time
since the previous authorization decision, the risk tolerance of the new authorizing official, and current organizational
requirements and/or priorities.
75
   The examples of changes listed above are only significant when they meet the threshold established in the definition
of significant change (i.e., a change that is likely to affect the security state of the information system).
76
   Examples of type authorizations include: (i) an authorization of the hardware and software applications for a standard
financial system deployed in several locations around the world; or (ii) an authorization of a common workstation or
operating environment (i.e., hardware, operating system, middleware, and applications) deployed to all operating units
within an organization.

specified environments of operation. This form of authorization allows a single authorization
package (i.e., security plan, security assessment report, and plan of action and milestones) to be
developed for an archetype (common) version of an information system that is deployed to
multiple locations, along with a set of installation and configuration requirements or operational
security needs, that will be assumed by the hosting organization at a specific location. The type
authorization is used in conjunction with the authorization of site-specific controls (e.g., physical
and environmental protection controls, personnel security controls) inherited by the information
system. 77 The RMF tasks listed in Chapter 3 address the authorization activities associated with
the employment of system-specific, hybrid, and common controls.

F.8 AUTHORIZATION APPROACHES
Organizations can choose from three different approaches when planning for and conducting
security authorizations to include: (i) an authorization with a single authorizing official; (ii) an
authorization with multiple authorizing officials; or (iii) leveraging an existing authorization. 78
The first approach is the traditional authorization process defined in this appendix where a single
organizational official in a senior leadership position is both responsible and accountable for an
information system. The organizational official also accepts the information system-related
security risks that may impact organizational operations and assets, individuals, other
organizations, or the Nation.

The second approach, or joint authorization, is employed when multiple organizational officials
either from the same organization or different organizations, have a shared interest in authorizing
an information system. The organizational officials collectively are responsible and accountable
for the information system and jointly accept the information system-related security risks that
may adversely impact organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and
the Nation. A similar authorization process is followed as in the first approach with the essential
difference being the addition of multiple authorizing officials. Organizations choosing a joint
authorization approach are expected to work together on the planning and the execution of RMF
tasks (see Appendix H) and to document their agreement and progress in implementing the tasks.
Collaborating on the security categorization, selection of security controls, plan for assessing the
controls to determine effectiveness, plan of action and milestones, and continuous monitoring
strategy, is necessary for a successful joint authorization. The specific terms and conditions of the
joint authorization are established by the participating parties in the joint authorization including
for example, the process for ongoing determination and acceptance of risk. The joint
authorization remains in effect only as long as there is mutual agreement among authorizing
officials and the authorization meets the requirements established by federal and/or organizational
policies.

The final approach, leveraged authorization, is employed when a federal agency 79 chooses to
accept some or all of the information in an existing authorization package generated by another
federal agency (hereafter referred to as the owning organization80) based on a need to use the

77
     Site-specific controls are typically implemented by an organization as common controls.
78
 Authorization approaches can be applied to both information systems and to common controls inherited by one or
more organizational information systems.
79
  In this situation, federal agency includes any organizations that are subordinate to the agency. For example, NIST is a
subordinate organization to the Department of Commerce.
80
  The term owning organization refers to the federal agency or subordinate organization that owns the authorization
package. The information system may not be owned by the same organization that owns the authorization package, for
example, in situations where the system/services are provided by an external provider.

same information resources (e.g., information system and/or services provided by the system).
The leveraging organization reviews the owning organization’s authorization package as the basis
for determining risk to the leveraging organization. 81 When reviewing the authorization package,
the leveraging organization considers risk factors such as the time elapsed since the authorization
results were produced, the environment of operation (if different from the environment of
operation reflected in the authorization package), the criticality/sensitivity of the information to
be processed, stored, or transmitted, as well as the overall risk tolerance of the leveraging
organization. If the leveraging organization determines that there is insufficient information in the
authorization package or inadequate security measures in place for establishing an acceptable
level of risk, the leveraging organization may negotiate with the owning organization for
additional security measures and/or security-related information. 82 Additional security measures
may include, for example, increasing the number of security controls, conducting additional
assessments, implementing compensating controls, or establishing constraints on the use of the
information system or services provided by the system. Security-related information may include,
for example, other information that the owning organization may have discerned in the use or
assessment of the information system that is not reflected in the authorization package. The
additional security measures and/or security-related information may be provided by the
leveraging organization, the information system developer, some other external third party, or
some combination of the above.

The leveraged authorization approach provides opportunities for significant cost savings and
avoids a potentially costly and time-consuming authorization process by the leveraging
organization. Leveraging organizations generate an authorization decision document and
reference, as appropriate, information in the authorization package from the owning organization.
In situations where addition security measures are implemented, the leveraging organization
documents those measures by creating an addendum to the original authorization package of the
owning organization. This addendum may include, as appropriate, updates to the security plan,
security assessment report, and/or plan of action and milestones. Consistent with the traditional
authorization process described above, a single organizational official in a senior leadership
position in the leveraging organization is both responsible and accountable for accepting the
information system-related security risks that may impact the leveraging organization’s
operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation. The leveraged authorization
remains in effect as long as the leveraging organization accepts the information system-related
security risks and the authorization meets the requirements established by federal and/or
organizational policies. This requires the sharing of information resulting from continuous
monitoring activities conducted by the owning organization (e.g., updates to the security plan,
security assessment report, plan of action and milestones, and security status reports). To enhance
the security of all parties, the leveraging organization can also share with the owning
organization, the results from any RMF-related activities it conducts to supplement the
authorization results produced by the owning organization.

For all three authorization approaches described above, risk management-related activities
(including RMF tasks) involving external providers are carried out in accordance with the
guidance provided in Appendices H and I.


81
  The sharing of the authorization package (including the security plan, security assessment report, plan of action and
milestones, and authorization decision document) is accomplished under terms and conditions agreed upon by all
parties (i.e., the owning organization and the leveraging organization).
82
  Negotiations with the owning organization may include other organizations (e.g., when the information system
and/or services are provided to the owning organization in full or in part, by an external provider).

APPENDIX G

CONTINUOUS MONITORING
MANAGING AND TRACKING THE SECURITY STATE OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS




A
         critical aspect of managing risk to information from the operation and use of information
         systems involves the continuous monitoring of the security controls employed within or
         inherited by the system. 83 Conducting a thorough point-in-time assessment of the
deployed security controls is a necessary but not sufficient condition to demonstrate security due
diligence. An effective organizational information security program also includes a rigorous
continuous monitoring program integrated into the system development life cycle. The objective
of the continuous monitoring program is to determine if the set of deployed security controls
continue to be effective over time in light of the inevitable changes that occur. A well-designed
and well-managed continuous monitoring program can effectively transform an otherwise static
security control assessment and risk determination process into a dynamic process that provides
essential, near real-time security status-related information to organizational officials in order to
take appropriate risk mitigation actions and make cost-effective, risk-based decisions regarding
the operation of the information system. Continuous monitoring programs provide organizations
with an effective mechanism to update security plans, security assessment reports, and plans of
action and milestones. The following sections provide a general overview of some fundamental
concepts associated with continuous monitoring. NIST Special Publication 800-137 provides
additional guidance on the development and implementation of information security continuous
monitoring programs.

G.1 MONITORING STRATEGY
Organizations develop a strategy and implement a program for the continuous monitoring of
security control effectiveness. The monitoring program is integrated into the organization’s
system development life cycle processes. A robust continuous monitoring program requires the
active involvement of information system owners and common control providers, chief
information officers, senior information security officers, and authorizing officials. The
monitoring program allows an organization to: (i) track the security state of an information
system on a continuous basis; and (ii) maintain the security authorization for the system over time
in highly dynamic environments of operation with changing threats, vulnerabilities, technologies,
and missions/business processes.

Continuous monitoring of security controls using automated support tools facilitates near real-
time risk management and represents a significant change in the way security authorization
activities have been employed in the past. Near real-time risk management of information
systems can be facilitated by employing automated support tools to execute various steps in the
RMF including authorization-related activities. In addition to vulnerability scanning tools, system
and network monitoring tools, and other automated support tools that can help to determine the
security state of an information system, organizations can employ automated security
management and reporting tools to update key documents in the authorization package including
the security plan, security assessment report, and plan of action and milestones. The documents in
the authorization package are considered “living documents” and updated accordingly based on
actual events that may affect the security state of the information system.


83
 A continuous monitoring program within an organization involves a different set of activities than Security Incident
Monitoring or Security Event Monitoring programs.

________________________________________________________________________________________________

Timeliness is critical for near-real time risk management. Organizations are encouraged to
consolidate available information into measures that can be displayed as trend reports or other
types of dashboard visualization to assist decision makers with timely review and decision
making. Transitioning to a near real-time risk management environment requires the increased
use of automated support tools over time as organizations integrate these technologies into their
information security programs in accordance with available resources.

An effective organization-wide continuous monitoring program 84 includes:
•    Defining a continuous monitoring strategy based on risk tolerance that maintains clear
     visibility into assets, awareness of vulnerabilities, up-to-date threat information, and
     mission/business impacts;
•    Establishing and implementing a continuous monitoring program that includes monitoring all
     implemented controls at the organization-defined frequency; 85
•    Analyzing and reporting findings to appropriate organizational officials; 86
•    Responding to findings with mitigation, acceptance, transference/sharing, or
     avoidance/rejection; and
•    Reviewing and updating the continuous monitoring strategy and program to increase
     visibility into assets and awareness of vulnerabilities.

Continuous monitoring is a tactic in a larger strategy of organization-wide risk management.
Organizations increase situational awareness through enhanced monitoring capabilities and
subsequently increase insight into and control of the processes used to manage organizational
security.

G.2 FREQUENCY OF SECURITY CONTROL MONITORING
The criteria for determining the frequency of security control monitoring is established by the
information system owner or common control provider in collaboration with the authorizing
official or designated representative, chief information officer, senior information security officer,
and risk executive (function). The frequency criteria reflects the organization’s priorities and
importance of the information system (or in the case of common controls, the information
systems inheriting the controls) to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other
organizations, and the Nation in accordance with FIPS 199 or CNSS Instruction 1253.
Organizations may use recent risk assessments (including current threat and vulnerability
information), history of cyber attacks, results of previous security assessments, and operational
requirements in guiding the frequency of security control monitoring.

84
   Although the primary focus of continuous monitoring activities is on the effectiveness of security controls employed
within and inherited by an information system, there are other equally important external factors in the environment of
operation for a system that also require monitoring on an ongoing basis. These factors include, for example, changes in
the organization’s missions or business processes, changes in the threat space, and changes in tolerance for previously
accepted risks.
85
  Through the use of automation, it is possible to monitor a greater number of security controls on an ongoing basis
than is feasible using manual processes. As a result, organizations may choose to monitor a greater number of security
controls with increased frequency.
86
   Organizations have significant latitude and flexibility in the breadth, depth, and formality of security status reports.
At a minimum, security status reports describe or summarize key changes to security plans, security assessment reports,
and plans of action and milestones. At the discretion of the organization, security status reports on information systems
can be used to help satisfy the FISMA reporting requirement for documenting remedial actions on any security-related
weaknesses or deficiencies.

________________________________________________________________________________________________

While a comprehensive discussion of considerations for determining monitoring frequencies is
provided in NIST Special Publication 800-137, it is important to note that security controls that
have the greatest volatility and the controls that have been identified in the organization’s plan of
action and milestones are typically monitored more frequently. Security control volatility is a
measure of how frequently a control is likely to change over time subsequent to its
implementation. For example, security policies and procedures in a particular organization may
not be likely to change from one year to the next and thus would likely be security controls with
lower volatility. Access controls or other (technical) security controls that are subject to the direct
effects or side effects of frequent changes in hardware, software, and/or firmware components of
an information system would likely be controls with higher volatility and therefore, require more
frequent monitoring. Security controls identified in the plan of action and milestones are also a
priority in the continuous monitoring process, due to the fact that these controls have been
deemed to be ineffective to some degree. Such controls may also require more frequent
monitoring. The authorizing official or designated representative approves the set of security
controls that are to be monitored on an ongoing basis as well as the frequency of the monitoring
activities.

G.3 KEY DOCUMENT UPDATES AND STATUS REPORTING
Continuous monitoring results are considered with respect to any necessary updates to the
security plan, security assessment report, and plan of action and milestones, since these
documents are used to guide future risk management activities. Updated security plans reflect any
modifications to security controls based on the risk mitigation activities carried out by
information system owners or common control providers. Updated security assessment reports
reflect additional assessment activities conducted by assessors to determine security control
effectiveness based on modifications to the security plan and deployed controls. Updated plans of
action and milestones: (i) report progress made on the current outstanding items listed in the plan;
(ii) address vulnerabilities discovered during the security impact analysis or security control
monitoring; and (iii) describe how the information system owner or common control provider
intends to address those vulnerabilities. The results of monitoring activities are reported to
authorizing officials on an ongoing basis in the form of status reports. Other key organizational
officials (e.g., risk executive [function], senior information security officer) receive the results of
continuous monitoring activities as needed or as requested. With the use of automated support
tools and effective organization-wide security program management practices, authorizing
officials have the capability to access the most recent documentation in the authorization package
at any time to determine the current security state of the information system, to help manage risk,
and to provide essential information for potential reauthorization decisions. The monitoring of
security controls and changes to the information system and its environment of operation,
continues throughout the system development life cycle. Summaries of monitoring results are
provided to the senior information security officer and the risk executive (function).

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS
APPLYING THE RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK IN DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS




M          anaging risk to information from the operation and use of information systems in
           modern computing environments with a diverse set of potential business relationships
           can be challenging for organizations. Relationships are established and maintained in a
variety of ways, for example, through joint ventures, business partnerships, outsourcing
arrangements (i.e., through contracts, lines of business arrangements, interagency and intra-
agency agreements), licensing agreements, and supply chain arrangements.87 The Risk
Management Framework (RMF) applies only to federal information systems. There are two
distinct types of operational scenarios that affect how organizations address the RMF steps and
associated tasks:
• Information systems used or operated by federal agencies; 88 and
• Information systems used or operated by other organizations 89on behalf of federal agencies.

SCENARIO 1: For an information system that is used or operated by a federal agency, the system
boundary is defined by the agency. The agency conducts all RMF tasks to include information
system authorization. The agency maintains control over the security controls employed within
and inherited by the information system.

SCENARIO 2: For an information system that is used or operated by another organization on
behalf of a federal agency, the system boundary is defined by the agency in collaboration with the
other organization and one of the following situations applies:
- If the organization is contracted to a federal agency, the contractor can conduct all RMF tasks
  except those tasks which must be carried out by the federal agency as part of its inherent
  governmental responsibilities. 90 The agency provides RMF-related inputs to the contractor, as
  needed, and maintains strict oversight on all contractor-executed RMF tasks. The contractor
  provides appropriate evidence in the security authorization package for the authorization
  decision by the authorizing official from the federal agency.
- If the organization is a federal agency, the organization can conduct all RMF tasks to include
  the information system authorization. The information system authorization can also be a joint
  authorization if both parties agree to share the authorization responsibilities. In situations
  where a federal agency uses or operates an information system on behalf of multiple federal
  agencies, the joint authorization can include all participating agencies.




87
  NIST Special Publication 800-53 provides additional guidance on the application and use of security controls in
external environments to include relationships with external service providers.
88
     References to federal agencies include organizations that are subordinate to those agencies.
89
  Organizations that use or operate an information system on behalf of a federal agency or one of its subordinate
organizations can include, for example, other federal agencies or their subordinate organizations, state and local
government agencies, contractors, and academic institutions.
90
  Organizations ensure that requirements for conducting the specific tasks in the RMF are included in appropriate
contractual vehicles, including requirements for independent assessments, when appropriate.

SECURITY CONTROLS IN EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENTS
PARTNERSHIPS, OUTSOURCING, AND SUPPLY CHAIN CONSIDERATIONS




O
        rganizations are becoming increasingly reliant on information system services provided
        by external providers to carry out important missions and business functions. External
        information system services are services implemented outside of the authorization
boundaries established by the organization for its information systems. These external services
may be used by, but are not part of, organizational information systems. In some situations,
external information system services may completely replace the functionality of internal
information systems. Organizations are responsible and accountable for the risk incurred by use
of services provided by external providers and address this risk by implementing compensating
controls when the risk is greater than the authorizing official or the organization is willing to
accept.

Relationships with external service providers are established in a variety of ways, for example,
through joint ventures, business partnerships, outsourcing arrangements (i.e., through contracts,
interagency agreements, lines of business arrangements), licensing agreements, and/or supply
chain exchanges. The growing dependence on external service providers and new relationships
being forged with those providers present new and difficult challenges for the organization,
especially in the area of information system security. These challenges include:
•    Defining the types of external services provided to the organization;
•    Describing how the external services are protected in accordance with the security
     requirements of the organization; and
•    Obtaining the necessary assurances that the risk to organizational operations and assets,
     individuals, other organizations, and the Nation arising from the use of the external services
     is acceptable.

FISMA and OMB policy require external providers handling federal information or operating
information systems on behalf of the federal government to meet the same security requirements
as federal agencies. Security requirements for external providers including the security controls
for information systems processing, storing, or transmitting federal information are expressed in
appropriate contracts or other formal agreements. Organizations can require external providers to
implement all steps in the RMF with the exception of the security authorization step, which
remains an inherent federal responsibility that is directly linked to the management of risk related
to the use of external information system services. 91

The assurance or confidence that the risk from using external services is at an acceptable level
depends on the trust 92 that the organization places in the external service provider. In some cases,
the level of trust is based on the amount of direct control the organization is able to exert on the

91
  If the external provider is a federal agency, the provider can conduct all RMF tasks to include the information system
authorization (see Appendix H).
92
   The level of trust that an organization places in an external service provider can vary widely, ranging from those who
are highly trusted (e.g., business partners in a joint venture that share a common business model and common goals) to
those who are less trusted and represent greater sources of risk (e.g., business partners in one endeavor who are also
competitors in another market sector).

external service provider with regard to employment of security controls necessary for the
protection of the service and the evidence brought forth as to the effectiveness of those controls.
The level of control is usually established by the terms and conditions of the contract or service-
level agreement with the external service provider and can range from extensive (e.g., negotiating
a contract or agreement that specifies detailed security control requirements for the provider) to
very limited (e.g., using a contract or service-level agreement to obtain commodity services 93
such as commercial telecommunications services). In other cases, the level of trust is based on
factors that convince the organization that the requisite security controls have been employed and
that a determination of control effectiveness exists. For example, a separately authorized external
information system service provided to an organization through a well-established line of
business relationship may provide a degree of trust in the external service within the tolerable risk
range of the authorizing official.

The provision of services by external providers may result in some services without explicit
agreements between the organization and the external entities responsible for the services.
Whenever explicit agreements are feasible and practical (e.g., through contracts, service-level
agreements, etc.), the organization develops such agreements and requires the use of the security
controls in NIST Special Publication 800-53. When the organization is not in a position to require
explicit agreements with external providers (e.g., the service is imposed on the organization or the
service is commodity service), the organization establishes explicit assumptions about the service
capabilities with regard to security. In situations where an organization is procuring information
system services or technologies through a centralized acquisition vehicle (e.g., government-wide
contract by the General Services Administration or other preferred and/or mandatory acquisition
organization), it may be more efficient and cost-effective for the originator of the contract to
establish and maintain a stated level of trust with the external provider (including the definition of
required security controls and level of assurance with regard to the provision of such controls).
Organizations subsequently acquiring information system services or technologies from the
centralized contract can take advantage of the negotiated trust level established by the
procurement originator and thus avoid costly repetition of the activities necessary to establish
such trust. 94 Contracts and agreements between the organization and external providers may also
require the active participation of the organization. For example, the organization may be
required by the contract to install public key encryption-enabled client software recommended by
the service provider.

Ultimately, the responsibility for adequately mitigating unacceptable risks arising from the use of
external information system services remains with the authorizing official. Organizations require
that an appropriate chain of trust be established with external service providers when dealing with
the many issues associated with information system security. A chain of trust requires that the
organization establish and retain a level of confidence that each participating service provider in
the potentially complex consumer-provider relationship provides adequate protection for the
services rendered to the organization. The chain of trust can be complicated due to the number of

93
  Commercial providers of commodity-type services typically organize their business models and services around the
concept of shared resources and devices for a broad and diverse customer base. Therefore, unless organizations obtain
fully dedicated services from commercial service providers, there may be a need for greater reliance on compensating
security controls to provide the necessary protections for the information system that relies on those external services.
The organization’s risk assessment and risk mitigation activities reflect this situation.
94
   For example, a procurement originator could authorize an information system providing external services to the
federal government under specific terms and conditions of the contract. A federal agency requesting information
system services under the terms of the contract would not be required to reauthorize the information system when
acquiring such services (unless the request included services outside the scope of the original contract).

entities participating in the consumer-provider relationship and the type of relationship between
the parties. External service providers may also in turn outsource the services to other external
entities, making the chain of trust even more complicated and difficult to manage. Depending on
the nature of the service, it may simply be unwise for the organization to place significant trust in
the provider—not due to any inherent untrustworthiness on the provider's part, but due to the
intrinsic level of risk in the service. Where a sufficient level of trust cannot be established in the
external services and/or service providers, the organization: (i) employs compensating controls;
(ii) accepts a greater degree of risk; or (iii) does not obtain the service (i.e., performs missions or
business operations with reduced levels of functionality or possibly no functionality at all).
