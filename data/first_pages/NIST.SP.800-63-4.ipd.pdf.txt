100   Reports on Computer Systems Technology

101   The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and
102   Technology (NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical
103   leadership for the Nation’s measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops
104   tests, test methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations, and technical
105   analyses to advance the development and productive use of information technology. ITL’s
106   responsibilities include the development of management, administrative, technical, and
107   physical standards and guidelines for the cost-effective security and privacy of other
108   than national security-related information in federal information systems. The Special
109   Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research, guidelines, and outreach efforts in
110   information system security, and its collaborative activities with industry, government,
111   and academic organizations.

112   Abstract

113   These guidelines provide technical requirements for federal agencies implementing digital
114   identity services and are not intended to constrain the development or use of standards
115   outside of this purpose. The guidelines cover identity proofing and authentication of users
116   (such as employees, contractors, or private individuals) interacting with government
117   information systems over networks. They define technical requirements in each of
118   the areas of identity proofing, registration, authenticators, management processes,
119   authentication protocols, federation, and related assertions. This publication will
120   supersede NIST Special Publication 800-63-3.

121   Keywords

122   authentication; authentication assurance; authenticator; assertions; credential service
123   provider; digital authentication; digital credentials; identity proofing; federation;
124   passwords; PKI.

125   Note to Reviewers

126   The rapid proliferation of online services over the past few years has heightened the need
127   for reliable, equitable, secure, and privacy-protective digital identity solutions.
128   Revision 4 of NIST Special Publication 800-63, Digital Identity Guidelines, intends to
129   respond to the changing digital landscape that has emerged since the last major revision
130   of this suite was published in 2017 — including the real-world implications of online
131   risks. The guidelines present the process and technical requirements for meeting digital
132   identity management assurance levels for identity proofing, authentication, and federation,
133   including requirements for security and privacy as well as considerations for fostering
134   equity and the usability of digital identity solutions and technology.

      December 2022


135   Taking into account feedback provided in response to our June 2020 Pre-Draft Call
136   for Comments, as well as research conducted into real-world implementations of the
137   guidelines, market innovation, and the current threat environment, this draft seeks to:
138      1. Advance Equity: This draft seeks to expand upon the risk management content
139         of previous revisions and specifically mandates that agencies account for impacts
140         to individuals and communities in addition to impacts to the organization. It also
141         elevates risks to mission delivery – including challenges to providing services to
142         all people who are eligible for and entitled to them – within the risk management
143         process and when implementing digital identity systems. Additionally, the guidance
144         now mandates continuous evaluation of potential impacts across demographics,
145         provides biometric performance requirements, and additional parameters for the
146         responsible use of biometric-based technologies, such as those that utilize face
147         recognition.
148      2. Emphasize Optionality and Choice for Consumers: In the interest of promoting
149         and investigating additional scalable, equitable, and convenient identify verification
150         options, including those that do and do not leverage face recognition technologies,
151         this draft expands the list of acceptable identity proofing alternatives to provide
152         new mechanisms to securely deliver services to individuals with differing means,
153         motivations, and backgrounds. The revision also emphasizes the need for digital
154         identity services to support multiple authenticator options to address diverse
155         consumer needs and secure account recovery.
156      3. Deter Fraud and Advanced Threats: This draft enhances fraud prevention
157         measures from the third revision by updating risk and threat models to account
158         for new attacks, providing new options for phishing resistant authentication, and
159         introducing requirements to prevent automated attacks against enrollment processes.
160         It also opens the door to new technology such as mobile driver’s licenses and
161         verifiable credentials.
162      4. Address Implementation Lessons Learned: This draft addresses areas where
163         implementation experience has indicated that additional clarity or detail was
164         required to effectively operationalize the guidelines. This includes re-working
165         the federation assurance levels, providing greater detail on Trusted Referees,
166         clarifying guidelines on identity attribute validation sources, and improving address
167         confirmation requirements.
168   NIST is specifically interested in comments on and recommendations for the following
169   topics:
170   Identity Proofing and Enrollment
171       • NIST sees a need for inclusion of an unattended, fully remote Identity Assurance
172         Level (IAL) 2 identity proofing workflow that provides security and convenience,
173         but does not require face recognition. Accordingly, NIST seeks input on the
174         following questions:

                                                   ii
      NIST SP 800-63-4 ipd                                             Digital Identity Guidelines
      December 2022


175           – What technologies or methods can be applied to develop a remote, unattended
176             IAL2 identity proofing process that demonstrably mitigates the same risks as
177             the current IAL2 process?
178           – Are these technologies supported by existing or emerging technical standards?
179           – Do these technologies have established metrics and testing methodologies to
180             allow for assessment of performance and understanding of impacts across user
181             populations (e.g., bias in artificial intelligence)?
182      • What methods exist for integrating digital evidence (e.g., Mobile Driver’s Licenses,
183        Verifiable Credentials) into identity proofing at various identity assurance levels?
184      • What are the impacts, benefits, and risks of specifying a set of requirements
185        for CSPs to establish and maintain fraud detection, response, and notification
186        capabilities?
187           – Are there existing fraud checks (e.g., date of death) or fraud prevention
188             techniques (e.g., device fingerprinting) that should be incorporated as baseline
189             normative requirements? If so, at what assurance levels could these be
190             applied?
191           – How might emerging methods such as fraud analytics and risk scoring be
192             further researched, standardized, measured, and integrated into the guidance in
193             the future?
194           – What accompanying privacy and equity considerations should be addressed
195             alongside these methods?
196      • Are current testing programs for liveness detection and presentation attack
197        detection sufficient for evaluating the performance of implementations and
198        technologies?
199      • What impacts would the proposed biometric performance requirements for identity
200        proofing have on real-world implementations of biometric technologies?
201   Risk Management
202      • What additional guidance or direction can be provided to integrate digital identity
203        risk with enterprise risk management?
204      • How might equity, privacy, and usability impacts be integrated into the assurance
205        level selection process and digital identity risk management model?
206      • How might risk analytics and fraud mitigation techniques be integrated into the
207        selection of different identity assurance levels? How can we qualify or quantify
208        their ability to mitigate overall identity risk?
209   Authentication and Lifecycle Management

      December 2022


210      • Are emerging authentication models and techniques – such as FIDO passkey,
211        Verifiable Credentials, and mobile driver’s licenses – sufficiently addressed and
212        accommodated, as appropriate, by the guidelines? What are the potential associated
213        security, privacy, and usability benefits and risks?
214      • Are the controls for phishing resistance as defined in the guidelines for AAL2 and
215        AAL3 authentication clear and sufficient?
216      • How are session management thresholds and reauthentication requirements
217        implemented by agencies and organizations? Should NIST provide thresholds or
218        leave session lengths to agencies based on applications, users, and mission needs?
219      • What impacts would the proposed biometric performance requirements for this
220        volume have on real-world implementations of biometric technologies?
221   Federation and Assertions
222      • What additional privacy considerations (e.g., revocation of consent, limitations of
223        use) may be required to account for the use of identity and provisioning APIs that
224        had not previously been discussed in the guidelines?
225      • Is the updated text and introduction of “bound authenticators” sufficiently clear
226        to allow for practical implementations of federation assurance level (FAL) 3
227        transactions? What complications or challenges are anticipated based on the
228        updated guidance?
229   General
230      • Is there an element of this guidance that you think is missing or could be expanded?
231      • Is any language in the guidance confusing or hard to understand? Should we add
232        definitions or additional context to any language?
233      • Does the guidance sufficiently address privacy?
234      • Does the guidance sufficiently address equity?
235             – What equity assessment methods, impact evaluation models, or metrics
236               could we reference to better support organizations in preventing or detecting
237               disparate impacts that could arise as a result of identity verification
238               technologies or processes?
239      • What specific implementation guidance, reference architectures, metrics, or other
240        supporting resources may enable more rapid adoption and implementation of this
241        and future iterations of the Digital Identity Guidelines?
242      • What applied research and measurement efforts would provide the greatest impact
243        on the identity market and advancement of these guidelines?

262     b) assurance that a license to such essential patent claim(s) will be made available
263        to applicants desiring to utilize the license for the purpose of complying with the
264        guidance or requirements in this ITL draft publication either:

267           ii. without compensation and under reasonable terms and conditions that are
268               demonstrably free of any unfair discrimination.
269   Such assurance shall indicate that the patent holder (or third party authorized to make
270   assurances on its behalf) will include in any documents transferring ownership of patents
271   subject to the assurance, provisions sufficient to ensure that the commitments in the
272   assurance are binding on the transferee, and that the transferee will similarly include
273   appropriate provisions in the event of future transfers with the goal of binding each
274   successor-in-interest.
275   The assurance shall also indicate that it is intended to be binding on successors-in-interest
276   regardless of whether such provisions are included in the relevant transfer documents.

349   2.   Introduction
350   This section is informative.
351   As the line between the virtual world and physical world blurs, and as digital and
352   internet-enabled technologies continue to proliferate and connect, it is imperative that
353   developers and consumers alike understand this changing hybrid ecosystem - including its
354   associated opportunities and risks. Engagement across this ecosystem is often determined
355   by an individual’s ability and willingness to establish a digital identity - the unique
356   representation of a person engaged in an online transaction.
357   A digital identity is always unique in the context of a digital service but does not always
358   uniquely identify a person in all contexts. Further, while a digital identity may relay
359   unique and specific meaning within the context of a digital service, the real-life identity
360   of the individual behind the digital identity may not be known. For the purpose of this
361   publication, a “person” refers to natural persons only (i.e., not all legal persons.)
362   Establishing a digital identity is intended to demonstrate trust between the holder of
363   the digital identity and the person, organization, or system on the other side of the
364   digital transaction. However, this process can present challenges. As in relationships
365   and transactions in the physical world, there are multiple opportunities for mistakes,
366   miscommunication, impersonation, and other attacks that fraudulently claim another
367   person’s digital identity. Additionally, given the broad range of individual needs,
368   constraints, capacities, and preferences, digital services must be designed with equity
369   and flexibility in mind to ensure broad and enduring participation.
370   Risks associated with digital identity stretch beyond the potential impacts to enterprises
371   and should be incorporated into enterprise decision-making. This publication endeavors
372   to more robustly and explicitly account for risks to individuals, communities, and other
373   organizations. Specifically, while using this guidance, organizations should consider how
374   decisions related to digital identity that prioritize organizational cybersecurity objectives
375   might affect or need to accommodate other objectives, such as those related to privacy,
376   equity, usability, and other indicators of mission and business performance that center
377   the experiences of the individuals interacting with programs and services. By taking a
378   human-centered and continuously informed approach to mission delivery, organizations
379   have an opportunity to incrementally build trust with the variety of populations they serve,
380   improve customer satisfaction, identify issues more quickly, and provide individuals with
381   effective and culturally appropriate redress options.
382   These guidelines lay out a model for federal programs and other organizations to assess
383   and manage risks associated with digital identity systems, including the processes,
384   policies, data, people, and technologies that support digital identity management.
385   The model is supported by a series of processes: identity proofing, authentication,
386   and federation. The identity proofing process establishes that a subject is a specific
387   physical person. The digital authentication process determines the validity of one or

                                                   3
      NIST SP 800-63-4 ipd                                               Digital Identity Guidelines
      December 2022


388   more authenticators used to claim a digital identity and establishes confidence that a
389   subject attempting to access a digital service: (1) is in control of the technologies being
390   used for authentication, and (2) is the same subject that previously accessed the service.
391   Finally, the federation process allows for identity information to be shared in support of
392   authentication across systems.
393   The composition, model, and availability of identity services has significantly
394   changed since the first version of SP 800-63 was released, as have the considerations
395   and challenges of deploying secure, private, and equitable services to diverse user
396   communities. This revision addresses these challenges while facilitating the new models
397   and architectures for identity services that have developed by clarifying requirements
398   based on the function an entity may serve under the overall digital identity model.
399   Additionally, this publication provides instruction for credential service providers (CSPs),
400   verifiers, and relying parties (RPs) and it describes the risk management processes
401   that organizations should follow for implementing digital identity services and that
402   supplement the NIST Risk Management Framework [NISTRMF] and its component
403   special publications. The publication expands upon the NIST RMF by outlining how
404   equity and usability considerations should be incorporated into digital identity risk
405   management processes and it highlights the importance of considering impacts, not only
406   on the enterprise operations and assets, but also on individuals, other organizations, and,
407   more broadly, society. Further, while digital authentication supports privacy protection
408   by mitigating risks of unauthorized access to individuals’ information, given that identity
409   proofing, authentication, authorization, and federation often involve the processing of
410   individuals’ information, these functions can also create privacy risks. These guidelines,
411   therefore, include privacy requirements and considerations to help mitigate potential
412   associated privacy risks.
413   Finally, while this publication provides organizations with technical requirements and
414   recommendations for establishing, maintaining, and authenticating the digital identity
415   of subjects in order to access digital systems over a network, additional support options
416   outside the purview of information technology teams may need to be provided to address
417   barriers and adverse impacts, foster equity, and successfully deliver on mission objectives.

418   2.1. Scope & Applicability
419   Not all digital services require identity proofing or authentication; however, this guidance
420   applies to all online transactions for which some level of digital identity is required,
421   regardless of the constituency (e.g., citizens, business partners, and government entities).
422   These guidelines primarily focus on organizational services that interact with external
423   users, such as citizens accessing public benefits or private sector partners accessing
424   collaboration spaces. However, it also applies to federal systems accessed by employees
425   and contractors. The Personal Identity Verification (PIV) of Federal Employees and
426   Contractors standard [FIPS201] and its corresponding set of special publications and

                                                   4
      NIST SP 800-63-4 ipd                                               Digital Identity Guidelines
      December 2022


427   organization-specific instructions, extend these guidelines for the federal enterprise,
428   providing additional technical controls and processes for issuing and managing Personal
429   Identity Verification (PIV) cards, binding additional authenticators as derived PIV
430   credentials, and using federation architectures and protocols with PIV systems.
431   Transactions not covered by this guidance include those associated with national security
432   systems as defined in 44 U.S.C. § 3542(b)(2). Private sector organizations and state, local,
433   and tribal governments whose digital processes require varying levels of digital identity
434   assurance may consider the use of these standards where appropriate.
435   Additionally, these technical guidelines do not address the identity of subjects for physical
436   access (e.g., to buildings), though some identities used for online transactions may also be
437   used for physical access. Additionally, this revision of these guidelines does not explicitly
438   address device identity, often referred to as machine-to-machine (such as router-to-router)
439   authentication or interconnected devices, commonly referred to as the internet of things
440   (IoT), although these guidelines are written to refer to generic subjects wherever possible
441   to leave open the possibility for applicability to devices. Furthermore, these guidelines
442   do not address authorization of access to Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) on
443   behalf of subjects.

444   2.2. How to Use this Suite of SPs
445   These guidelines support the mitigation of the negative impacts induced by a digital
446   identity error by separating the individual elements of digital identity into discrete,
447   component parts. For non-federated systems, agencies will select two components,
448   referred to as Identity Assurance Level (IAL) and Authentication Assurance Level (AAL).
449   For federated systems, a third component, Federation Assurance Level (FAL), is included.
450   Sec. 5, Digital Identity Risk Management provides details on the risk assessment process
451   and how the results of the risk assessment, with additional context, inform organizational
452   selection of IAL, AAL, and FAL combinations based on risk and mission.
453   By conducting appropriate risk management for business, security, and privacy, side-by-
454   side with mission needs, organizations will select IAL, AAL, and FAL as distinct options.
455   Specifically, organizations are required to individually select levels corresponding to each
456   function being performed. While many systems could have the same numerical level for
457   each IAL, AAL, and FAL, this is not a requirement and organizations should not assume
458   they will be the same in any given system or application.
459   The components of identity assurance detailed in these guidelines are as follows:
460       • IAL refers to the identity proofing process.
461       • AAL refers to the authentication process.
462       • FAL refers to the federation process, when the RP is connected through a federated
463         protocol.

      December 2022


464         Note: When described generically or bundled, these guidelines will refer to
465         IAL, AAL, and FAL as xAL.
466   SP 800-63 is organized as the following suite of volumes:
467   SP 800-63 Digital Identity Guidelines: Provides the risk assessment methodology and an
468   overview of general identity frameworks, using authenticators, credentials, and assertions
469   together in a digital system, and a risk-based process of selecting assurance levels. SP
470   800-63 contains both normative and informative material.
471   [SP800-63A]: Provides requirements for enrollment and identity proofing of applicants,
472   either remotely or in person, that wish to gain access to resources at each of the three
473   identity assurance levels (IALs). It details the responsibilities of Credential Service
474   Providers (CSPs) with respect to establishing and maintaining subscriber accounts and
475   binding authenticators (either CSP-issued or subscriber-provided) to the subscriber
476   account. SP 800-63A contains both normative and informative material.
477   [SP800-63B]: Provides recommendations on types of authentication processes, including
478   choices of authenticators, that may be used at each of the three authentication assurance
479   levels (AALs). It also provides recommendations on the lifecycle of authenticators,
480   including invalidation in the event of loss or theft. SP 800-63B contains both normative
481   and informative material.
482   [SP800-63C]: Provides requirements on the use of federated identity architectures
483   and assertions to convey the results of authentication processes and relevant identity
484   information to an agency application. Further, this volume offers privacy-enhancing
485   techniques to share information about a valid, authenticated subject, and describes
486   methods that allow for strong multi-factor authentication (MFA) while the subject
487   remains pseudonymous to the digital service. SP 800-63C contains both normative and
488   informative material.

489   2.3. Enterprise Risk Management Requirements and Considerations
490   Effective enterprise risk management is multidisciplinary by default and involves the
491   consideration of a diverse set of factors and equities. In a digital identity risk management
492   context, these factors include, but are not limited to, information security, privacy, equity,
493   and usability. It is important for risk management efforts to weigh these factors as
494   they relate not only to enterprise assets and operations but also to individuals, other
495   organizations, and society more broadly.
496   During the process of analyzing factors relevant to digital identity, organizations may
497   determine that measures outside of those specified in this publication are appropriate in
498   certain contexts, for instance where privacy or other legal requirements exist or where the

501   employ compensating or supplemental controls not specified in this publication. They
502   may also consider partitioning the functionality of a digital service to allow less sensitive
503   functions to be available at a lower level of assurance.
504   The considerations detailed below support enterprise risk management efforts and
505   encourage informed, inclusive, and human-centric service delivery. While this list of
506   considerations is not exhaustive, it highlights a set of cross-cutting factors likely to impact
507   decision-making associated with digital identity management.

508   2.3.1. Security
509   It is increasingly important for enterprise organizations to assess and manage digital
510   identity security risks, such as unauthorized access, availability issues, impersonation, and
511   other types of fraudulent claims, as well as institute strong identity governance practices.
512   As organizations consult this guidance, they should consider potential impacts to the
513   confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and information systems that they
514   manage and that their service providers and business partners manage on behalf of the
515   individuals and communities that they serve.
516   Federal agencies implementing these guidelines need to adhere to their statutory
517   responsibilities, including those under the Federal Information Security Modernization
518   Act (FISMA) of 2014 [FISMA] and related NIST standards and guidelines. NIST
519   recommends that non-federal organizations implementing these guidelines follow
520   equivalent standards to ensure the secure operation of their digital systems.
521   FISMA requires federal agencies to implement appropriate controls to protect federal
522   information and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure,
523   disruption, or modification. The NIST RMF [NISTRMF] provides a process that
524   integrates security, privacy, and cyber supply chain risk management activities into the
525   system development life cycle. It is expected that federal agencies and organizations
526   that provide services under these guidelines have already implemented the controls and
527   processes required under FISMA and associated NIST risk management processes and
528   publications.
529   The controls and requirements encompassed by the identity, authentication, and
530   federation assurance levels under these guidelines augment, but do not replace or alter,
531   the information and information system controls as determined under FISMA and the
532   RMF.

533   2.3.2. Privacy
534   When designing, engineering, and managing digital identity systems, it is imperative to
535   consider the potential of that system to create privacy-related problems for individuals
536   when processing PII — a problematic data action — and the potential impact of the
537   problematic data action should it occur. Additionally, by focusing on the privacy


                                                    7
      NIST SP 800-63-4 ipd                                               Digital Identity Guidelines
      December 2022


538   engineering objectives of predictability, manageability, and disassociability, organizations
539   can determine the types of capabilities a given system may need to be able to demonstrate
540   how organizational privacy policies and system privacy requirements have been
541   implemented.
542   The Privacy Act of 1974, 2010 Edition, [PrivacyAct] established a set of fair information
543   practices for the collection, maintenance, use, and disclosure of information about
544   individuals that is maintained by federal agencies in systems of records.
545   When designing and implementing digital identity management processes and systems,
546   privacy risk assessments are required for PII processing under these guidelines. Such
547   privacy risk assessments can be used to support Privacy Impact Assessments under OMB
548   Guidance for Implementing the Privacy Provisions of the E-Government Act of 2002
549   [M-03-22] as well as to select controls from NIST Special Publication 800-53, Security
550   and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations [SP800-53]. Further,
551   each volume of 800-63 (63A, 63B, and 63C) contains a specific section providing
552   detailed privacy requirements and considerations for the implementation of the processes,
553   controls, and requirements presented in that volume.

554   2.3.3. Equity
555   As defined in Executive Order 13985, Advancing Racial Equity and Support for
556   Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government [EO13985], equity refers
557   to the consistent and systematic fair, just, and impartial treatment of all individuals,
558   including individuals who belong to underserved communities that have been denied
559   such treatment, such as Black, Latino, and Indigenous and Native American persons,
560   Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, and other persons of color; members of religious
561   minorities; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) persons; persons
562   with disabilities; persons who live in rural areas; and persons otherwise adversely affected
563   by persistent poverty or inequality.
564   A person’s ability to engage in an online transaction, such as accessing a critical service
565   like healthcare, is often dependent on their ability to successfully and safely present a
566   digital identity. Given the broad disparities that exist in the U.S. society and globally,
567   many people are either unable to successfully present a digital identity, or they face a
568   higher degree of burden in navigating online services than their more privileged peers,
569   leaving them locked out of critical services or broader participation in the online world.
570   In a public service context, this poses a direct risk to successful mission delivery. In a
571   broader societal context, challenges related to digital access can exacerbate existing
572   inequities and continue systemic cycles of exclusion for historically marginalized and
573   underserved groups.
574   Readers of this guidance are encouraged to consider existing inequities faced by the
575   populations they serve to identify opportunities to design or operate digital identity
576   systems and processes in ways that best support their needs. Readers are also encouraged

                                                   8
      NIST SP 800-63-4 ipd                                                Digital Identity Guidelines
      December 2022


577   to consider any potential or actual impact to the experiences and outcomes of these
578   populations, including disparities between populations, caused by the design or operation
579   of digital identity systems.
580   For federal agencies implementing these guidelines, EO 13985 directs federal agencies
581   to identify underserved communities for the programs and services that they provide and
582   to determine and address any systemic barriers to underserved communities to provide
583   equitable access to those programs and services. In alignment with the direction set
584   by EO 13985, federal agencies should determine potential barriers communities and
585   individuals may face to enrollment in and access to online benefits and services. They
586   should also identify whether programmatic changes may be necessary to advance equity.

587   2.3.4. Usability
588   Usability refers to the extent to which a system, product, or service can be used by
589   specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction in
590   a specified context of use.
591   Similar to equity, usability requires an understanding of the people interacting with a
592   digital identity system or process, as well as their unique goals and context of use. To
593   provide an effective, efficient, and satisfactory experience, readers of this guidance should
594   take a holistic approach to considering the interactions that each user will engage in
595   throughout the process of enrolling in and authenticating to a service. Throughout the
596   design and development lifecycle of a digital identity system or process, it is important to
597   conduct usability evaluation with representative users performing realistic scenarios and
598   tasks in appropriate context of use.
599   Digital identity management processes should be designed and implemented so it is easy
600   for users to do the right thing, hard to do the wrong thing, and easy to recover when the
601   wrong thing happens.

604   4.   Digital Identity Model
605   This section is informative.

606   4.1. Overview
607   The SP 800-63 guidelines use digital identity models that reflect technologies and
608   architectures currently available in the market. These models have a variety of entities
609   and functions and vary in complexity. Simple models group functions, such as creating
610   subscriber accounts and providing attributes, under a single entity. More complex
611   models separate these functions among a larger number of entities. The entities and their
612   associated functions found in digital identity models include:
613   Subject (represented by one of three roles):
614        • Applicant — the subject to be identity proofed
615        • Subscriber — the subject that has successfully completed the identity proofing
616          process or has successfully completed authentication
617        • Claimant — the subject to be authenticated
618   Credential Service Provider (CSP): A trusted entity whose functions include identity
619   proofing applicants to the identity service and the registration of authenticators to
620   subscriber accounts. A subscriber account is the CSP’s established record of the
621   subscriber, the subscriber’s attributes, and associated authenticators. A CSP may be an
622   independent third party.
623   Relying Party (RP): An entity that relies upon the information in the subscriber account,
624   or an identity provider (IdP) assertion when using federation, typically to process a
625   transaction or grant access to information or a system.
626   Verifier: An entity whose function is to verify the claimant’s identity by verifying the
627   claimant’s possession and control of one or more authenticators using an authentication
628   protocol. To do this, the verifier needs to confirm the binding of the authenticators with
629   the subscriber account and check that the subscriber account is active.
630   Identity Provider (IdP): An entity in a federated model that performs both the CSP and
631   Verifier functions. The IdP is responsible for authenticating the subscriber and issuing
632   assertions to communicate with one or more RPs.
633   The entities and interactions that comprise the non-federated digital identity model are
634   illustrated in Figure 1. The federated digital identity model is illustrated in Figure 2.
635   Figure 1 shows an example of a common sequence of interactions in the non-federated
636   model. Other sequences could also achieve the same functional requirements. The usual
637   sequence of interactions for identity proofing and enrollment activities is as follows:


                                                     11
      NIST SP 800-63-4 ipd                                               Digital Identity Guidelines
      December 2022




                       Figure 1. Non-Federated Digital Identity Model Example


638       • Step 1: An applicant applies to a CSP through an enrollment process. The CSP
639         identity proofs that applicant.
640       • Step 2: Upon successful proofing, the applicant is enrolled in the identity service as
641         a subscriber.
642            – A subscriber account and corresponding authenticators are established
643              between the CSP and the subscriber. The CSP maintains the subscriber
644              account, its status, and the enrollment data. The subscriber maintains their
645              authenticators.
646   The usual sequence of interactions involved in using one or more authenticators to
647   perform digital authentication in the non-federated model is as follows:
648       • Step 3: The RP requests authentication from the claimant.
649       • Step 4: The claimant proves possession and control of the authenticators to the
650         verifier through an authentication process.

      December 2022


651            – The verifier interacts with the CSP to verify the binding of the claimant’s
652              identity to their authenticators in the subscriber account and to optionally
653              obtain additional subscriber attributes.
654            – The CSP or verifier functions of the service provider provide information
655              about the subscriber. The RP requests the attributes it requires from the CSP.
656              The RP, optionally, uses this information to make authorization decisions.
657       • Step 5: An authenticated session is established between the subscriber and the RP.




                          Figure 2. Federated Digital Identity Model Example

658   Figure 2 shows an example of those same common interactions in a federated model.
659       • Step 1: An applicant applies to an IdP through an enrollment process. Using its
660         CSP function, the IdP identity proofs the applicant.
661       • Step 2: Upon successful proofing, the applicant is enrolled in the identity service as
662         a subscriber.
663            – A subscriber account and corresponding authenticators are established
664              between the IdP and the subscriber. The IdP maintains the subscriber account,
665              its status, and the enrollment data collected for the lifetime of the subscriber
666              account (at a minimum). The subscriber maintains their authenticators.
667   The usual sequence of interactions involved in using one or more authenticators in the
668   federated model to perform digital authentication is as follows:

                                                  13
      NIST SP 800-63-4 ipd                                               Digital Identity Guidelines
      December 2022


669       • Step 3: The RP requests authentication from the claimant. The IdP provides
670         an assertion and optionally additional attributes to the RP through a federation
671         protocol.
672       • Step 4: The claimant proves possession and control of the authenticators to the
673         verifier function of the IdP through an authentication process.
674            – Within the IdP, the verifier and CSP functions interact to verify the binding
675              of the claimant’s authenticators with those bound to the claimed subscriber
676              account and optionally to obtain additional subscriber attributes.
677       • Step 5: All communication, including assertions, between the RP and the IdP
678         happens through federation protocols.
679       • Step 6: The IdP provides the RP with the authentication status of the subscriber
680         and relevant attributes and an authenticated session is established between the
681         subscriber and the RP.
682   For both models, the verifier does not always need to communicate in real time with
683   the CSP to complete the authentication activity (e.g., some uses of digital certificates).
684   Therefore, the line between the verifier and the CSP represents a logical link between
685   the two entities. In some implementations, the verifier, RP, and CSP functions may
686   be distributed and separated. However, if these functions reside on the same platform,
687   the interactions between the functions are signals between applications or application
688   modules running on the same system rather than using network protocols.
689   In all cases, the RP should request the attributes it requires from a CSP or IdP before
690   authenticating the claimant.
691   The following sections provide more detailed digital identity models for identity proofing,
692   authentication, and federation.

693   4.2. Enrollment and Identity Prooﬁng
694   The previous section introduced the entities and interactions in the conceptual digital
695   identity model. This section provides additional details regarding the participants’
696   relationships and responsibilities with respect to identity proofing and enrollment
697   processes.
698   [SP800-63A], Enrollment and Identity Proofing provides general information and
699   normative requirements for the identity proofing and enrollment processes as well as
700   requirements specific to identity assurance levels (IALs). In addition to a “no identity
701   proofing” level, IAL0, this document defines three IALs that indicate the relative strength
702   of an identity proofing process.
703   An individual, referred to as an applicant at this stage, opts to enroll with a CSP. If the
704   applicant is successfully proofed, the individual is then enrolled in the identity service as
705   a subscriber of that CSP.

      NIST SP 800-63-4 ipd                                               Digital Identity Guidelines
      December 2022


706   The CSP then establishes a subscriber account to uniquely identify each subscriber and
707   record any authenticators registered (bound) to that subscriber account. The CSP may:
708       • issue one or more authenticators to the subscriber at the time of enrollment,
709       • bind authenticators provided by the subscriber, and/or
710       • bind authenticators to the subscriber account at a later time as needed.
711   CSPs generally maintain subscriber accounts according to a documented lifecycle, which
712   defines specific events, activities, and changes that affect the status of a subscriber
713   account. CSPs generally limit the lifetime of a subscriber account and any associated
714   authenticators in order to ensure some level of accuracy and currency of attributes
715   associated with a subscriber. When there is a status change or when the authenticators
716   near expiration and any renewal requirements are met, they may be renewed and/or re-
717   issued. Alternately, the authenticators may be invalidated and destroyed according to the
718   CSPs written policy and procedures.
719   Subscribers have a duty to maintain control of their authenticators and comply with CSP
720   policies in order to remain in good standing with the CSP.
721   In order to request issuance of a new authenticator, typically the subscriber authenticates
722   to the CSP using their existing, unexpired authenticators. If the subscriber fails to request
723   authenticator re-issuance prior to their expiration or revocation, they may be required to
724   repeat the identity proofing (either complete or abbreviated) and enrollment processes in
725   order to obtain a new authenticator.
726   Figure 3 shows a sample of interactions for identity proofing and enrollment.

727   4.3. Authentication and Lifecycle Management
728   Normative requirements can be found in [SP800-63B], Authentication and Lifecycle
729   Management.

730   4.3.1. Authenticators
731   The classic paradigm for authentication systems identifies three factors as the
732   cornerstones of authentication:
733       • Something you know (e.g., a password)
734       • Something you have (e.g., an ID badge or a cryptographic key)
735       • Something you are (e.g., a fingerprint or other biometric characteristic data)
736   Single-factor authentication requires only one of the above factors, most often
737   “something you know”. Multiple instances of the same factor still constitute single-factor
738   authentication. For example, a user generated PIN and a password do not constitute two
739   factors as they are both “something you know.” Multi-factor authentication (MFA) refers
740   to the use of more than one distinct factor. For the purposes of these guidelines, using two
741   factors is adequate to meet the highest security requirements. Other types of information,
742   such as location data or device identity, may also be used by a verifier to evaluate the risk
743   in a claimed identity but they are not considered authentication factors.
744   In digital authentication, the claimant possesses and controls one or more authenticators.
745   The authenticators will have been bound with the subscriber account. The authenticators
746   contain secrets the claimant can use to prove they are a legitimate subscriber. The
747   claimant authenticates to a system or application over a network by demonstrating they
748   have possession and control of the authenticator. Once authenticated, the claimant is
749   referred to as a subscriber.
750   The secrets contained in an authenticator are based on either key pairs (asymmetric
751   cryptographic keys) or shared secrets (including symmetric cryptographic keys and
752   memorized secrets). Asymmetric key pairs are comprised of a public key and a related
753   private key. The private key is stored on the authenticator and is only available for
754   use by the claimant who possesses and controls the authenticators. A verifier that has
755   the subscriber’s public key, for example through a public key certificate, can use an
756   authentication protocol to verify the claimant has possession and control of the associated
757   private key contained in the authenticators and, therefore, is a subscriber.
758   As mentioned above, shared secrets stored on an authenticator may be either symmetric
759   keys or memorized secrets (e.g., passwords and PINs). While both keys and memorized
760   secrets can be used in similar protocols, one important difference between the two is
761   how they relate to the claimant. Symmetric keys are generally chosen at random and
762   are complex and long enough to thwart network-based guessing attacks, and stored in
763   hardware or software that the subscriber controls. Memorized secrets typically have fewer

                                                   17
      NIST SP 800-63-4 ipd                                                Digital Identity Guidelines
      December 2022


764   characters and less complexity than cryptographic keys to facilitate memorization and
765   ease of entry. The result is that memorized secrets have increased vulnerabilities that
766   require additional defenses to mitigate.
767   There is another type of memorized secret used as an activation factor for a multi-factor
768   authenticator. These are referred to as activation secrets. An activation secret is used to
769   decrypt a stored key used for authentication or is compared against a locally held stored
770   verifier to provide access to the authentication key. In either of these cases, the activation
771   secret remains within the authenticator and its associated user endpoint. An example of an
772   activation secret would be the PIN used to activate a PIV card.
773   As used in these guidelines, authenticators always contain or comprise a secret; however,
774   some authentication methods used for in-person interactions do not apply directly to
775   digital authentication. For example, a physical driver’s license is something you have
776   and may be useful when authenticating to a human (e.g., a security guard) but it is not an
777   authenticator for online services.
778   Some commonly used authentication methods do not contain or comprise secrets, and are
779   therefore not acceptable for use under these guidelines. For example:
780       • Knowledge-based authentication, where the claimant is prompted to answer
781         questions that are presumably known only by the claimant, does not constitute
782         an acceptable secret for digital authentication.
783       • A biometric also does not constitute a secret and can not be used as a single-factor
784         authenticator.
785   A digital authentication system may incorporate multiple factors in one of two ways:
786      1. The system may be implemented so that multiple factors are presented to the
787         verifier, or
788      2. Some factors may be used to protect a secret that will be presented to the verifier.
789   For example, item 1 can be satisfied by pairing a memorized secret (something you
790   know) with an out-of-band device (something you have). Both authenticator outputs
791   are presented to the verifier to authenticate the claimant. For item 2, the authenticator
792   and authenticator secret could be a piece of hardware that contains a cryptographic key
793   (something you have) that is controlled by the claimant where access is protected with a
794   fingerprint (something you are). When used with the biometric factor, the cryptographic
795   key produces an output that is used to authenticate the claimant.
796   As noted above, biometrics do not constitute acceptable secrets for digital authentication
797   and, therefore, cannot be used for single-factor authentication. However, biometrics
798   authentication can be used as an authentication factor for multi-factor authentication when
799   used in combination with a possession-based authenticator. Biometric characteristics
800   are unique, personal attributes that can be used to verify the identity of a person who is

801   physically present at the point of verification. This includes, but is not limited to, facial
802   features, fingerprints, iris patterns, and voiceprints.

803   4.3.2. Subscriber Accounts
804   As described in the preceding sections, a subscriber account binds one or more
805   authenticators to the subscriber via an identifier as part of the registration process. A
806   subscriber account is created, stored, and maintained by the CSP. The subscriber account
807   records all identity attributes validated during the identity proofing process.

808   4.3.3. Authentication Process
809   The authentication process enables an RP to trust that a claimant is who they say they
810   are. Figure 4 shows a sample authentication process. Other approaches are described in
811   [SP800-63B], Authentication and Lifecycle Management. This sample authentication
812   process shows interactions between the RP, a claimant, and a verifier/CSP. The verifier is
813   a functional role and is frequently implemented in combination with the CSP, as shown in
814   Fig. 4, the RP, or both.




                                Figure 4. Sample Authentication Process

815   A successful authentication process demonstrates that the claimant has possession and
816   control of one or more valid authenticators that are bound to the subscriber’s identity. In
817   general, this is done using an authentication protocol involving an interaction between
818   the verifier and the claimant. The exact nature of the interaction is extremely important

                                                    19
      NIST SP 800-63-4 ipd                                               Digital Identity Guidelines
      December 2022


819   in determining the overall security of the system. Well-designed protocols can protect the
820   integrity and confidentiality of communication between the claimant and the verifier both
821   during and after the authentication, and can help limit the damage that can be done by an
822   attacker masquerading as a legitimate verifier.
823   Additionally, mechanisms located at the verifier can mitigate online guessing attacks
824   against lower entropy secrets — like passwords and PINs — by limiting the rate at which
825   an attacker can make authentication attempts, or otherwise delaying incorrect attempts.
826   Generally, this is done by keeping track of and limiting the number of unsuccessful
827   attempts, since the premise of an online guessing attack is that most attempts will fail.

828   4.4. Federation and Assertions
829   Normative requirements can be found in [SP800-63C], Federation and Assertions.
830   In general usage, the term federation can be applied to a number of different approaches
831   involving the sharing of information between different trust domains. These approaches
832   differ based on the kind of information that is being shared between the domains. Some
833   common examples include:
834       • sharing identifiers (e.g., using a driver’s license number or an email address),
835       • sharing authenticators (e.g., using a PKI authenticator for multiple applications),
836       • sharing identity assertions (e.g., a federation protocol like OpenID Connect or
837         SAML),
838       • sharing account attributes (e.g., a provisioning protocol like SCIM), and
839       • sharing authorization decisions (e.g., a policy protocol like XACML).
840   The SP 800-63 guidelines are agnostic to the identity proofing, authentication, and
841   federation architectures an organization selects and they allow organizations to deploy a
842   digital identity scheme according to their own requirements. However, there are scenarios
843   that an organization may encounter that make federation potentially more efficient
844   and effective than establishing identity services local to the organization or individual
845   applications. The following lists detail scenarios where the organization may consider
846   federation a viable option. These lists are provided for consideration and are not intended
847   to be comprehensive.
848   An organization should consider accepting federated identity assertions if any of the
849   following apply:
850      1. Potential users already have an authenticator at or above the required AAL.
851      2. Multiple types of authenticators are required to cover all possible user communities.
852      3. An organization does not have the necessary infrastructure to support management
853         of subscriber accounts (e.g., account recovery, authenticator issuance, help desk).

                                                   20

      December 2022


854      4. There is a desire to allow primary authenticators to be added and upgraded over
855         time without changing the RP’s implementation.
856      5. There are different environments to be supported, as federation protocols are
857         network-based and allow for implementation on a wide variety of platforms and
858         languages.
859      6. Potential users come from multiple communities, each with its own existing identity
860         infrastructure.
861      7. The ability to centrally manage account lifecycles, including account revocation and
862         binding of new authenticators is important.
863   An organization should consider accepting federated identity attributes if any of the
864   following apply:
865      1. Pseudonymity is required, necessary, feasible, or important to stakeholders
866         accessing the service.
867      2. Access to the service requires a partial attribute list.
868      3. Access to the service requires at least one derived attribute value.
869      4. The organization is not the authoritative source or issuing source for required
870         attributes.
871      5. Attributes are only required temporarily during use (such as to make an access
872         decision), and the organization does not need to retain the data.

873   4.4.1. Federation Beneﬁts
874   Federated architectures have many significant benefits, including, but not limited to:
875       • Enhanced user experience: For example, an individual can be identity proofed once
876         and reuse the subscriber account at multiple RPs.
877       • Cost reduction to both the user (reduction in authenticators) and the organization
878         (reduction in information technology infrastructure).
879       • Minimizing data in applications as organizations do not need to collect, store, or
880         dispose of personal information.
881       • Minimizing data exposed to applications, using pseudonymous identifiers and
882         derived attribute values instead of copying account values to each application.
883       • Mission enablement: Organizations can focus on their mission without worrying
884         about expending resources on identity management.
885   The following sections discuss the components of a federated identity architecture should
886   an organization elect this type of model.

      NIST SP 800-63-4 ipd                                               Digital Identity Guidelines
      December 2022


887   4.4.2. Federation Protocols and Assertions
888   Federation protocols allow for the conveyance of assertions, authentication attributes,
889   and subscriber attributes across networked systems. In a federation scenario, as shown in
890   Figure 2, the CSP provides a service known as an identity provider, or IdP. The IdP acts as
891   a verifier for authenticators issued by the CSP. Using federation protocols, the IdP sends
892   a message, called an assertion, about this authentication event to the RP. Assertions are
893   verifiable statements from an IdP to an RP that represent an authentication event for a
894   subscriber. The RP receives and uses the assertion provided by the IdP, but the RP does
895   not verify authenticators directly.
896   Federation is generally used when the RP and the IdP are not a single entity or are not
897   under common administration, though this technology can be applied within a single
898   security domain for a variety of reasons. The RP uses the information in the assertion to
899   identify the subscriber and make authorization decisions about their access to resources
900   controlled by the RP.
901   Examples of assertions include:
902       • Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) assertions are specified using a
903         mark-up language intended for describing security assertions. They can be used
904         by a verifier to make a statement to an RP about the identity of a claimant. SAML
905         assertions may optionally be digitally signed.
906       • OpenID Connect claims are specified using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) for
907         describing security, and optionally, user claims. JSON user information claims may
908         optionally be digitally signed.
909       • Kerberos tickets allow a ticket-granting authority to issue session keys to two
910         authenticated parties using symmetric or asymmetric key establishment schemes.

911   4.4.3. Relying Parties
912   An RP relies on results of an authentication protocol to establish confidence in the
913   identity or attributes of a subscriber for the purpose of conducting an online transaction.
914   RPs may use a subscriber’s federated identity (pseudonymous or non-pseudonymous),
915   IAL, AAL, FAL, and other factors to make authorization decisions.
916   When using federation, the verifier is not a function of the RP. A federated RP receives an
917   assertion from the IdP, which provides the verifier function, and the RP ensures that the
918   assertion came from an IdP that is trusted by the RP. The RP also processes any additional
919   information in the assertion, such as personal attributes or expiration times. The RP is
920   the final arbiter concerning whether a specific assertion presented by a verifier meets the
921   RP’s established criteria for system access regardless of IAL, AAL, or FAL.

922   5.    Digital Identity Risk Management
923   This section is normative.
924   This section provides details on the methodology for assessing digital identity risks for
925   each xAL. This process augments the risk management processes for information and
926   information system risk under NIST guidance for implementing Federal Information
927   Security Modernization Act [FISMA] requirements.
928   There are 4 steps to the digital identity risk management process:
929        1. Conduct Initial Impact Assessment: In this step, organizations evaluate their user
930           population and assess the impact of a failure of each function in the identity system
931           (i.e., proofing, authentication, and federation) for their protected application or
932           service against a defined set of impact categories. The outcome of this step is a
933           documented set of impact categories and associated impact levels.
934        2. Select Initial Assurance Levels: In this step, the impact categories and impact
935           levels are evaluated to determine the appropriate assurance levels to protect the
936           application. The outcome of this step is an identified initial level for each applicable
937           xAL.
938        3. Tailor and Document Assurance Level Determinations: In this step, detailed
939           privacy, equity, usability, and threat assessments are conducted to determine
940           the potential impact of the initially selected assurance level on the specific user
941           population and threat environment of the application. The initial assurance level
942           is tailored, compensating or supplemental controls are identified, and all decisions
943           are documented. The outcome is a Digital Identity Acceptance Statement (see
944           Sec. 5.3.4) with a defined implementable assurance level.
945        4. Continuously Evaluate & Improve: In this step, information is collected on
946           performance of the identity system across a diverse set of factors based on
947           organization needs and evolving threat vectors. This information is used to
948           determine if the selected assurance level and controls are meeting mission, business,
949           and security needs and to monitor for unintended harms that may have emerged.
950           The outcomes of this step are performance metrics, documented and transparent
951           processes for evaluation and redress, and ongoing improvements to the identity
952           system as needed.
953   While presented as a “stepwise” approach, there can be many points in the process that
954   require divergence from the sequential order, including the need for iterative cycles
955   between initial task execution and revisiting tasks. For example, the introduction of new
956   regulations or requirements while an assessment is ongoing may require organizations to
957   revisit a step in the process. Additionally new functionality, changes in data usage, and
958   changes to the threat environment may at any point require an organization to revisit steps
959   in the digital identity risk management process.

      December 2022


960   Organizations SHOULD adapt and modify this overall approach to meet organizational
961   processes, governance, and integration with enterprise risk management practices. At a
962   minimum, organizations SHALL ensure that each step is executed and the normative
963   mandates and outcomes of each step are completed and documented regardless of
964   operational approach and enabling tools.

965   5.1. Conduct Initial Impact Assessment
966   The purpose of the initial impact analysis is to identify the potential adverse impacts of
967   failures in identity proofing, authentication, and federation specific to an RP application
968   or service, yielding an initial set of assurance levels. Assessing these areas separately
969   allows organizations maximum flexibility in developing or acquiring a digital identity
970   service that best enables them to successfully deliver on mission objectives.
971   The impact assessment includes:
972       • Identifying impacted entities,
973       • Identifying a set of impact categories for which harms will be assessed,
974       • Identifying potential harms for each of the impact categories,
975       • Identifying the levels of impact those potential harms would inflict should failures
976         occur, and
977       • Assessing the impact of each type of failure (proofing, authentication, and
978         federation) and the resulting impact level to all affected entities.
979   The output of this assessment is a defined impact level — High, Moderate, or Low — for
980   each possible type of failure. This serves as the primary input to the initial assurance level
981   selection.

982   5.1.1. Identify Impacted Entities
983   When assessing impacts, an organization needs to determine the entities that will be
984   impacted by the application or transaction under consideration. As mentioned earlier
985   in this guideline, it is imperative to consider the impact on different entities resulting
986   from a failure of the digital identity system. Of particular importance is ensuring that the
987   potential impacts to individuals are considered alongside those of the enterprise.
988   Accordingly, impact assessments SHALL include individuals using the system or
989   application in addition to the organization itself. Additionally, organizations SHOULD
990   identify other entities, such as mission partners, communities, and those identified in
991   [SP800-30], that need to be specifically included based on mission and business needs.
992   At a minimum, agencies SHALL document all entities to which impacts will be assessed
993   when conducting their impact analysis.
994   The outcome of this activity is a list of entities subject to the application or transaction
995   under consideration for whom impacts will be assessed.

       December 2022


996    5.1.2. Identify Impact Categories and Potential Harms
997    Initial assurance levels for digital transactions SHALL be determined by assessing the
998    potential impact of, at a minimum, each of the following categories:
999        • Damage to mission delivery
1000       • Damage to trust or reputation
1001       • Loss of sensitive information
1002       • Damage to or loss of economic stability
1003       • Loss of life or damage to safety, health, or environmental stability
1004       • Noncompliance with laws, regulations, and/or contractual obligations
1005   Organizations SHOULD include additional impact categories as appropriate based on
1006   their mission. Each impact category SHALL be documented and consistently applied
1007   across different applications assessed by the organization.
1008   Harms are any adverse effects that would be experienced by an entity. They provide a
1009   means to more effectively understand the impact categories and how they may apply to
1010   specific entities associated with that application. Agencies SHOULD consider specific
1011   harms for each of the defined impact categories to better inform their impact analysis.
1012   Identification of harms for each category SHALL be done for each of the entities
1013   identified during “entity identification” process.
1014   Examples of harms associated with each category include, but are not limited to:
1015   Damage to mission delivery:
1016       • Harms to individuals may include the inability to access government services or
1017         benefits for which they are eligible.
1018       • Harms to the organization may include an inability to perform current
1019         mission/business functions in a sufficiently timely manner, with sufficient
1020         confidence and/or correctness, within planned resource constraints, or an inability,
1021         or limited ability, to perform mission/business functions in the future.
1022   Damage to trust or reputation:
1023       • Harms to individuals may include impersonation or damage to image or reputation.
1024       • Harms to the organization may include damage to trust relationships, image, or
1025         reputation including future, potential trust relationships.
1026   Loss of sensitive information:
1027       • Harms to individuals includes loss of PII or other sensitive information, which may
1028         result in secondary harms such as loss of economic stability, loss of life, physical or
1029         psychological injury, impersonation, identity theft, or persistent inconvenience.

       December 2022


1030       • Harms to the organization may include loss or degradation of intellectual property
1031         or other information assets such as classified materials or controlled unclassified
1032         information (CUI).
1033   Damage to or loss of economic stability:
1034       • Harms to individuals may include debts incurred or assets lost as a result of fraud or
1035         other harm, damage to or loss of credit, actual or potential employment, or sources
1036         of income, and/or other financial loss.
1037       • Harms to the organization may include costs incurred related to fraud or other
1038         criminal activity, loss of assets, devaluation, or loss of business.
1039   Loss of life or damage to safety, health, or environmental stability:
1040       • Harms to individuals may include death, damage to or loss of physical, mental, or
1041         emotional well-being, damage to the environment, or loss of accessible, affordable
1042         housing.
1043       • Harms to the organization may include damage to or loss of the organization’s
1044         workforce or the impact of unsafe conditions rendering the organization unable to
1045         operate or operating at reduced capacity.
1046   Noncompliance with laws, regulations, and/or contractual obligations:
1047       • Harms to individuals may include damage to or loss of economic stability, safety,
1048         privacy, civil liberties, equity, and/or usability due to violations of local, state, and
1049         federal laws, regulations, and/or contractual obligations.
1050       • Harms to the organization may include financial costs, sanctions, liability, etc, due
1051         to noncompliance with applicable laws, regulations, contractual requirements, or
1052         other requirements in other binding agreements.
1053   The outcome of this activity will be a list of impact categories and harms which will be
1054   used to assess impacts to identified entities.

1055   5.1.3. Identify Potential Impact Levels
1056   Initial assurance levels for digital transactions are determined by assessing the potential
1057   impact a failure would have on each of the categories from Sec. 5.1.2 using one of the
1058   following potential impact values:
1059      1. Low potential impact: could be expected to have a limited adverse effect
1060      2. Moderate potential impact: could be expected to have a serious adverse effect
1061      3. High potential impact: could be expected to have a severe or catastrophic adverse
1062         effect



                                                     26

       December 2022


1063         Note: If a failure in the identity system causes no measurable consequences
1064         for a category, there is no impact.
1065   Each assurance level, IAL, AAL, and FAL (if accepting or asserting a federated identity)
1066    SHALL be evaluated separately. Ideally, any evaluation will include different viewpoints
1067   such as harm to individuals, the organization, other organizations, and the nation as
1068   applicable to successful delivery of the organization’s mission. Examples of potential
1069   impacts in each of the categories include:
1070   Damage to mission delivery:
1071      • Low: at worst, slight outcome disparities exist between individuals that participate
1072        in federally funded programs and those that are eligible but unable to participate, or
1073        a limited adverse effect on organizational operations or assets, or public interests.
1074        Examples of limited adverse effects are: mission capability degradation to the
1075        extent and duration that the organization is able to perform its primary functions
1076        with noticeably reduced effectiveness, or minor damage to organizational assets or
1077        public interests.
1078      • Moderate: at worst, outcome disparities are evident between individuals that
1079        participate in federally funded programs and those that are eligible but unable
1080        to participate, or a serious adverse effect on organizational operations or assets,
1081        or public interests. Examples of serious adverse effects are: significant mission
1082        capability degradation to the extent and duration that the organization is able
1083        to perform its primary functions with significantly reduced effectiveness; or
1084        significant damage to organizational assets or public interests.
1085      • High: outcome disparities endure across communities, indicating a systemic
1086        pattern of exclusion, avoidance, or other barriers to participation in federally
1087        funded programs, or a severe or catastrophic adverse effect on organizational
1088        operations or assets, or public interests. Examples of severe or catastrophic effects
1089        are: severe mission capability degradation or loss to the extent and duration that the
1090        organization is unable to perform one or more of its primary functions; or major
1091        damage to organizational assets or public interests.
1092   Damage to trust and reputation:
1093      • Low: at worst, limited, short-term inconvenience, distress, or embarrassment to any
1094        party.
1095      • Moderate: at worst, serious short-term or limited long-term inconvenience, distress,
1096        or damage to the standing or reputation of any party.
1097      • High: severe or serious long-term inconvenience, distress, or damage to the
1098        standing or reputation of any party. This is ordinarily reserved for situations with
1099        particularly severe effects or which potentially affect many individuals.

1113      • High: severe or catastrophic financial loss to any party.
1114   Loss of life or damage to safety, health, or environmental stability:
1115      • Low: at worst, minor injury or acute health issue that resolves itself and does not
1116        require medical, including mental health, treatment; limited risk of environmental
1117        impact in locality where program operations take place.
1118      • Moderate: at worst, moderate risk of minor injury or limited risk of injury
1119        requiring medical, including mental health, treatment; or the compounding impact
1120        of multiple low impact events; moderate risk of environmental impact in locality
1121        where program operations take place.
1122      • High: a risk of serious injury, trauma, or death; or the compounding impact of
1123        multiple moderate impact events; high risk of environmental impact in locality
1124        where program operations take place.
1125   Noncompliance with laws, regulations, and/or contractual obligations:
1126      • Low: at worst, a risk of civil or criminal violations of a nature that would not
1127        ordinarily be subject to enforcement efforts, or at worst, an insignificant or
1128        inconsequential organization liability.
1129      • Moderate: at worst, a risk of civil or criminal violations that may be subject to
1130        enforcement efforts, or a serious organization liability.
1131      • High: a risk of civil or criminal violations that are of special importance to
1132        enforcement programs, or severe or catastrophic organization liability.

1133   5.1.4. Impact Analysis
1134   The impact analysis helps determine the extent to which risk must be mitigated by the
1135   identity proofing, authentication, and federation processes. These determinations drive
1136   the relevant choices of applicable technologies and mitigation strategies, rather than the
1137   desire for any given technology driving risk determinations.
1138   To determine the appropriate level of assurance of the user’s asserted identity,
1139   organizations SHALL assess the potential risks and identify measures to minimize
1140   their impact. Organizations SHALL assess the risk of identity proofing, authentication,
1141   and federation failures separately to determine the required assurance level for each
1142   transaction. This process SHALL include consideration of potentially varying impacts
1143   of harms to different entities impacted by the digital identity system, as described in
1144   Sec. 5.1.1. Business processes, policies, and technologies may help reduce risk. Entities
1145    SHOULD consider the impact of specific modes of failures related to identity proofing,
1146   authentication, and federation this includes, but may not be limited to:
1147   Identity Proofing:
1148       • The impact of providing a service to the wrong subject (e.g., an attacker
1149         successfully proofs as someone else).
1150       • The impact of not providing service to an eligible subject due to barriers, including
1151         biases, faced by the subject throughout the process of identity proofing.
1152       • The impact of excessive information collection and retention to support identity
1153         proofing processes.
1154   Authentication:
1155       • The impact of authenticating the wrong subject (e.g., an attacker who compromises
1156         or steals an authenticator).
1157       • The impact of failing to authenticate the correct subject due to barriers, including
1158         biases, faced by the subject in presenting their authenticator.
1159   Federation:
1160       • The impact of the wrong subject successfully accessing an application, system, or
1161         data (e.g., compromising or replaying an assertion).
1162       • The impact of releasing subscriber attributes to the wrong application or system.
1163   Using a worksheet similar to Table 1 can assist organizations with compiling the
1164   information gathered in order to complete the analysis. This kind of analysis would be
1165   done for each type of potential failure for identity proofing, authentication, and federation
1166   to determine the overall risks to entities interacting with the digital identity system.

1167   The output of this step is a defined impact level for failures of identity proofing,
1168   authentication, and federation which serve as the primary input to the initial assurance
1169   level selection.

1170   5.2. Select Initial Assurance Levels
1171   The impact analysis serves as a primary input to the process of selecting initial assurance
1172   levels for identity proofing, authentication and federation. The assurance levels may differ
1173   across these areas based on the analysis of the potential impact of failures in each area.
1174   The purpose of these initial assurance levels is to identify baseline digital identity controls
1175   and processes, reflected in the requirements and guidelines in the companion volumes of
1176   [SP800-63A], [SP800-63B], and [SP800-63C], which will be assessed and tailored based
1177   on mission need, cybersecurity risk, and other potential impacts to the organization and
1178   users of the digital identity systems.

       December 2022


1179   5.2.1. Assurance Levels
1180   An organization RP SHALL select, based on cybersecurity risk and mission needs, the
1181   following individual initial assurance levels:
1182       • IAL: The robustness of the identity proofing process to confidently determine the
1183         identity of an individual. IAL is selected to mitigate potential identity proofing
1184         failures.
1185       • AAL: The robustness of the authentication process itself, and the binding between
1186         an authenticator and a specific individual’s identifier. AAL is selected to mitigate
1187         potential authentication failures.
1188       • FAL: The robustness of the federation process used to communicate authentication
1189         and attribute information (if applicable) to an RP from an IdP. FAL is optional as
1190         not all digital systems will leverage federated identity architectures. FAL is selected
1191         to mitigate potential federation failures.

1192   5.2.2. xAL Descriptions
1193   A summary of each of the identity, authenticator, and federation assurance levels is
1194   provided below.
1195   When described generically or bundled, these guidelines will refer to IAL, AAL, and FAL
1196   as xAL.

1197   5.2.2.1. Identity Assurance Level
1198   IAL1: IAL1 requires validation of identifying attributes against authoritative or credible
1199   sources and use of basic processes to verify the claimed identity of the applicant.
1200   IAL2: IAL2 requires identifying attributes to be supported by strong evidence and
1201   validated against authoritative or credible sources and use of processes to verify the
1202   claimed identity of the applicant.
1203   IAL3: IAL3 requires identifying attributes to be verified by an authorized CSP
1204   representative through examination of physical documentation using an interactive
1205   process with a CSP representative.

1206   5.2.2.2. Authentication Assurance Level
1207   AAL1: AAL1 provides some assurance that the claimant controls an authenticator
1208   registered to the subscriber. AAL1 requires single-factor authentication using a wide
1209   range of available authentication technologies. Successful authentication requires that the
1210   claimant prove possession and control of the authenticator through a secure authentication
1211   protocol.
1212   AAL2: AAL2 provides high confidence that the claimant controls authenticator registered
1213   to the subscriber. Proof of possession and control of two different authentication factors is

                                                    31
       NIST SP 800-63-4 ipd                                                Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022


1214   required through a secure authentication protocol. Approved cryptographic techniques are
1215   required at AAL2 and above.
1216   AAL3: AAL3 provides very high confidence that the claimant controls authenticator
1217   registered to the subscriber. Authentication at AAL3 is based on proof of possession of a
1218   key through a cryptographic authentication protocol capable of resisting phishing attacks.

1219   5.2.2.3. Federation Assurance Level
1220   FAL1: FAL1 allows for the subscriber to log into the RP using an assertion from the
1221   IdP that can be verified by the RP as coming from the IdP and targeted for a specific RP.
1222   The assertion is protected from modification or construction by an attacker. The trust
1223   agreement and registration between the IdP and RP can happen dynamically.
1224   FAL2: FAL2 adds the requirement that the assertion be robust against injection at the
1225   RP. One means of this is to have the assertion presented directly to the RP from the IdP
1226   instead of passing through an intermediary like a browser. The trust agreement between
1227   the IdP and RP cannot happen dynamically, but dynamic registration of the specific IdP
1228   and RP can occur at runtime.
1229   FAL3: FAL3 adds the requirement that the subscriber authenticate directly to the RP
1230   using a bound authenticator along with presenting the authentication assertion. The
1231   presence of this additional authenticator provides a very high assurance to the RP that
1232   the party accessing the RP is the party identified in the assertion. The trust agreement and
1233   registration cannot be dynamic.

1234   5.2.3. Initial Assurance Level Selection
1235   The identification and assessment of the potential impacts of failures in identity proofing,
1236   authentication, and federation processes informs the organization’s digital identity risk
1237   management process and the initial selection of assurance levels for those areas. These
1238   initial selections are primarily based on cybersecurity risk, but will be tailored, based on
1239   mission needs and other potential impacts to the organization, users, and mission partners.
1240   Organizations SHALL develop and document a process and governance model for
1241   selecting initial assurance levels based on the potential impact of digital identity failures.
1242   This section provides guidance on the major elements to include in that process.

1243   5.2.3.1. Selecting Initial IAL
1244   The IAL reflects the level of assurance that an applicant holds the claimed real-life
1245   identity. Organizations SHALL use a risk-based approach to select the most appropriate
1246   identity proofing requirements for their RP application. The impact analysis described in
1247   Sec. 5.3.1 informs the selection of the initial IAL selection. This initial selection SHALL
1248   be tailored, as described in Sec. 5.3, based on mission needs, risk tolerance, and potential
1249   impacts to privacy, equity, and usability, before making a final IAL determination.

                                                    32
       NIST SP 800-63-4 ipd                                               Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022


1250   The IAL selection does not mean the RP application owner will need to perform the
1251   proofing themselves since identity proofing is the function of the CSP.
1252   Not all RP applications will require identity proofing. If the RP application does not
1253   require any personal information to execute any digital transactions, the system can
1254   operate without identity proofing users of the RP application. If personal information
1255   is needed, the RP needs to determine if validated and verified attributes are required or
1256   if self-asserted attributes are acceptable. If there are insignificant potential harms from
1257   accepting self-asserted attributes, the system may also be able to operate without identity
1258   proofing users. In such cases, the identity proofing processes described in [SP800-63A]
1259   are not applicable to the system.
1260   If an organization determines that identity proofing is necessary, the initial IAL
1261    SHALL be assessed based on the potential impacts of identity proofing failures. As
1262   described in Sec. 5.1, potential impacts SHALL be considered from the perspective of
1263   the organization, individuals, other organizations, and the nation, for harms incurred
1264   through the use or operation of the RP application. While the organization may not be
1265   negatively impacted, the user could be significantly harmed, as could individuals whose
1266   privacy or other rights have been violated by the business practices of a service provider.
1267   Organizations SHOULD consider the worst-case when identifying the overall impact
1268   level of the RP application, but may use risk management processes to tailor their initial
1269   selection when there are differing impacts.
1270   When assessing the overall impact level of the RP application, the organization SHOULD
1271   consider impacts to mission delivery separately from other impact categories. Potential
1272   failures in the identity proofing process that could lead to harms in mission delivery
1273   should be assessed by the organization to determine if the associated impacts would
1274   be mitigated or exacerbated by the implementation of more rigorous identity proofing
1275   processes. As such, the organization MAY exclude the mission delivery category when
1276   initially identifying the overall impact level of the RP application, as these impacts will
1277   need to be considered in the tailoring process.
1278   The overall impact level assessed by the organization leads to a preliminary selection of
1279   the IAL from which further tailoring may be done:
1280       • Low impact: IAL1
1281       • Moderate impact: IAL2
1282       • High impact: IAL3
1283   The preliminary selection assumes that higher potential impacts of failures in the identity
1284   proofing process should be mitigated by higher assurance processes. While this is often
1285   the case, organizations should consider the specific failures, impact categories, and
1286   impacted entities identified as part of the impact analysis to determine if additional
1287   tailoring is warranted. For example, if a failure to enroll a legitimate applicant could lead

                                                    33

       December 2022


1288   to excessive harm, organizations should assess whether lower-assurance identity proofing
1289   processes would be appropriate.
1290   The result of this process, including any additional tailoring, is the initial assessment
1291   of the IAL, which will be assessed against additional potential impacts as described in
1292   Sec. 5.3.

1293   5.2.3.2. Selecting Initial AAL
1294   The AAL reflects the level of assurance from the authentication process that the claimant
1295   is who they claim to be. Organizations SHALL use a risk-based approach to select
1296   the most appropriate authentication requirements for their RP application. The impact
1297   analysis described in Sec. 5.1.3 informs the selection of the initial AAL selection. This
1298   initial selection SHALL be tailored, as described in Sec. 5.3, based on mission needs, risk
1299   tolerance, and potential impacts to privacy, equity, and usability, before making a final
1300   AAL determination.
1301   The AAL selection does not mean the RP application owner will need to issue
1302   authenticators themselves.
1303   The initial AAL SHALL be assessed based on the potential impacts of authentication
1304   failures. As described in Sec. 5.1, potential impacts SHALL be considered from the
1305   perspective of the organization, individuals, other organizations, and the nation, for harms
1306   incurred through the use or operation of the RP application, as the level of harm from a
1307   failure could vary significantly across these entities. Organizations SHOULD consider
1308   the worst-case when identifying the overall impact level of the RP application, but may
1309   use risk management processes to tailor their initial selection when there are differing
1310   impacts.
1311   When assessing the overall impact level of the RP application, the organization SHOULD
1312   consider impacts to mission delivery separately from other impact categories. Potential
1313   failures in the authentication process that could lead to harms in mission delivery should
1314   be assessed by the organization to determine if the associated impacts would be mitigated
1315   or exacerbated by the implementation of more rigorous authentication controls. As such,
1316   the organization MAY exclude the mission delivery category when initially identifying
1317   the overall impact level of the RP application, as these impacts will need to be considered
1318   in the tailoring process.
1319   The overall impact level assessed by the organization leads to a preliminary selection of
1320   the AAL from which further tailoring may be done:
1321       • Low impact: AAL1
1322       • Moderate impact: AAL2
1323       • High impact: AAL3

       December 2022


1324   The preliminary selection assumes that higher potential impacts of failures in the
1325   authentication process should be mitigated by higher assurance processes. While this
1326   is often the case, organizations should consider the specific failures, impact categories,
1327   and impacted entities identified as part of the impact analysis to determine if additional
1328   tailoring is warranted. Further, organizations should consider legal, regulatory, or
1329   policy requirements that govern digital services. For example, the terms of [EO13681]
1330   requiring “that all organizations making personal data accessible to citizens through
1331   digital applications require the use of multiple factors of authentication,” which would
1332   drive the selection of AAL2 or AAL3.
1333   The result of this process, including any additional tailoring, is the initial assessment of
1334   the AAL, which will be as assessed against additional potential impacts as described in
1335   Sec. 5.3.

1336   5.2.3.3. Selecting Initial FAL
1337   The FAL reflects the level of assurance in identity assertions that convey the results of
1338   authentication processes and relevant identity information to RP systems. Organizations
1339    SHALL use a risk-based approach to select the most appropriate federation requirements
1340   for their RP application. The impact analysis described in Sec. 5.3.1 informs the selection
1341   of the initial FAL selection. This initial selection SHALL be tailored, as described in
1342   Sec. 5.3, based on mission needs, risk tolerance, and potential impacts to privacy, equity,
1343   and usability, before making a final FAL determination.
1344   The initial FAL SHALL be assessed based on the potential impacts of failures in the
1345   presentation or acceptance of assertions in federated identity architectures. Examples
1346   of compromise include use of assertion replay to impersonate a valid user or leakage of
1347   assertion information through the browser. As described in Sec. 5.1, potential impacts
1348    SHALL be considered from the perspective of the organization, individuals, other
1349   organizations, and the nation, for harms incurred through the use or operation of the
1350   RP application, as the level of harm from a failure could vary significantly across these
1351   entities. Organizations SHOULD consider the worst-case when identifying the overall
1352   impact level of the RP application, but may use risk management processes to tailor their
1353   initial selection when there are differing impacts.
1354   When assessing the overall impact level of the RP application, the organization SHOULD
1355   consider impacts to mission delivery separately from other impact categories. Potential
1356   failures in federated architectures that could lead to harms in mission delivery MAY be
1357   assessed by the organization to determine if the associated impacts would be mitigated or
1358   exacerbated by the implementation of more rigorous controls by identity providers. As
1359   such, the organization may exclude the mission delivery impact category when initially
1360   identifying the overall impact level of the RP application, as these impacts will need to be
1361   considered in the tailoring process.

       December 2022


1362   The overall impact level assessed by the organization leads to a preliminary selection of
1363   the FAL from which further tailoring may be done:
1364       • Low impact: FAL1
1365       • Moderate impact: FAL2
1366       • High impact: FAL3
1367   The preliminary selection assumes that higher potential impacts of failures in federated
1368   identity architectures should be mitigated by higher assurance processes. While this is
1369   often the case, organizations should consider the specific failures, impact categories,
1370   and impacted entities identified as part of the impact analysis to determine if additional
1371   tailoring is warranted.
1372   The result of this process, including any additional tailoring, is the initial assessment of
1373   the FAL, which will be as assessed against additional potential impacts as described in
1374   Sec. 5.3.

1375   5.3. Tailor and Document Assurance Levels
1376   Tailoring provides a process to modify an initially assessed assurance level or implement
1377   compensating controls based on ongoing detailed impact and risk assessments.
1378   Organizations SHOULD implement the assessed assurance level as defined in these
1379   guidelines. However, these guidelines provide flexibility to allow for organizations
1380   to meet specific mission needs and address unique risk appetites and considerations.
1381   Therefore, organizations SHALL establish and document an xAL tailoring process. At a
1382   minimum this process:
1383      1. SHALL include a structured governance approach to allow for decision-making
1384         and conflict resolution.
1385      2. SHALL document all decisions in the tailoring process, including the assessed
1386         xALs, modified xALs, and compensating controls in the Digital Identity
1387         Acceptance Statement (see Sec. 5.3.4).
1388      3. SHALL justify and document all risk-based decisions or modifications to
1389         the initially assessed xALs in the Digital Identity Acceptance Statement (see
1390         Sec. 5.3.4).
1391      4. SHOULD establish a cross-functional capability to support subject matter analysis
1392         of xAL selection impacts in the tailoring process.
1393      5. SHOULD be a continuous process that incorporates real world operational data to
1394         evaluate the impacts of selected xAL controls.
1395   The tailoring process promotes a structured means to balance risks and impacts in the
1396   furtherance of protecting systems, data, and services in a manner that enables mission
1397   success while supporting equity, privacy, and usability for individuals.

       December 2022


1398   5.3.1. Assess Privacy, Equity, Usability and Threats
1399   When selecting and tailoring assurance levels for specific applications, it is critical that
1400   insights and inputs to the process extend beyond an initial, static impact assessment.
1401   When transitioning from an initial assurance level to the final xAL selection and
1402   implementation, organizations SHALL conduct detailed assessments of the controls
1403   defined at the assurance level to determine potential impacts in their operational
1404   environment. At a minimum, organizations SHALL assess impacts related to the
1405   following areas:
1406       • Privacy – to determine unintended consequences to the privacy of individuals that
1407         will be subject to the controls at an assessed xAL and of individuals affected by
1408         organizational or third-party practices related to the establishment, management, or
1409         federation of a digital identity.
1410       • Equity – to determine whether implementation of controls may create or maintain
1411         inequities across demographics or user groups.
1412       • Usability – to determine whether implementation of the selected controls will result
1413         in challenges to end-user experience.
1414       • Threat – to determine whether the defined assurance level will address specific
1415         threats based on environment, threat actors, and known tactics, techniques, and
1416         procedures (TTPs).
1417   Additionally, organizations SHOULD conduct additional business specific assessments
1418   as appropriate to fully represent mission and domain specific considerations not captured
1419   here. These assessments SHALL be extended to any compensating or supplemental
1420   controls as defined in Sec. 5.3.2 and Sec. 5.3.3.

1421   5.3.2. Identify Compensating Controls
1422   A compensating control is a management, operational, or technical control employed
1423   by an organization in lieu of a recommended control in the defined xALs. They are
1424   intended, to the greatest degree possible, to address the same risks as the baseline control
1425   is intended to address.
1426   Organizations SHOULD implement their identity services per the requirements in these
1427   guidelines for their tailored assurance level. However, where organizations are unable
1428   to implement a specific control associated with their baseline or tailored assurance
1429   level, they MAY select to implement a compensating control. This control MAY be a
1430   modification to a digital identity process as defined in these guidelines, but MAY also be
1431   applied elsewhere in an application, transaction, or service lifecycle. For example:
1432       • A federal agency could choose to use a federal background investigation and
1433         checks, as referenced by Personal Identity Verification [FIPS201], to compensate
1434         for the identity evidence validation with authoritative sources requirement under
1435         these guidelines.

                                                    37
       NIST SP 800-63-4 ipd                                              Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022


1436       • An organization could choose to implement stricter auditing and transactional
1437         review processes on a payment application where verification processes using
1438         weaker forms of identity evidence were accepted due to availability of evidence
1439         in the end-user population.
1440   Where compensating controls are implemented, organizations SHALL demonstrate
1441   comparability of a chosen alternative or document residual risk incurred by deviating
1442   from normative requirements. Organizations SHALL implement procedures to document
1443   both the justification for any departure from normative requirements and detail the
1444   compensating controls employed. The inclusion of compensating controls does not
1445   imply that an organization must tailor to a lower xAL. The process of tailoring allows
1446   for agencies and service providers to make risk-based decisions in how they implement
1447   their xALs and provides a mechanism for documenting and communicating decisions
1448   through the Digital Identity Acceptance Statement described in Sec. 5.3.4.

1449   5.3.3. Identify Supplemental Controls
1450   Supplemental controls are those that may be added, in addition to those specified in the
1451   organizations tailored assurance level, in order to address specific threats or attacks.
1452   Organizations SHOULD identify and implement supplemental controls where they
1453   identify threats that may not be addressed in baseline controls. For example:
1454       • An organization could choose to verify an end user against additional pieces of
1455         identity evidence, beyond what is required by the assurance level, due to a high
1456         prevalence of fraudulent attempts to complete the proofing process.
1457       • An organization could choose to implement risk-scoring analytics, coupled with
1458         re-proofing mechanisms, to confirm a user’s identity when their access attempts
1459         exhibit certain risk factors.
1460   Where organizations implement supplemental controls, these SHALL be assessed for
1461   impacts based on the same factors used to tailor the organization’s assurance level.
1462   Supplemental controls SHALL be documented.

1463   5.3.4. Document Results - The Digital Identity Acceptance Statement
1464   The Digital Identity Acceptance Statement documents the results of the digital identity
1465   risk management process. This includes the Impact Assessment, Initial Assurance Level
1466   Selection, and Tailoring process.
1467   The statement SHALL include, at a minimum:
1468      1. Initial Impact Assessment Results
1469      2. Initially assessed xAL,
1470      3. Tailored xAL and rationale, if tailored xAL differs from initially assessed xAL,


                                                   38
       NIST SP 800-63-4 ipd                                                Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022


1471      4. All compensating controls and their comparability or residual risk associated with
1472         compensating controls
1473      5. All supplemental controls
1474   Federal agencies SHOULD include this information in the system authorization package
1475   described in [SP800-37].

1476   5.4. Continuously Evaluate and Improve
1477   Threat actors adapt, user expectations and needs shift, and missions evolve. As such,
1478   risk assessments and identity solutions are not to be set and forgotten. To maintain pace
1479   with the constantly shifting environment in which they operate, organizations SHOULD
1480   implement a continuous evaluation and improvement program that leverages input from
1481   people interacting with the identity system. These programs SHOULD consider feedback
1482   from application performance metrics, threat intelligence, fraud analytics, assessments of
1483   equity impacts, privacy impact analysis, and user inputs.

1484   5.5. Cyber, Fraud, and Identity Program Integrity
1485   Typically, identity solutions are the front door for a critical business or service function.
1486   Accordingly, they should not operate in a vacuum. Close coordination of identity
1487   functions with cybersecurity teams, threat intelligence teams, and program integrity
1488   teams can enable a more complete protection of business capabilities, while constantly
1489   improving identity solution capabilities. For example, payment fraud data collected
1490   by program integrity teams could provide indicators of compromised subscriber
1491   accounts and potential weaknesses in identity proofing implementations. Similarly,
1492   threat intelligence teams may receive indication of new TTPs that may impact identity
1493   proofing, authentication, and federation processes. Organizations SHOULD establish
1494   consistent mechanisms for the exchange of information between critical security and
1495   fraud stakeholders.
1496   Where supporting service providers, such as CSPs, are external, this may be complicated,
1497   but SHOULD be considered in contractual and legal mechanisms. All data collected,
1498   transmitted, or shared SHALL be minimized and subject to a detailed privacy and legal
1499   assessment.

1587   Appendix A.      Deﬁnitions and Abbreviations
1588   This section is informative.

1589   A.1. Deﬁnitions
1590   A wide variety of terms is used in the realm of authentication. While many terms’
1591   definitions are consistent with earlier versions of SP 800-63, some have changed in this
1592   revision. Many of these terms lack a single, consistent definition, warranting careful
1593   attention to how the terms are defined here.
1594   Access
1595   To make contact with one or more discrete functions of an online, digital service.

1596   Activation
1597   The process of inputting an activation factor into a multi-factor authenticator to enable its
1598   use for authentication.

1599   Activation factor
1600   An additional authentication factor that is used to enable successful authentication
1601   with a multi-factor authenticator. Since all multi-factor authenticators are physical
1602   authenticators, activation factors are either memorized secrets or biometric factors.

1603   Active Attack
1604   An attack on the authentication protocol where the attacker transmits data to the claimant,
1605   Credential Service Provider (CSP), verifier, or Relying Party (RP). Examples of active
1606   attacks include attacker-in-the-middle (AitM), impersonation, and session hijacking.

1607   Address of Record
1608   The validated and verified location (physical or digital) where a subscriber can receive
1609   communications using approved mechanisms.

1610   Allowlist
1611   A documented list of specific elements that are allowed, per policy decision. In federation
1612   contexts, this is most commonly used to refer to the list of RPs allowed to connect to
1613   an IdP without subscriber intervention. This concept has historically been known as a

       December 2022


1618   Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS)-approved or NIST recommended. An
1619   algorithm or technique that is either 1) specified in a FIPS or NIST Recommendation, or
1620   2) adopted in a FIPS or NIST Recommendation.

1621   Assertion
1622   A statement from a verifier to an RP that contains information about a subscriber.
1623   Assertions may also contain verified attributes.

1624   Assertion Reference
1625   A data object, created in conjunction with an assertion, that identifies the verifier and
1626   includes a pointer to the full assertion held by the verifier.

1627   Asymmetric Keys
1628   Two related keys, comprised of a public key and a private key, that are used to perform
1629   complementary operations such as encryption and decryption or signature verification and
1630   generation.

1631   Attack
1632   An unauthorized entity’s attempt to fool a verifier or RP into believing that the
1633   unauthorized individual in question is the subscriber.

1634   Attacker
1635   A party, including an insider, who acts with malicious intent to compromise a system.

1636   Attacker-in-the-Middle Attack (AitM)
1637   An attack in which an attacker is positioned between two communicating parties in order
1638   to intercept and/or alter data traveling between them. In the context of authentication, the
1639   attacker would be positioned between claimant and verifier, between registrant and CSP
1640   during enrollment, or between subscriber and CSP during authenticator binding.

1641   Attribute
1642   A quality or characteristic ascribed to someone or something.

1643   Attribute API
1644   An API that provides attribute values, derived attribute values, and related information
1645   about one or more subscribers. Access to these APIs are often granted to RPs in the
1646   context of an identity API (for a single subscriber) or a provisioning API (for multiple
1647   subscribers). This is distinct from an attribute verification API which is used to verify
1648   attribute values for a CSP during the identity proofing process.

1649   Attribute Bundle

       December 2022


1650   A packaged set of attributes, usually contained within an assertion. Attribute bundles offer
1651   RPs a simple way to retrieve the most relevant attributes they need from IdPs. OpenID
1652   Connect scopes [OIDC] are an implementation of attribute bundles.

1653   Attribute Provider
1654   A service that provides a subscriber’s attributes without asserting that the subscriber is
1655   present to the RP. An Identity Provider (IdP) is one type of attribute provider used in
1656   federated scenarios. Attribute providers often make these attributes available by means of
1657   an attribute API.

1658   Attribute Value
1659   A complete statement asserting a property of a subscriber, independent of format. For
1660   example, for the attribute “birthday,” a value could be “12/1/1980” or “December 1,
1661   1980.”

1662   Attribute Verification API
1663   An API that provides verification of attribute values for use during an identity proofing
1664   process. This API accepts attribute values as input queries and returns whether or not the
1665   attribute values can be verified. This is distinct from an attribute API which is used to
1666   convey attributes to an RP.

1667   Authenticate
1668   See Authentication.

1669   Authenticated Protected Channel
1670   An encrypted communication channel that uses approved cryptography where the
1671   connection initiator (client) has authenticated the recipient (server). Authenticated
1672   protected channels provide confidentiality and MitM protection and are frequently used in
1673   the user authentication process. Transport Layer Security (TLS) [BCP195] is an example
1674   of an authenticated protected channel where the certificate presented by the recipient is
1675   verified by the initiator. Unless otherwise specified, authenticated protected channels
1676   do not require the server to authenticate the client. Authentication of the server is often
1677   accomplished through a certificate chain leading to a trusted root rather than individually
1678   with each server.

1679   Authentication
1680   The process of determining the validity of one or more authenticators used to claim a
1681   digital identity. Authentication establishes that a subject attempting to access a digital
1682   service is in control of the technologies used to authenticate.

1683   Authentication Factor
1684   The three types of authentication factors are something you know, something you have,
1685   and something you are. Every authenticator has one or more authentication factors.

       December 2022


1686   Authentication Intent
1687   The process of confirming the claimant’s intent to authenticate or reauthenticate
1688   by including a process requiring user intervention in the authentication flow. Some
1689   authenticators (e.g., OTP devices) establish authentication intent as part of their operation,
1690   others require a specific step, such as pressing a button, to establish intent. Authentication
1691   intent is a countermeasure against use by malware of the endpoint as a proxy for
1692   authenticating an attacker without the subscriber’s knowledge.

1693   Authentication Protocol
1694   A defined sequence of messages between a claimant and a verifier that demonstrates that
1695   the claimant has possession and control of one or more valid authenticators to establish
1696   their identity, and, optionally, demonstrates that the claimant is communicating with the
1697   intended verifier.

1698   Authentication Secret
1699   A generic term for any secret value that an attacker could use to impersonate the
1700   subscriber in an authentication protocol.
1701   These are further divided into short-term authentication secrets, which are only useful
1702   to an attacker for a limited period of time, and long-term authentication secrets, which
1703   allow an attacker to impersonate the subscriber until they are manually reset. The
1704   authenticator secret is the canonical example of a long-term authentication secret, while
1705   the authenticator output, if it is different from the authenticator secret, is usually a short-
1706   term authentication secret.

1707   Authenticator
1708   Something the claimant possesses and controls (typically a cryptographic module or
1709   password) that is used to authenticate the claimant’s identity. In some previous editions of
1710   SP 800-63, this was referred to as a token.

1711   Authentication Assurance Level (AAL)
1712   A category describing the strength of the authentication process.

1713   Authenticator Output
1714   The output value generated by an authenticator. The ability to generate valid authenticator
1715   outputs on demand proves that the claimant possesses and controls the authenticator.
1716   Protocol messages sent to the verifier are dependent upon the authenticator output, but
1717   they may or may not explicitly contain it.

1718   Authenticator Secret
1719   The secret value contained within an authenticator.

       December 2022


1720   Authenticator Type
1721   A category of authenticators with common characteristics. Some authenticator types
1722   provide one authentication factor, others provide two.

1723   Authenticity
1724   The property that data originated from its purported source.

1725   Authoritative Source
1726   An entity that has access to, or verified copies of, accurate information from an issuing
1727   source such that a CSP can confirm the validity of the identity evidence supplied by an
1728   applicant during identity proofing. An issuing source may also be an authoritative source.
1729   Often, authoritative sources are determined by a policy decision of the agency or CSP
1730   before they can be used in the identity proofing validation phase.

1731   Authorize
1732   A decision to grant access, typically automated by evaluating a subject’s attributes.

1733   Authorized Party
1734   In federation, the organization, person, or entity that is responsible for making decisions
1735   regarding the release of information within the federation transaction, most notably
1736   subscriber attributes. This is often the subscriber (when runtime decisions are used) or
1737   the party operating the IdP (when allowlists are used).

1738   Back-Channel Communication
1739   Communication between two systems that relies on a direct connection (allowing for
1740   standard protocol-level proxies), without using redirects through an intermediary such as
1741   a browser. This can be accomplished using HTTP requests and responses.

1742   Bearer Assertion
1743   The assertion a party presents as proof of identity, where possession of the assertion itself
1744   is sufficient proof of identity for the assertion bearer.

1745   Binding
1746   An association between a subscriber identity and an authenticator or given subscriber
1747   session.

1748   Biometric Reference
1749   one or more stored biometric samples, templates, or models attributed to an individual
1750   and used as the object of biometric comparison. For example, a facial image stored
1751   digitally on a passport, fingerprint minutiae template on a National ID card or Gaussian
1752   Mixture Model for speaker recognition, in a database.


                                                    47

       December 2022


1753   Biometric Sample
1754   An analog or digital representation of biometric characteristics prior to biometric feature
1755   extraction. An example is a record containing a fingerprint image.

1756   Biometrics
1757   Automated recognition of individuals based on their biological and behavioral
1758   characteristics.

1759   Blocklist
1760   A documented list of specific elements that are blocked, per policy decision. This concept
1761   has historically been known as a blacklist.

1762   Challenge-Response Protocol
1763   An authentication protocol where the verifier sends the claimant a challenge (usually a
1764   random value or nonce) that the claimant combines with a secret (such as by hashing
1765   the challenge and a shared secret together, or by applying a private key operation
1766   to the challenge) to generate a response that is sent to the verifier. The verifier can
1767   independently verify the response generated by the claimant (such as by re-computing the
1768   hash of the challenge and the shared secret and comparing to the response, or performing
1769   a public key operation on the response) and establish that the claimant possesses and
1770   controls the secret.

1771   Claimant
1772   A subject whose identity is to be verified using one or more authentication protocols.

1773   Claimed Address
1774   The physical location asserted by a subject where they can be reached. It includes the
1775   individual’s residential street address and may also include their mailing address.
1776   For example, a person with a foreign passport living in the U.S. will need to give an
1777   address when going through the identity proofing process. This address would not be
1778   an “address of record” but a “claimed address.”

1779   Claimed Identity
1780   An applicant’s declaration of unvalidated and unverified personal attributes.

1781   Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart
1782   (CAPTCHA)
1783   An interactive feature added to web forms to distinguish whether a human or automated
1784   agent is using the form. Typically, it requires entering text corresponding to a distorted
1785   image or a sound stream.

       December 2022


1786   Core Attributes
1787   The set of identity attributes the CSP has determined and documented to be required for
1788   identity proofing.

1789   Credential
1790   An object or data structure that authoritatively binds an identity - via an identifier or
1791   identifiers - and (optionally) additional attributes, to at least one authenticator possessed
1792   and controlled by a subscriber.
1793   A credential is issued, stored, and maintained by the CSP. Copies of information from
1794   the credential can be possessed by the subscriber, typically in the form of a one or more
1795   digital certificates that are often contained, along with their associated private keys, in an
1796   authenticator.

1797   Credential Service Provider (CSP)
1798   A trusted entity whose functions include identity proofing applicants to the identity
1799   service and the registration of authenticators to subscriber accounts. A CSP may be an
1800   independent third party.

1801   Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)
1802   An attack in which a subscriber currently authenticated to an RP and connected through
1803   a secure session browses to an attacker’s website, causing the subscriber to unknowingly
1804   invoke unwanted actions at the RP.
1805   For example, if a bank website is vulnerable to a CSRF attack, it may be possible for
1806   a subscriber to unintentionally authorize a large money transfer, merely by viewing a
1807   malicious link in a webmail message while a connection to the bank is open in another
1808   browser window.

1809   Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
1810   A vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious code into an otherwise benign
1811   website. These scripts acquire the permissions of scripts generated by the target website
1812   and can therefore compromise the confidentiality and integrity of data transfers between
1813   the website and client. Websites are vulnerable if they display user-supplied data from
1814   requests or forms without sanitizing the data so that it is not executable.

1815   Cryptographic Authenticator
1816   An authenticator that proves possession of an authentication secret through direct
1817   communication, via the endpoint, with a verifier.

1818   Cryptographic Key
1819   A value used to control cryptographic operations, such as decryption, encryption,
1820   signature generation, or signature verification. For the purposes of these guidelines,

                                                    49

1821   key requirements shall meet the minimum requirements stated in Table 2 of NIST
1822   [SP800-57Part1].
1823   See also Asymmetric Keys, Symmetric Key.

1824   Cryptographic Module
1825   A set of hardware, software, and/or firmware that implements approved security functions
1826   (including cryptographic algorithms and key generation).

1827   Data Integrity
1828   The property that data has not been altered by an unauthorized entity.

1829   Derived Attribute Value
1830   A statement asserting a property of a subscriber without necessarily containing identity
1831   information, independent of format. For example, instead of requesting the attribute
1832   “birthday,” a derived value could be “older than 18”. Instead of requesting the attribute for
1833   “physical address,” a derived value could be “currently residing in this district.” Previous
1834   versions of these guidelines referred to this construct as an “attribute reference”.

1835   Digital Authentication
1836   The process of establishing confidence in user identities presented digitally to a system.
1837   In previous editions of SP 800-63, this was referred to as Electronic Authentication.

1838   Digital Signature
1839   An asymmetric key operation where the private key is used to digitally sign data and
1840   the public key is used to verify the signature. Digital signatures provide authenticity
1841   protection, integrity protection, and non-repudiation, but not confidentiality protection.

1842   Disassociability
1843   Per [NISTIR8062]: The processing of PII or events without association to individuals or
1844   devices beyond the operational requirements of the system.

1845   Eavesdropping Attack
1846   An attack in which an attacker listens passively to the authentication protocol to capture
1847   information that can be used in a subsequent active attack to masquerade as the claimant.

1848   Electronic Authentication (E-Authentication)
1849   See Digital Authentication.

1850   Enrollment
1851   The process through which an applicant applies to become a subscriber of a CSP and the
1852   CSP validates the applicant’s identity.

       December 2022


1853   Entropy
1854   A measure of the amount of uncertainty an attacker faces to determine the value of a
1855   secret. Entropy is usually stated in bits. A value having n bits of entropy has the same
1856   degree of uncertainty as a uniformly distributed n-bit random value.

1857   Equity
1858   Per EO 13985, Equity refers to the consistent and systematic fair, just, and impartial
1859   treatment of all individuals, including individuals who belong to underserved
1860   communities that have been denied such treatment, such as Black, Latino, and Indigenous
1861   and Native American persons, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, and other persons
1862   of color; members of religious minorities; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer
1863   (LGBTQ+) persons; persons with disabilities; persons who live in rural areas; and persons
1864   otherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality.

1865   Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS)
1866   Under the Information Technology Management Reform Act (Public Law 104-106),
1867   the Secretary of Commerce approves the standards and guidelines that the National
1868   Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) develops for federal computer systems.
1869   NIST issues these standards and guidelines as Federal Information Processing Standards
1870   (FIPS) for government-wide use. NIST develops FIPS when there are compelling federal
1871   government requirements, such as for security and interoperability, and there are no
1872   acceptable industry standards or solutions. See background information for more details.
1873   FIPS documents are available online on the FIPS home page: https://www.nist.gov/itl/fips.

1875   Federated Identifier
1876   The combination of a subject identifier within an assertion and an identifier for the IdP
1877   that issued that assertion. When combined, these pieces of information uniquely identify
1878   the subscriber in the context of a federation transaction.

1879   Federation
1880   A process that allows the conveyance of identity and authentication information across a
1881   set of networked systems.

1882   Federation Assurance Level (FAL)
1883   A category describing the assertion protocol used by the federation to communicate
1884   authentication and attribute information (if applicable) to an RP.

1885   Federation Proxy
1886   A component that acts as a logical RP to a set of IdPs and a logical IdP to a set of RPs,
1887   bridging the two systems with a single component. These are sometimes referred to as
1888   “brokers”.

       December 2022


1889   Federation Transaction
1890   A specific instance of processing an authentication using a federation process for a
1891   specific subscriber by conveying an assertion from an IdP to an RP.

1892   Front-Channel Communication
1893   Communication between two systems that relies on redirects through an intermediary
1894   such as a browser. This is normally accomplished by appending HTTP query parameters
1895   to URLs hosted by the receiver of the message.

1896   Hash Function
1897   A function that maps a bit string of arbitrary length to a fixed-length bit string. Approved
1898   hash functions satisfy the following properties:
1899     1. One-way - It is computationally infeasible to find any input that maps to any pre-
1900        specified output; and
1901     2. Collision resistant - It is computationally infeasible to find any two distinct inputs
1902        that map to the same output.

1903   Identity
1904   An attribute or set of attributes that uniquely describe a subject within a given context.

1905   Identity API
1906   An attribute API accessed by an RP for accessing attributes of a specific subscriber.
1907   Access to the identity API is generally granted as part of a federation authentication
1908   process and limited to the information for a single, specific subscriber.

1909   Identity Assurance Level (IAL)
1910   A category that conveys the degree of confidence that the applicant’s claimed identity is
1911   their real identity.

1912   Identity Evidence
1913   Information or documentation provided by the applicant to support the claimed identity.
1914   Identity evidence may be physical (e.g. a driver license) or digital (e.g. an assertion
1915   generated and issued by a CSP based on the applicant successfully authenticating to the
1916   CSP).

1917   Identity Proofing
1918   The process by which a CSP collects, validates, and verifies information about a person.

1919   Identity Provider (IdP)
1920   When using federation, this is the party that manages the subscriber’s primary
1921   authenticators and issues assertions derived from the subscriber account.

       December 2022


1922   Identity Resolution
1923   The process of collecting information about an applicant in order to uniquely distinguish
1924   an individual within the context of the population the CSP serves.

1925   Issuing Source
1926   An authority responsible for the generation of data, digital evidence (such as assertions),
1927   or physical documents that can be used as identity evidence.

1928   Kerberos
1929   A widely used authentication protocol developed at MIT. In “classic” Kerberos, users
1930   share a secret password with a Key Distribution Center (KDC). The user (Alice) who
1931   wishes to communicate with another user (Bob) authenticates to the KDC and the KDC
1932   furnishes a “ticket” to use to authenticate with Bob.
1933   See [SP800-63C] Sec. 11.2 for more information.

1934   Knowledge-Based Verification (KBV)
1935   Identity verification method based on knowledge of private information associated with
1936   the claimed identity. This is often referred to as knowledge-based authentication (KBA)
1937   or knowledge-based proofing (KBP).

1938   Manageability
1939   Per NISTIR 8062: Providing the capability for granular administration of personally
1940   identifiable information, including alteration, deletion, and selective disclosure.

1941   Memorized Secret
1942   A type of authenticator comprised of a character string intended to be memorized or
1943   memorable by the subscriber, permitting the subscriber to demonstrate something they
1944   know as part of an authentication process.

1945   Message Authentication Code (MAC)
1946   A cryptographic checksum on data that uses a symmetric key to detect both accidental
1947   and intentional modifications of the data. MACs provide authenticity and integrity
1948   protection, but not non-repudiation protection.

1949   Mobile Code
1950   Executable code that is normally transferred from its source to another computer system
1951   for execution. This transfer is often through the network (e.g., JavaScript embedded in a
1952   web page) but may transfer through physical media as well.

       December 2022


1954   A characteristic of an authentication system or an authenticator that requires more than
1955   one distinct authentication factor for successful authentication. MFA can be performed
1956   using a single authenticator that provides more than one factor or by a combination of
1957   authenticators that provide different factors.
1958   The three authentication factors are something you know, something you have, and
1959   something you are.

1960   Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
1961   An authentication system that requires more than one distinct authentication factor for
1962   successful authentication. Multi-factor authentication can be performed using a multi-
1963   factor authenticator or by a combination of authenticators that provide different factors.
1964   The three authentication factors are something you know, something you have, and
1965   something you are.

1966   Multi-Factor Authenticator
1967   An authenticator that provides more than one distinct authentication factor, such as a
1968   cryptographic authentication device with an integrated biometric sensor that is required to
1969   activate the device.

1970   Network
1971   An open communications medium, typically the Internet, used to transport messages
1972   between the claimant and other parties. Unless otherwise stated, no assumptions are
1973   made about the network’s security; it is assumed to be open and subject to active
1974   (e.g., impersonation, attacker-in-the-middle, session hijacking) and passive (e.g.,
1975   eavesdropping) attack at any point between the parties (e.g., claimant, verifier, CSP, RP).

1976   Nonce
1977   A value used in security protocols that is never repeated with the same key. For example,
1978   nonces used as challenges in challenge-response authentication protocols must not be
1979   repeated until authentication keys are changed. Otherwise, there is a possibility of a
1980   replay attack. Using a nonce as a challenge is a different requirement than a random
1981   challenge, because a nonce is not necessarily unpredictable.

1982   Offline Attack
1983   An attack where the attacker obtains some data (typically by eavesdropping on an
1984   authentication transaction or by penetrating a system and stealing security files) that
1985   the attacker is able to analyze in a system of their own choosing.

1986   One-to-one (1:1) Comparison
1987   The process in which a biometric sample from an individual is compared to a biometric
1988   reference to produce a comparison score.

       December 2022


1989   Online Attack
1990   An attack against an authentication protocol where the attacker either assumes the role of
1991   a claimant with a genuine verifier or actively alters the authentication channel.

1992   Online Guessing Attack
1993   An attack in which an attacker performs repeated logon trials by guessing possible values
1994   of the authenticator output.

1995   Pairwise Pseudonymous Identifier
1996   An opaque unguessable subscriber identifier generated by a CSP for use at a specific
1997   individual RP. This identifier is only known to and only used by one CSP-RP pair.

1998   Passive Attack
1999   An attack against an authentication protocol where the attacker intercepts data traveling
2000   along the network between the claimant and verifier, but does not alter the data (i.e.,
2001   eavesdropping).

2002   Passphrase
2003   A passphrase is a memorized secret consisting of a sequence of words or other text that a
2004   claimant uses to authenticate their identity. A passphrase is similar to a password in usage,
2005   but is generally longer for added security.

2022   information.

2023   Pharming
2024   An attack in which an attacker corrupts an infrastructure service such as DNS (Domain

2055   point of capture.

2056   Protected Session
2057   A session wherein messages between two participants are encrypted and integrity is
2058   protected using a set of shared secrets called session keys.
2059   A protected session is said to be authenticated if, during the session, one participant
2060   proves possession of one or more authenticators in addition to the session keys, and if the
2061   other party can verify the identity associated with the authenticator(s). If both participants
2062   are authenticated, the protected session is said to be mutually authenticated.

2063   Provisioning API
2064   An attribute API that allows an RP to access to attributes for multiple subscribers for
2065   the purposes of provisioning RP subscriber accounts. Access to a provisioning API is
2066   generally granted to the RP outside of a specific federated authentication transaction.

2079   that binds an identifier to a subscriber to a public key. The certificate indicates that the
2080   subscriber identified in the certificate has sole control and access to the private key. See
2081   also [RFC5280].

2082   Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
2083   A set of policies, processes, server platforms, software, and workstations used for the
2084   purpose of administering certificates and public-private key pairs, including the ability to

2209   by the validated identity attributes and associated evidence. In NIST SP 800-63, the term
2210   “verification” is synonymous with “identity verification.”

2211   Verifier
2212   An entity that verifies the claimant’s identity by verifying the claimant’s possession and
2213   control of one or more authenticators using an authentication protocol. To do this, the
2214   verifier needs to confirm the binding of the authenticators with the subscriber account and

       December 2022


2341   Appendix B.      Change Log
2342   B.1. SP 800-63-1
2343   NIST SP 800-63-1 updated NIST SP 800-63 to reflect current authenticator (then referred
2344   to as “token”) technologies and restructured it to provide a better understanding of
2345   the digital identity architectural model used here. Additional (minimum) technical
2346   requirements were specified for the CSP, protocols used to transport authentication
2347   information, and assertions if implemented within the digital identity model.

2348   B.2. SP 800-63-2
2349   NIST SP 800-63-2 was a limited update of SP 800-63-1 and substantive changes were
2350   made only in Sec. 5, Registration and Issuance Processes. The substantive changes in the
2351   revised draft were intended to facilitate the use of professional credentials in the identity
2352   proofing process, and to reduce the need to send postal mail to an address of record to
2353   issue credentials for level 3 remote registration. Other changes to Sec. 5 were minor
2354   explanations and clarifications.

2355   B.3. SP 800-63-3
2356   NIST SP 800-63-3 is a substantial update and restructuring of SP 800-63-2. SP 800-63-
2357   3 introduces individual components of digital authentication assurance — AAL, IAL,
2358   and FAL — to support the growing need for independent treatment of authentication
2359   strength and confidence in an individual’s claimed identity (e.g., in strong pseudonymous
2360   authentication). A risk assessment methodology and its application to IAL, AAL, and
2361   FAL has been included in this guideline. It also moves the whole of digital identity
2362   guidance covered under SP 800-63 from a single document describing authentication
2363   to a suite of four documents (to separately address the individual components mentioned
2364   above) of which SP 800-63-3 is the top-level document.
2365   Other areas updated in 800-63-3 include:
2366       • Renamed to Digital Identity Guidelines to properly represent the scope includes
2367         identity proofing and federation, and to support expanding the scope to include
2368         device identity, or machine-to-machine authentication in future revisions.
2369       • Changed terminology, including the use of authenticator in place of token to avoid
2370         conflicting use of the word token in assertion technologies.
2371       • Updated authentication and assertion requirements to reflect advances in both
2372         security technology and threats.
2373       • Added requirements on the storage of long-term secrets by verifiers.
2374       • Restructured identity proofing model.
2375       • Updated requirements regarding remote identity proofing.

       December 2022


2376      • Clarified the use of independent channels and devices as “something you have”.
2377      • Removed pre-registered knowledge tokens (authenticators), with the recognition
2378        that they are special cases of (often very weak) passwords.
2379      • Added requirements regarding account recovery in the event of loss or theft of an
2380        authenticator.
2381      • Removed email as a valid channel for out-of-band authenticators.
2382      • Expanded discussion of reauthentication and session management.
2383      • Expanded discussion of identity federation; restructuring of assertions in the
2384        context of federation.

2385   B.4. SP 800-63-4
2386   NIST SP 800-63-4 has substantial updates and re-organization from SP 800-63-3.
2387   Updates to 800-63-4 include:
2388      • Section 2.3 expands security and privacy consideration content of previous
2389        revisions. It also adds equity and usability considerations.
2390      • Section 4.1 includes updated non-federated and federated digital identity models
2391        and descriptions.
2392      • Section 4.4 consolidates informative descriptions and considerations on the use of
2393        federated identity architectures and assertions into one section.
2394      • Section 5 expands upon the risk management content of previous revisions and
2395        specifically mandates that organizations take into account impacts to individuals
2396        and communities in addition to impacts to the organization. It also elevates risks
2397        to mission delivery, including challenges to the provisioning of services to all
2398        people who are eligible for and entitled to them, within the risk management
2399        process and when implementing digital identity systems. The xAL selection
2400        flowcharts, previously found in 800-63-3, section 6, have been replaced with text
2401        that elaborates the risk management process along with a sample risk assessment
2402        matrix that supports xAL selection. Additionally, the guidelines now mandate
2403        continuous evaluation of potential impacts to individuals, communities, and
2404        organizations.
