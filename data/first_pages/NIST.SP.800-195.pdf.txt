     Awareness about the importance of strong cybersecurity for maintaining trust in the economy and protecting the
nation is at an all-time high. So, too, are the challenges. When it comes to cybersecurity, the National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST) has a long history of conducting path-breaking research and development, cultivating standards
and best practices, and facilitating technology transitions. We rely on open, transparent, and collaborative processes that
engage private and public sector participation and attract expertise from around the world. This 2016 report captures our
most noteworthy accomplishments.

    In 2016, NIST continued to advance fundamental research to support security and interoperability standards and
guidelines. This work was led by the Computer Security Division (CSD) in the NIST Information Technology Laboratory
(ITL). Among other things, CSD is responsible for developing cybersecurity standards, guidelines, tests, and metrics for
the protection of non-national security federal information systems. Recognizing the agency’s need to respond to and
anticipate increasing demands for its cybersecurity expertise, NIST established the Applied Cybersecurity Division (ACD)
within ITL to support additional applied research and to transition effective cybersecurity technology approaches to
government and business sectors nationwide. ACD helps to drive the adoption of appropriate cybersecurity solutions by
government and commercial organizations – enabling solutions-oriented collaborative interactions and offering guidance
on the use of research results, standards, and best practices. Other parts of NIST also are key contributors to NIST’s
cybersecurity portfolio.

    Strong partnerships with industry, academia and government are critical to NIST’s cybersecurity program. In 2016,
NIST continued to collaborate with stakeholders from across the country and around the world to raise awareness and
encourage use of the voluntary Cybersecurity Framework. In this spirit, NIST began to develop an update to the version first
published in 2014. NIST also prepared a draft Cybersecurity Framework profile aligned with manufacturing sector goals and
industry best practices. In addition, NIST developed the draft Baldrige Cybersecurity Excellence Builder self-assessment tool
that complements the Cybersecurity Framework and helps organizations to better understand the effectiveness of their
cybersecurity risk management efforts.

    Looking ahead is vital in the realm of cybersecurity. Knowing that if large-scale quantum computers are ever built,
they will be able to break many of the public-key cryptosystems currently in use and compromise the confidentiality and
integrity of digital communication on the Internet and elsewhere, NIST is working closely with the academic community and
industry to develop protective cryptographic standards that we all rely upon. Building on its successful tradition of working
openly with the worldwide cryptographic community, in 2016 NIST called for submissions for quantum-resistant public-key
cryptographic algorithms for standards. These algorithms must be secure against both quantum and classical computers,
and should interoperate with existing communications protocols and networks. After submissions are received late in
2017, NIST plans to spend 3-5 years working with the research community and industry to analyze the candidates before
selecting algorithms for standardization.

     Identity management is fundamental to security management. In 2016, NIST continued to advance solutions in identity
management through projects with partners who manage innovative but practical real-world solutions. Also in the past
year, NIST produced an introduction to the concepts of privacy engineering and risk management for federal information
systems. The goal is to help decrease privacy risks and enable organizations to make purposeful decisions about resource
allocation and effective implementation of controls in information systems. NIST also initiated an update to our Digital

         Identity Guideline (Special Publication 800-63), which provides technical guidelines to agencies for the implementation
         of digital authentication. Building from these foundational resources, NIST’s efforts will focus on strengthening the
         security, privacy, usability and interoperability of digital identity solutions that meet an organization’s identity and access
         management needs throughout the system lifecycle.

              During 2016, NIST’s National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) moved into a new permanent facility that

                   Center’s workspace from four to 23 separate, flexible laboratories—including two larger areas capable of
         safely hosting large equipment, such as automobiles. This additional space allows NCCoE to increase its collaborations
         and projects. In 2016, the Center published draft practice guides to support industry sectors, including healthcare, financial
         services, and energy; these guides are now beginning to be put to productive use. NCCoE also published draft documents
         to support security in key technology areas, such as cloud computing and mobile applications.

              The National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE), led by NIST, is a partnership between government, academia,
         and the private sector that is focused on promoting a robust network and an ecosystem of cybersecurity education,
         training, and workforce development. In 2016, NIST released an update to the NICE Cybersecurity Workforce Framework
         (NCWF); it already is being used in the private and public sectors to more effectively identify, recruit, develop and maintain
         cybersecurity talent. The NICE framework provides a common language to categorize and describe cybersecurity work that
         helps organizations to build a strong staff to protect systems and data.

              Our dedicated staff has accomplished a great deal in 2016, developing standards and working closely with scores
         of partners and drawing upon hundreds of private and public sector organizations and individuals. This is not a static
         endeavor. For example, NIST is fully aware of the urgent need to more aggressively address the security challenges of the
         Internet of Things and, more broadly, our connected world.

             We welcome any and all suggestions about where and how we can better provide the nation with the kind of
         cybersecurity information and tools that it needs in order to advance and protect our economy and our country.

    This Annual Report, formerly the Computer Security Division Annual Report, has been renamed to the Information
Technology Laboratory (ITL) Cybersecurity Program Annual Report. This change reflects the opportunity to describe the many
cybersecurity program highlights and accomplishments from throughout the laboratory. This Annual Report is organized into
several sections, each identified by a title page.
    Please note: This Annual Report covers the Federal Government’s Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 from October 1, 2015 to September
30, 2016.
    ITL, an operating unit under NIST, contains seven divisions. Five of these seven divisions are involved with cybersecurity
efforts at NIST. Throughout this Annual Report, there are some references to particular division activities, and to work by
groups within those divisions. Primarily, the authors have attributed accomplishments to ITL, since ITL staff have been
involved with each cybersecurity program included in this Annual Report. At the end of each program/project write-up, one
or more points of contact are provided and may be used to address questions or request for more information. Many sections
also include additional references that readers may find valuable.
      Below is a condensed hierarchical chart of ITL’s structure:

ASSESSMENT TESTING TOOLS
         ITL supports the development of biometric
conformance testing methodology standards and other
conformity assessment efforts through active technical
participation in the development of these standards and
the development of associated conformance test software,
architectures and test suites, collectively known as Biometric
Conformance Test Software (BioCTS). These test tools are
developed to promote the adoption of these standards
and to support users, product developers, and testing labs
that require conformance to selected biometric standards.
ITL contributes to the development of biometric standards

     The Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP)
was developed to support the federal user communities for
strong, independently tested, and commercially available
cryptographic modules. Through this program, the CMVP
works with international government, public and private
sectors as a part of the cryptographic community to
achieve standards-based security and assurance of correct
implementation. The goal is to provide federal agencies
with a security metric to use in procuring and deploying
cryptographic modules, and promote the use of validated
modules by industry and the public. The testing performed
by independent third-party laboratories accredited by
the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program
(NVLAP), and the validations performed by the CMVP
program provide this metric. Federal agencies, industry,
and the public can choose cryptographic modules and/or
products containing cryptographic modules from the CMVP
Validated Modules List and have confidence in the claimed
level of security and assurance of correct implementation.
     Cryptographic module testing and validation are
based on published NIST standards. Since federal agencies                             Figure 17: FY 2016 CMVP Certificates by Security Level

Authentication Guideline. OMB defines four levels of
assurance that a federal agency must select, based on a risk
assessment to determine the impact of an authentication
failure. This guideline covers remote authentication of users
(such as private individuals) interacting with government IT
systems over the Internet. It defines technical requirements
for each of the four levels of assurance in the areas of identity
proofing, authenticators, credential binding, management
processes, authentication protocols and federation. The

      The group is recognized for exceptional technical innovation in leading a global effort to develop Federal Information
      Processing Standard (FIPS) 202, the “SHA-3” hash function standard. Cryptographic hash functions are critical components
      of the technologies (e.g., digital signatures and message authentication) that secure global communications, international
      electronic commerce and more. Advances in cryptanalysis in 2004-2007 weakened the security of many widely used hash
      functions, broadly threatening cybersecurity. SHA-3 is intended to provide security for decades.

      The team is recognized for outstanding leadership and teamwork in coordinating the design and construction of the
      facility housing the National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence. In 12 months, this team transformed a 65,000-square-foot
      biotech facility into a state-of-the-art cybersecurity research center that is home to 28 laboratories and other workspaces
      for collaboration among government, academia and industry. During this time, this high-performing team brought
      together the necessary leadership skills, team-building techniques, contracting and procurement expertise, project
      management discipline, physical security methods, construction knowledge, and attention to detail required to complete
      this high-priority effort.

                Cyber attacks inevitably have negative impacts
           on relevant missions. However, concrete methods to
           accurately evaluate such impacts are rare. In this paper,
           we propose a probabilistic approach based on Bayesian
           networks for quantitative mission impact assessment.
           A System Object Dependency Graph (SODG) is first
           built to capture the intrusion propagation process at
           the low operating system level. On top of the SODG,
           a mission-task-asset (MTA) map can be established
           to associate the system objects with corresponding
           tasks and missions. Based on the MTA map, a Bayesian
           network can be constructed to leverage the collected
           intrusion evidence and infer the probabilities of tasks
           and missions being tainted. This approach is promising
           for effective quantitative mission impact assessment.
