This publication has been developed by NIST in accordance with its statutory responsibilities under the
Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) of 2014, 44 U.S.C. § 3551 et seq., Public Law
(P.L.) 113-283. NIST is responsible for developing information security standards and guidelines, including
minimum requirements for federal systems, but such standards and guidelines shall not apply to national
security systems without the express approval of appropriate federal officials exercising policy authority
over such systems. This guideline is consistent with the requirements of the Office of Management and
Budget (OMB) Circular A-130.

Nothing in this publication should be taken to contradict the standards and guidelines made mandatory and
binding on federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory authority. Nor should these
guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the Secretary of Commerce,
Director of the OMB, or any other federal official. This publication may be used by nongovernmental
organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright in the United States. Attribution would,
however, be appreciated by NIST.

There may be references in this publication to other publications currently under development by NIST in accordance
with its assigned statutory responsibilities. The information in this publication, including concepts and methodologies,
may be used by federal agencies even before the completion of such companion publications. Thus, until each
publication is completed, current requirements, guidelines, and procedures, where they exist, remain operative. For
planning and transition purposes, federal agencies may wish to closely follow the development of these new
publications by NIST.

                                                                                              It is critical to understand the organizational mission and how each system supports that mission.
                                                                                              After a system's role has been defined, the security requirements implicit in that role can also be

                                                                                              The roles and functions of a system may not be constrained to a single organization. In an inter-

                                                                                              corruption. There are many elements of software support.
                                                                                              The first element is controlling what software is used on a system. If users or systems personnel
                                                                                              can install and execute any software on a system, the system is more vulnerable to viruses,

                                                                                              organizations also oversee the configuration and use of powerful system utilities. System utilities

                                                                                              The second element in software support can be to ensure that software has not been modified
                                                                                              without proper authorization. This involves the protection of software and backup copies and can

                                                                                              Many organizations also include a program to ensure that software is properly licensed, as
                                                                                              required. For example, an organization may audit systems for illegal copies of copyrighted

                                                                                              any type of system.

                                                                                              Closely related to software support is configuration management—the process of tracking and
                                                                                              approving changes to the system. Configuration management can be formal or informal and
                                                                                              normally addresses hardware, software, networking, and other changes. The primary security

                                                                                              or unknowingly diminish security. Some of the methods discussed under software support (e.g.,
                                                                                              such as inspecting and testing software changes) can be used. Chapter 7 discusses other methods.
                                                                                              Note that the security goal is to know what changes occur, not to prevent security from being

                                                                                              risk due to the need to accomplish the mission. In such cases, the decrease in security is based on
                                                                                              a decision by the authorizing official who considered all appropriate factors. Furthermore, the

                                                                                              Support and operations personnel and sometimes users back up software and data. This function

                                                                                              often requires that the system be able to identify and differentiate between users. For example,
                                                                                              access control is often based on least privilege, which refers to granting users only those accesses

                                                                                              Systems recognize individuals based on the authentication data the systems receive.
