Executive Summary

Some federal agencies, in addition to being subject to the Federal Information Security Management Act
of 2002 (FISMA), are also subject to similar requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Security Rule (the Security Rule), if the agency is a covered entity
as defined by the rules implementing HIPAA.

This Special Publication summarizes the HIPAA security standards and explains some of the structure
and organization of the Security Rule. This publication helps to educate readers about information
security terms used in the HIPAA Security Rule and to improve understanding of the meaning of the
security standards set out in the Security Rule. This publication is also designed to direct readers to
helpful information in other NIST publications on individual topics the HIPAA Security Rule addresses.
Readers can draw upon these publications for consideration in implementing the Security Rule. This
publication is intended as an aid to understanding security concepts discussed in the HIPAA Security
Rule, and does not supplement, replace, or supersede the HIPAA Security Rule itself.

The HIPAA Security Rule specifically focuses on the safeguarding of electronic protected health
information (EPHI). Although FISMA applies to all federal agencies and all information types, only a
subset of agencies is subject to the HIPAA Security Rule based on their functions and use of EPHI. All
HIPAA covered entities, which include some federal agencies, must comply with the Security Rule. The
Security Rule specifically focuses on protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of EPHI, as
defined in the Security Rule. The EPHI that a covered entity creates, receives, maintains, or transmits
must be protected against reasonably anticipated threats, hazards, and impermissible uses and/or
disclosures. In general, the requirements, standards, and implementation specifications of the Security
Rule apply to the following covered entities:

•   Covered Health Care Providers—Any provider of medical or other health services, or supplies, who
    transmits any health information in electronic form in connection with a transaction for which HHS
    has adopted a standard.

•   Health Plans—Any individual or group plan that provides, or pays the cost of, medical care, including
    certain specifically listed governmental programs (e.g., a health insurance issuer and the Medicare
    and Medicaid programs).

•   Health Care Clearinghouses—A public or private entity that processes another entity’s health care
    transactions from a standard format to a non-standard format, or vice-versa.

•   Medicare Prescription Drug Card Sponsors –A nongovernmental entity that offers an endorsed
    discount drug program under the Medicare Modernization Act. This fourth category of “covered
    entity” will remain in effect until the drug card program ends in 2006.
NIST standards and guidelines can be used to support the requirements of both HIPAA and FISMA.

Title III of the E-Government Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-347), which recognized the importance of
information security to the economic and national security interests of the United States, tasked NIST
with responsibilities for creating security standards and guidelines, including the development of the
following:

•   Standards to be used by all federal agencies to categorize all information and information systems
    collected or maintained by or on behalf of each agency based on the objectives of providing
    appropriate levels of information security according to a range of risk levels.



                                                     vi
An Introductory Resource Guide for Implementing the HIPAA Security Rule


•   Guidelines recommending the types of information and information systems to be included in each
    category.

•   Minimum information security requirements (i.e., management, operational, and technical controls),
    for information and information systems in each such category.
FISMA directs heads of federal agencies and their chief information officers (CIOs) to ensure that there
are information security programs in place and trained personnel assigned to manage and support the
programs. Heavy emphasis is placed on fully integrating security into the business processes. Preparation
of security plans and certification and accreditation (C&A) of agency systems are critical to meeting the
objectives of FISMA. In many areas, both FISMA and the HIPAA Security Rule specify similar
requirements.

NIST security publications (Special Publications in the 800 series and Federal Information Processing
Standards (FIPS)) may be used by organizations to help provide a structured, yet flexible framework for
selecting, specifying, employing, and evaluating the security controls in information systems. For federal
organizations, the information provided by these publications can make a significant contribution toward
satisfying the requirements of FISMA and HIPAA.

1.     Introduction

NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements, used by
federal agencies in providing adequate information security for the protection of agency operations and
assets. Pursuant to this mission, NIST’s Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) has developed
guidance to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of information technology (IT) planning,
implementation, management, and operation.

NIST publishes a wide variety of publications on information security. These publications serve as a
valuable resource for federal agencies seeking to address existing and new federal information security
requirements. One such set of federal information security requirements are the security standards
adopted by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) under the Health Insurance Portability
and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA, Public Law 104-191). HIPAA required the Secretary to adopt,
among other standards, security standards for certain health information. These standards, known as the
HIPAA Security Rule (the Security Rule), were published on February 20, 2003. In the preamble to the
Security Rule, several NIST publications were cited as potentially valuable resources to readers with
specific questions and concerns about IT security.

Congress enacted the Administrative Simplification (part of Title II) provisions of HIPAA to, among
other things, promote efficiency in the health care industry through the use of standardized electronic
transactions, while protecting the privacy and security of health information. Pursuant to the
Administrative Simplification provisions of HIPAA, the Secretary of HHS adopted standards relating to:

•    Electronic healthcare transactions and code sets;

•    Privacy of protected health information;

•    Security of electronic protected health information (EPHI); and

•    Unique health identifiers.
This Special Publication summarizes the HIPAA security standards and explains some of the structure
and organization of the Security Rule. This publication helps to educate readers about information
security terms used in the HIPAA Security Rule and to improve understanding of the meaning of the
security standards set out in the Security Rule. This publication is also designed to direct readers to
helpful information in other NIST publications on individual topics the HIPAA Security Rule addresses.
Readers can draw upon these publications for consideration in implementing the Security Rule. This
publication is intended as an aid to understanding security concepts discussed in the HIPAA Security
Rule, and does not supplement, replace, or supersede the HIPAA Security Rule itself. While CMS
mentioned several of these publications in the preamble to the HIPAA Security Rule, CMS does not
require their use in complying with the Security Rule.1

This document addresses only the security standards of the Security Rule and not other provisions
adopted or raised by the Rule, such as 45 CFR § 164.105.

Figure 1 shows all the components of HIPAA and illustrates that the focus of this document is on the
security provisions of the statute and the regulatory rule.

“Covered entities” (except small health plans) must comply with the final Security Rule by April 21,
2005, and small health plans must comply by April 21, 2006.2 Readers should refer to the Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Web site, http://www.cms.hhs.gov/hipaa/hipaa2, for more
detailed information about the passage of HIPAA by Congress, specific provisions of HIPAA,
determination of the entities covered under the law, the complete text of the HIPAA Security Rule, the
deadline for compliance with the Rule, and enforcement information.

1.1    Purpose and Applicability

The purpose of this publication is to help educate readers about the security standards included in the
HIPAA Security Rule. This document is also designed to direct readers to helpful information in other
NIST publications on security topics included in the HIPAA Security Rule. Readers can draw upon these
publications for consideration in implementing the Security Rule.

The guidance provided in this publication is applicable to all federal information systems,3 other than
those systems designated as national security systems as defined in 44 United States Code (U.S.C.),


2
  The definition of “small health plan” at 45 CFR § 160.103 applies to all of the HIPAA rules, including the Security Rule. A
“small” health plan is one with annual receipts of $5 million or less.
3
 A federal information system is an information system used or operated by an executive agency, by a contractor of an executive
agency, or by another organization on behalf of an executive agency.


SP 800-66                                                                                                                Page 2
An Introductory Resource Guide for Implementing the HIPAA Security Rule


Section 3542.4 The guidance included in this publication has been broadly developed from a technical
perspective so as to be complementary to similar guidelines issued by agencies and offices operating or
exercising control over national security systems. State, local, and tribal governments, as well as private
sector organizations comprising the critical health infrastructure of the United States are encouraged to
consider using these guidelines, as appropriate.

NIST publications may be useful to any agency seeking to understand the security issues raised by the
HIPAA Security Rule regardless of that agency’s size, structure, or distribution of security
responsibilities. Specific agency missions, resources, and organizational structures, however, vary
greatly, and agencies’ approaches to implementing the HIPAA Security Rule may diverge significantly.
Federal agencies use different titles to identify roles that have security-related responsibilities and may
also assign particular responsibilities for implementing information security controls (those required by
HIPAA and others) differently. NIST SP 800-66 assists all agencies seeking further information on the
security safeguards discussed in the HIPAA Security Rule, regardless of the particular structures,
methodologies, and approaches used to address its requirements.

The preamble of the Security Rule states that HHS does not rate or endorse the use of industry developed
guidelines and/or models. Organizations that are not required to use this NIST special publication (by
other regulation, law, or requirement), yet choose to use it, must determine the value of its content for
implementing the Security Rule standards in their environments. The use of this publication or any other
NIST publication does not ensure or guarantee an organization will be compliant with the Security Rule.

1.2     Scope

This publication provides a brief overview of the HIPAA Security Rule, directs the reader to additional
NIST publications on information security, and identifies typical activities an agency should consider in
implementing an information security program.

This publication is intended as an aid for federal agencies to understand security concepts discussed in the
HIPAA Security Rule and does not supplement, replace, modify or supersede the Security Rule itself.
Anyone seeking clarifications of the HIPAA Security Rule should contact the Office of HIPAA Standards
at CMS. Readers may send questions to askhipaa@cms.hhs.gov or contact the CMS HIPAA Hotline, 1-
866-282-0659.

The NIST publications available as of the publication date of SP 800-66 were used in preparing this
document. NIST frequently publishes new standards and guidelines or updates existing publications that
may also serve as useful references. To remain current with the latest available list of NIST security
publications, the reader should periodically review the NIST Computer Security Resource Center (CSRC)
Web site at http://csrc.nist.gov.

  A national security system is any information system (including any telecommunications system) used or operated by an agency
or by a contractor of an agency, or other organization on behalf of an agency—(i) the function, operation or use of which:
involves intelligence activities, involves cryptographic activities related to national security; involves command and control of
military forces; involves equipment that is an integral part of a weapon or weapons system; or is critical to the direct fulfillment
of military or intelligence missions (excluding a system that is to be used for routine administrative and business applications, for
example, payroll, finance, logistics, and personnel management applications); or (ii) is protected at all times by procedures
established for information that have been specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive Order or an Act of
Congress to be kept classified in the interest of national defense or foreign policy. Agencies should consult NIST Special
Publication 800-59, Guide for Identifying an Information System as a National Security System, for guidance on determining the
status of their information systems.

2.    NIST IT Security Publications

 Special Publication 800-66 was developed by the Computer Security Division (CSD) of NIST’s ITL
pursuant to its mission regarding the development of guidance for IT security planning, implementation,

2.1 Security Program Development Life Cycle

The phases of a typical security program life cycle can be used to assist an organization with addressing
the standards of the HIPAA Security Rule. The life cycle phases include planning of security controls
and policies, implementation of security controls, assessment of the security of an IT system or program,
and technical and IT infrastructure guidance. An organization seeking to address issues in a particular
phase of the security program life cycle may wish to focus its attention on NIST publications most
relevant to that program phase. Figure 2 identifies NIST publications that may be most helpful to an
organization seeking more information on security-related issues in the development stages shown below.




              Figure 2. Key Publications for Establishing and Supporting a Security Program

2.2 Publications Directly Supporting Federal Requirements for System Certification and
Accreditation (C&A)

The E-Government Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-347) recognized the importance of information security
to the economic and national security interests of the United States. Title III of the E-Government Act,
entitled the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA), tasked NIST with
responsibilities for standards and guidelines, including the development of the following:

An Introductory Resource Guide for Implementing the HIPAA Security Rule


•   Standards to be used by all federal agencies to categorize all information and information systems
    collected or maintained by or on behalf of each agency based on the objectives of providing
    appropriate levels of information security according to a range of risk levels

•   Guidelines recommending the types of information and information systems to be included in each
    category

•   Minimum information security requirements (i.e., management, operational, and technical controls)
    for information and information systems in each such category.
FISMA directs heads of federal agencies and their Chief Information Officers (CIOs) to ensure that there
are information security programs in place and trained personnel assigned to manage and support the
programs. Heavy emphasis is placed on fully integrating security into the business processes. One of the
most critical processes important to ensuring that proper security controls are included in agency systems
is the process that provides an assessment of whether the security controls have been implemented and are
operating as intended. Coupled with this activity is the requirement that a management official authorize
each system for operation. These processes are known as certification and accreditation (C&A). FISMA
requires that agency systems be certified and accredited. This includes federal systems subject to
HIPAA. Figure 3 below highlights key publications essential to achieving system certification and
accreditation regarding security controls and the sequence in which they should be considered.

Following is a brief overview of the topics covered in each of the NIST publications identified in Figure
3. Included with each overview is a brief description of how the document supports other publications in
Figure 3.

Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 199, Standards for Security Categorization of
Federal Information and Information Systems

•   Presents standards for categorizing information and information systems based on the objective of
    providing appropriate levels of information security according to a range of risk levels.

•   Illustrates the security level used as an indicator (called “security category”) of how severely an
    agency mission can be potentially impacted (i.e., Low, Moderate, or High) if the worst-case scenario
    occurs from loss of confidentiality, integrity, and/or availability of information.

•   Aligns security categories to recommended initial baseline sets of security controls from SP 800-53 to
    be used as the starting point for risk analysis activities.
SP 800-60, Guide for Mapping Types of Information and Information Systems to Security Categories

•   Identifies various/typical information types found in federal agencies and discusses these in the
    context of the FIPS 199 security categories.

•   Provides a recommended methodology for mapping information types to a security category.

•   Discusses and applies the methodology to specific information types as examples of how to use the
    methodology.

•   When possible, identifies information types that should have the same security category across all
    federal agencies.
SP 800-53/FIPS 200 ,Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems 6

•   Provides a catalog of security controls for information systems (derived from many sources).

•   Recommends baseline security controls (minimum) for information for Low, Moderate, and High
    security categories for information systems in accordance with FIPS 199.

•   Provides guidance for agency-directed tailoring of baseline security controls based on risk/cost-
    benefit analyses.
SP 800-30, Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems

•   Provides guidance on risk management techniques and methods.
Focuses on assessment of magnitude of harm based on issues related to confidentiality, integrity, and
availability.

3. HIPAA Security Rule

The HIPAA Security Rule specifically focuses on the safeguarding of EPHI. Although FISMA applies to
all federal agencies and all information types, only a subset of agencies is subject to the HIPAA Security
Rule based on their functions and use of EPHI. All HIPAA covered entities, which includes some federal
agencies, must comply with the Security Rule. The Security Rule specifically focuses on protecting the
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of EPHI, as defined in the Security Rule. The EPHI that a
covered entity creates, receives, maintains, or transmits must be protected against reasonably anticipated
threats, hazards, and impermissible uses and/or disclosures. In general, the requirements, standards, and
implementation specifications of the Security Rule apply to the following covered entities:

•      Covered Health Care Providers— Any provider of medical or other health services, or supplies,
       who transmits any health information in electronic form in connection with a transaction for which
       HHS has adopted a standard.

•      Health Plans— Any individual or group plan that provides or pays the cost of medical care (e.g., a
       health insurance issuer and the Medicare and Medicaid programs).

•      Health Care Clearinghouses— A public or private entity that processes another entity’s health care
       transactions from a standard format to a non-standard format, or vice-versa.

•      Medicare Prescription Drug Card Sponsors – A nongovernmental entity that offers an endorsed
       discount drug program under the Medicare Modernization Act. This fourth category of “covered
       entity” will remain in effect until the drug card program ends in 2006.
This section identifies the main goals, explains some of the structure and organization, and identifies the
purpose of the sections of the Security Rule.

3.1 Security Rule Goals and Objectives

As required by the “Security standards: General rules”7 section of the HIPAA Security Rule, each
covered entity must:

•      Ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of EPHI that it creates, receives, maintains, or
       transmits,

•      Protect against any reasonably anticipated threats and hazards to the security or integrity of EPHI, and

•      Protect against reasonably anticipated uses or disclosures of such information that are not permitted
       by the Privacy Rule.
In complying with this section of the Security Rule, covered entities must be aware of the definitions
provided for confidentiality, integrity, and availability as given by § 164.304:

•      Confidentiality is “the property that data or information is not made available or disclosed to
       unauthorized persons or processes.”

•      Integrity is “the property that data or information have not been altered or destroyed in an
       unauthorized manner.”

An Introductory Resource Guide for Implementing the HIPAA Security Rule


•   Availability is “the property that data or information is accessible and useable upon demand by an
    authorized person.”
3.2 Security Rule Organization

To understand the requirements of the HIPAA Security Rule, it is helpful to be familiar with the basic
security terminology it uses to describe the security standards. By understanding the requirements and the
terminology in the HIPAA Security Rule, it becomes easier to see which NIST publications may be
appropriate reference resources and where to find more information. The Security Rule is separated into
six main sections that each include several standards and implementation specifications a covered entity
must address.8 Each of the six sections is listed below.

•   Security standards: General Rules - includes the general requirements all covered entities must
    meet; establishes flexibility of approach; identifies standards and implementation specifications (both
    required and addressable); outlines decisions a covered entity must make regarding addressable
    implementation specifications; and requires maintenance of security measures to continue reasonable
    and appropriate protection of electronic protected health information.

•   Administrative Safeguards - are defined in the Security Rule as the “administrative actions and
    policies, and procedures, to manage the selection, development, implementation, and maintenance of
    security measures to protect electronic protected health information and to manage the conduct of the
    covered entity's workforce in relation to the protection of that information.”

•   Physical Safeguards - are defined as the “physical measures, policies, and procedures to protect a
    covered entity's electronic information systems and related buildings and equipment, from natural and
    environmental hazards, and unauthorized intrusion.”

•   Technical Safeguards - are defined as the “the technology and the policy and procedures for its use
    that protect electronic protected health information and control access to it.”

•   Organizational Requirements - includes standards for business associate contracts and other
    arrangements, including memoranda of understanding between a covered entity and a business
    associate when both entities are government organizations; and requirements for group health plans.

•   Policies and Procedures and Documentation Requirements - requires implementation of
    reasonable and appropriate policies and procedures to comply with the standards, implementation
    specifications and other requirements of the Security Rule; maintenance of written (which may be
    electronic) documentation and/or records that includes policies, procedures, actions, activities, or
    assessments required by the Security Rule; and retention, availability and update requirements related
    to the documentation.
Within the Security Rule sections are standards and implementation specifications. Each HIPAA Security
Rule standard is required. A covered entity is required to comply with all standards of the Security Rule
with respect to all EPHI.

  Sections of the HIPAA regulations that are included in the Security Rule and therefore addressed in this document but do not
have their own modules are Part 160 — General Administrative Requirements § 160.103, Definitions; Part 164 — Security and
Privacy §§ 164.103, Definitions; 164.104, Applicability; 164.105, Organizational requirements (discussed in section 4 of this
document), 164.302 Applicability; 164.304, Definitions; 164.306, Security standards: General rules (discussed in section 3.1 of
this document), and 164.318, Compliance dates for the initial implementation of the security standards.


SP 800-66                                                                                                              Page 12
An Introductory Resource Guide for Implementing the HIPAA Security Rule


Many of the standards contain implementation specifications. An implementation specification is a more
detailed description of the method or approach covered entities can use to meet a particular standard.9
Implementation specifications are either required or addressable. However, regardless of whether a
standard includes implementation specifications, covered entities must comply with each standard.

•   A required implementation specification is similar to a standard, in that a covered entity must
    comply with it.

•   For addressable implementation specifications covered entities must perform an assessment to
    determine whether the implementation specification is a reasonable and appropriate safeguard for
    implementation in the covered entity’s environment. In general, after performing the assessment a
    covered entity decides if it will implement the addressable implementation specification; implement
    an equivalent alternative measure that allows the entity to comply with the standard; or not implement
    the addressable specification or any alternative measures, if equivalent measures are not reasonable
    and appropriate within its environment. Covered entities are required to document these assessments
    and all decisions. For federal agencies, however, all of the HIPAA Security Rule’s addressable
    implementation specifications will most likely be reasonable and appropriate safeguards for
    implementation, given their sizes, missions, and resources.
Where there are no implementation specifications identified in the Security Rule for a particular standard,
such as for the “Assigned Security Responsibility” and “Evaluation” standards, compliance with the
standard itself is required.

Anyone seeking clarification regarding the principles of the HIPAA Security Rule should send inquiries
to the CMS e-mail address askhipaa@cms.hhs.gov, or contact the CMS HIPAA Hotline, 1-866-282-0659.

3.3 Safeguards Sections of the Security Rule

Table 2 lists the standards and implementation specifications within the Administrative, Physical, and
Technical Safeguards sections of the Security Rule. The table is categorized according to the
categorization of standards within each of the safeguards sections in the Security Rule.

•   Column 1 of the table lists the Security Rule standards.

•   Column 2 indicates the regulatory citation to the appropriate section of the Security Rule where the
    standard can be found.

•   Column 3 lists the implementation specifications associated with the standard, if any exist, and
    designates the specification as required or addressable.



NOTE: In many areas both FISMA and the HIPAA Security Rule specify similar requirements.
Appendix E of this document provides a crosswalk between the two.

Pursuant to its mission under FISMA, NIST has prepared publications that are also potentially relevant to
the HIPAA Security Rule standards and implementation specifications listed in Table 2. In the following
section, security measures relevant to these HIPAA Security Rule safeguards from NIST publications are
presented, along with references to publications that may be useful in considering how to approach
implementing the HIPAA Security Rule standards.

4. Associating NIST Publications with HIPAA Security Rule Standards

In this section, security measures from NIST publications that are relevant to each section of the Security
Rule are presented. Each standard is presented in a consistent module format.

The modules are designed to make it easy to start the thought process for implementing the Security Rule.
The modules provide an overview of the information available in NIST’s publications. The modules are
but one approach, and their use is completely optional. There may be other methods of consideration
more useful to a covered entity based upon its unique operations.

The modules highlight but are not meant to be prescriptive of all the information a covered entity may
wish to consider in implementing the Security Rule. The modules may not be considered all-inclusive of
the information available in NIST publications.

The modules are composed of the following components:

The first element of each module is the Title of the HIPAA standard and the citation to where the standard
can be located within the HIPAA Security Rule. The HIPAA Standard is then quoted directly as it
appears within the HIPAA Security Rule. Compliance with each HIPAA Security Rule standard is
required.

The Key Activities column suggests, for each HIPAA Security Rule standard, actions that are usually
associated with the security function or functions suggested by that standard. Some of these key activities
are also the implementation specifications of the HIPAA Security Rule, discussed in Section 3.2, Security
Rule Organization, and listed in Section 3.3, Table 2. Each key activity that is also an implementation
specification has been identified as such in the module (in italics in the Description section of the
module), along with a note as to whether the implementation specification is required or addressable.
Other key activities would normally be performed as part of one or more of the related implementation
specifications under the standard, but are listed separately for clarity of presentation. Where such a
relationship exists it is indicated in an accompanying footnote.

Other key activities are not implementation specifications. These activities are not specifically discussed
or required by the HIPAA Security Rule, and their inclusion here is in no way meant to expand upon the
intent or requirements of the Security Rule. Many of these activities, however, are usually included in a
robust security process, and many will be required of federal entities under other federal laws, regulations,
or procedures that may or may not be discussed within this document.

The modules address all HIPAA Security Rule standards and all associated implementation
specifications, both required and addressable. Six of the standards include all the necessary instructions
for implementation and have no associated implementation specifications.11 However, as noted earlier in
this document, even if there are no implementation specifications outlined in the Security Rule, such as
with “Assigned Security Responsibility” and “Evaluation,” compliance with the standard itself is still
required.



11
  Standards that do not contain implementation specifications—that “themselves also serve as the implementation specification,”
as stated in the preamble to the HIPAA Security Rule—are those described in Sections 4.2 (HIPAA Standard: Assigned Security
Responsibility); 4.8 (HIPAA Standard: Evaluation); 4.11 (HIPAA Standard: Workstation Use); 4.12 (HIPAA Standard:
Workstation Security), 4.15 (HIPAA Standard: Audit Controls); and 4.17 (HIPAA Standard: Person or Entity Authentication).


SP 800-66                                                                                                            Page 16
An Introductory Resource Guide for Implementing the HIPAA Security Rule


The key activities are illustrative and not all-inclusive. There will be many additional activities an
organization will need to consider, specific to its own operations that are not included in the key activities
of the modules. Each entity will need to identify what activities beyond those listed in the modules are
necessary and appropriate in its environment, implement those activities, and document them.

The modules are meant to serve as only a general introduction to the security topics raised by the HIPAA
Security Rule. For more detailed information about the key activities, consult one or more NIST
publications referenced for the subject HIPAA standard. Anyone seeking clarification regarding the
principles of the HIPAA Security Rule should send inquiries to the CMS e-mail address,
askhipaa@cms.hhs.gov, or contact the CMS HIPAA Hotline, 1-866-282-0659.

The Description column in the table/module includes an expanded explanation about the key activities.
The descriptions include types of activities an organization may pursue in addressing a specific security
function. These are abbreviated explanations designed to help get an organization started in addressing
the HIPAA Security Rule. The first description bullet of each key activity that is also an implementation
specification includes the Security Rule implementation specification text in italics. When relationships
exist between description bullets and other Security Rule standards or implementation specifications it is
indicated in an accompanying footnote. The NIST publications identified as an Introductory Reference
for the HIPAA Security Rule standard can be consulted for more detailed information about the security
topic.

The third column, Sample Questions, includes some questions to determine whether or not the elements
described have actually been considered or completed. These sample questions are not exhaustive but
merely indicative of relevant questions that could be asked. They are a starting point for an organization
to examine its security practices as they relate to the HIPAA Security Rule. Affirmative answers to these
questions do not imply that an organization is meeting all of the requirements of the HIPAA security
standards. If an organization has already incorporated considerations raised by these questions into its
information security program, however, those efforts may signal that the organization is taking
appropriate steps. Note, however, that negative answers to these questions should prompt the covered
entity to consider whether it needs to take further action in order to comply with the standards. In fact, it
is expected that many organizations with existing information security infrastructure already in place will
have considered most of the Sample Questions. The questions an organization asks in assessing and
developing its security program should be tailored to fit the unique circumstances of each entity.

The bottom row of most modules includes additional NIST documents that may be consulted as Primary
References and Supplemental References for implementing the standards and implementation
specifications of the HIPAA Security Rule. These publications are also referenced in the HIPAA Security
Rule/ NIST Publications Crosswalk table in Appendix D.

The Examples at the end of the HIPAA standard module are meant to illustrate how the standard may be
addressed in a specific environment based on a set of objectives. The examples suggest actions and issues
that could arise, but are not comprehensive descriptions of the actions an organization must perform to
address the HIPAA Security Rule standard. The actual activities necessary to implement the standard
requirement for any given entity may vary substantially depending on organization mission, size, and
scope. There may be mitigating factors an entity should consider that are beyond the context of the
examples provided. The examples are for illustrative purposes only and are not meant to imply any
degree of HIPAA compliance.

The examples describe the efforts of two hypothetical federal agencies that are also HIPAA covered
entities. An overview of the environmental and information systems characteristics of each covered entity
is provided below. The examples describe how each of the covered entities has chosen to address certain


SP 800-66                                                                                             Page 17

standards and implementation specifications of the HIPAA Security Rule. Again, the examples are
provided for informational purposes only, and appropriate and necessary activities will differ for each
covered entity.

Each example is followed by an Explanation that illustrates how the standard (and its implementation
specifications, if any) were addressed by the hypothetical entities in the previous example. Each
explanation contains references and citations to the HIPAA Security Rule.



Overview of Example Health Plan:

Example Health Plan (EXHP) is a large federal health plan with operations in multiple states. The
overall structure of the organization includes a main office and remote state offices in each state the
health plan serves. The main office is responsible for establishing security policy, standards and
technology for the entire covered entity. The remote state offices are responsible for implementation of
the policy, standards and technology within their local environment. EXHP has a single standardized
information system that processes, stores and transmits EPHI. The system was implemented five years
ago. The information system is distributed among the offices, with the primary data center in the main
office.

Overview of Example Hybrid Covered Entity and Large Healthcare Provider:

Example Hybrid Covered Entity (EXHCE) is a government organization that is also a hybrid entity.
The organization has designated the healthcare provider functions of the larger organization as the health
care component of the organization, pursuant to § 164.105 of the HIPAA Security Rule. The healthcare
provider functions are not the primary functions of the organization. The information systems that store
electronic protected health information (EPHI) for the health care component are kept separate from the
primary non-covered functions.

Example Large Healthcare Provider (EXLHCP) is the health care component (the part of the hybrid
entity that performs the functions that make the hybrid entity a covered entity) under EXHCE and is a
large federal healthcare delivery network with over 50 hospitals in multiple states. The structure of
EXLHCP includes a central management organization and individual management teams responsible for
single or multiple hospital locations. The central management organization is responsible for establishing
security policy, standards and technology for the entire organization. Each of the hospital management
teams is responsible for implementing the policy, standards and technology within their local
environments.

EXLHCP has developed a standard list of technologies for use within the organization. Central
management allows each of the local hospitals to implement the technology that best meets their
individual needs. The list of technologies includes over 30 different information systems, used by the
local hospitals that contain EPHI. Some of the systems were implemented over 10 years ago. Other
systems have been, or have begun to be implemented, within the last 12 months. Some hospitals have
implemented an information system from the same vendor but are operating on different versions.

Overview of Organizational Requirements:

Section 164.105 of the HIPAA Security Rule, Organizational Requirements, sets out the special
requirements that covered entities must meet if they qualify to be able to designate themselves as “hybrid
entities” or “affiliated covered entities” if they choose to do so. This document will not discuss these



SP 800-66                                                                                          Page 18
An Introductory Resource Guide for Implementing the HIPAA Security Rule


organizational requirements in detail, as they do not set out general security principles. HIPAA covered
entities are encouraged to review this section of the HIPAA Security Rule in full and seek further
guidance. Section 164.105 contains three standards:

        •    Section 164.105(a)(1), Standard: Health Care Component, sets out special requirements for
        health care components of hybrid entities. Among other effects, this section establishes which
        provisions of the HIPAA Security Rule apply only to the health care component and which apply
        to the entire hybrid entity; requires the health care component to protect EPHI from being
        impermissibly disclosed to other components of the hybrid entity; and establishes requirements
        for designating components of a hybrid entity as health care components.

        •    Section 164.105(b)(1), Standard: Affiliated Covered Entities, among other effects, establishes
        that affiliated covered entities must safeguard EPHI consistently with the administrative,
        technical and physical standards of the HIPAA Security Rule.

        •   Section 164.105(c)(1), Standard: Documentation states that covered entities must retain
        documentation of the covered entity’s designation as a hybrid entity or affiliated covered entity
        and retain that documentation for 6 years from the date of its creation or the date it was last in
        effect, whichever is greater.

Example:
Example Health Plan (EXHP) established a formal security management program several years ago to
protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of all electronic information. Initially, the security
management program was implemented to address other Federal laws and requirements (e.g., HIPAA
Privacy Rule and Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)). To comply with the HIPAA
Security Rule, the covered entity has specifically included EPHI as a subset of the electronic information
it protects (§ 164.306(a)). These examples address how EXHP will comply with the HIPAA Security
Rule.

The security management program includes formal security risk analysis and risk management processes.
The main office and all remote state offices have been performing this formal process since 1996. The
main office developed a formal risk analysis tool and released it to the remote state offices. All entities
implement the tool independently using internal resources with information security expertise. The tool
captures threat and vulnerability information relevant to each location. The risk analysis tool generates
reports that include qualified and quantified risks. In addition to the risk analysis tool, the main office
developed risk management guidelines to focus the security measures implemented for certain types of
risks. The remote state offices use the risk management guidelines in their decision making process. The
covered entity has determined this process meets the intent of the Security Rule and it will be continued
(§§ 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A) – (B)).

After performing risk analyses for many years, the main office has identified several instances of internal
employees creating organizational risk (e.g., sharing passwords or not logging off workstations).
Therefore, the main office developed a more stringent sanction policy for violations of the organization’s

policies and procedures related to electronic information. The policy is distributed to all remote offices
and implemented without revision. The main office determined it was necessary to implement this policy
without modification to ensure consistent application of identified sanctions (§ 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(C)).

Another significant factor in EXHP’s security management program is the ability to review activities
performed in the primary information system. The main office requires the information system to have
minimum security capabilities. (These minimum capabilities are described in the Technical Safeguards
examples.) The main office requires information systems to have the capability to generate reports related
to the review of those general security safeguards. Manually generated security incident reports are also
reviewed. The main office requires review of these information system activity reports at least twice a
week or more frequently as needed. Any reviews that identify significant issues are handled through the
security incident response process described later in Section 4.6 of this document (§ 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(D)).




Explanation:

The covered entity’s decision to maintain the current security management program, which includes the
risk analysis and risk management processes, is appropriate for its environment, if it addresses the
standards and implementation specifications at §§ 164.306(a), and 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A) and (B). The
implementation specifications at §§ 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A) and (B) require an accurate and thorough
assessment of potential risks and vulnerabilities to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of EPHI
and the implementation of security measures to reduce risks and vulnerabilities identified during the risk
analysis to a reasonable and appropriate level. If the risk analysis and management process do not
sufficiently identify and reduce risks to and vulnerabilities of EPHI, then the processes must be revised.

The decision to develop a more stringent sanction policy and procedures is a permissible way of meeting
the requirements of the standard at § 164.306(a)(4) and the implementation specification at §
164.308(a)(1)(ii)(C). 45 CFR § 164.306(a)(4) requires a covered entity to ensure compliance with the
Security Rule by all workforce members. The implementation specification at § 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(C)
requires a covered entity to apply appropriate sanctions against workforce members who fail to comply
with the security policies and procedures of the covered entity. If the sanction policy and procedure
language does not provide those responsible for applying sanctions with a consistent means for ensuring
workforce compliance with the Security Rule, then the sanction language must be revised.

The covered entity’s decision to coordinate the information system activity review procedure with the
technical measures available in information systems and to require the reviews to be performed weekly is
reasonable and appropriate. The entity’s decision meets the intent of the standard at § 164.306(a)(2) and
the implementation specification at § 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(D). 45 CFR § 164.306(a)(2) requires a covered
entity to protect against any reasonably anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of EPHI.
The implementation specification at § 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(D) requires a covered entity to implement a
procedure to regularly review records of information system activity. If the logs and/or reports contain too
much information to review twice a week, then the review must be performed more regularly. If the
capability to generate logs and/or reports, using either technical or manual capabilities, does not support
reviews twice a week, then the procedure must be revised.

Example:

Example Large Healthcare Provider (EXLHCP) has used an Information Security Committee consisting
of members from the central management organization and individuals from the hospital locations. The
responsibilities of the committee include development of security policy, review of security incidents,
discussions of security technology, and other discussions of relevant security topics. This structure has
worked well for the organization for years. Therefore, the covered entity made the decision to assign the
chairman of this committee, the Chief Security Officer at the central management organization, as the
overall security official as required by § 164.308(a)(2). The security official’s expanded responsibilities
include oversight and accountability for all information security activities of EXLHCP. The functions of
the committee remain the same.

An Introductory Resource Guide for Implementing the HIPAA Security Rule


To maintain consistent implementation of the organization’s security program, the security official and
Information Security Committee decided to require each hospital location to appoint a local security
official. Most local hospitals elected to appoint their Information Security Committee representative as
their security official, as well. At other hospitals, a new security official with dedicated responsibility for
the local security program was appointed. The local security officials report to the central security
official. The responsibility of the local security officials is to implement the organization’s security
program at their respective hospitals.

Explanation:

The covered entity’s decision to assign security responsibility while maintaining the existing committee
structure is reasonable and appropriate. The assigned security responsibility standard (§ 164.308(a)(2))
requires a covered entity to identify a security official to be responsible for development and
implementation of required security policies and procedures. The organization identified one individual as
the security official with responsibility for the entire information security program. That individual’s
duties include being chairman of the committee, responsibility for development of policy and procedures,
control of information security budgeting, oversight of local security officials, and other relevant duties.
The Security Rule does not prohibit a covered entity from maintaining an information security committee
or similar structure to assist the security official in making organizational decisions, as long as the
security official has ultimate responsibility. If the security official’s responsibilities do not meet the
requirements of § 164.308(a)(2), then the assignment must be changed. The Security Rule also does not
prohibit the assignment of additional security officials in large organizations with multiple locations as
long as one individual has been assigned ultimate responsibility.

Example:

The EXHP has a standardized primary information system and is able to establish clear policies and
procedures for the authorization, clearance, establishment, modification and termination of a workforce
member’s access to the system and locations where EPHI is accessible (§§ 164.308(a)(3) & (4)). A large
organizational project was started two years ago to streamline and automate this entire process for all
locations. EXHP expects the updated processes to improve departmental coordination, save resource
costs, reduce certain vulnerabilities in the current process, and ensure compliance with the Security Rule.

An Intranet based system is being implemented to automate the existing access procedures. The updated
procedures will still involve cooperation between the main office and remote offices but the automated
system will reduce time lags in the process. During their risk analysis, the covered entity determined that
delays in authorizing and establishing access could create workforce productivity losses. The risk analysis
also identified that delays in notification for modification or termination of access create undue risk of
unauthorized access (§ 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A)).

The Intranet system contains a list of all established workforce job classifications and the pre-authorized
information access levels based on the job classification. The job classification list and pre-authorized
access levels were reviewed and approved by all relevant department managers and supervisors at the
main office and remote locations (§ 164.308(a)(3)(ii)(A)). The job classifications are consistent across
entities.

The workforce job classifications and pre-authorized access levels in the system are directly related to
approved functions each employee is responsible for performing. The job classifications were previously
developed to address other federal law and organizational needs (§ 164.308(a)(4)). Once the appropriate
authorizations are granted, the workforce member can automatically be set up, or established, with
appropriate access levels to the relevant information systems needed for their specific job.

Current manual procedures requiring a workforce member’s supervisor to manually sign-off, or clear, that
access is appropriate, and will be performed using the electronic system. The Human Resources (HR)
department enters the workforce member’s employment, educational, and/or background check
information (as required) into the system. Once this is complete, the hiring manager receives a
notification via email to log-in to the system and sign-off on members’ access. (§ 164.308(a)(3)(ii)(B))

After the department manager signs off, the Information Systems (IS) department, at the relevant location,
receives an email notification to establish access for the workforce member. The notification includes the
type of access needed to perform that individual’s job functions. (§ 164.308(a)(4)(ii)(B)) The information
system records the access levels provided to the workforce member and can report the information as
needed. (§ 164.308(a)(4)(ii)(C))

The Intranet system also contains information on the termination and job modification processes. When
an employee is terminated or changes job classifications, the department manager or HR initiates the
termination or modification process. Once the process is initiated, notifications are sent to the appropriate
HR and IS personnel. The termination or modification notification includes relevant details for all parties
involved to perform their respective termination or modification of access processes. For terminations, the
HR department collects all devices that provide physical access. Finally, the IS department removes or
modifies all information system access. (§ 164.308(a)(3)(ii)(C))

Every six months a report of all workforce members and associated access levels is generated by the IS
department and sent to the relevant department managers for review. The department managers are
responsible for reviewing the list for accuracy and notifying IS, through the Intranet system, if a
workforce member’s access should be modified or terminated. This final check is used to verify accuracy
of access levels and the overall success of the new Intranet system.

The covered entity reviewed business operations to identify health care clearinghouse functions as
required by the implementation specification at § 164.308(a)(4)(ii)(A). The review verified health care
clearinghouse functions are not performed. The findings are documented.

Explanation:

The covered entity’s decision to address the standards for Workforce Security (§164.308(a)(3)) and
Information Access Management (§ 164.308(a)(4)) as an integrated process is permissible based on the
facts provided. 45 CFR § 164.308(a)(3) references § 164.308(a)(4), which appears to complete the
process for providing workforce members access to EPHI.

The decision to use existing policies and procedures as the basis for development and implementation of
the automated Intranet based access system is appropriate based on the facts presented, if the policies and
procedures address the requirements of §§ 164.306(a)(3), 164.308(a)(3) and 164.308(a)(4). 45 CFR §
164.306(a)(3) requires covered entities to protect against any reasonably anticipated uses or disclosures of
EPHI that are not permitted by the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The standard and implementation specifications
of § 164.308(a)(3) require a covered entity to implement policies and procedures to ensure that all
members of its workforce have appropriate access to EPHI, as provided under paragraph (a)(4)
[Information Access Management], and to prevent those workforce members who do not have access
authorization under paragraph (a)(4) [Information Access Management] from obtaining access to EPHI.
45 CFR § 164.308(a)(4) requires covered entities to implement policies and procedures for authorizing
access to EPHI that are consistent with the applicable requirements of the Privacy Rule. The covered
entity would still be able to achieve compliance using the automated Intranet access system if the existing
policies and procedures for the authorization, clearance, establishment, modification and termination of



SP 800-66                                                                                           Page 29
An Introductory Resource Guide for Implementing the HIPAA Security Rule


workforce member’s access to the information system and locations where EPHI is accessible address the
requirements of the standards identified above and are incorporated into the Intranet access system.

This example assumes the Human Resources (HR) department is performing a manual process to verify
the workforce member’s background and job qualifications before entering the employment information
into the system. If the HR department is not performing some method of workforce clearance procedure
before initiating the access authorization process, then the process must be updated to include this
activity. (§ 164.308(a)(3)(ii)(B))

The covered entity’s decision to continue to require sign-off by a workforce member’s supervisor for
access to EPHI but automate the process is appropriate for this entity, if the automated process provides a
means of verifying the supervisor’s sign-off. If the sign-off cannot be verified during the automated or
subsequent manual process, then a mechanism for verification must be developed and added to the
process (§ 164.308(a)(3)(ii)(A)).

The example states the covered entity is using a decentralized method of establishing, modifying and
terminating user access. The IS department at each location is responsible for managing user access
within the information system. The Security Rule does not require a specific method (e.g., decentralized
or centralized) for performing access functions within information systems, as long as the covered entity
has a method in place. The entity’s decision to use a decentralized method for establishing, modifying and
terminating user access is appropriate for its environment, if the procedures are implemented at all
locations (§ 164.308(a)(4)(ii)(B)).

The covered entity’s decision to automate the termination and job modification process within the Intranet
system is appropriate given the covered entity’s circumstances, if the notifications generated by the
system allow the assigned departments to perform their required termination or modification functions in
a timely manner. The entity’s risk analysis uncovered time delays in the termination process during the
exchange of termination information from the department managers to the HR department and finally to
the IS departments. The time delays, upwards of 60 days, allowed a workforce member who was no
longer employed by the entity to access information systems with EPHI. If the automated Intranet system
does not reduce the information sharing time delays to reasonable levels, the system must be modified to
ensure only authorized workforce members can access EPHI using a workstation, transaction, program,
process or other mechanism (§ 164.308(a)(4)(ii)(C)).

The covered entity’s finding and documentation that it does not engage in clearinghouse functions is an
appropriate means of documenting that §164.308(a)(4)(ii)(A) does not apply.

Example:

EXLHCP has an existing mandatory confidentiality and security awareness and training program
(“training program”) that is provided to all workforce members including management at all locations.
The covered entity determined that minimal updates are needed to meet Security Rule compliance. The
current training program is delivered by a trainer during the orientation program and is refreshed annually
as part of the performance evaluation process. The content covers confidentiality, privacy and security
issues relevant to the organization. (§ 164.308(a)(5)(i)) The security training section was updated to
reflect the topics suggested in the Security Rule, including EPHI, protection from malicious software, log-
in monitoring and password management (§§ 164.308(a)(5)(ii)(B) – (D)).

The awareness program promotes key concepts of the confidentiality, privacy and security training using
various methods. A monthly article discussing current hot topics is published in the employee newsletter.
Each hospital location provides workforce members with security trinkets highlighting important phrases
and concepts. As needed, e-mails are distributed to warn workforce members of malicious code, viruses
and other urgent information security issues. (§ 164.308(a)(5)(ii)(A))

Explanation:

Under the facts set out in the example, the covered entity’s decision to update the existing training
program to include topics required by the Security Rule is reasonable and appropriate if the existing
training program allows the entity to address the standards at §§ 164.306(a)(4) and 164.308(a)(5). 45 CFR
§164.306(a)(4) requires a covered entity to ensure compliance with the Security Rule by all workforce
members. The standard at § 164.308(a)(5) requires covered entities to implement a security awareness
and training program from all members of its workforce (including management).
The entity’s decision to use the existing training program is appropriate for its environment, if all
members of the workforce, including management, receive security training. If the training program is not
delivered to all workforce members, then the training program must be revised to do so.

The covered entity’s decision to update the content of the security training to include addressable
implementation specifications of this standard (protection from malicious software, log-in monitoring and
password management) is reasonable and appropriate for its environment. In general, § 164.306(d)(3)
requires covered entities to assess whether each addressable implementation specification is a reasonable
and appropriate safeguard to implement in its environment. If the covered entity determines the safeguard
is reasonable and appropriate the safeguard must be implemented (§§ 164.308(a)(5)(ii)(B) – (D)).

The covered entity’s decision to promote security awareness among the workforce by distributing
monthly articles, security trinkets and e-mail notifications is a permissible way of meeting the
requirements of this implementation specification. The addressable implementation specification at §
164.308(a)(5)(ii)(A) for security reminders only requires periodic security updates. The entity’s decision
to deliver security updates using various methods and to send them monthly (newsletter) or as needed (e-
mails) is appropriate for its environment, if all members of the workforce including management receive
the security reminders.

Example:

As a Federal agency, EXHP is required to follow incident response procedures established separate from
the Security Rule. EXHP has determined this additional process meets the Security Rule standard and
implementation specification. In the event of a security incident, all staff members at a government
agency are instructed to contact their Incident Response Team, which includes the Security Officer as a
member. The Incident Response Team will evaluate the incident and ensure that it is reported to
appropriate management personnel and the FedCIRC. When appropriate the covered entity will mitigate
any harmful effects resulting from the security incident. The team members will also inform their
investigative organization in the Inspector General’s Office if the incident may potentially involve system
abuse or criminal activity. All steps in the process are carefully documented to maintain integrity of
potential investigations. The documentation is also reviewed periodically to ensure responses are

appropriate and to identify operational or technological changes that can be made to prevent future
incidents (§§ 164.308(a)(6)(i) & (6)(ii)).




Explanation:

The covered entity’s decision to maintain existing procedures developed for compliance with other
regulatory requirements is appropriate given the covered entity’s circumstances, if the existing procedure
allows the entity to comply with the standard and implementation specification at §§ 164.308(a)(6)(i) and
(a)(6)(ii). 45 CFR § 164.308(a)(6)(i) requires a covered entity to implement policies and procedures for
addressing security incidents. The required implementation specification at § 164.308(a)(6)(ii) requires
covered entities to identify, respond, mitigate and document suspected or known security incidents. If it is
determined that the existing procedures do not satisfy the standard and/or do not allow the entity to
protect against reasonably anticipated threats and hazards to EPHI as required by § 164.306(a)(2), the
procedure must be updated.

Example:

Most hospitals of EXLHCP have maintained contingency plans for many years. Results of the
organizational risk analysis identified that several hospitals had outdated contingency plans and two of the
smaller hospitals had no contingency plan. After receiving the results of the risk analysis, EXLHCP’s
security official required all locations to have a contingency plan. In order to assist the hospitals in their
updating or development activities the central management organization’s contingency plan was made
available as a template. All hospital locations must have a contingency plan with the same content
provided in the template.

The purpose of the current organizational contingency plan is to protect the organization’s assets from
being damaged during an emergency or other occurrence (for example, fire, vandalism, system failure,
and natural disaster) (§ 164.308(a)(7)(i)). The contingency plan contains all plans and procedures for
preparing the organization for and responding to disaster and/or emergency situations. The policies and
procedures in the plan match the implementation specifications of the contingency plan standard in the
Security Rule.

The first section of the contingency plan is a data backup plan. The purpose of the backup plan is to create
a useable exact copy of all information system data. The data backup plan includes detailed procedures
for backing up all data and system files needed to restore the primary information system and workforce
member network storage drives. The data backup procedures describe how to perform nightly
incremental, or partial, backups and weekly full system backups. The full system backups are performed
on the weekends while the system is not in use. The backup procedures provide enough detail to be
implemented by anyone with basic information systems knowledge (§ 164.308(a)(7)(ii)(A)).

The next sections of the contingency plan are the disaster recovery and emergency mode operation plans.
The plans include several scenarios and procedures for restoring operations and supporting information
systems. The emergency mode operation plan defines procedures for system downtime of less than 12
hours. The disaster recovery plan defines procedures for system downtime of more than 12 hours. The
primary goal of both plans is to maintain critical clinical processes and business operations during
emergency or disaster situations. To support the goal of continued clinical processes and business
operations both plans identify procedures for maintaining or restoring electronic communications and
information systems while maintaining data safeguards. If data must be restored during the emergency or
disaster situation, options for data restoration range from local recovery, using the emergency mode
operations plan, to secondary location recovery, using the disaster plan. Any hospital locations or other
offices that use information systems provided at the central management organization’s data center are
included in the plan. These organizations also receive copies of the plan (§§ 164.308(a)(7)(ii)(B) – (C)).

EXLHCP has determined that testing and revision of all components of the contingency plan are critical
to the success of the plan. Several testing scenarios are included in the plan. One of the testing scenarios
is a walkthrough or verbal review of the plan by those responsible for functions included in the plan.
During this test all parties involved meet in a single room and walk through each step of the plan to
determine if the restoration will be successful. Another test in the plan is a live test. During this test the
primary information system is brought down and operations are restored at an alternate operating facility.
During this test all connections from the alternate operating facility to other hospital locations or other
offices are tested to ensure data can be accessed. Any issues discovered during these tests or during actual
disaster or emergency operations are used to revise the plan. (§ 164.308(a)(7)(ii)(D))

The covered entity determined that a formalized applications and data criticality analysis is also critical to
the success of the plan. The central management office and local hospitals use and maintain over 30
information systems that contain EPHI. The criticality of information systems and EPHI is different based
on the clinical process or business operation the information systems and EPHI support. The formalized
applications and data criticality analysis contained in the template contingency plan classifies criticality
using four categories. The four categories are used to determine priority for restoration of the applications
and data. The applications and data grouped in the highest category must be restored immediately to
support clinical operations and business functions. The applications and data grouped in the lowest
category can be restored within 1 week (§ 164.308(a)(7)(ii)(E)).

The covered entity’s decision to require all hospital locations to have a contingency plan is appropriate
based on the facts presented. The decision to provide the central management organizations current plan
and supporting procedures as a template for the hospital locations that do not have a contingency plan is
appropriate for its environment if the hospital locations customize the template for their specific
environment. The template contingency plan addresses the standards and implementation specifications of
§§ 164.306(a)(2) and 164.308(a)(7)(ii)(A) – (E). The purpose of the entity’s contingency plan is to protect
all data, including EPHI, from reasonably anticipated threats and hazards. This meets the requirement of §
164.306(a)(2) to ensure the protection of EPHI from reasonably anticipated threats and hazards.

As identified in the example, the content of the entity’s plan does address all implementation
specifications of § 164.308(a)(7). It addresses the data backup, disaster recovery, emergency mode
operations, testing and revision and applications and data criticality analysis implementation
specifications. The content of the plan allows the entity to create and maintain retrievable exact copies of
EPHI (§ 164.308(a)(7)(ii)(A)); establishes procedures to restore any loss of data (§ 164.308(a)(7)(ii)(B));
establishes procedures to enable continuation of critical business processes for protecting the security of
EPHI while operating in emergency mode (§ 164.308(a)(7)(ii)(C)); contains procedures for periodic
testing and revision of all components of the contingency plan (§ 164.309(a)(7)(ii)(D)); and assesses the
relative criticality of specific applications and data in support of other contingency plan components (§
164.309(a)(7)(ii)(E)).

The contingency plan documentation will be maintained in binders. This decision may be reasonable and
appropriate if the individuals responsible for implementing the contingency plan procedures at each
location have access to the binders. This method of maintaining documentation is acceptable under §
164.316(b), which requires those responsible for implementing procedures to have access to the
documentation. If those responsible for performing procedures in the contingency plan cannot access the
procedures when needed, the method for maintaining and distributing the documentation must be revised.

Example:

As part of its overall compliance plan, EXHP chose to modify its enterprise risk analysis tool to include
all standards and implementation specifications of the Security Rule in question format. EXHP also
included the questions from the NIST Special Publication (SP) Security Self-Assessment Guide for
Information Technology Systems (NIST SP 800-26) in the enterprise risk analysis tool. EXHP is a Federal
agency and is required to use NIST SP 800-26. The main office and all remote offices are also required to
perform an evaluation of the technical and non-technical operations of each location. Results of the risk
analysis and evaluation help to focus the organization’s efforts to develop additional policy and
procedures, mitigate security issues, and apply reasonable and appropriate security safeguards. The
evaluation is performed yearly and revisited based on operational or environmental changes (§
164.308(a)(8)).

Explanation:

The covered entity’s decision to perform the evaluation by using the modified enterprise risk analysis tool
is reasonable and appropriate. The evaluation standard at §164.308(a)(8) requires a covered entity to
perform a periodic technical and non-technical evaluation based initially on the standards of the Security
Rule and subsequently based on environmental or operational changes. If the enterprise risk analysis tool
is modified to include all standards implemented under the Security Rule and is used to perform an initial
and subsequent evaluations of the environment, then the approach is reasonable and appropriate.

The entity’s decision to perform the evaluation every year is reasonable. The Security Rule does not
define a timeframe for performing the evaluation. It states only that the evaluation must be performed
periodically and in response to environmental or operational changes. If the evaluation cannot be
performed on an annual or other appropriate periodic basis or in response to operational or environmental
changes, the process must be revised.

Example:

During implementation of the HIPAA Privacy Rule, EXLHCP developed business associate contract
(BAC) and memorandum of understanding (MOU) language. Each of the entity’s business associates,
including those using EPHI, was identified during Privacy Rule implementation. Contracts or MOUs
were executed with each of the business associates or other government entities. After reviewing the
requirements of § 164.314(a) the organization determined that no additional language is needed. The
covered entity decided appropriate safeguard language was included in the original versions of the BAC
and MOU (§§ 164.308(b)(1) & (4)).

Explanation:

The covered entity’s decision not to update existing business associate agreements and memoranda of
understanding language developed for Privacy Rule compliance is a permissible way of meeting the
requirements of this standard. 45 CFR §164.308(b)(1) requires a covered entity to document satisfactory
assurances that the business associate will meet all requirements of § 164.314(a). The entity reviewed the
existing BACs and MOUs to determine if the written language appropriately addresses requirements of §
164.314(a). The decision was made that all language requirements of § 164.314(a) were addressed. If the
covered entity determined the existing language does not provide satisfactory assurances that the business
associate will maintain reasonable and appropriate safeguards, the language must be updated.

Example:

EXHP has several layers of facility safeguards and access controls at each location. The main office
developed the facility access controls policy that the covered entity decided will allow them to meet this
standard. The entity’s policy requires appropriate access controls to the exterior and interior of all
physical locations. The policy includes provisions requiring all workforce members to display ID badges
and visitors to be escorted by an authorized workforce member in all work areas. If a workforce member
is prevented access to a physical location, procedures exist to verify they are authorized to access the
location. Each of the remote offices is responsible for implementing procedures that adhere to policy
developed by the main office. To ensure all offices use appropriate safeguards, the main office established
standards for physical access control measures. The most common measure used by the offices is a card
reader access control system for all areas workforce members need to access. Different access levels were
established based on the job classification activities pursuant to §§ 164.310(a)(1), (2)(ii) and (2)(iii).

The facility policy also required appropriate access controls to be maintained during contingency
operations related to the disaster recovery or emergency operations plans. Each of the offices established
procedures to maintain access controls to the facilities while permitting authorized access to those
individuals responsible for recovery of operations and data. The entity decided to include this information
in the Contingency Plan to ensure it would be used at the appropriate time (§ 164.310(a)(2)(i)).

EXHP’s facility access controls policy also requires that any security related repairs made to any facility
or component of the facility be documented. The covered entity decided it was reasonable to track any
modifications, repairs or removal of physical safeguards for the facility. This section of the policy mirrors
the specifications identified in the Security Rule. Each office has responsibility for implementing the
procedures to document the activities. Most offices use an electronic tracking form. Other locations
capture the modifications on a paper form because the maintenance is not often performed. The main
office has determined that either option for tracking modifications, repairs or removal of physical
safeguards is acceptable (§ 164.310(a)(2)(iv)).

Explanation:

The covered entity’s decision to maintain the existing policies and procedures for facility access controls
is reasonable and appropriate. The entity determined that the standards and implementation specifications
at §§ 164.310(a)(1), (a)(2)(ii), and (a)(2)(iii) are all addressed in the current policy and procedures. The
facility access controls standard at § 164.310(a)(1) requires covered entities to implement policies and
procedures to limit physical access to information system and facilities where the information systems are
housed, while ensuring authorized access is allowed. The addressable implementation specification at §
164.310(a)(2)(ii) for a facility security plan requires covered entities to assess whether to implement


SP 800-66                                                                                                 Page 52
        An Introductory Resource Guide for Implementing the HIPAA Security Rule


policies and procedures to safeguard the facility and equipment from unauthorized physical access,
tampering, and theft. The addressable implementation specification at § 164.310(a)(2)(iii) for access
control and validation procedures requires a covered entity to assess whether to implement policies and
procedures to control and validate a person’s access to facilities based on their role or function, including
visitor controls. The entity has determined that the existing policies and procedures will allow them to
limit or reduce unauthorized physical access, allow authorized access, safeguard the facility and
equipment therein and control and validate authorized access to the facilities and locations where
information systems exist. If the policy, procedures or security measures used do not appropriately
address this standard or implementation specifications they must be revised.

The covered entity’s decision to allow all remote offices to develop access control procedures to be used
during contingency operations and to include this information in the Contingency Plan a permissible way
of meeting the requirements of this standard. The addressable implementation specification at §
164.310(a)(2)(i) for contingency operations requires a covered entity to determine whether to establish
procedures for allowing facility access to support data restoration during an emergency and to implement
the procedures as needed. The entity has decided to implement this specification by developing
contingency operations procedures at all locations and combining the procedures into the Contingency
Plan. The Security Rule does not identify how the procedures should be documented or maintained. 45
CFR § 164.316(b)(2)(ii) only requires the documentation to be available to those persons responsible for
implementing the procedures. Inclusion of the procedures in the Contingency Plan should ensure that the
procedures will be available to those responsible for implementation, if needed. If the procedures do not
support facility access during data restoration or are not available if needed, then the procedures and
location where they are maintained must be revised.

The covered entity’s decision to track all modifications, repairs or removal of physical safeguards for the
facility is reasonable and appropriate. 45 CFR § 164.310(a)(2)(iv) requires covered entities to assess
whether implementation of policies and procedures to document repairs and modifications to the physical
components of a facility which are related to security (for example, hardware, walls, doors, and locks) is
reasonable and appropriate for their environment. The entity’s determination that the current policies and
procedures for facility access controls contain the processes needed to meet this addressable
implementation specification is appropriate for its environment. If the policy and procedures do not
address documentation of maintenance and repairs to physical security components of the facility, the
documentation must be revised.

Example:

EXLHCP has existing formal Workstation Acceptable Use policy and procedures identifying the proper
functions to be performed on workstations. The policy and procedures identify the attributes of the
physical surroundings of an information system and the appropriate safeguards to be implemented on the
workstations. The procedures section also includes guidelines for manual protection of workstations to be
practiced by all workforce members. These safeguards are discussed further in the Section 4.12,
Workstation Security. The entity has determined the existing policy and procedures meet Security Rule
compliance and no revisions are needed (§ 164.310(b)).

Explanation:

The covered entity’s decision to use the existing Workstation Acceptable Use policy a permissible way of
meeting the requirements of this standard. The standard for workstation security at § 164.310(b) requires
a covered entity to implement policies and procedures that specify the proper functions and manner in
which the functions are to be performed, and the physical attributes of the surroundings of a specific
workstation or class of workstation that can access EPHI. The entity’s existing workstation acceptable use
policy and procedures identify proper functions to be performed, the attributes of the physical
surroundings and appropriate safeguards to be implemented on all information systems, including those
with EPHI. If the policy does not meet the requirements of § 164.310(b), and thus does not enable the

Example:

EXLHCP’s Workstation Use policy established the safeguards to be used to secure workstations. The
purpose of the physical safeguards is to restrict access to authorized users. Each hospital documents the
procedures implemented in their environment to safeguard workstations. The primary safeguard
implemented at all locations to restrict access to the hospital data center is a card reader access control
system. Only authorized employees with access cards are able to access the data center locations.
Additional safeguards that are implemented for areas with visitors include positioning of workstation
monitors away from open areas and using password protected screen savers or requiring employees to
lock workstations before leaving them. (§ 164.310(c))

Explanation:

The covered entity’s decision to implement multiple levels of safeguards to protect workstations from
unauthorized access is a permissible way of meeting the requirements of this standard. The entity’s

workstation acceptable use policy and the requirements of §164.310(c) require implementation of
physical safeguards for all workstations that access EPHI to restrict access to authorized users. The
decisions to implement safeguards such as the card reader access control system, positioning of
workstation monitors and using password-protected screensavers are all reasonable given the covered
entity’s circumstances. The Security Rule does not require the use of specific security measures to comply
with this standard. The Security Rule general rules regarding flexibility of approach at § 164.306(b)(1)
does allow all covered entities to use any security measures that allow it to reasonably and appropriately
implement the standards and implementation specifications of the Security Rule for its environment. If
the physical safeguards implemented by each hospital location do not allow the entity to meet the
requirements of the Workstation Acceptable Use policy and the workstation security standard at §
164.310(c), additional or new safeguards must be implemented.

Example:

EXHP has established new organization-wide policy and procedures for device and electronic media
controls. The policy and procedures identify proper steps for receipt, removal and movement of all
electronic media both internal and external to the facility. The policy states the organization’s position on
disposal, media re-use, accountability and data backup and storage. All locations follow this policy and
procedures (§ 164.310(d)(1)).

The policy states that all data on electronic media must be properly destroyed prior to disposal or removal
from the organization. Each location is responsible for implementing standard procedures for the
destruction and disposal of electronic media. All workforce members that dispose of electronic media
must bring the data to the IS department. The IS department then disposes of the data. The covered
entity’s procedure requires the use of a special mechanical device to physically destroy the media before
disposal. If needed, remote offices are provided with the option to use a business associate to perform the
physical destruction. If this method is used, the destruction must be performed at the remote office
location (§ 164.310(d)(2)(i)).

EXHP’s Device and Electronic Media Controls policy states that if electronic media is to be reused within
the organization it must be properly overwritten or erased before the media is made available for re-use.
As with the disposal procedure, the IS department at each location is responsible for this procedure. The
organizational procedure for making media available for re-use includes the use of a special software
program to overwrite data at the hardware level. The main office evaluated and purchased the program to
perform this function. The program is distributed to all offices for local use. After the program is run on
the media and erasure of data has been confirmed, it is made available for re-use and distributed to the
new location by the IS department. (§ 164.310(d)(2)(ii))

The entity’s policy identifies each department manager and the IS department as being accountable for
movement of electronic media. The accountability procedure requires the use of an inventory and tracking
database developed by the main office. The IS department is accountable for the first steps in the process.
These steps include identifying all electronic media with an identifying label, and inventorying the
electronic media in the tracking database. Once the media is moved to a department, the accountability is
shared between the IS department and the department manager. IS updates the database with the location
of the media and the responsible department manager. The department manager is responsible for
periodically checking on the media assigned to their department. The spot check is performed to ensure
media has not been moved to a different location or removed from the facility (§ 164.310(d)(2)(iii)).

If media is moved, organizational policy requires that the IS department ensures that any data stored on
the media is properly backed up before movement. The primary backup procedure only addresses the
backup of the primary information system and workforce member network storage drives. This procedure


SP 800-66                                                                                                   Page 59
        An Introductory Resource Guide for Implementing the HIPAA Security Rule


focuses on the movement of workforce member workstations that are used to store EPHI. Workforce
members are able to store data, including EPHI, on workstations but data stored on workstations is not
backed up in the network backup process. The procedure allows the IS department to temporarily store
the data on the network or use a portable writable CD-ROM drive for the backup. Immediately after the
device is moved, the data is restored to the workstation (§ 164.310(d)(2)(iv)).

EXHP’s risk analysis identified disposal, re-use and accountability issues with the multiple forms of
portable media. To mitigate these risks the covered entity decided to restrict the use of portable media.
The restriction is documented in the device and electronic media controls policy. The only approved
portable media are CD-ROMs and floppy disks. The covered entity chose to eliminate the use of all other
portable media. All workforce members have the ability to use floppy disks. Workforce members must
submit a request for writeable CD-ROM drives. Only workforce members approved by the Security
Official or Security Committee are authorized to have writeable CD-ROM drives. This includes approval
of members of the IS department (§ 164.310(d)(2)(iii)).

Explanation:

The covered entity’s decision to implement a new policy and procedure for device and media controls is
appropriate under the entity’s circumstances. The entity is required by § 164.310(d)(1) to implement
policies and procedures that govern the receipt and removal of hardware and electronic media that contain
electronic protected health information into and out of a facility, and the movement of these items within
the facility.

The entity’s decision to establish standard procedures for disposal of electronic media containing PHI to
comply with the media controls policy and the implementation specification at § 164.310(d)(2)(i) and to
allow each location to implement the procedures is reasonable and appropriate in the covered entity’s
circumstances. The required implementation specification at § 164.310(d)(2)(i) states that covered entities
must implement policies and procedures to address the final disposition of electronic protected health
information, and/or the hardware or electronic media on which it is stored. This specification does not
prohibit the entity from assigning the IS department or a business associate to conduct the disposal
procedure. If a business associate is used to perform EPHI disposal, a business associate contract with
assurances that appropriate safeguards will be implemented, as required by §§ 164.308(b)(1) and
164.314(a), must also be implemented. If the procedure used does not properly dispose of electronic
media with PHI or if the business associate does not provide satisfactory assurances of security
safeguards related to the EPHI, the procedure and methods for disposal must be changed.

The covered entity’s decision to implement special data erasing programs to ensure any EPHI is
overwritten or erased prior to media being re-used is appropriate for its environment. 45 CFR §
164.310(d)(2)(ii) requires a covered entity to implement procedures for removal of electronic protected
health information from electronic media before the media are made available for re-use. The policy,
procedures and security measure implemented by the entity reasonably address this requirement. If the
procedures or security measure do not allow the entity to properly remove data before re-use, it must be
revised.

The covered entity’s decision to make both department managers and the IS department at each remote
office accountable for movement of electronic media with PHI using an inventory and tracking database
is appropriate under the covered entity’s circumstances. The addressable implementation specification at
§ 164.310(d)(2)(iii) for accountability requires a covered entity to assess whether it is reasonable and
appropriate to maintain a record of the movements of hardware and electronic media and any person
responsible therefore. This specification does not prohibit a covered entity from assigning this function to
multiple departments or requiring the use of a specific tracking mechanism, such as the inventory and

tracking database implemented by this entity. This process might not be reasonable and appropriate if the
IS department did not maintain the tracking database, or information is not shared between the
departments, or if each department manager does not check on the media assigned to their department.

The covered entity’s decision to back up all electronic media, including media with PHI, before
movement of the media is appropriate in this covered entity’s environment. The addressable
implementation specification at § 164.310(d)(2)(iv) requires a covered entity to assess whether it is
reasonable and appropriate to create a retrievable, exact copy of EPHI, when needed, before movement of
equipment. The entity’s decision to use the Backup Plan in the Contingency Plan to make retrievable,
exact copies of EPHI on the primary information system and network storage drives is appropriate under
these circumstances. In addition, the decision to develop this procedure to focus on making retrievable,
exact copies of EPHI stored on a workstation before moving the workstation is also appropriate. The
procedures established to meet this implementation specification would likely not be reasonable and
appropriate if retrievable copies of the EPHI could not be created for this covered entity.

The entity’s decision to implement an additional policy restricting the use of certain electronic media is
reasonable and appropriate under these facts. If the entity’s risk analysis identifies threats to the security
or integrity of EPHI that may be stored on certain portable media, the entity must implement security
measures sufficient to reduce the risk to a reasonable and appropriate level to comply with the general
security requirements of § 164.306(a).

Example:

EXHP establishes access to the primary information system using the Information Access Management
policy and procedures identified in the previous Administrative Safeguards examples. The Intranet based
application described in the Administrative Safeguards example sends an e-mail to the IS department to
establish access. The IS department has developed a technical policy and procedure for providing access
to the system. The policy requires that only an authorized IS system administrator can perform access
functions in the system. The procedure provides a step-by-step guide that system administrators use to
perform access functions. EXHP’s risk analysis and evaluation of the information system verified that
appropriate access controls are available and users can be segmented from different PHI based on their
job classifications. Each of the pre-authorized access levels, defined in the Intranet application, is
matched to a template in the system that defines certain functions the user can perform (§ 164.312(a)(1)).

The access control policy requires that all users be assigned a unique user name for all applications. Using
their unique name and a password, assigned for user authentication, the users only obtain access to PHI
needed for their job functions. The entity’s procedure for assigning user names defines the standard
characteristics, or naming convention, of the user name. The entity’s standard for user names is first letter
of first name, first two letters of last name and a random four-digit number (e.g., FLL4321) (§
164.312(a)(2)(i)).
EXHP identified emergency situations in the past when access to the information system was needed but
not provided in a timely manner. A procedure for handling these instances was developed. The procedure
defines situations that constitute an emergency. One type of emergency situation addressed in the
procedure is not being able to grant immediate access to new workforce members, such as temporary
employees, that are exceptions to the standard access establishment procedures. This emergency situation
is addressed in new procedures established for implementation of the new Intranet based workforce
access workflow system, which will automate the section of the procedure requiring immediate granting
of access during emergencies. Another emergency situation addressed in the procedure is when the
information system is unavailable. EXHP determined that, if an emergency occurred making the system
unavailable, the Contingency Plan procedures would be used to continue business operations and provide
access to EPHI (§ 164.312(a)(2)(ii)).

EXHP has a Workstation Acceptable Use policy that requires all workstations to have automatic logoff
capabilities. The procedures implemented to safeguard workstations include password protected screen
savers or workstation locking. EXHP determined that additional logoff capabilities were needed at the
information system level. The system has the capability to electronically enforce a logoff function at a
determined time interval of inactivity. The time interval is set at 5 minutes. This is consistent with the
workstation time interval. If the time interval is exceeded, the user must re-authenticate to the computer
with their unique user name and password (§ 164.312(a)(2)(iii)).

Finally, after performing the risk analysis, EXHP decided to encrypt and decrypt all data in the
information system. The information system has the capability to perform these functions using a strong
form of encryption. Due to system performance considerations the entity determined that data would only
be encrypted during non-work hours. Each evening the database is encrypted and each morning it is
decrypted (§ 164.312(a)(2)(iv)).


Explanation:

The covered entity’s decision to implement technical access control policies and procedures based on the
information access management standard at § 164.308(a)(4) and technical capabilities of the primary
information system a permissible way of meeting the requirements of this standard. 45 CFR §
164.312(a)(1) requires a covered entity to implement technical policies and procedures for information
systems that maintain EPHI to allow access only to those persons or software programs that have been
granted access rights as specified in §164.308(a)(4). The access rights to EPHI established in the entity’s
information access management policy are based on a workforce member’s job function. The technical
capabilities of the information system do allow for segmentation of access to the EPHI based on the job
functions established in the information access management policy. The technical procedures established
to implement the information access management policy would not be reasonable and appropriate if the
information system was not capable of segmenting access to EPHI based on the job classifications
defined in the policy.

The covered entity’s decision to assign all users of the information system a unique user name using a
standard naming convention that uniquely identifies each user to the information system is appropriate
given the covered entity’s circumstances. The implementation specification at § 164.312(a)(2)(i) requires
covered entities to assign a unique name and/or number for identifying and tracking user identity. The
Security Rule does not specify the naming convention, or format for the unique user name as long as each
user can be uniquely identified from other information system users. The naming convention for
assigning user names would not be reasonable and appropriate if users could not be distinguished from
each other when accessing the information system (e.g. shared or generic user names).

The covered entity’s decision to identify different situations when emergency access to information
systems with EPHI is needed and to implement the procedures in those identified situations is reasonable
and appropriate. The implementation specification at § 164.312(a)(2)(ii) requires a covered entity to
establish (and implement as needed) procedures for obtaining necessary electronic protected health
information during an emergency. The entity’s decision to define the emergency situations to mean
immediate access is needed for certain types of workforce members or during emergency situations when
the Contingency Plan is activated is reasonable and appropriate. This procedure would not be reasonable
and appropriate if it does not account for all types of access to be established for users during emergency
situations. If additional emergency situations are identified, the procedure must be revised.

The covered entity’s decision to use the existing capabilities of the information system to supplement the
automatic logoff procedures implemented under the Workstation Acceptable Use policy is appropriate for


SP 800-66                                                                                           Page 65

its environment. The addressable implementation specification at § 164.312(a)(2)(iii) requires covered
entities to determine whether to implement electronic procedures that terminate an electronic session after
a predetermined time of inactivity. The Security Rule does not identify the duration of the predetermined
time of inactivity; therefore, the entity’s decision to set the time interval at 5 minutes is acceptable if the
entity has determined this time interval is reasonable and appropriate for its environment. This process
would not be reasonable and appropriate if the automatic logoff capability was implemented but the
predetermined time of inactivity was set for a duration of time that would not trigger the automatic logoff
feature in a reasonable amount of time, such as eight hours.

The covered entity’s decision to only implement encryption and decryption of data in the primary
information system during non-business hours is appropriate for this covered entity. The addressable
implementation specification at §164.312(a)(2)(iv) requires covered entities to determine whether to
implement a mechanism to encrypt and decrypt EPHI. To determine whether to implement encryption the
entity reviewed the results of the risk analysis associated risk management options and technical
capabilities of the information system. After reviewing these sources of information the entity concluded
that encryption and decryption of EPHI in the information system during normal business hours would
not reduce risk levels but would decrease system performance. The entity also concluded that
implementing the system capabilities for encryption during non-business hours would not decrease
system performance and would increase the security of EPHI in the information system. The decision not
to implement encryption mechanisms during business hours would not be reasonable and appropriate if
using these mechanisms would significantly reduce the risks to EPHI and system performance would not
suffer.

Example:

EXLHCP performed an evaluation of the audit controls in its 30+ information systems and identified a
wide range of recording and reporting capabilities. To test the audit controls of the information systems,
IS departments at all locations implemented all levels of audit controls. In many cases implementing all
levels of audit controls made the systems unusable. Knowing full audit controls would not meet business
needs, the audit issue was raised to the Information Security Committee. During a series of meetings the
Information Security Committee decided a balance was needed between system performance and audit
capabilities implemented. The committee determined audit controls would be based on business needs.
Different levels of audit recording and reporting were needed to properly track information system
activity. During this process the information system activity review procedures were developed. As
explained earlier in this example, the requirement in this procedure is to review reports of system activity
at least twice weekly. A sub-committee, consisting of IS and operational department representatives, was
established to determine auditing levels. The ability to meet requirements outlined in the information
system activity review procedure was a factor during development of auditing level recommendations.
The sub-committee’s recommendations were then turned over to IS to implement (§ 164.312(b)).

Explanation:

The covered entity’s decision to use different levels of audit controls in information systems with EPHI
based on varying audit control capabilities and business needs to support the information system activity
review procedure is reasonable and appropriate. 45 CFR § 164.312(b) requires covered entities to
implement hardware, software, and/or procedural mechanisms that record and examine activity in
information systems that contain or use electronic protected health information. The Security Rule does
not specify the level of audit controls to implement. Therefore the entity’s decision to implement different
levels of audit controls to record and examine system activity ranging from detailed audit controls (all
access or views of EPHI) to general audit controls (only changes to EPHI) is reasonable and appropriate.
The procedural mechanisms implemented would not be reasonable and appropriate if the information
systems do not have the capabilities to record and examine system activity needed for the entity’s
information system activity review procedures and no additional procedural mechanisms were
implemented to supplement the lack of technical capabilities in the systems.

Example:

While performing the most recent risk analysis process, the covered entity identified potential data
integrity issues in the primary information system. The information system does have technical
mechanisms to check the integrity of data and correct certain types of integrity issues. However, the
integrity-checking program is not in use. To mitigate this risk, a policy and procedure for protecting data
integrity was developed. The covered entity determined this new policy and procedure will also meet
Security Rule requirements. The policy requires manual and technological processes to ensure that any
data, including EPHI, is not altered or destroyed in an improper manner. The policy references the
information system activity review and information access management policies as supplemental policies
for protecting data against improper alteration or destruction (§ 164.312(c)(1)).

The procedure for maintaining data integrity required the use of the technical data integrity-checking
program included in the information system. The covered entity decided the program should be run every
other week or as needed. Prior to running the program the system administrator must notify users that the
system will be unavailable during a certain period of time for system maintenance. During this period of
down time the administrator must run system diagnostics and identify any integrity issues that if
uncorrected could cause destruction of PHI. Once the issues are identified the administrator executes the
integrity-checking program to fix the problem. After these steps are performed the system is restored to
normal operating mode (§ 164.312(c)(2)).

Explanation:

The covered entity’s decision to implement a new policy and procedures for data integrity and to use
existing technical integrity measures of the information system is reasonable and appropriate given the
covered entity’s circumstances. 45 CFR § 164.312(c)(1) requires a covered entity to implement policies
and procedures to protect electronic protected health information from improper alteration or destruction.
The entity’s decision to require manual and technological processes for data integrity in the policy is also
reasonable and appropriate for its environment. The policy would not be reasonable and appropriate if the
manual process or technical capabilities of the system did not identify integrity issues until after the EPHI
was already altered or destroyed.

The covered entity’s decision to implement procedures for maintaining data integrity that includes the use
of a technical data integrity-checking program that is part of the information system is appropriate for its
environment. The addressable implementation specification at § 164.312(c)(2) requires a covered entity to
determine whether it is reasonable and appropriate to implement electronic mechanisms to corroborate
that electronic protected health information has not been altered or destroyed in an unauthorized manner.
The entity’s decision to implement the electronic data integrity checking mechanism within the
information system to corroborate the integrity of EPHI and to run the program every other week or as
needed, does allow the entity to meet this addressable implementation specification. The Security Rule
does not require a frequency for running the electronic mechanisms. The procedure may not be reasonable
and appropriate if the technical measures do not corroborate integrity of EPHI until after it is altered or
destroyed in an unauthorized manner.

Example:

Most of EXLHCP’s information systems use passwords for user authentication. After performing a recent
risk analysis, the decision was made to maintain this method until a more technologically sound and cost-
effective means of authentication is available. EXLHCP’s Information Access Management policy
requires all users to enter their user name and password to access information systems. To implement this
policy the central management organization’s IS department developed a procedure for establishing and
managing passwords that all hospital locations have implemented. The procedure states that only
authorized system administrators are able to establish user names and passwords to the system. The
system administrator assigns an initial password during the access establishment process. The user
receives the initial password delivered via interoffice mail. This initial password is used to log into the
system. Once the user is logged in, the system forces them to change the initial password. The new
password must meet the organization’s password standards. The standards identify password length, use
of special characters, and password change frequency. (§ 164.312(d))

Explanation:

The covered entity’s decision to use passwords as the means for providing authentication for users
accessing EPHI is reasonable and appropriate in its environment. 45 CFR § 164.312(d) requires covered
entities to implement procedures to verify that a person or entity seeking access to electronic protected
health information is the one claimed. The entity’s decision to implement a procedure for establishing and
maintaining passwords to support the Information Access Management policy is an appropriate method
for managing the authentication process. The Security Rule does not require that a specific type of
authentication method be used. The flexibility requirements at § 164.306(b)(1) allow covered entities to
use any security measures that allow it to reasonably and appropriately implement the Security Rule
standards and implementation specifications. The use of passwords for authentication is appropriate given
the covered entity’s circumstances, if the password can verify the identity of a user requesting access to
the system as required by this standard. If the covered entity determines other technical security measures
provide a more acceptable assurance of user identity and authentication, then the covered entity may want
to research and consider future implementation of additional technical security measures for the
information system.

Example:

When the information system was implemented EXHP determined that use of the Internet or other open
electronic communications networks put the entity at too much risk. Two years ago the organization
modified its position due to advances in security technology and increases in the potential efficiencies to
be gained from use of the Internet. EXHP decided to implement an external portal to allow access to
EPHI over the Internet. Risks associated with the project were evaluated. A detailed architecture,
including security architecture, was developed for the portal. The primary goal of the security architecture
was to ensure that no unauthorized individual would access data, specifically electronic patient data that
was transmitted over the Internet. The covered entity decided to secure the web portal using an encrypted
transmission protocol, unique user authentication, and “view only” access to maintain data integrity. As
part of its on-going risk analysis, the covered entity conducted a review of the security of the portal. After
the review it was determined that security measures established during initial implementation met the
Security Rule requirements (§§ 164.312(e)(1), (e)(2)(i) – (ii)).

Explanation:

The covered entity’s decision to develop a security architecture for their web portal including technical
measures to protect against unauthorized access to EPHI being transmitted over communications
networks is reasonable and appropriate. 45 CFR § 164.312(e)(1) requires covered entities to implement
technical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to electronic protected health
information that is being transmitted over an electronic communications network. The addressable
implementation specification of this standard at § 164.312(e)(2)(i) for integrity controls requires covered
entities to determine whether to implement security measures to ensure that electronically transmitted
electronic protected health information is not improperly modified without detection until disposed of.
The other addressable implementation specification for this standard at § 164.312(e)(2)(ii) for encryption
requires covered entities to determine whether to implement a mechanism to encrypt electronic protected
health information whenever deemed appropriate.

When determining how to implement the requirements of the standard and the determination of whether
to implement the addressable implementation specifications the entity reviewed risk analysis results and
available security measures for reducing the risk of transmitting EPHI over the Web portal. The entity’s
decision to implement encryption of data via a secure transmission protocol and maintain integrity control
of data with encryption and view only access within the application is reasonable and appropriate and
allows the entity to meet the transmission security standard and associated implementation specifications.

The decision to transmit EPHI via communications networks would not be reasonable and appropriate if
the technical measures chosen to protect the transmission are not able to protect the EPHI from
unauthorized access during the transmission.

Example:

As described in the previous Administrative Safeguards example, EXLHCP has already developed
business associate agreement and memorandum of understanding language as part of Privacy Rule
compliance. All non-government business associates with access to PHI, including EPHI, were identified,
and business associate contracts were executed. In all government business associate relationships,
EXLHCP decided to use a memorandum of understanding to establish terms that mirror the language of
the business associate contract.

After a review of the requirements of § 164.314(a)(2)(i), the organization determined that no
modifications or additional language were needed. The original agreement and memorandum of
understanding (MOU) language went beyond the direct regulatory references required by the HIPAA
Privacy Rule to include technology and security related issues. Although the language is not the exact
language used in the Security Rule, the covered entity determined the existing agreements and MOUs
contained terms that address all of the requirements including: implementation of safeguards by the
business associate and their agents or contractors, reporting of security breaches and incidents, and
authorization to terminate the contract if a material term is violated (§§ 164.314(a)(1), (a)(2)(i)(A) – (D)
and (a)(2)(ii)(A) – (C)).

Explanation:

The covered entity’s decision not to update existing business associate contracts (BAC) and memoranda
of understanding (MOU) language developed for Privacy Rule compliance a permissible way of meeting
the requirements of this standard, if the language addresses all applicable requirements of the Security
Rule at §§ 164.314(a)(1) – (a)(2)(ii)(C). 45 CFR § 164.314(a)(1) requires the contract or other
arrangement between the covered entity and its business associate required by § 164.308(b) to meet the
requirements of paragraph (a)(2)(i) or (a)(2)(ii) of this section, as applicable. The entity reviewed the
existing BACs and MOUs to determine if the written language addresses all requirements of §
164.314(a)(2)(i) or (a)(2)(ii). After this review, the entity determined that all language requirements of the
Security Rule are addressed including: the requirement to implement safeguards by the business associate

and their agents or contractors, reporting of security breaches and incidents, and authorization to
terminate the contract if a material term is violated (§§ 164.314(a)(1), (a)(2)(i)(A) – (D) and (a)(2)(ii)(A)
– (C)). The covered entity’s decision to maintain existing contract and other arrangement language would
not be reasonable and appropriate if it determined the existing language does not provide satisfactory
assurances that the business associate will maintain reasonable and appropriate safeguards and does not
address the required language at §§ 164.314(a)(1) – (a)(2)(ii)(C).

Example:

EXHP determined this requirement does not apply to their organization. All disclosures from the group
health plan to the plan sponsor are made pursuant to § 164.504(f)(1)(ii) or (iii), or as authorized under §
164.508.

Explanation:

If the information the group health plan discloses to the plan sponsor is information that does not come
within §164.504(f)(1)(ii) or (iii), or as authorized under §164.508, then the group health plan must
address this standard and implementation specifications or not disclose the EPHI. It would be advisable
for the group health plan to document this decision.

Example:

Over the past five years, EXLHCP has developed several policies and procedures establishing positions
on security related issues. The entity recognized this as an important factor to ensure compliance with the
Security Rule. To ensure all policies and procedures required by the Security Rule are implemented, an
inventory and gap analysis were performed in conjunction with the risk analysis at all hospital locations.
EXLHCP determined that all Security Rule policies and procedures requirements have been reasonably
and appropriately addressed (§ 164.316(a)).

Explanation:

The covered entity’s decision to perform an inventory and gap analysis as part of the risk analysis process
to determine if all policies and procedures have been developed is a permissible way of determining
compliance with the requirements of this standard. The gap analysis process would not be reasonable and
appropriate to comply with this standard if policies and procedures were not subsequently developed and
implemented to account for identified gaps between current documented policies and procedures and that
which is required by the Security Rule.

In the past, EXHP maintained all documentation in printed binders. It has been difficult for EXHP to
update the documentation and maintain version control. EXHP decided to convert from paper to
electronic documentation. EXHP decided that both paper and electronic documentation will be
maintained for three years. After three years all documentation will be maintained electronically, except
for three printed binders that will be maintained at each location as part of the Contingency Plan. This
will allow users to print out documentation as needed, and save on general printing costs. An Intranet site
is currently being developed to maintain all organizational documentation including policies, procedures,
actions, activities and assessments. The main office will have a site for displaying and maintaining
organizational policies and procedures. Each remote state office will also have a site for their
documentation (§§ 164.316(b)(1)(i) – (ii)).

The new Intranet site will also allow EXHP to meet the Security Rule requirements for documentation
retention and availability. Moreover, it will make the process of updating and redistributing
documentation more efficient. The organization has an existing policy on establishing and maintaining all
documentation relevant to operations and administrative functions. The policy requires all documentation,
in written or electronic format, to be retained for seven years from the date of creation or last revision. It
requires documentation to be made available to all workforce members. It also requires a yearly review of
all documentation. The review identifies any updates or revisions that need to be made in a timely manner
in response to environmental or operational changes. EXHP decided to edit this policy to identify the
need to make updates when changes affect the security of EPHI (§§ 164.316(b)(2)(i) – (iii)).

Explanation:
The covered entity’s decision to manage all documentation for all locations in electronic form via an
Intranet site within the next three years may be reasonable and appropriate for this entity. 45 CFR
§164.316(b)(1)(i) – (ii) requires covered entities to; (i) maintain the policies and procedures implemented
to comply with this subpart in written (which may be electronic) form; and (ii) if an action, activity or
assessment is required by this subpart to be documented, maintain a written (which may be electronic)
record of the action, activity, or assessment. The entity’s decision to maintain all documentation in
electronic form with three printed binders per location for contingency operations is a permissible way of
meeting the requirements of this standard. However, the decision to maintain all documentation in
electronic format would not be reasonable and appropriate;

             •   If the availability and integrity of the electronic media storing the documentation is not
                 maintained;
             •   If the data on the electronic media cannot be read during the 7 year retention period;
             •   If the Intranet system used to distribute the documentation is not available to those
                 persons responsible for implementing the procedures; or
             •   If version control is not maintained for updates and revisions to documentation and
                 critical documentation of environmental or organizational security controls are not
                 properly recorded.


The entity’s decision to maintain all documentation for seven years from the date of creation of last
revision goes beyond requirements of the Security Rule but may be reasonable and appropriate for this
entity. The implementation specification at §164.316(b)(2)(i) requires covered entities to retain the
documentation required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section for six years from the date of its creation or the
date when it last was in effect, whichever is later. The Security Rule allows covered entities to implement
security measures that exceed requirements and still be in compliance, such as the entity’s decision to
follow existing policy and retain documentation for a period of seven years instead of the required six
year period.


SP 800-66                                                                                            Page 85

The covered entity’s decision to make all documentation available to all workforce members exceeds the
requirements of the Security Rule but is a permissible way of meeting the requirements of this standard.
45 CFR § 164.316(b)(2)(ii) requires covered entities to make documentation available to those persons
responsible for implementing the procedures to which the documentation pertains. The entity’s decision
to make all documentation available to all workforce members ensures it will meet the requirements of
this implementation specification.

The entity’s decision to review all documentation annually and to require any updates or revisions to
documentation to be performed in a timely manner in response to environmental or operational changes
may be reasonable and appropriate for this entity. The implementation specification at §
164.316(b)(2)(iii) requires covered entities to review documentation periodically, and update as needed,
in response to environmental or operational changes affecting the security of the EPHI. The Security Rule
does not identify how often the periodic reviews of documentation must be performed. The entity’s
decision to review documentation yearly may be reasonable and appropriate if it also allows the entity to
identify more frequently updates that are needed to respond to environmental or operational changes that
affect the security of EPHI.

Appendix B—Glossary

The terms and definitions used in this Special Publication (SP) have been obtained from Congressional
legislation, executive orders, Office of Management and Budget (OMB) policies, and commonly accepted
glossaries of security terminology, including that of National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) SP 800-53, Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems and the Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)).

                                 implementation specifications, a covered entity must– (i)
                                 Assess whether each implementation specification is a
                                 reasonable and appropriate safeguard in its environment, when
                                 analyzed with reference to the likely contribution to protecting
                                 the entity's electronic protected health information; and (ii) As
                                 applicable to the entity - (A) Implement the implementation
                                 specification if reasonable and appropriate; or (B) If

                                 alternative measure if reasonable and appropriate.

Affiliated Covered Entities      Legally separate covered entities that are under common
[45 C.F.R. Sec. 164.105(b)]      ownership or control and that have all designated themselves
                                 as a single affiliated covered entity for the purposes of the
                                 Privacy and Security Rule (more precisely, those parts of the
                                 Rules appearing at 45 CFR, Part 160, Subparts C and E).

Authentication                   The corroboration that a person is the one claimed.

                               participates, where the provision of the service involves the
                               disclosure of individually identifiable health information from
                               such covered entity or arrangement, or from another business
                               associate of such covered entity or arrangement, to the person.

                               arrangement that performs a function or activity as described
                               by paragraph (1)(i) of this definition for or on behalf of such
                               organized health care arrangement, or that provides a service
                               as described in paragraph (1)(ii) of this definition to or for
                               such organized health care arrangement, does not, simply
                               through the performance of such function or activity or the
                               provision of such service, become a business associate of other
                               covered entities participating in such organized health care
                               arrangement.
                                  (3) A covered entity may be a business associate of another
                               covered entity.

Certification and              Certification is a comprehensive assessment of the
Accreditation (C&A)            management, operational, and technical security controls in an
[NIST SP 800-37]               information system, made in support of security accreditation,
                               to determine the extent to which the controls are implemented
                               correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired
                               outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for
                               the system. Accreditation is the official management decision
                               given by a senior agency official to authorize operation of an
                               information system and to explicitly accept the risk to agency
                               operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation),
                               agency assets, or individuals, based on the implementation of
                               an agreed-upon set of security controls.
Computer Security              An event with the potential to disrupt computer operations,
Contingency                    thereby disrupting critical mission and business functions, for
[NIST SP 800-12]               example, a power outage, hardware failure, fire, or storm. If
                               the event is very destructive, it is often called a disaster.

Confidentiality                The property that data or information is not made available or
[45 C.F.R. Sec. 164.304]       disclosed to unauthorized persons or processes.

   Appendix E—HIPAA Security Rule/FISMA Requirements Crosswalk

   This appendix provides a crosswalk of the Administrative, Technical and Physical standards and
   implementation specifications of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996
   (HIPAA) Security Rule123 to the requirements of the Federal Information Security Management Act of
   2002 (FISMA), which contains requirements relevant to the security programs of all federal agencies.

        This crosswalk does not address the administrative and organizational requirements of the HIPAA Security Rule such as those
   described in Chapter 4. These activities are generally specific to demonstrating compliance with the HIPAA Security Rule rather
   than standards requiring the implementation of security controls, as is required by FISMA.
   124
       In addition to NIST 800-26, specifically mentioned in OMB Memorandum M-03-19, NIST SP 800-53 also includes a set of
   controls that are required by FISMA and that are relevant to the security controls addressed in the Table E-1 above.
