rhe          National Institute of Standards and Technology was established in 1988 by Congress to "assist industry in
         the development of technology             .   .   .   needed to improve product quality, to modernize manufacturing processes,
to ensure product reliability     .   .   .   and to facilitate rapid commercialization ... of products based on new scientific
discoveries."
        NIST, originally founded as the National Bureau of Standards in 1901, works to strengthen U.S. industry's
competitiveness; advance science and engineering; and improve public health, safety, and the environment. One
of the agency's basic functions is to develop, maintain, and retain custody of the national standards of
measurement, and provide the means and methods for comparing standards used in science, engineering,
manufacturing, commerce, industry, and education with the standards adopted or recognized by the Federal
Government.
        As an agency of the U.S. Commerce Department's Technology Administration, NIST conducts basic and
applied research in the physical sciences and engineering, and develops measurement techniques, test
methods, standards, and related services. The Institute does generic and precompetitive work on new and
advanced technologies. NIST's research facilities are located at Gaithersburg,                            MD 20899, and at Boulder, CO 80303.
Major technical operating units and their principal activities are listed below. For more information contact the

INTRODUCTION
The Private Branch Exchange (PBX) is an essential element that supports                 the critical
infrastructure of both government agencies           and U.S. industry.   A PBX is a sophisticated
computer-based switch that can be thought of as        essentially a small, in-house phone
company for the organi2ation that operates it. Protection of the PBX is thus a high priority.
Failure to secure a        PBX can result in exposing the organization to toU fraud, theft of
proprietary or confidential information, and loss of revenue or legal entanglements.


This report presents a generic methodology for conducting an analysis of a Private Branch
Exchange (PBX) in order to identify security vulnerabilities. The report focuses on digital-
based PBXs and addresses the following areas for study:

    •          System Architecture

    •          Hardware

    •          Maintenance

    •          Administrative Database/Software


    •          User Features

This report is not intended to provide a step-by-step process, but rather a guideline for what
specific areas should be       smdied for the existence of possible vulnerabilities.   This process
must be customized for each specific PBX, depending upon the actual switch features as
well as the perceived threat.      We do not identify known vulnerabilities in particular switches
because doing so may encourage attacks by unsophisticated hackers or "script kiddies."
However, this report does provide information on vulnerabilities that are not well known to
many system administrators, as well as procedures for penetration testing, i.e., deterrrdning
the existence of these vulnerabilities and if they can be exploited. Sophisticated hackers and
foreign intelligence organizations should be assumed to know of these vulnerabilities already.
System administrators need to be able to find them before an attacker does.              Note that
some of the analysis methods described here may require instruments or expertise not
available in    all   organizations.   Individual judgment will be required to determine if the
organization's risk is sufficient to warrant obtaining additional assistance.


A second reason for conducting penetration tests is to determine what countermeasures
should receive priority.      Not all of the vulnerabilities described in this report wiU appear on
every PBX system. Depending on the system architecture and the set of active user features,
the risk of some security weaknesses being exploited wiU be considerably less than for
others.  Given a limited budget for security, protecting against the higher risk vulnerabilities
will require giving less attention to others. To establish whether the potential exists for a




                                                 1
particular attack on a PBX, testing will normally be needed. The methods described in this
report are designed to assist administrators in conducting this type of testing. Computer
based telephony systems and new techniques such as voice over IP (VOIP) present an
entirely new collection of vulnerabilities and are not addressed in this report. However,
some of the evaluation methods described here may be appHed to these systems as well.




BACKGROUND
DigitalPBXs are widespread throughout government and industry, having replaced theitr
analog predecessors. The advent of software-based PBXs has provided a wealth of
communications          capabilities within     these switches.    Today, even the most basic    PBX
systems have a wide range of capabilities that were previously available only in large-scale
switches.   These new features have opened up many new opportunities for an adversary to
attempt to exploit the PBX, particularly by using the features as designed for a purpose that
was never intended.         The threats to PBX telephone systems are many, depending on the
goals of attackers. Threats include:


    •        Theft of service      — i.e., toll fraud, probably the most common of motives        for
            attackers.


    •       Disclosure of information - data disclosed without authorization, either by deliberate

            action or by accident. Examples include both eavesdropping on conversations or
            unauthorized access to routing and address data.

    •       Data modification - data altered in some meaningful way by reordering, deleting or
            modifying it. For example, an intruder may change billing information, or modify
            system tables to gain additional services.

    •        Unauthori^d access - actions that permit an unauthorized user to gain access to
            system resources or privileges.

    •       Denial of service - actions that prevent die system from functioning in accordance
            with its intended purpose.                A piece of equipment or entity may be rendered
            inoperable or forced to operate in a degraded state; operations that depend on
            timeliness may be delayed.


    •        T^f^ffi^   analysis   -   a   form of passive attack     in   which an intruder observes
            information about calls (although not necessarily the contents of the messages)
            and makes inferences,              e.g.    from the source and destination numbers, or
            frequency and length of the messages. For example, an intruder observes a high
            volume of calls between a company's legal department and the Patent Office,
            and concludes that a patent is being filed.

PBXs are sophisticated computer systems, and many of the threats and vulnerabilities
associated with operating systems are shared by PBXs. But there are two important ways in
which PBX security is different from conventional operating system security:

    •      'External accessI control.     Like larger telephone switches,     PBXs typically require
           remote maintenance by the vendor. Instead of relying on local administrators to
           make operating system updates and               patches,     organizations   normally have
           updates installed remotely by the switch manufacturer.             This of course requires
           remote maintenance ports and access to the switch by a potentially large pool of
           outside parties.


   •       Feature richness.    The wide variety of features available on PBXs, particularly
           administrative      features   and conference functions, provide the          possibility   of
           unexpected attacks.      A feature may be used by an attacker in a manner that was
           not intended by its designers.        Features may also interact in unpredictable ways,
           leading to system compromise even if each component of the system conforms
           to   its   security requirements     and the system     is    operated and administrated
           correcdy.


Although most features are        common from PBX to PBX, the implementation of these
features may vary.    For example, many PBX vendors have proprietary designs for the digital
signaling protocol between the      PBX and the user instruments.           This is the reason digital
instruments usually cannot be interchanged between PBXs of different manufacturers.                The
methodology outlined in this report will assist in the investigation of PBX features that are
known to be susceptible to adversarial attack. However, the degree of vulnerability, if any,
win depend on how each feature is implemented.




EVALUATION APPROACH
This report provides suggestions for areas of investigation.          In practice, the evaluator may
discover many other avenues of investigation.          For some aspects of the PBX, specific steps
are suggested to attempt to investigate a vulnerability (especially User Features). For others,
the approach is necessarily architecture-dependent and must be discussed more generally.


The type of skills and number of evaluators required, as well as the length of time required
to perform the evaluation cannot be fixed since these depend on the size and complexity of
the PBX under study. The type of perceived threat and the seriousness of any discovered




                                                   3
vulnerabilities must be decided by the evaluating organization. Consequentiy, any corrective

actions must also be decided upon based on the cost of the loss compared with the cost of
the corrective action.   It is   recommended that at least two individuals perform the evaluation
in order to share observations and gain the advantage of multiple insights.

SYSTEM
ARCHITECTURE
This section addresses the ways in which an adversary may be able to exploit wilnerabilities
that are inherent in the system architecture.




SEPARATION OF SWITCHING AND ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS
All modem PBXs have central computer processors that are controlled      from a software-
driven stored program (see Figure       1).            most PBXs have microprocessors
                                                In addition,
dispersed throughout the switch that provide real-time signaUng and supervision control as
instructed from the central processor. One or more terminals and their associated port(s)
provide computer operating system, database management, and maintenance access to the
PBX processor. Access to these functions gives the administrator or maintenance personnel
total control   of the PBX.   Depending on the size of the PBX, these functions may be
separate or combined.


Administrative Terminals. The switch should be examined to determine whether the
administrative functions are performed on terminals that are connected to the PBX via the
same type of ports that switch the voice and data traffic, or if the terminals are connected via
dedicated ports. If they are connected via the same type of voice and data ports, these
terminals could be surreptitiously switched to an unauthorized user.      This may or may not
require a modem. If the ports are dedicated for use by these terminals, this vulnerability is
reduced. However, it may be possible for an adversary to gain access through the use of a
modem coupled with an unauthorized connection to a switched port, enabHng the adversary
to dial in   and make database modifications.         Tests should be conducted to see   if   these
functions can be rerouted to other physical terminals through configuration options or other
changes to the administrative database.

In smaller PBXs, these functions are often combined. For example, the attendant (operator)
terminal   may also be the database terminal, or the database terminal may also be the
maintenance terminal.   Attempts should be made to use these terminals to modify the
database or gain access to unauthorized functions.         For example, investigate whether the
attendant or maintenance personnel can gain access and modify the database.

SWITCHING ALGORITHM
Switching     is    performed using time division multiplexing techniques where each voice
(digitized)   and data port is assigned a time     Under control of the call processing
                                                            slot.

routines, incoming time slots are connected to outgoing time slots.      If the number of

incoming slots does not exceed the number of outgoing slots, there wiU be no contention for
switching resources. This is commonly known as non-blocking switching.


Dual Connections. To investigate for vulnerabilities, attempts should be made to route
another incoming time slot to an outgoing time slot in addition to the intended time slot.
This might be accomplished by a database entry or by a modification to the PBX control
software.     After accomplishing this, test calls should be made to vetiiy the dual connection
and to determine whether the calling or called party can detect the false connection.             If the

PBX under study has status or maintenance query features, attempts should be made to
detect the modification.


The documentation accompanying the PBX forms the basis for learning its structure and
operation. The manufacturer may have additional documentation that will be useful during
the course of the evaluation. It may be beneficial to have technical discussions with the
manufacturer to           fully   understand how PBX functions are implemented. Since this
information        is   usually proprietary, it may be necessary to negotiate a non-disclosure
agreement between the evaluating organization and the manufacturer to protect this data.




                                                        6
Also, the manufacturer may provide training as to the operation and maintenance of the
PBX for customers that purchase their products.



Function Allocation
Although most     PBX functions are software driven, the PBX under study should be
examined    to   determine   how    specific   features   are   implemented   so   that   potential
vulnerabilities can be explored.   For example, conferencing can be implemented in hardware
or software.   Knowing the design implementation will aid in determining if an adversary may
be able to exploit the function. Figure 2 shows a typical PBX functional architecture.

HARDWARE
This section addresses the ways in which an adVersary coiold exploit vulnerabilities that are
inherent in the system hardware to gain unwanted access to information passing through the
switch.




Susceptibility to Tapping
A PBX's susceptibiHt}^ to tapping depends on the methods used for communication between
the PBX and its instruments. This communication may include voice, data, and signaling
information.     The signaling information is typically commands to the instrument (turn on
indicators,   microphones, speakers, etc.) and status from the instrument (hook status, keys
pressed, etc.). Three general communications methods are discussed below.




Analog Voice with or witiiout Separate Control Signals

This is the simplest of the three methods discussed here. Analog voice information is passed
between the PBX and the instrument on either a single pair of wires or two pairs (one for
transmit and one for receive). If there is any additional signaling communication (other than
the hook switch) between the        PBX and the instrument, it is done on wires that are separate
from the voice pair(s).

The voice information is transmitted essentially as it is picked up by a microphone. It is in a
form that can be directiy reproduced by a speaker. The voice line can be easily tapped by
connecting a high impedance differential amplifier to the pair of voice wires. The amplified
voice signal can then be heard directiy with a speaker or headphones, or it can be recorded
for later playback.


If signaling data     is   transmitted on a separate set of wires,   it   is   normally in proprietary
form.ats.     An adversar)^ with physical access can gain useful information by hooking an
oscilloscope up to each wire and observing the effects when the instrument is taken on and
off hook, keys are pressed, etc. For example, in one common format the voltage present on
each data wire reflects the on/ off status of a control or indicator.




                                                  9
Another possible format is one in which information is passed as bytes of digital data in a
serial asynchronous bit stream similar to that of a PC's          or a terminal's serial data port. Each
data byte being transmitted would appear in a pattern similar to the following: Start Bit, Data
Bits   (5. .8,   frequendy 8), optional Parity Bit, Stop Bits (1, 1.5, or 2).     The Start Bit and Stop
bits are of opposite polarity.          The bit rate could be measured with an oscilloscope.      A device
such as a PC or terminal could then be configured to capture the serial data and perhaps
store it for some later use.




Analog Voice with Inclusive Control Signals

In this scheme, analog voice and control signaling is passed between the                   PBX and the
instrument on either a single pair of wires or two pairs (one pair for transmit and another for
receive).        This can be done if the signal path is of a high enough bandwidth to pass voice
information         (less   than 4    KHz)   plus additional data information.       For example, voice
information can be combined with data information modulated onto a carrier tone that is
centered outside of the voice band.


This type of line           is   vulnerable to tapping by connecting a high impedance differential
amplifier to the pair and passing the signal through            filters   to separate the voice   and data
information.        Data information could be recovered by demodulating the carrier tone.             The
methods outHned in the section above could then be used to determine the format of the
data being transmitted.




Digital Voice with Inclusive Control Signals

With this method, voice and control signaling data are passed across the same pair of wires.
There may be two pairs of wires, one for each direction, or both directions could be
combined onto one pair of wires using echo cancellation as is done with ISDN.
Conventional tapping techniques would not work against most types of digital lines. The
format and type of digital signals that pass between the PBX and its instruments vary widely
between switch types.

If separate pairs are            used for transmit and receive, each pair could be tapped to provide
access to the transmit and receive digital bit streams by             first   determining in what digital
format the data is beiag transmitted.            Then a digital to analog converter could be used to
convert the digital data back into analog voice that can be Ustened to or recorded.               A great
deal of information useful to an attacker could be gained by disassembling the telephone
models of interest and determining what types of parts are used for CODECs, UARTs,
A/Ds, D/As, etc. PubHshed information on these parts can generally be obtained from the
manufacturers.




                                                     10
Echo Cancellation

If both transmit and receive are combined on one pair using echo cancellation, the
previously described methods would not be useful for tapping. This is because each
transmit end of the link can only determine what is being received by subtracting out what it
istransmitting from the total signal. An outside observer tapping the line somewhere
between the two ends would only have access to the total signal and would therefore find it
very difficult to reproduce either end.       An attack would depend on a known initial condition
on both ends (such as silence) in order to be able to subtract the correct information from
the total signal.     The technical difficult)^ of this attack probably makes systems using echo
cancellation      most resistant to attack among those described here. Protecting against this
attack requires ensuring that lines are not physically compromised.




Analysis of Signaling Methods

It   may be possible to discover information about the method of communication between the
PBX and its instruments by disassembling and examining them. Most digital instruments are
designed around a microcontroller that handles the PBX communication, controls the
displays,and responds to key presses and hook status changes. There may be a PROM
device in the instrument, or the microcontroller may have built-in PROM that stores the
microcontroller's software.         With access to the PROM and/ or microcontroller, the software
could be disassembled, providing information about the                 PBX communication. If the
software    is    stored direcdy in the microcontroller,     it   may not be accessible since some
microcontrollers have a security feature that can make it difficult if not impossible to read its
contents once it is programmed.           An approach to investigating these vulnerabilities is the
following:


      •          Disassemble an instrument.

      •          Note the integrated circuits (ICs) that are used and look up unfamiliar ICs m the
                 corresponding vendors' data books. This provides knowledge as to the signaling
                 protocols.


      •          Determine    if   the instrument contains   a    PROM device.     If so,   a   detailed

                 investigation would require attempting to        remove and read the device with a
                 PROM programmer.
      •          Locate the microcontroller and determine its part number.        Look it up m the
                 microcontroller manufacturer's data books. Determine if it has a security feature




                                                    11
              and if so, how it works.       A detailed investigation would require attempting to
              read the microcontroller's contents with a           PROM programmer or a test circuit
              and a PC or workstation.

       •      If the   PROM or microcontroller code          is   readable, it may be desirable to try to
              disassemble the code to learn how the instrument communicates with the PBX.
              Some reverse engineering may be required.




INSTRUMENT MODIFICATION RISKS
       •      Methods to prevent eavesdropping on an on-hook analog telephone by using
              telephone    instruments     that     are   known    to   resist    such    attacks   have    been
              documented in the Telephone Security Group (TSG) standards [TSG].
              However, digital instruments offer a similar vulnerability.         An adversary
              interested in eavesdropping on a particular user instrument has three goals:


       •      Create a condition so that the voice information wiU be transmitted to the PBX
              while giving the appearance that the instrument is on-hook.


       •      Modify the instrument        to     keep the microphone            live   while in an on-hook
              condition.


       •:     Ensure that this condition is transparent to the user and the PBX.




The circuitry of the digital instrument under study must be analyzed to determine the
conditions that must exist to allow the digitized voice information to continue to transmit to
the    PBX.   This     may include having the handset off-hook electrically.                 Also, since the
instrument would normally include a          CODEC to convert the analog voice to digital data,
this   function must be enabled.         In order to create the necessary conditions,               it   may be
necessary to cut traces on the circuit board and/or insert jumpers to bypass certain
safeguards widiin the instrument          itself.    One could also modify the on-board PROM
containing the program that controls the instruments to create this condition.                           The key
condition is that the instrument still appear to be on-hook to the user and the PBX so that
normal caUs can be made and received.

Once the conditions are created, make calls to and from the modified instrument to assure
normal operation. Also, if diagnostic tests are available, test the line m question to be sure
that no abnormal conditions are detected.




                                                    12
Ha\Tng successfully modified an instrument now creates the opportunity for an adversary to
exploit. As mentioned earlier, the line cannot simply be "tapped" to gain access to the voice

data. An active device may be required to "tap" the line between the instrument and the

PBX and convert the bit stream to analog form. Also, this condition may be exploited in
conjunction with one or more feature vulnerabilities to allow undetected access to the
telephone line of interest.




CONFERENCING (HARDWARE)
When implemented in hardware, the conferencing feature may employ a circuit card known
as a conference bridge or a signal processor chip.      This allows multiple lines to be "bridged"
to create a conference      where all parties can both speak and listen.     Some PBXs have a
feature   where all parties can hear, but only certain parties can speak.       This is a type of
broadcast conference.       An adversary would desire a connection to the bridge where the
conference could be overheard.          A hardware modification to the bridge itself may make   it

possible to cause the "output" of the bridge to be available to a specific port.            As in
instrument modifications, some additional steps must be taken to receive this information.
This may include modif\^ing the database to have the adversary be a permanent member of
the bridge so that any conference on that bridge could be overheard.




COUNTERMEASURES
    •     Physical securit}'^ to prevent unauthorized access to telephone closets and PBX
          facilities is important.   Whenever possible, the PBX should be kept in a locked room
          with restricted access.

    •     Critical hardware components may be locked with anti-tamper devices.


    •     Periodic integrit}^ checks should be made to ensure that components have note been
          tampered with.




                                                  13
MAINTENANCE
Maintenance procedures are among the most commonly exploited functions in networked
systems, and the problem        is   even more acute with   PBXs because PBX maintenance
frequendy requires the involvement of outside personnel. This section addresses the ways in
which an adversary could exploit vulnerabilities in maintenance features to gain unwanted
access to the switch.




Remote Access
Remote    access   is   frequendy an unavoidable necessity, but   it   can represent a serious
            The maintenance features may be accessible via a remote terminal with a
vulnerability.

modem, an Attendant Console or other instrument, or even over an outside dial-in line.
This allows for systems to be located over a large area (perhaps around the world) and have
one central location from which maintenance can be performed.          Often it is necessary for
the switch manufacturer to have remote access to the switch to install software upgrades or
to restart a switch that has experienced a service degradation.


Dial-back modem vulnerabilities.

Unattended remote access to a switch clearly represents a vulnerability. Many organi2ations
have employed dial-back modems to control access to remote maintenance facilities.         This
access control method works by identifying the incoming call, disconnecting the circuit, and
diaUng the identified person or computer at a predetermined telephone number. Although
helpful, this form of access control is weak because methods of defeating it are well known.
For example, if the local telephone company central office uses originator control for phone
Unes, the attacker can stay   on the Hne, send a dial tone when the modem attempts to
disconnect, then wait for the modem to dial out again on the same Hne.             A more
sophisticated means of defeating dial-back modems has also been used in attacks reported in
the open literature. In this method, the local phone company switch is penetrated and its
databases modified to forward the returned calls directiy to the attacker's computer.




Social engineering attacks.

Even if the organization requires some action by local operators to provide access to the
remote maintenance connection, serious vukierabiUties may still exist.     For example,
modems on lines used by remote maintenance may be kept off, and only turned on when a




                                              14
call is   received from the switch manufacturer.        Often the only form of authentication used
by the organization may be ensuring that the manufacturer remote maintenance personnel
requesting access are Hsted among legitimate remote users.           This form of authentication is
clearly inadequate.    It is   easy for attackers to contact the switch manufacturer on the pretext
of needing help with a particular type of switch, obtain the names of the manufacturer's
remote maintenance personnel, and then masquerade as these personnel to obtain access to
the victim's switch.




MAINTENANCE FEATURE VULNERABILITIES
A common maintenance feature is Maintenance-Out-of-Service (MOS). This feature allows
maintenance personnel to place a Hne out of ser\ace for maintenance.            It is typically   used
when a problem is detected with a line or when it is desired to disable a Hne. However, if a
line is placed MOS while it is in operation, the PBX may terminate its signaling

communication with the instrument and leave the instrument's voice channel connection
active even after the instrument is placed on-hook. If the MOS feature were to function in
this   manner, the potential exists for someone to use the MOS feamre to establish a live
microphone connection to           a user's location    without the user's knowledge, and thereby
eavesdrop on the area surrounding the user's instrument.




LINE Testing Capabilities
Another common maintenance feature is the ability to connect two lines together in order to
transmit data from one Hne to the other and verify whether or not the second Hne receives
the data properly.     This feature would aUow someone with maintenance access to connect a
user's instrument to     an instrument at another location in order to eavesdrop on the area
surrounding the user's instrument without the user's knowledge.




UNDOCUMENTED MAINTENANCE FEATURES
The PBX may support some maintenance features that are not normaUy accessible to the
owner/ operator of the PBX for several reasons. These types of utiHties vary gready from
one PBX to another so that a general approach to finding them cannot be detailed. Some
suggested courses of action are Hsted below:




                                                   15
•   Ask the manufacturer or maintenance company if any such features exist.

    •      Attempt to learn about undocumented usemames/passwords.

    •      Attempt to search the system PROMS or disks for evidence of such features.

    •      Viewing the system load files with a binary editor will sometimes reveal the
           names of undocumented commands among                            a    Hst   of   known maintenance
           commands that can be recognized in the binaries.




SPECIAL MANUFACTURER'S FEATURES
There may be features that the manufacturer considers useful in the event a customer's PBX
becomes disabled to such a point that on-site maintenance personnel cannot resolve the
problems. The manufacturer could then instruct the maintenance personnel to configure
and connect a modem to the maintenance port. The manufacturer may then be able to dial-
in and use certain special features to resolve the problems without sending a representative
to the customer's location. The potential cost savings is a likely reason for adding such
special features. The manufacturer would not want the special features to be well known
because of their potential vulnerability. These types of features would most Hkely be
accessible via undocumented username/password access to the maintenance and/or
admimstrative tools. Some possible undocumented features are Hsted below:


    •      Database upload/ download  utility: Such a utiMty allows the manufacturer to
           download the database from a system that is malfunctioning and examine it at
           their location to try to determine the cause of the malfunction. It would also
           allow the manufacturer to upload a new database to a PBX in the event that the
           database became so corrupted that the system became inoperable.                         Compromise
           of such a utility could allow an adversary to download a system's database, insert
           a trojan horse or otherwise                modify   it   to allow special features to        be made
           available to the adversary,        and upload the modified database back into the
           system.


    •      Database examine/ modify utility: Such a utility allows the manufacturer to remotely
           examine and modify a system's database to repair damage caused by incorrect
           configuration, design bugs, or tampering.                   This    utility   could also provide an
           adversary with the ability to modify the database to gain access to special
           features.


    •      Software debugger/ update   utility:       This type of utility gives the manufacturer the
           ability   to   remotely   debug        a    malfunctioning      system.         It   also   allows   the
           manufacturer to remotely update systems with bug fixes and software upgrades.




                                                      16
               Such a utility could also grant an adversary the same abilities. This is perhaps the
               most dangerous vulnerability because access to the software would give an
               adversary virtually unlimited access to the PBX and its associated instruments.




Manufacturer's Development & Test features
There may be features that were added to the system during its development phase that were
forgotten and not removed when production versions were released.                There also may be
hidden features that were added by a person on the development team with the intent of
creating a backdoor into customers' systems.            Left-over debugging code, binary editors, and
even a "batdeship" game have been discovered in commercial PBX system load modules.

These types of features potentially create extreme vulnerabilities for the PBX system if an
adversary has detailed knowledge of the software and its structure. This is because there is
generally litde or no protection given to test features that are expected to be removed.         The
test features are probably easy to access for ease of development and have few restrictions in

order to reduce development time. These types of features could come in many forms, such
as:



       •       Undocumented username/ passwords

       •       Entering out-of-range values in database fields

       •       Dialing undocumented access codes on instruments


       •       Pressing certain key sequences on instruments




It    may be possible to discover some of these undocumented features during the normal
course of the evaluation.      If open technical discussions are held with the manufacturer, this

area       should   be   discussed,   although may only be known to the original
                                                 they
designers/developers. Lasdy, some "shortcuts" may be described in vendor ttaining courses
as an aid to maintenance people.




                                                   17
COUNTERMEASURES
 •   Ensure that remote maintenance access is normally blocked unless unattended access
     is   required.   Whenever possible, require some involvement of local personnel in
     opening remote maintenance ports.

 •   Install   two-factor (i.e., two different mechanisms) strong authentication on remote
     maintenance ports. Smart-card based systems or one-time password tokens,           in
     addition to conventional login/ password functions, make it much more difficult for
     attackers to breach your system's security.


 •   Keep maintenance terminals in a locked, restricted area.

 •   Turn off maintenance features when not needed, if possible.




                                          18
ADMINISTRATIVE
DATABASES
Administrative databases represent "the keys to the kingdom" for a PBX. Among the most
critical security tasks    for   PBX owners are administration of the PBX, the creation and
modification of its user databases, and the operating software controlling the switch.




SOFTWARE LOADING AND UPDATE TAMPERING
When software is initially loaded onto a PBX and when any software updates /patches are
loaded, the PBX is particularly vulnerable to software tampering.     A software update sent to
a    PBX administrator could be intercepted by an adversary. The update could be modified to
allow special access or special features to the adversary.   The modified update would then be
sent to the       PBX administrator who would install the update and unknowingly give the
adversary unwanted access to the PBX.




Tamper and Error Detection

The ability of an adversary to intercept and modify the software can be reduced by several
means. The software could be encrypted by the manufacturer and decrypted by the PBX
during the install/ update process using unique keys only possessed by the manufacturer and
PBX administrator (or the PBX itself). This method would work well unless the adversary
were to discover the key and encryption method.       The presence of such an encryption
scheme could be detected by looking through the software with an ASCII dump utility on a
PC or workstation. The software wiU almost definitely contain words and phrases that are
recogni2able to people such as messages, variable and function names used by debuggers,
etc. If no readily recognizable words or phrases are found, it is very likely that the software

is   encrypted.


The software manufacturer could also use error detection methods in order to detect
tampered software before installation.      Various cyclical redundancy checks and checksums
can be performed on the software before it is installed. The results can be compared with
known correct results stored with the software or in ROM on the PBX to determine




                                                19
whether or not the software is valid.      This scheme    is   useful against hardware or other
unintentional errors, but only marginally effective against a skilled attacker.   Software can be
intentionally modified in such a way that the modification will not be detectable by standard
error detection algorithms.   A PC or workstation could be used to read the PBX software,
make changes, and place the modified software on media used by the PBX. The installation
or update process can then be attempted with the modified software.        If an error detection
scheme is in fact used, it is very unHkely that the installation process will allow the modified
software to be installed.




Countermeasures

Many software packages use error detection codes to protect against transmission or disk
copying     errors.   Conventional error detection codes       such as   checksums or     cyclical

redundancy checks (CRC) are not        sufficient to ensure    tamper detection.     Strong error
detection      based on cryptography must be used.        These methods use cryptographic
algorithms that guarantee detection of even a single bit modification.




Crash-Restart Attacks
                                                                The means by which a
System crashes primarily present a denial-of-service vulnerability.
system may be crashed vary significandy from one system to another. The following Hst
suggests a few features and conditions that can sometimes trigger a system crash:

•        Call Forwarding.
•       Voice mail.
•       Physical removal of hardware or media from the PBX.
•       Use of administrative/maintenance terminal functions.
•       Direct modification of the system or the database may be possible if the media can
        be read by utilities typically found on a PC or workstation.
•       Normal system Shutdown procedures.


These approaches should be tested as possible ways of exposing the weaknesses discussed in
the remainder of this section.




Live Microphone Vulnerabilities

Although denial-of-service is the primary vulnerability of a system crash, it is not the only
possibility. A system may in some cases be crashed in such a way as to disable the
interaction between the PBX and its instruments without terininating the calls in progress.




                                             20
When a user then attempts to terminate a call, the PBX may be unable to command the
instruments to disable their microphones thereby causing voice data to continue to be
received by the microphone and transmitted to a destination that may be accessible to an
adversary.     The adversary could then eavesdrop on areas around the target instrument until
normal operation of the PBX is restored.      XXTiiIe   attempting to cause various system crashes
as described above, tn^ to determine if any connections remain active after the crash and the
users attempt to terminate the connections.




Embedded Login IDs and Passwords

Passwords are normally stored in the system database and can be changed by administrators
and users, as in any computer operating system. However, testing has shown that some
PBXs have embedded login IDs and passwords that are restored on rebooting the system.
These mav be needed to allow manufacturer personnel to bring up a system remotely after a
failure that   has corrupted the local database.     However, they also make it possible for an
attacker to gain adrninistrator privileges on a svstem by crashing the system, then applying a
known embedded login ID/password combination.



Countermeasures

        Test for crash-restart \"ulnerabilLties. If present develop and document restart
        procedures that eliminate the \'ulnerabilLty. This may require doing a cold start
        (complete shutdown, power-off, and restart) in event of a system crash.

        If embedded passwords are found, consider patching the load module to replace
        them. Authorized manufacturer personnel can be given the new password if needed.




PASSWORDS
Most PBXs grant admimstrative          access to the system database through an Attendant
Console or a generic dumb terminal.         Username/password combinations are often used to
protect the system from         unwanted changes to the database. If remote access to the
maintenance features      is   available, it is usually restricted by some form of password

protection.     There mav be a siagle fixed maintenance account, multiple fixed maintenance




                                                21
                                                      The documentation provided with
accounts, or general user defined maintenance accounts.
the PBX should state what tjrpe of maintenance access is available. The documentation
should also indicate how passwords function.




Password Types

Passwords may be set at the factory to predetermined permanent values. If this is the case,
the passwords should be provided by the manufacturer.              They may also be determined by
searching the contents of the system media (ROM, PROM, EPROM, EEPROM, FLASH,
floppy/hard disk, CD-ROM) for the user or account names. Passwords may be stored in a
look-up table near the account names.       However, some form of encryption may be used to
make it difficult to determine the passwords.

Passwords may also be set to factory default values that can be changed by the user. Default
values are typically published in the documentation provided with the PBX.             If there are
multiple maintenance accounts and only one is used by maintenance personnel, the others
may remain at their published factory settings.       This would grant maintenance access to
anyone who knows the factory default settings. Tables where passwords are stored may be
readily   found by making a copy of likely storage media (EEPROM, FLASH, floppy disk),
changing a password, and comparing the updated media with the older copy.                     Any
differences are Hkely to indicate where passwords are stored.           Even if the passwords are
encrypted, the encrypted versions of known passwords could be placed into the password
locations of other accounts to set the password of an account without having prior access to
that account.   This scenario could be used by an adversary to seize control of the PBX since
the passwords would only be known by the adversary.


In addition to published or user defined usernames/passwords, there             may be additional
combinations that are intended only for use by the manufacturer.              If a table containing

usernames or passwords can be found in the load module, comparing the number of entries
in the table with the     number of known combinations could lead to              the discovery of
additional combinations.     If additional passwords are        found but the usernames associated
with them are unknown, it may be possible to determine correct combinations as follows:

    •        Change the password to one that is known.              Then try logging in using the
             known password with various reasonable guesses at the usemame such as
             ADMIN, MAINT, SYSTEM, SUPERUSER, ROOT, etc.

    •        If a valid username can be determined without a password, it would be useful to
             try logical guesses at the password.


    •        The maximum allowable length of a password would be useful to know when
             guessing passwords.     If   not published,   it   could be determined by using the




                                               22
           system to   set the   password of an accessible account to longer and longer
           passwords until perhaps the password is not accepted.

           If a very long password is accepted, the system may only use part      of it.   The
           useful part could be determined by* first setting a very long password and then
           trying to log in using only the first few characters.


           Try longer and longer parts of the password until a part is found that works. The
           length of the successful part is Hkely to be the maximum password length.




Password Login Timeouts

A potential vulnerability of the password access system is that an authentic user may log
onto the system and at some point leave the active terminal unattended without intentionally
logging-off of the system.   An adversary with access to the terminal could then have access
to the maintenance system and its features.


The PBX may provide protection from such a vulnerability in the form of a timeout period.
The system could measure the amount of inactive time on the terminal and automatically
terminate the login session. If thf timeout period is set to a short enough time, the chances
of an adversary gaining access to an unattended terminal are significantiy reduced. However,
the timeout period cannot be so short that an authentic user becomes annoyed by frequent
automatic logouts during normal use.   The timeout can be tested as foUows:

   •       Log into the system.

   •       Wait a while without pressing any keys or moving the mouse.     A timeout should
           occur in about 5-10 minutes.        Watch for any warning messages that indicate
           that a timeout has occurred.


   •       Try to access the system to determine if the login session has been terminated.
           There may not have been a warning message displayed when the timeout
           occurred.


   •       If no timeout is observed, try longer waiting times - up to perhaps 30 minutes.   A
           timeout this long or longer would not be very useful.




                                               23
A system without a timeout feature that has dial-up maintenance capabilities could allow an
adversary access to remote maintenance capabilities.       For example, an authentic user may
dial-up   and   log-into the maintenance system,   perform maintenance tasks, and disconnect
without logging-off. If an adversary were then to dial-up the maintenance system, access to
the system may be available without the use of a username/password to gain access.




Multi-Level Password Access

The password system may employ a scheme where the level of access granted to a user is
dependent on the username or password that is used. For example, there may be a "super
user" diat has virtually unlimited access to the database and maintenance features while an
"attendant" may only be able to adjust a limited set of database parameters.


If there are multiple levels of access, try to determine if they are user selectable (perhaps by
the "super user") or if they are predetermined by the manufacmrer.         Look for a feature that
allows a higher level user to determine the access level of those below it.       If the levels of
access are adjustable, a user with a low level of access may be able to increase their access
levels by modification of the system database.




Countermeasures

Perhaps the most important task for password security is to make passwords resistant to
cracking by automated tools.      A password generator that creates random passwords can go a
long way in defeating password crackers.        Both free and commercial random password
generation tools     are   available.   Commercial products are available that can generate
passwords of user-selectable length that are very resistant to cracking.




PHYSICAL Security
Physical access to the      PBX hardware grants access to the software, the configuration
database, and all calls going in and out of the PBX.    With easy access to the PBX, practically
any conceivable vulnerability could be exploited by an adversary.

The type of media on which the software and databases are stored is important to a PBX's
physical security. If these are stored on ROM type devices or on an internal hard disk, it is

more difficult to gain access to them than if tiiey are stored on floppy disks or CD-ROM.
ROM devices are mounted on circuit boards and may be soldered in rather than socketed,
makmg removal and replacement difficult.           Likewise, an internal hard disk    is   probably
mounted behind something and is bolted into the chassis making removal and replacement
difficult.   However, floppy disks are easily removable and replaceable.       An adversary with




                                              24
access      to    the   floppy    disks   could   easily     conceal   a   disk   containing   modified
software/ databases, gain access to the PBX, and replace the original disk with the modified
disk.    Similarly,   CD-ROMs can be easily removed and replaced. Since equipment for creating
CD-ROMs is as readily available as for floppy disks, an adversary may find it as equally easy
to copy and modify a       CD-ROM based system.
If the   PBX supports configuration and maintenance via a dumb terminal, the terminal may
be located near the PBX.         If the terminal is not at the same location as the PBX, the terminal
port is still available and could be used by an adversary with a PC acting as a terminal.


Some PBXs may be configured as a central system unit with peripheral units at remote
locations. The remote peripheral units may also support configuration/maintenance via a
dumb terminal and therefore provide the same vulnerabilities as the system unit's terminal.
Also,    all calls   routed through a particular peripheral unit are accessible to someone with
physical access to the peripheral unit.


Attendant Consoles         may offer access to PBX maintenance and configuration software.
Special features may also be available to Attendant Consoles such as Override, Forwarding,
and Conferencing.        If any of these features are available to the user of an Attendant Console,
physical access to it should be restricted to prevent giving an adversary unwanted access to
these features.


Most PBXs have an attached system printer.                 Various information may be output to the
printer including source and destination of calls that are made or received (possibly every
call),   access codes used to access certain features, account or authorization codes used for
making special calls, etc. Access to these printouts could provide information enabling toU
fraud or other compromises.




Countermeasures

Because of the potential for exploitation by intruders, PBX boot disks and utilities must be
given more protection than usually afforded typical office software such as word processing
packages.        Strong physical security should be provided for PBX software.           Audit reports
from the PBX should be shredded or destroyed in the same way as confidential memos or
financial information.




                                                    25
Remote Access
A very useful but potentially vulnerable feature of many PBXs is remote administrative
access. The PBX may allow an administrator to make changes to the system configuration
database through an Attendant Console or from a terminal that is not physically located near
the PBX, perhaps over a dial-in line with a modem.




Remote Access via an Attendant Console

The degree of the vulnerability created by remote access via an Attendant Console is
determined by several      factors:   password    access, physical connection of the       Attendant
Console to the PBX, and         availability   of administrative features through the Attendant
Console.


If there is no password protection or if the password protection is not very good, physical
access to the Attendant Console  becomes very important.    If the Attendant console
connects to the PBX m the same manner as the telephone instruments, an adversary could
connect their own Attendant Console in place of any other instrument to gain access to the
administrative features.




Remote Access via a Terminal

If a   standard dumb terminal can be used for access to the administrative features,           more
opportunities become available for an adversary to gain unwanted access.             A modem could
be connected to a terminal port and an outside dial-in line allowing easy access for the PBX
administrator to do remote configuration and maintenance. Unfortunately, it also gives easy
remote access to an adversary. By setting up remote access in this manner, a poor password
protection system, the existence of "backdoors"         (e.g.,   a special   key sequence that would
bypass required authorization levels), or the use of easy-to-guess passwords would seriously
undermine the security of the system.

Some PBX systems may even support multiple terminal ports. For example, a system with
multiple remote switching components (nodes) may have a terminal port for each node. If
all of the terminal ports were considered to be one access point by the PBX, an unused port

could be used by an adversary to copy the communications of a port that is used. This may
allow an adversary to gain password information that could then be used to gain fuU access
to the system's administrative and maintenance features.          Testing for remote access can be
done as follows:




                                                26
    •       Connect a modem to the administrative or maintenance terminal port. Make
            sure the modem is configured correcdy (baud rate, parity, stop bits, DTE/DCE).
             Also connect the modem to a line that is accessible from the PSN.

    •       Connect a similar modem to a terminal and a line on the PSN.

    •       From the remote terminal,           dial   into   the   administrative/maintenance port.
            Determine the extent of access that is available with this configuration.

   •        While logged into the system, disconnect the line and call back. Determine if the
            login session was automatically terminated after the hang-up. If not, this could
            present a vulnerability similar to a timeout vulnerability.




Countermeasures

   •    Vulnerabilities can be minimized if the Attendant Console connects to the              PBX with
        a different physical and/ or electrical connection than that of the telephone
        instruments.


   •    If the Attendant console connects to the         PBX in the same manner as the telephone
        instruments, vulnerabilities can be reduced by having some sort of line configuration
        feature.   Such   a feature could reduce vulnerabilities           by requiring that   a line   be
        specifically   configured   for   use    with    an    Attendant    Console.    With     such    a

        configuration requirement, a telephone instrument could not be easily replaced with
        an Attendant Console to gain access to the administrative features.




Alarms and Audit Trails
Alarms occur within the PBX for many reasons: hardware failure, thresholds exceeded, etc.
They are usually categorized as either major or minor depending on whether a function is
lost or just operating in a degraded mode. The evaluator must observe these alarms when

attempting to modify the system to exploit a vulnerability and, in some cases, attempt to
defeat them to determine if it is possible to avoid detection of the modification.




                                                   27
Similarly, a system administrator can use these alarms to detect such modifications.      An audit
of the database    may also detect a modification such as a user line enabled for Silent
Monitoring that was not authorized for it. The success of such an audit is only as good as
the amount of configuration management appHed during switch operation.


The   PBX may maintain a history of significant system events to provide a system
administrator a means to determine what activity has occurred on a PBX.          The audit trail or
system log may contain information about various events such as: database changes, power
failures, hardware failures,   card changes, disk changes, etc.   Stored with the event type may
be information such as: time and date of occurrence, type of database change, the user that
made the change, the line on which remote maintenance was performed, etc.

The level of detail stored in the audit trail determines how effective it is in protecting the
PBX from an adversary.         For instance, if a system does not log the time and date of an
event, it may be difficult for an administrator to pinpoint an adversary's actions.     Also, if the
system provides a means of editing, erasing, or replacing the audit trail, an adversary could
use that feature to    mask changes      that   were made.    Such a feature would present         a
vulnerability to the system.


In researching the vulnerabilities in a particular audit trail system, it is useful to determine the
level of detail stored to   determine if an adversary can make changes that go unnoticed or
hide changes that have been made.        You should try various events such as those suggested
above to determine the level of vulnerability allowed in the audit trail system.




                                                28
USER FEATURES
An adversary may be able to exploit vulnerabilities in a system's features and the way in
which featmes can                As with many aspects of information technology, the
                          interact.

proliferation of features that make PBXs easy to configure and use has also led to an
expansion of vulnerabilities.     Many of these are inherent in the features themselves, or arise
out of feature interactions, making them difficult to avoid.     This discussion illustrates some
of these \'xilnerabilities so that administrators will be able to weigh the risks of features
against their benefits.




ATTENDANT CONSOLE
Attendant Consoles typically have more function keys and a larger alphanumeric display that
standard instruments to support the extra features available to the Attendant Console.       The
Attendant Console may be used for access to maintenance and administrative functions.
Some typical features available with an Attendant Console are Override, Forwarding, and
Conferencing.




Attendant Override

Attendant Override is intended to allow the Attendant to break into a busy line to inform a
user of an important incoming call. This feature could be used by an adversary with access
to an Attendant Console to eavesdrop on conversations.       The PBX should provide for some
protection against such uses of Override by providing visual and/or audible warnings that an
Override is in progress. The vulnerability of the Override feature can be tested as foUows:


    •       If necessary, configure the Attendant Console to permit the Attendant to use
            Override.


    •       Place a call between two extensions.

    •       Use the Override feature of the Attendant Console to attempt to break into the
            call in progress.




                                                 29
    •           Note whether both parties can be heard by the Attendant and whether both
                parties can hear the Attendant.   Also look and listen for indications on the target
                instruments that reveal that an Override is in progress.             Audible warnings may
                come in the form of a single tone when the Override is initiated, periodic
                warning tones while Override is active, or a combination of the two.

    •           If any warnings are observed, look to see if there is any way of disabling them via

                the administrative tools.


    •           Try using Override with various combinations of inside and outside Hnes. There
                may be differences in the amount and type of warnings given between inside and
                outside lines.




Attendant Forwarding

A common feature granted to the Attendant              is   the ability to control the forwarding of other
instruments.      An adversary with access to the Attendant Console could use this feature to
forward any instrument's incoming calls to a long distance number.                        The adversary could
then    call   the target instrument   and be forwarded to the long distance number, thereby
gaining free long distance access. This can be tested as foUows:


    •           Use the Attendant Console to forward a different instrument to a long distance
                number.

    •           From another instrument, or from an outside Hne, call the forwarded instrument.
                Note whether or not the long distance call is successful.



An adversary could also use Attendant Forwarding to forward a user's instrument to an
unused or disabled number.         As a result, the normal user of the target instrument may be
denied incoming calls. This can be tested as follows:


   «            Use the Attendant Console to forward a different instrument                       to   another
                extension, perhaps one that is not connected to an instrument.


   •            From another instrument, or from an outside Hne, call the forwarded instrument.
                 Observe the forwarded instrument             to see if 1)   there   is   any indication that
                Forwarding is active, and 2) that an incoming call has been forwarded.                 A visual
                or audible warning may indicate that a           call   has been   made to the forwarded
                instrument and/or forwarded to a different location.




                                                  30
Look for something in the administrative tools that would allow an administrator to disable
the use of Attendant Forwarding to prevent an adversary from exploiting any wilnerabilities
related to Attendant Forwarding.




Attendant Conferencing

Attendants may also have the ability to initiate a conference or join an existing conference.
If this    feature   is   available,   the   potential   exists   for   an Attendant to eavesdrop on a
conversation or add an additional party to a conference without the knowledge of the other
parties.   Potential vulnerabilities can be examined as follows:


    •         Use the Attendant Consdle to initiate a conference between two parties.
              Attempt to leave the Attendant in the conference.

    •         Set    up an ordinary call between two parties.              Attempt to use the Attendant
              Console to join into the call in progress. Also try to add a third party to the call
              in progress.


    •         If any of the above cases are possible, observe the instruments in the conference
              and look for visual or audible indications that a conference is in progress. For
              example, if any of the affected instruments have alphanumeric displays, the
              number of conference members may be displayed. There may also be a single
              tone heard when a member is added to the conference.

    •         Inside and outside lines   may respond differentiy. If the PBX supports both
              digital and analog instruments, there may also be different responses between the

              two line types.




Automatic Call Distribution (ACD)
ACD allows a PBX to be configured so that incoming calls are distributed to the next
available agent or placed on hold until an agent becomes available.              Agents may be grouped
together with each group havmg a supervisor.       The group of supervisors may then even have
a higher-level supervisor.       The number of supervisors and number of levels of supervisors is
dependent on the type of PBX being used.




                                                         31
Most ACD systems grant a supervisor the ability to monitor the calls of the group they are
supervising. The system may allow this monitoring to be done without the knowledge of the
parties being monitored (although laws may require consumers to be notified of monitoring.)


Because of this feature, ACD systems are a potential vulnerability to the users of a PBX.       If

an adversary could gain access to the configuration tools or the system database, they could
set up an   ACD supervisor and an ACD group. The supervisor could then monitor the calls
of any of the users ia the Group.       The ability of an adversary to do this could be tested as
follows:


      •      Using the system configuration tools, create an ACD Agent and assign the Agent
             to a specific line.


      •      Then    create   an   ACD Supervisor that has the newly created Agent in its
             supervisory Group and assign the Supervisor to a specific line.


      •      On the Agent's Hne, place a call to another extension or outside Hne. Alternately,
             place a call from another extension or outside line into the Agent's line.


      •      From the Supervisor's line, access the monitoring feature for the desired Agent.

  .   •      The Silent Monitoring feamre msy allow the Supervisor to monitor both sides of
             the Agent's call without either party having any visual or audible warning.      To
             verify this, look for any indicators or messages     on the target instruments and
             listen for any warning tones.    Also listen to veriiy that the Supervisor cannot be
             heard on either of the target instruments.




Depending on the way the ACD system works, the Agents and Supervisors may need to be
permanendy assigned to specific lines. A more flexible method may also be used where the
Agents and Supervisors are assigned ID codes and can be logged into any Hne. The type of
method used will affect how the first two steps are performed. In either case it is useful to
closely observe the monitored instruments to see if there are any indications that the line is
being used as an    ACD Agent.


Call Forwarding
Call Forwarding is a common feature that allows a user to specify an alternate number to
which calls are to be forwarded based on certain conditions. Common conditions are:
forward all calls, forward only when line is busy, forward when there is no answer after a
certain number of rings, or forward when the line is busy or there is no answer.




                                               32
Forwarding Loops.     One potential problem with Call Forwarding is the ability to set up
forwarding loops.     This occurs   when one line is forwarded through any number of
intermediary lines and back to itself. If such a loop is set up, it may cause the entire system
to crash or stop processing calls. This may require that one of the Hnes in the loop be called
in order to initiate the failure. This can be tested as foUows:


    •       If necessary, configure several Hnes with the ability to use Call Forwarding.


    •       Set up the forwarding loop by forwarding the first line to the second, the second
            to the third, and so on until the last line is reached. Then forward the last line
            back to the first. There may be a forwarding button on the instrument or you
            may have to dial a forwarding Access Code.

    •       Using a Hne that is not in the forwarding loop, call one of the numbers in the
            loop and observe what happens.

    •       Also try using a line that is in the forwarding loop to call another hne in the loop
            and observe what happens.

    •       Try the same type of test using different forwarding methods. Also try with only
            one instrument forwarded directiy to itself.




User Tracking. Another potential use of Call Forwarding by an adversary is to learn the
whereabouts of a PBX user. Many PBXs can use instruments that possess alphanumeric
displays which display messages to users.  These displays may be used by the Call
Forwarding feature to inform a caUer that the called Une has been forwarded to another line.
If any instruments possessing     an alphanumeric display are     available, this feature   can be
tested as follows:


    •       If necessary, configure a Hne with the abiHty to use Call Forwarding.


    •       Forward a Hne to another extension.

    •       From an instrument possessing an alphanumeric display, call the forwarded Hne.
             Observe the display and look for messages that indicate that the dialed Hne has
            been forwarded to another extension.

    •       Repeat after adding other forwards.




                                               33
ACCOUNT Codes/Authorization Codes
Account Codes are normally used for tracking calls made by certain people or projects so
that bills can be charged appropriately. For example, a user may be required to enter an
Account Code prior to placing a long distance call. Depending on the configuration of the
PBX, the Account Code may have to be on a Ust of approved codes for the call to be
successful. If this is the case, the Account Code may be considered an Authori2ation Code
because the user must dial a specific Account Code that is authorized for making long
distance calls.


Another important use         for Access   Codes is   for Dial In   System Access (DISA).   DISA
typically allows a user to dial in to the    PBX system from an outside Hne and gain access to
the normal features of the PBX, almost as if they were a subscriber on the  PBX instead of an
outside caller.     This feature is typically used to allow employees to make long distance calls
from the corporate PBX while out of the office by dialing in to the switch, then entering a
code to make long distance calls.
                                It is easily abused by anyone with the authorization code,

possibly leading to large fraudulent long-distance charges.


Certain Account Codes may also be allocated for changing a user's Class of Service (COS).
When the COS is changed, the user may have access to a different set of features. For
example, most instruments may be assigned a COS that does not permit the use of an
Override feature, but a special COS that is only accessible by using an Account Code may be
created that does permit the use of Override.          By using the Account Code, an adversary
could then gain access to the Override feature.

Since the Account Codes are used for biUing, there are records kept of the calls that are
made    for   the         Account Codes.
                    various                  These records generally include the source,
destination. Account Code, and time/ date of the call. The records may be stored as files on
one of the system's disks, or they may be printed out on a system printer. If the records are
printed, an adversary who is able to gain access to the printer wiU have access not only to
traffic information, but the printed Account Codes.       Once the codes are known, the
adversary wiH be able to use the codes for toll fraud, additional feature access, etc.


Testing for vulnerabiHties with Account Codes may be performed as follows:


    •         AUow the use of Account Codes.

    •         Restrict an instrument so that long-distance calls cannot be made from it.


    •         Assign an Account Code that permits diahng long-distance.

    •         From the restricted instrument, attempt to dial a long distance number. The
              connection should not be made.




                                                34
    •         From the restricted instrument, dial the Account Code set above and then dial
              the long distance number.             This time the connection should be made.       If the
              system has a printer attached, check to see if traffic information for the call is
              printed (possibly including the Account Code).            Also check to see if records are
              kept    on    the     system   that    may 'be    accessible   from   the   maintenance   or
              administration terminal, or the Attendant Console.


    •         Attempt the same procedure as above, but intentionally dial an incorrect
              Account Code. Do this several times with various placements of the first
              incorrect    digit.    This will allow you to determine if the entire code must be
              entered before the code is rejected.           A system that rejects incorrect codes at the
                  wrong digit allows the codes to be guessed more easily. This wiU also allow
              first

              you to determine the length of an Account Code. The documentation may also
              provide information on the Account Code length and whether or not it is
              variable.


    •         Attempt to set up a DISA Hne that requires an Account Code. Dial into the
              DISA Hne and enter a valid Account Code. Attempt to use features such as
              Override, Silent Monitoring, Conferencing, etc. from the DISA Hne. Determine
              how much control is granted by the administrative tools for restricting/ aUowing
              the use of such features.




ACCESS CODES
Access Codes are frequendy assigned to features so that users with simple instruments (e.g.,
traditional analog phones) may have access to these features. In determining vulnerabiHties
due to Access Codes, it is useful to            determine to which features Access Codes can and
cannot be assigned.  For those that can have Access Codes assigned, determine from what
types of lines and mstruments the features are accessible. For example, allowing a Silent
Momtonng feature to be accessed from an outside Hne can be a significant vuLnerabiHty.



SILENT MONITORING
A Silent Monitoring feature may be available that allows a user, given special access to this
feature, to   monitor other caUs without the knowledge of the parties being eavesdropped




                                                        35
upon.   If such a feature exists,   its   use should be limited to as few people as possible to
prevent unauthorized use.     Potential vulnerabilities of a Silent Monitoring feature can be
examined as follows:

    •       Enable Silent Monitoring for an extension or Access Code. Also ensure that any
            Silent Monitoring blocking features are disabled for at least two more extensions.


    •      Place a call between two unblocked extensions.


    •      Use the Silent Monitoring feature to monitor the call in progress. Observe the
            target instruments for visual/ audible warnings that indicate that the call is being
           monitored. Also listen to verify that the Monitoring party cannot be heard.

    •      Look for ways in the administrative tools that Silent Monitoring can be disabled.

    •      Determine how Silent Monitoring is assigned.              If the feature   is   assigned to a
            feature key on an instrument, physical access to such an instrument would grant
           an adversary access to this        feature.   Access to the database would allow the
           adversary to assign such a feature key to most other instruments.


    •      If an   Access Code is assigned to the Silent Monitoring feature, determine the
           minimum and maximum lengths of the codes. Determine if the system allows
           "easy to guess" codes to be used such as aU of 1 digit            (e.g.,   55555), a simple
           sequence (e.g., 12345), the user's extension, etc. If such limitations are not used,
           an adversary could guess the Access Code in a               relatively short time.      Also
           determine how invalid Access Codes are rejected.            If an invalid code is rejected

           when the first incorrect digit is pressed, guessing Access Codes becomes a
           relatively easy task.




CONFERENCING
The common Conferencing feature could allow an adversary to eavesdrop on a conversation
or add an additional party to a conference without the knowledge of the other parties.
Potential vulnerabilities can be examined as follows:


   •       If necessary, permit several instruments the use of the Conference feature.


    •      Set up an ordinary call between           two parties.   Attempt to use the Conference
           feature to add another user to the call in progress.


    •      Once a conference is m progress, attempt to add parties to the conference from
           other instruments besides the conference initiator.




                                                36
     •      If any of the above cases are possible, observe the instruments in the conference
            and look for visual or audible indications that a conference is in progress.   For
            example,   if   any of the affected instruments have alphanumeric displays, the
            number of conference members may be displayed. There may also be an audible
            tone heard when a member is added to the conference.

     •      Different responses   may occur with inside and outside Unes. If the PBX
            supports   both digital and analog instruments, there may also be different
            responses between the two Hne types.

Itmay also be possible to use a maintenance feature to establish a direct connection between
the adversary's line and the conference bridge.      If so, the adversary may become a
permanent member of this bridge and able to monitor any conference call that uses this
particular bridge.


     •      Take the adversary's Line out of service.

     •      Attempt to drrecdy connect this Hne to a Hne assigned to a conference bridge
            (preferably the "last" Hne).


     •      EstabHsh a conference caU using this bridge.

     •      Determine whether the adversary can overhear the conferees or be heard by
            them.

     •      If the adversary cannot hear the conference, try putting the Hne


     •      back in service and observe whether the direct connection is

     •      maintained and whether the conference can now be heard.

Additional steps may be necessary to ensure that the adversary cannot be heard. Using
maintenance and administrative functions, try to detect the adversary's presence on the
bridge.




                                               37
Override (Intrude)
An Override           or Intrude   feature   is   common to many PBXs.             Due   to   its   potential
vulnerability,   it   is   commonly selectable as a feature that can be allowed/disaUowed on a
single instrument or a group of instruments.              Override is intended to allow one user (perhaps
a supervisor) to break into a busy line to inform another user of an important message.                   This
feature could be used by an adversary with access to any instrument permitted to use the
Override feature to eavesdrop on conversations.                    The PBX should provide           for   some
protection against such uses of Override by providing visual and/ or audible warnings that an
Override is in progress. The vulnerability of the Override feature can be tested as follows:


     •        If necessary, configure an instrument to permit the use Override.


     •        Place a call between two other extensions.


,.   •        Use the Override feature on the first instrument to attempt to break in to the call
              in progress.


     •        Note whether both parties can be heard by the Overrider and whether both
              parties can hear the Overrider. Also look and Hsten for indications on the target

                                                                Audible warnings may
              instruments that reveal that an Override is in progress.
              come in the form of a single tone when the Override is initiated, periodic
              warning tones while Override is active, or a combination of the two.

     •.   '
              If any warnings are observed, look to see if there is any way of disabling them via

              the administrative tools.


     •        Try using Override with various combinations of inside and outside lines. There
              may be differences in the amount and type of warnings given between inside and
              outside lines.


     •        Look for any settings in the administrative tools that may disable the use of
              Override on an instrument or group of instruments.




Auto answer
Auto Answer is a common feature that allows an instrument to automatically go off-hook
when called. The instrument is generally equipped with a speaker and microphone in
addition to the handset.        It is intended    for use by people who may frequentiy not have their
hands free to answer an incoming call (e.g., a hospital nursing station).




                                                     38
An adversary coxild use this feature to gain information that would not normally be available.
 For example, an instrument in a conference room could be set up for Auto Answer. Since
the microphone in the room would be live, the adversary could then monitor a meeting
remotely by simply calling that extension.


The degree to which this is possible depends on the specific configuration of the PBX and
instruments evaluated. There is typically some warning given to a user that a call has come
in and been answered by their instrument.         The warning may be in the form of a Hght or
other visual indicator on the instrument, or a ring from the instrument's ringer or speaker, or
a combination.


The audible warning may be easily defeated by turning off the ringer or by turning down the
speaker/ringer volume so that the warning is very quiet. The on/ off or volume control may
be a physical control on the instrument, or a remote control under the configuration of the
system database. If it is remotely controlled, it could be changed without direct access to the
instrument via access to the PBX configuration tools.


The ability of an adversary to make use of Auto Answer could be tested as follows:

    •       If necessary, configure an instrument and Hne for Auto Answer.


    •       From another instrument, call the instrument that has Auto Answer turned on.
            Look for visual warnings on the instrument and Hsten for audible warnings.

    •       Sounds in the room with the Auto Answer instrument should now be heard at
            the calling extension.


    •       If any warnings were noted, look for ways that they can be defeated.   Try turning
            off/ down the ringer and/ or speaker volume.


If any warnings can be defeated, determine if the configuration is stored in the instrument or
the PBX.   Do this by configuring two of the same type instruments in different ways (e.g.,
one instrument set to high volume and one to low).  Then swap the instruments between
lines and note whether the configuration moved with  the instrument or not. If not, it is
likely that the configuration is stored in the   PBX and not the instrument.




                                                  39
Tenanting
Tenanting is a feature commonly used to limit subscriber access to only those subscribers
that belong to the same Tenant group.    would be used in a situation where one company
                                                      It

owns a building or group of buildings and leases out parts of the buildings to other
companies. The building owner may also own a PBX that is used to provide voice/data
service to the tenants of the buildings. The tenants would all share the resources of a
common PBX, but each would Kke to have its own configuration, Attendants, Trunk hnes,
etc.    The Tenanting feature can be used to divide the resources of the PBX in this manner.

The operation of the Tenanting feature will vary from one PBX to another. The PBX may
restrict the Tenant groups so that to each group, there appear to be no other users of the

PBX. Alternately, the PBX may allow for adjustments in the restrictions placed between
groups. Reducing the limitations between groups may be useful, but it introduces a potential
vulnerability into the system.


If   an adversary were to gain access to the                    PBX administrative tools, or access to the
configuration        database,   the    limitations        between Tenant groups could be intentionally
reduced.        The adversary could create an additional Tenant group that has unrestricted access
to all other groups.      Instruments and/ or trunk Hnes could be assigned to the new group that
would allow the adversary to access the instruments and trunk Hnes of the other groups.
Testing for Tenanting vulnerabihties can be done as follows:


       •    '
                 Create three different Tenant groups, each with some instruments and trunk
                 Hnes assigned to it.

       •         If the restrictions     between groups are           adjustable,   maximize the   restrictions

                 between the first two groups and rninirnize the restrictions between the third
                 group and both of the others.

       •         Try to determine the level of restriction between the frcst two groups by placing
                 calls   between groups,        up conferences between groups, combining
                                              setting
                 members of both groups into the same ACD group, using an Override or
                 Intrude feature between groups, and using one group's Attendant Console to
                 access the other group's instruments (forwarding, messages, configuration, etc.).


       •.        Perform tests    as   above between the third group and either of the               first   two
                 groups.


       •         Compare the results of the above tests.              If Tenant restrictions   can be reduced,
                 the Tenanting feature is a potential vulnerabiHty.




                                                           40
VOICE MAIL
The voice mail feature of many PBXs can be a particularly wdnerable feature. This is
because voice mail is typically used to let someone store voice messages at a central location
by calling in from any inside or outside Hne and then retrieve the messages from any inside
or outside hne.    It also grants the general public access to the      PBX system.



Unauthorized Access to Stored Messages

In retrieving messages, the target extension and a password are usually required to gain
access to the messages.       Since the target extension is usually easy to determine, the only
significant restriction to an adversary is the password.         Once an adversary determines a target
user's   password, aU messages left for the target user are accessible to the adversary.          The
adversar}^ could also delete messages from the target user's mailbox to prevent an important
message from getting to the target user.           Some weaknesses of voice mail and answering
machine passwords include the following:

    •        Default and obvious passwords.         Once the target user's extension is known, try
             obvious passwords such as birth dates, other significant dates, and names that
             may be sigmficant to the user. Default passwords (e.g., voice mail box number,
             '9999', '1000', etc.) established at system initiali2ation time may never have been

             changed.

    •        Fixed length passwords.        Check if a password entry can be terminated by a
             special key such as the # or * key.          If not, the passwords may be of fixed length.

             Try to determine if the passwords have a fixed length and, if so, what that length
             is.   This   may be done by entering a known incorrect password slowly while
             listening to determine when the password is rejected.           If such a limitation can be
             found, it reduces the number of random combinations that may be tried before a
             correct password is found.


    •        Non-terminated password entry.               Some systems accept a continuous string of
             digits,   granting entry   when the correct password sequence is entered.              For
             example, if the password       is   '896',   and the sequence '1935896' is entered, the
             password is accepted and access granted. Attackers could use a simple algorithm
             to overlap digit sequences. By not requiring a password entry to be terminated,
             the length of the average sequence needed to guess a four-digit password is
             reduced by a factor of five.




                                                     41
    •       Check to determine if a complete password must be entered before an incorrect
            password is rejected. Do this by entering several correct digits foUowed by an
            incorrect digit. Does the system reject the password as soon as the first incorrect
            digit is entered or must the entire password be entered? If it is rejected on the

            first incorrect digit, sequential guessing becomes much more practical.        For
            example, on such a system that has a fixed password length of four and uses the
            digits 0-9, it would take at most 40 sequential attempts to guess a password. On a

            system that required aU four digits to be entered, at most 10,000 guesses would
            be required.




Denial of Service
An adversary may be able to use a PBX's voice mail system to damage the system in such a
way that other users cannot access the voice mail system or even the entire switch.




Lengthy Messages

The amount of message time that can be stored on a voice mail system is typically limited by
the size and number of hard disks allocated to voice mail. By leaving a user an excessively
long message full of random noise, much if not aU of the total message time can be used.
The system may not be able to deal with a situation Hke this and crash, causing access to
voice mail or the PBX to be limited. The system may impose a per-message time limit. If
this is the case, multiple lengthy messages can still be left and have the same effect.


    •       Try to determine if the switch has a per-message time limit by attempting to
            leave a message so long that it uses all of the available space.   You should use a
            message that consists of some sort of noise since most systems don't record
            silence.


    •       If the entire message space cannot be used in a single message or set of messages
            to a single user, try to determine if there is a per-user message space hmit.   Even
            if general   access to the system cannot be denied in this manner, an individual
            user may still be denied incoming messages by filling the user's message space to
            its limit.




                                             42
Embedding Codes in Messages

Many voice mail systems have playback features such as: Fast Forward, Rewind, Skip, Send a
Copy, etc.   These are typically accessed by pressing various digit keys during playback.          It

may be possible for an adversary to insert these codes into a message during recording in
order to cause undesirable results if they are interpreted during playback.       A few examples
are listed below:


    •        An adversary could send a message to a target user that contains a Rewind code
             at the immediate beginning of the message. When the user plays back the

             message, it immediately rewinds to the beginning of the message and gets stuck
             in a loop playing back that message continuously.


    •        An adversary could send a message to a target user that contains a Send a Copy
             code and an extension for the copy's destination.           If the target user's   same
             extension is used as the destination, this may create a message that is duplicated
             every time   it   is   played, thereby   making a message   that seemingly cannot be
             deleted.  Even if the destination extension cannot be added to the message,
             during playback the system may still enter the Send a Copy mode requiring the
             user to enter a destination. This may create an annoying situation where a user
             must send the message to another user in order to delete it, causing the message
             to "float" around from one user to another until perhaps a system administrator
             can delete it.

    •        Try embedding playback codes into a voice mail message.         If this is possible, try

             ideas similar to the examples above   and determine how the system acts upon
             playback.    The details will depend on the playback options available on each
             specific voice mail system.




Access to Outgoing Lines

    •        Some systems may allow access to the PBX via the Voice Mail system in a similar
             manner as a DISA Hne. If this can be done, an adversary may be able to gain
             access to many of the switch's features.   Depending on which features are
             accessible, toU fraud and theft of information are possible.      Checking for these
             types of vulnerabilities can be done as follows:


    •        Configure an extension for Voice Mail.




                                                      43
    •      From     another extension,       call    the    extension configured above and leave a
           message.       Search through the available menu options for any options that may
           grant access to another line.


    •      Dial in to the Voice Mail system to retrieve the message.                    Search through the
           available menu options for any options that may grant access to another line.


    •      If any access to        another line is possible when leaving or retrieving a message,
           further investigation is required.


    •      After getting access to another line, try using various Access Codes to attempt to
           use    their    associated   switch   features.       Also   try    using Account     Codes or
           Authorization codes to make long distance calls.




PRIVACY Release
Privacy Release is a feature that may be used when more than one instrument shares the
same extension. Frequentiy, instruments can be configured to support multiple extensions
where some or all of the extensions are shared with other instruments. The PBX normally
ensures the security of each line by allowing each extension to be used by only one
instrument at a time.    The Privacy Release feature disables this security by allowing
instruments to connect to an extension that is already in use.                Testing for vulnerabilities in
the Privacy Release feature can be done as follows:


   •       Configure several instruments to have access to the same extension. Each
           instrument may only be able to have a unique primary extension. If this is the
           case, the redundant extensions may be able to be configured using
           programmable line keys on the instruments.

   •       Place a       call   between one of the extensions configured above and another
           extension or outside Hne.


   •       From one of the other extensions configured above, attempt to connect to the
           in-use extension. This should not yet be possible.


   •       Activate the Privacy Release feature on the instrument used in step two.                    This
           time    the     connection    should be         permitted.   Look      for   any visual/audible
           indications on the three instruments that an additional party has connected to the
           call in progress.


   •       Check to see if the Privacy Release is specific to a single instrument or if it is
           global to aU instruments sharing a particular extension by activating Privacy




                                                    44
           Release on one instrument and then using two different instruments to test
           other's ability to use the same extension.


    •      Examine the additional features accessible from the Attendant Console and the
           maintenance/administrative terminal (if applicable). Attempt to determine if a
           feature exists that could allow an adversary to remotely control the status of an
           mstrument's Privacy Release, or if it is only controllable at the instrument itself.

    •      If possible, examine the configuration database to try to determine if the status
           of Privacy Release is stored in the database or in the instrument.    If it is stored in
           the database, an adversary with access to the database could remotely change the
           Privacy Release status of an instrument.




Non-Busy extensions
The Non-Busy Extensions feature typically allows calls to an in-use extension to be added to
a conference with the existing parties when the extension is already off-hook.     An adversary
could configure a target instrument as a Non-Busy Extension and then caU that extension to
eavesdrop on a call in progress. The PBX should provide some form of warning to the user
of the Non-Busy Extension that another party has joined the call in progress.        Testing for
vukierabiLities in the Non-Busy Extensions feature could be done as follows:


   •       Configure an extension as a Non-Busy Extension.

   •       Place a caU between the Non-Busy Extension and another extension or outside
           Une.


   •       From another instrument, place a caU to the Non-Busy extension.             Look and
           listen for visual and audible indications    on the Non-Busy Extension that would
           indicate that another caUer has    been added to the caU in progress.        Types of
           warnings may include messages on an alphanumeric display, conference indicator
           lamps, and warning tones.

   •       Also observe the instrument to which the Non-Busy Extension was                initially

           connected.   Look for the same types of warnings as above.

   •       Try the above procedure using different model instruments as the Non-Busy
           Extension and its initial connection instrument. Also try various combinations




                                              45
            of digital, analog, and outside lines. There may be warnings that are present on
            one instrument or line that are not used on another.




Diagnostics
In addition to the major diagnostic features available at a maintenance terminal or Attendant
Console, many PBXs provide diagnostics that can be initiated from any instrument.         These
diagnostic features may permit a user to make connections through the       PBX by bypassing
normal call processing restrictions.    An adversary with access to these diagnostic features
may be able to deny service or make undetected connections allowing for the monitoring of
other calls. These features are commonly vulnerable when used in combinations with other
feature vulnerabilities. Diagnostic vuLnerabihties may be researched as foUows:


    •       Study the PBX documentation to determine if there are any documented
            diagnostic key sequences. If so, try to exploit them to gain access to other lines
           what would not normally be permitted.

    •      Look for documented restrictions such as extensions that cannot be used. These
           may be used for undocumented diagnostics.




Camp-On
The Camp-On or Call Waiting feature allows a party to call into a busy extension and
indicate to the busy party that someone is caUing. The party wanting to Camp-On may be
required to press a key that activates Camp-On, or Camp-On may be automatically activated
when the caUing party waits on the Ime. When activated, the called party may receive a
visual and/or audible warning indicating that anodier party is Camped-On. Some typical
options available are Forward, Trade to, and Conference with the Camped-On party.


If the caUing party is   brought into a conference, other parties on die call may or may not
receive a visual or audible indication that another party is added to the conference.   By using
this feature, an adversary may be able to   Camp-On to a party in a conference and be brought
into the conference without the knowledge of some of the conference members.             Testing
the Camp-On feature can be performed as follows:


    •       If necessary, enable the   Camp-On feature.

    •      Place a call between one instrument (A) and another (B).




                                              46
    •       From another instrument (C) that is permitted to use Camp-On, call one of the
            other instruments (e.g., A). Camp-On to (A) by waiting or pressing a feature key
            as appropriate.


    •       Instrument (A) should receive an indication of the Camp-On.          Connect to the
            Camped-On party (C).

    •       Try to bring instrument (B) into a conference with (A) and (C) perhaps with a
            Camp-On key, Conference key or FLASH.

    •       Check the instruments for visual or audible indications that a conference is now
            in progress.


    •       Try this procedure with different types of instruments, different lines (analog,
            digital, outside), and   DISA lines.




Dedicated Connections
The use of Dedicated Connections allows connections to be made through the PBX without
need for normal dialing sequences. Dedicated Connections may be used for creating a voice
hot line between two instruments so that when one instrument goes off-hook, the other
immediately rings.   Another example is for a dedicated data line between a subscriber's PC
or terminal and a central server or mainframe.


This can create a vulnerability in which an adversary could make a dedicated connection to a
user's Ime and thereby eavesdrop on that line.      Such changes may be possible if an adversary
has access to the system's software, configuration tools, or database.




FEATURE INTERACTION ATTACKS
With the advent of the digital PBX and its wealth of features, the interaction between
features presents a significant possibility for vulnerabilities. With such a large number of
features available, it becomes difficult for the manufacturer to consider all of the
combinations in which different features may interact. Because of this, vulnerabilities may
exist that allow an adversary unwanted access to the PBX and its instruments.




                                                   47
Since the actual Feature Interaction vxilner abilities found on a specific system depend heavily
on the particular implementation of the features, it would be nearly impossible to describe
every possibility for a generic system. Listed below are a few examples that involve common
features. In testing for Feature Interaction vulnerabilities, one should examine the features

available, look for commonalities       between features (keys, database configuration, etc.), and
then test combinations you suspect may prove vulnerable.              It is   useful to try combinations
that       do not appear   to   have obvious potential for vulnerability because many Feature
Interaction vulnerabilities are results of quirks      m the implementation of the features.
In construction of a COS, Feature Interaction should be given much thought.                 Many of the
feature vulnerabilities discussed involve Feature Interaction since several              COS items or
system options may have to be enabled/ disabled to allow them to occur.




Call Forwarding/Return Call

A possible Feature Interaction vulnerability           is   the use of CaU Forwarding to defeat the
Return CaU feature. Normally, if an adversary were to call a target user (perhaps harassment
via the telephone), after the call is terminated, the target user could use the Return              CaU
feature to caU back the adversary       and/or discover the adversary's extension (the returned
extension may be displayed on an alphanumeric display when the caU is returned).                    The
adversary probably would not want the             target user to discover this information.         The
adversary may be able to hide their extension from the target user by using CaU Forwarding.
The foUowing procedure could be used to test for this vulnerability:

       •        Place a caU from one extension (A) to another (B).      The (B) instrument should
                have an alphanumeric display.

       •        Terminate the caU at both ends.

       •        Attempt to use Return CaU on (B) to caU back (A). Observe the display on (B)
                for information about the extension being caUed back.


       •        If extension information is displayed, the adversary may be able to be located; if
                not, the adversary's caU may stiU be returned.


       •        Forward (A) to another extension (C).

       •        Again place a caU from (A) to (B) and terminate the caU on both ends after (B)
                has picked up.

       •        Attempt to use Return CaU on (B) to caU back (A). Observe the display on (B)
                for information about the extension being caUed back.




                                                  48
     •      If the display   shows (A)'s extension, then Call Forwarding cannot be used to
            mask the adversary's extension from Return Call.

     •      If the display shows (C)'s extension, then Call Forwarding can be used to mask
            the adversary's extension from Retufn Call.


     •      In any case, check to see which extension (A) or (C) is actually called back.   The
            display on (B) may not agree with the extension that is actually called back.




Conference/Call Park

An adversary may be able to use the Call Park feature to intrude into a target user's
Conference. Call Park is typically used to transfer a call to a busy extension.The busy user
isinformed of the parked call and can connect to it if desired.     Conferencing may use the
same key to bring a party into a conference as Call Park uses to connect to a parked call.
This could allow an adversary to park a call onto an extension that is setting up a conference.
When the conference is connected, the parked call may also be connected thereby
unknowingly bringing the adversary into the conference. Testing for this vulnerability can
be done as follows:

     •     Place a call from one extension (A) to another (B).


     •     At (A), place (B) on hold and connect to another extension (C).

     •     Place a call from extension (D) to (E).


     •     Use the Call Park feature to park the incoming call to (E) from (D) onto (A).

     •      Complete (A)'s conference with (B) and (C).

     •     Determine if the parked call onto (A) was brought into the conference with (B)
           and (C). If so, observe (A)'s instrument for information about the number of
           parties in the conference to determine if (A) is given any indication that there is
            an extra party in the conference.




                                                49
Return Call/Camp-On/Caller-ID Blocking

The Return Call, Camp-On, and Caller-ID Blocking features may be combined to cause
unwanted disclosure of telephone numbers. In the example below, caller (A) attempts to call
(B) using CaUer-ID Blocking so as not to disclose (A)'s telephone number. The example

below illustrates how (B) can use Return Call and Camp-On to defeat CaUer-ID Blocking
and discover (A)'s telephone number:

       •    Using CaUer-ID Blocking, place a call from (A) to (B).

       •    Do not answer the call at (B); hang up at (A).

       •    Use Return Call at (B) at to call (A) back.

       •    Answer the call at (A).

       •    Hang up at (B) and immediately use Return Call again to call (A) back a second
            tmie. Since (A) is still off-hook, Camp-On may be invoked (automatically or
            manually). Hang up at (B).


   .
       •    Hang up at (A). The Camp-On takes effect and the switch rings both (A) and
            (B). Caller-ID information may be transmitted to both (A) and (B) at this time,

            disclosing (A)'s telephone number to (B).




COUNTERMEASURES
Because the vulnerabilities described in this section are inherent in feature implementation,
they are difficult to defend against.    In some cases not all features are needed, or may be
turned off without major inconvenience to users.      The most effective strategy is to ensure
that only essential features are activated.




                                              50
COMPUTER
TELEPHONY
One of the biggest new developments in telecommunications is the advent of computer
based telephony systems (CT). As microprocessor speeds have increased and memory prices
dropped, it has become possible to implement a PBX on Htde more than a high-end PC.          A
CT system t}'pically requires only the addition of specialized voice processing boards to an
ordinary office PC with 64 MB of memory, a 3 GB disk, and 300 MHz processor. Some CT
systems use specialized real-time operating systems, but the trend is toward commercial off-
the-shelf systems such as Windows, Linux, or other versions of UNIX.        This development
has brought great reductions in the cost of PBX systems, but         means the possibility of
enormously increased security risks.Two factors in particular can increase exposure: greatiy
expanded integration of telephony with the computer network, and implementation of PBX
functions over operating systems with widely known vulnerabilities.      Some of the features
appearing in new CT systems include:


    •   Voice over IP.

    •   Browser-based call handling and adrninistration.

    •   Integration of IP PBX with legacy PBXs and voicemail systems.


    •   Integration of wireless networks with office network systems.


    •   Virtual private networks.




A complete exposition of the risks of CT systems     is   beyond the scope of this document.
The safest course of action is to assume that most or all of the vulnerabilities described here
apply to CT systems as well as traditional PBXs.         CT systems may also have added
vulnerabilities resulting from well-known weaknesses of    PC operating systems. Future NIST
publications may address CT security issues in more depth.

Appendix B
EXAMPLE SECURITY
POLICY
This policy concerns the digital switching equipment (PBX) configuration, switch data, and
maintenance and adrniriistration functions. This poHcy deals mainly with constraints that are
enforceable through system software manipulation.        PoHcy statements concerning physical,
procedural, or administrative functions are discussed in       Appendix B, BaseHne Security
Controls.


   1.   The switch will route all calls only to their intended authorized destinations.

   2.   The switch wiU prevent unauthorized access to, or tampering with existing
        connections or conversations.

   3.   The switch wiU prevent unauthorized disconnection of caUs and support positive
        disconnection.


   4.   The switch will prevent unauthorized observation or manipulation of the subscriber
        database within the switch memory.

   5.   The switch wiU restrict the use of its resources and features to authorized users and
        subscribers, and will allow only authorized users to modify switch database
        attributes.   The switch will log aU unauthorized user access attempts as well as
        authorized user attempts to do unauthorized functions.

   6.   The switch will implement vaHd identification and authentication procedures for
        physical access to switch hardware and software.


   7.   The switch wiU maintain an audit trail of all security related incidents occurring
        within the switch and the audit information wiU be protected from unauthorized
        access, modification, or destruction.


   8.   The switch will exercise the option of providing control of privileged user access to
        switch functions, with each user only allowed access to its specific functions
        necessary to perform his/her duties.




                                                55
access or use.       Sensitive areas within the    PBX area should be made physically secure during
unattended time using such methods as locked doors, automatic detection devices, and
positive identification          and authentication controls.   Personnel traffic and access to work
areas should be rninirnized to authorized personnel only.            Sensitive areas   (e.g.   switchroom,
file   storage area, and cross-connect terminal) should be placed or positioned in low traffic
areas if traffic can not be controlled.




Operations Security
The objective is to prevent compromise of PBX data.               Applications, patches, supplements,
and test programs are usually needed to test and upgrade the PBX system.                     In this regard,
the    PBX administrator will sometimes need to provide accurate real-time data to the
firmware software developers or programmers. Sensitive data should be properly handled in
a manner befitting its classification.        Proper care should be exercised to iriinirnize exposure
of aU PBX data not needed for the specific problems.                Operations security also involves
protection against unauthorized software or hardware modifications.                    ,It   also   involves
prevention of trouble calls being overlooked, especially the ones that deals directiy to PBX
integrity (e.g. network integrity, memory mismatches, and carrier loss).           All activity initiated
within the    PBX system should be logged and a record kept of this log.                     This log wiU
encompass not only normal daily operational routines but also maintenance and trouble
shooting procedures. If a problem was found and subsequentiy fixed, the steps involved in
the whole procedure should be put in the log. Another objective is to detect unauthorized
system use. Most PBX systems have within its security parameters the method to record, in
memory, items such as system activity logs, journal files, exception reports, software errors,
hardware errors, and operations and measurements parameters. These parameters or files
should be constantiy checked and updated, both manually and automatically. Back-ups of
system configuration and database should be kept and maintained at least daily. Such back-
up files should be kept in a secure area allowing access only by authorized personnel.




MANAGEMENT INITIATED CONTROLS
The     objectives    are   to    prevent loss of security support; prevent disclosure, taking, or
unauthorized use of documents; and prevent inadequate PBX system controls.                       Personnel
accountable for the security of the PBX          should require that these areas are explicitiy defined.
 PBX administration requires the use and filing of reports and other documents which
includes security reviews, audits, PBX traffic reports, subscriber trouble reporting logs, and
maintenance logs. These reports are sensitive and should be protected. Management should
also be aware that there are other          PBX owners/users and that they may have devised other
ways of protecting their investments.




                                                    58
PBX SYSTEM CONTROL
The objectives are to avoid inadequacy of controls, to detect PBX systems and operations
failures,   and to prevent loss, modification, disclosure, or destruction of switch data assets.
Third party vendor supplied PBX support programs                  (e.g.   call   detail   recording systems)
should be used without modification.   Many of these programs have been developed with
the controls and integrity built into them.Any modifications may possibly compromise its
built in capabilities. Whenever changes are to be made in the PBX switch database or
operating system, a review of the change should be made to make sure the new changes are
necessar)'    and wiU not compromise controls and                integrity       of the    switch,    have   an
unanticipated impact on some other part of the system, and/or interfere excessively with the
existing system.      Exception reporting on a periodic basis should be activated to report any
deviations firom the normal activity that may indicate errors or unauthorized acts. Exception
reporting should occur when a specific control is violated, or may constitute a warning of
possible undesirable events.      Exception reporting should be recorded in a recoverable form
within the system and        when required,     displayed to the          PBX security administrator.
Validation of aU inputs to the PBX system should be performed, if it is not aheady automatic
within the PBX, to assist in the assurance of correct and proper data entry.                         Validation
should      include   checking   for   out-of-range    values,   invalid     characters,     and excess      in
upper/lower Limits of possible entry.




PBX SYSTEM Terminal ACCESS Control
The objective is to prevent and avoid PBX system access exposure and control access to the
PBX system database.                                PBX system and its database is an
                             Limiting the access to the
important means of securit}^ It may be possible to control dial-up access to the PBX for
maintenance and administcation purposes. A PBX port interfaced to the PubHc Switched
Telephone Network is exposed to access from telephones anywhere in the world.                            There
may be a trade-off between PBX security and maintenance and administration accessibility.
One alternative is to restrict access to the dial-up line to certain times of the day. Dial-up
modem lines should be password or access code protected. Once access is given, whether
via dial-up    modem Hnes or on-site operations, administration, and maintenance terminals,
care should be taken so that only authorized personnel are allowed access to data assigned to
them.    Users and others who have access to the PBX database should only be allowed to
view, change, or manipulate the data that pertain to their specific job functions.                   Different
types of database read and write privileges should be given to users with different job
functions.     Passwords to the PBX should be kept secret.           It   should be set up so that each
user has a distinct and separate password of their own. This is to keep positive track of their




                                                  59
activities.   Access to the use of all terminals should be restricted to authorized users.     This
can be done by physically securing areas in which the terminals are located.

Password Management - Password control is essential to good security.           Passwords should
be controlled so that they expire after a period of time (e.g. 30 days). This type of password
is   considered reusable and is vulnerable if the password is seen (watched being entered) or
monitored.     To prevent this type of vulnerability, a device to generate a password based on
some information (e.g. time, date, and personal identification number) that is valid for only a
brief period (e.g.   1   minute).   This type of device mitigates the reusable password problems
but can isolate the user if the 'token device' is lost, stolen, broken, or the batteries expire (the
batteries can not be changed by the user).

Building Science Series Disseminates technical information developed at the Institute on building
materials, components, systems, and whole structures. The series presents research results, test methods, and
performance criteria related to the structural and environmental functions and the durability and safety
characteristics of building elements and systems.

Technical Notes   —   Studies or reports which are complete in themselves but restrictive in their treatment of
a subject. Analogous to monographs but not so comprehensive in scope or definitive in treatment of the
subject area. Often serve as a vehicle for final reports of work performed at NIST under the sponsorship of
other government agencies.
Voluntary Product Standards       —Developed under procedures published by         the Department of Commerce
in Part 10, Title 15, of the Codeof Federal Regulations. The standards establish nationally recognized
requirements for products, and provide all concerned interests with a basis for common understanding of
the characteristics of the products. NIST administers this program in support of the efforts of private-sector
standardizing organizations.

Federal Information Processing Standards Publications (FIPS PUB) Publications in this series
collectively constitute the Federal Information Processing Standards Register. The Register serves as the
official source of information in the Federal Government regarding standards issued by NIST pursuant to
the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 as amended. Public Law 89-306 (79 Stat.
1 127), and as implemented by Executive Order 1 1717 (38 FR 12315, dated May       11, 1973) and Part 6 of
Title 15   CFR (Code of Federal Regulations).
NIST Interagency or Internal Reports (NISTIR)          —The    series includes interim or final reports on     work
performed by NIST for outside sponsors (both government and nongovernment). In general, initial
distribution is handled by the sponsor; public distribution is handled by sales through the National Technical
Information Service, Springfield, VA 22161, in hard copy, electronic media, or microfiche form. NISTIR's
may also report results of NIST projects of transitory or limited interest, including those that will be
published subsequently in more comprehensive form.
