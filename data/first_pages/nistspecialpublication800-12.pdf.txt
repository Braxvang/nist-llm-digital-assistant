       NIST, originally founded as the National Bureau of Standards in 1901, works to strengthen U.S. industry's
competitiveness; advance science and engineering; and improve public health, safety, and the environment. One of the
agency's basic functions is to develop, maintain, and retain custody of the national standards of measurement, and
provide the means and methods for comparing standards used in science, engineering, manufacturing, commerce,
industry, and education with the standards adopted or recognized by the Federal Government.
       As an agency of the U.S. Commerce Department's Technology Administration, NIST conducts basic and applied
research in the physical sciences and engineering, and develops measurement techniques, test methods, standards, and
related services.   The Institute does generic and precompetitive work on new and advanced technologies. NIST's
research facilities are located at Gaithersburg,              MD 20899, and at Boulder, CO 80303. Major technical operating units
and their principal activities are listed below. For more information contact the Public Inquiries Desk, 301-975-3058.

NIST would like to thank the many people who assisted with the development of this handbook. For their
initial recommendation that NIST produce a handbook, we thank the members of the Computer System

Security and Privacy Advisory Board, in particular, Robert Courtney, Jr. NIST management officials who
supported this effort include: James Burrows, F. Lynn McNulty, Stuart Katzke, Irene Gilbert, and Dennis
Steinauer.


In addition, special thanks is due those contractors who helped craft the handbook, prepare drafts, teach
classes, and review material:


        Daniel F. Sterne of Trusted Information Systems (TIS, Glenwood, Maryland) served as Project
        Manager for Trusted Information Systems on this project. In addition, many TIS employees
        contributed to the handbook, including: David M. Balenson, Martha A. Branstad, Lisa M. Jaworski,
        Theodore M.P. Lee, Charles P. Pfleeger, Sharon P. Osuna, Diann K. Vechery, Kenneth M. Walker,
        and Thomas J. Winkler-Parenty.


Additional drafters of handbook chapters include:


        Lawrence Bassham EI (NIST), Robert V. Jacobson, International Security Technology, Inc. (New
        York, NY) and John Wack (NIST).


Significant assistance was also received from:


        Lisa Camahan (NIST), James Dray (NIST), Donna Dodson (NIST), the Department of Energy, Irene
        Gilbert (NIST), Elizabeth Greer (NIST), Lawrence Keys (NIST), Elizabeth Lennon (NIST), Joan
        O'Callaghan (Bethesda, Maryland), Dennis Steinauer (NIST), Kibbie Streetman (Oak Ridge National
        Laboratory), and the Tennessee Valley Authority.


Moreover, thanks is extended to the reviewers of draft chapters. While many people assisted, the following
two individuals were especially tireless:


        Robert Courtney, Jr. (RCI) and Steve Lipner (MITRE and TIS).


Other important contributions and comments were received from:


        Members of the Computer System Security and Privacy Advisory Board, and the
        Steering Committee of the Federal Computer Security Program Managers' Forum.


Finally, although space does not allow specific acknowledgement of all the individuals who contributed to
this effort, their assistance was critical to the preparation of this document.

                                                    INTRODUCTION

1.1            Purpose

This handbook provides assistance in securing computer-based resources (including hardware,
software, and information) by explaining important concepts, cost considerations, and
interrelationships of security controls.              It illustrates the benefits of security controls, the major

techniques or approaches for each control, and important related considerations.'


The handbook provides a broad overview of computer security to help readers understand their
computer security needs and develop a sound approach to the selection of appropriate security
controls.         It   does not describe detailed steps necessary to implement a computer security program,
provide detailed implementation procedures for security controls, or give guidance for auditing
the security of specific systems. General references are provided at the end of this chapter, and
references of "how-to" books and articles are provided at the end of each chapter in Parts II, III
and IV.


The purpose of this handbook is not to specify requirements but, rather, to discuss the benefits of
various computer security controls and situations in which their application may be appropriate.
Some requirements for federal systems^ are noted in the text. This document provides advice and
guidance; no penalties are stipulated.


1.2            Intended Audience

The handbook was written primarily for those who have computer security responsibilities and
need assistance understanding basic concepts and techniques. Within the federal government,^
this includes those          who have computer security responsibilities for sensitive systems.




   '
       It is   recognized that the computer security field continues to evolve.   To address changes and new issues, NIST's
Computer Systems Laboratory publishes the CSL Bulletin series. Those bulletins which deal with security issues can be
thought of as supplements to this publication.


   ^   Note that these requirements do not arise from this handbook, but from other sources, such as the Computer
Security Act of 1987.


   ^   In the Computer Security Act of 1987, Congress assigned responsibility to NIST for the preparation of standards

and guidelines for the security of sensitive /(?<iera/ systems, excluding classified and "Warner Amendment" systems
(unclassified intelligence-related), as specified in 10    USC 2315 and 44 USC 3502(2).

                                                                  3

principle that is repeatedly stressed is that only
security measures that are cost-effective
should be implemented.              A familiarity with the principles is fiindamental to understanding the
handbook's philosophical approach to the issue of security.


The next three major sections deal with security controls: Management Controls^ (II), Operational
Controls (III), and Technical Controls (IV). Most controls cross the boundaries between
management, operational, and technical. Each chapter in the three sections provides a basic
explanation of the control; approaches to implementing the control, some cost considerations in
selecting, implementing, and using the control; and selected interdependencies that may exist with

     '    The term management controls is used in a broad sense and encompasses areas that do not fit neatly into
operational or technical controls.


                                                                  4

other controls. Each chapter in this portion of the handbook also provides references that may be
useflil in actual implementation.



•   The Management Controls section addresses security topics that can be characterized as
    managerial. They are techniques and concerns that are normally addressed by management in
    the organization's computer security program. In general, they focus on the management of
    the computer security program and the management of risk within the organization.


•   The Operational Controls section addresses security controls that focus on controls that are,
    broadly speaking, implemented and executed by people (as opposed to systems). These
    controls are put in place to improve the security of a particular system (or group of systems).
    They often require technical or specialized expertise - and often rely upon management
    activities as well as technical controls^



•   The Technical Controls section focuses on security controls that the computer system
    executes. These controls are dependent upon the proper functioning of the system for their
    effectiveness. The implementation of technical controls, however, always requires significant
    operational considerations - and should be consistent with the management of security within
    the organization.


Finally, an example is presented to aid the reader in correlating some of the major topics discussed

in the handbook.    It   describes a hypothetical system and discusses some of the controls that have
been implemented to protect it. This section helps the reader better understand the decisions that
must be made in securing a system, and illustrates the interrelationships among controls.



1.4 Important Terminology


To understand the rest of the handbook, the reader must be familiar with the following key terms
and definitions as used in this handbook. In the handbook, the terms computers and computer
systems are used to refer to the entire spectrum of information technology, including application
and support systems. Other key terms include:


Computer Security: The protection afforded to an automated information system in order to attain
the applicable objectives of preserving the integrity, availability and confidentiality of information
system resources (includes hardware, software, firmware, information/data, and
telecommunications).


Integrity: In lay usage, information has integrity when it is timely, accurate, complete, and
consistent.   However, computers are unable to provide or protect all of these qualities.
Therefore, in the computer security field, integrity is often discussed more narrowly as having two

                                                Location of Selected Security Topics


          Because this handbook is structured to focus on computer security controls, there may be several security
          topics that the reader may have trouble locating. For example, no separate section is devoted to mainframe or
          personal computer security, since the controls discussed in the handbook can be applied (albeit in different
          ways) to various processing platforms and systems. The following may help the reader locate areas of interest
          not readily found in the table of contents:

                                       Security features, including those incorporated into trusted systems, are discussed

          Network Security Network security uses the same basic set of controls as mainframe security or PC security.

                             environment are addressed, as appropriate. For example, secure gateways are discussed as a
                             part of Access Control; transmitting authentication data over insecure networks is discussed
                             in the Identification and Authentication chapter; and the Contingency Planning chapter talks
                             about data conununications contracts.


                                       For the same reason, there is not a separate chapter for PC, LAN, minicomputer, or

denied to authorized users.


Confidentiality:       A requirement that private or confidential information not be disclosed to
unauthorized individuals.


1.5 Legal Foundation for Federal Computer Security Programs


The executive principles discussed in the next chapter explain the need for computer security. In
addition, within the federal government, a number of laws and regulations mandate that agencies
protect their computers, the information they process, and related technology resources (e.g.,
telecommunications).^          The most important are listed below.

•        The Computer Security Act of 1987 requires agencies to identify sensitive systems, conduct
         computer security training, and develop computer security plans.

•        The Federal Information Resources Management Regulation (FIRMR) is the primary
         regulation for the use, management, and acquisition of computer resources in the federal
         government.


•        0MB Circular A-1 30 (specifically Appendix III) requires that federal agencies establish
         security programs containing specified elements.


Note that many more specific requirements, many of which are agency specific, also exist.

Federal managers are responsible for familiarity and compliance with applicable legal
requirements. However, laws and regulations do not normally provide detailed instructions for
protecting computer-related assets. Instead, they specify requirements - such as restricting the
availability of personal data to authorized users.             This handbook aids the reader in developing an
effective, overall security approach and in selecting cost-effective controls to meet such

requirements.

                     ELEMENTS OF COMPUTER SECURITY

This handbook's general approach to computer security is based on eight major elements:


     1.        Computer security should support the mission of the organization.

    2.         Computer security is an integral element of sound management.

    3.         Computer security should be cost-effective.

    4.         Computer security responsibilities and accountability should be made explicit.

    5.         System owners have computer security responsibilities outside their own
               organizations.


    6.         Computer security requires a comprehensive and integrated approach.

    7.         Computer security should be periodically reassessed.

    8.         Computer security is constrained by societal factors.

Familiarity with these elements wiU aid the reader in better understanding how the security
controls (discussed in later sections) support the overall computer security program goals.


2.1 Computer Security Supports the Mission of the Organization.


The purpose of computer security is to protect an organization's valuable resources, such as
information, hardware, and software. Through the selection and application of appropriate
safeguards, security helps the organization's mission by protecting its physical and financial
resources, reputation, legal position, employees, and other tangible and intangible assets.
Unfortunately, security is sometimes viewed as thwarting the mission of the organization by
imposing poorly selected, bothersome rules and procedures on users, managers, and systems.         On
the contrary, well-chosen security rules and procedures do not exist for their own sake - they are
put in place to protect important assets and thereby support the overall organizational mission.


Security, therefore, is a means to an end and not an end in itself   For example, in a private- sector
business, having good security is usually secondary to the need to make a profit.    Security, then,
ought to increase the firm's ability to make a profit. In a public-sector agency, security is usually
secondary to the agency's service provided to citizens. Security, then, ought to help improve the
service provided to the citizen.

cost of security controls.


As with many other resources, the management of information and computers may transcend
organizational boundaries.   When an organization's information and computer systems are linked
with external systems, management's responsibilities also extend beyond the organization. This
may require that management (1) know what general level or type of security is employed on the
external system(s) or (2) seek assurance that the external system provides adequate security for
the using organization's needs.


2.3 Computer Security Should Be Cost-Effective.

The costs and benefits of security should be carefully examined in both monetary and non-
monetary terms to ensure that the cost of controls does not exceed expected benefits.        Security
should be appropriate and proportionate to the value of and degree of reliance on the computer
systems and to the severity, probability and extent of potential harm. Requirements for security
vary, depending upon the particular computer system.


In general, security is a smart business practice.   By investing in security measures, an
organization can reduce the frequency and severity of computer security-related losses. For
example, an organization may estimate that it is experiencing significant losses per year in
inventory through fraudulent manipulation of its computer system. Security measures, such as an
improved access control system, may significantly reduce the loss.


Moreover, a sound security program can thwart hackers and can reduce the frequency of viruses.
Elimination of these kinds of threats can reduce unfavorable publicity as well as increase morale
and productivity.


Security benefits, however, do have both direct and indirect costs. Direct costs include
purchasing, installing, and administering security measures, such as access control software or
fire-suppression systems. Additionally, security measures can sometimes affect system
performance, employee morale, or retraining requirements. All of these have to be considered in
addition to the basic cost of the control itself In many cases, these additional costs may well
exceed the initial cost of the control (as is often seen, for example, in the costs of administering an
access control package). Solutions to security problems should not be chosen if they cost more,
directly or indirectly, than simply tolerating the problem.

2.4 Computer Security Responsibilities and Accountability Should Be Made
Explicit.


The responsibilities and accountability'^ of owners, providers, and users of computer systems and
other parties" concerned with the security of computer systems should be explicit.'^ The
assignment of responsibilities may be internal to an organization or may extend across
organizational boundaries.


Depending on the size of the organization, the program may be large or small, even a collateral
duty of another management official. However, even small organizations can prepare a document
that states organization policy and makes explicit computer security responsibilities. This element
does not specify that individual accountability must be provided for on all systems. For example,
many information dissemination systems do not require user identification and, therefore, cannot
hold users accountable.


2.5 Systems Owners Have Security Responsibilities Outside Their                                                 Own
Organizations.

If a system has external users, its owners have a responsibility to share appropriate knowledge

about the existence and general extent of security measures so that other users can be confident
that the system is adequately secure.               (This does not imply that all systems must meet any
minimum level of security, but does imply that system owners should inform their clients or users
about the nature of the security.)


In addition to sharing information about security, organization managers "should act in a timely,
coordinated manner to prevent and to respond to breaches of security" to help prevent damage to




     The difference between responsibility and accountability is not always clear. In general, responsibility is a broader
     '°


term, defining obligations and expected behavior.  The term implies a proactive stance on the part of the responsible
party and a causal relationship between the responsible party and a given outcome. The term accountability generally
refers to the ability to hold people responsible for their actions. Therefore, people could be responsible for their actions

but not held accountable. For example, an anonymous user on a system is responsible for not compromising security but
cannot be held accountable if a compromise occurs since the action cannot be traced to an individual.


     " The term other parties may include but is not limited to: executive management; programmers; maintenance

providers; information system managers (software managers, operations managers, and network managers); software
development managers; managers charged with security of information systems; and internal and external information
system auditors.


          Implicit is the recognition that people or other entities (such as corporations or governments) have responsibilities
and accountability related to computer systems. These are responsibilities and accountabilities are often shared among
many entities. (Assignment of responsibilities is usually accomplished through the issuance of policy. See Chapter 5.)


                                                                 12

others.'^      However, taking such action should nof jeopardize the security of systems.


2.6 Computer Security Requires a Comprehensive and Integrated
Approach.

Providing effective computer security requires a comprehensive approach that considers a variety
of areas both within and outside of the computer security field. This comprehensive approach
extends throughout the entire information life cycle.


2.6.1 Interdependencies of Security Controls


To work effectively, security controls often depend upon the proper functioning of other controls.
In fact, many such interdependencies exist. If appropriately chosen, managerial, operational, and
technical controls can work together synergistically. On the other hand, without a firm
understanding of the interdependencies of security controls, they can actually undermine one
another. For example, without proper training on how and when to use a virus-detection
package, the user may apply the package incorrectly and, therefore, ineffectively. As a result, the
user may mistakenly believe that their system will always be virus-free and may inadvertently
spread a virus. In reality, these interdependencies are usually more complicated and difficult to
ascertain.


2.6.2 Other Interdependencies


The effectiveness of security controls also depends on such factors as system management, legal
issues, quality assurance, and internal and management controls. Computer security needs to
work with traditional security disciplines including physical and personnel security. Many other
important interdependencies exist that are often unique to the organization or system
environment. Managers should recognize how computer security relates to other areas of systems
and organizational management.


2.7 Computer Security Should Be Periodically Reassessed.


Computers and the environments they operate in are dynamic. System technology and users, data
and information in the systems, risks associated with the system and, therefore, security
requirements are ever-changing.        Many types of changes affect system security: technological
developments (whether adopted by the system owner or available for use by others); connecting
to external networks; a change in the value or use of information; or the emergence of a new
threat.

/.   Introduction and Overview




In addition, security is never perfect when a system is implemented. System users and operators
discover new ways to intentionally or unintentionally bypass or subvert security. Changes in the
system or the environment can create new vulnerabilities.    Strict adherence to procedures is rare,

and procedures become outdated over time. All of these issues make it necessary to reassess the
security of computer systems.



2.8 Computer Security is Constrained by Societal Factors.

The ability of security to support the mission of the organization(s) may be limited by various
factors, such as social issues.   For example, security and workplace privacy can conflict.
Commonly, security is implemented on a computer system by identifying users and tracking their
actions. However, expectations of privacy vary and can be violated by some security measures.
(In some cases, privacy may be mandated by law.)


Although privacy is an extremely important societal issue, it is not the only one. The flow of
information, especially between a government and its citizens, is another situation where security
may need to be modified to support a societal goal. In addition, some authentication measures,
such as retinal scanning, may be considered invasive in some environments and cultures.


The underlying idea is that security measures should be selected and implemented with a
recognition of the rights and legitimate interests of others. This many involve balancing the
security needs of information owners and users with societal goals. However, rules and
expectations change with regard to the appropriate use of security controls. These changes may
either increase or decrease security.


The relationship between security and societal norms is not necessarily antagonistic. Security can
enhance the access and flow of data and information by providing more accurate and reliable
information and greater availability of systems. Security can also increase the privacy afforded to
an individual or help achieve other goals set by society.

                                ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

One fundamental issue that arises in discussions of computer security is: "Whose responsibility is
it?" Of course, on a basic level the answer is simple: computer security is the responsibility of

everyone who can affect the security of a computer system. However, the specific duties and
responsibilities of various individuals and organizational entities vary considerably.


This chapter presents a brief overview of roles and responsibilities of the various officials and
organizational offices typically involved with computer security.''*                 They include the following
groups:'^


      •            senior management
      •            program/functional managers/application owners,
      •            computer security management,
      •            technology providers,
      •            supporting organizations, and
      •            users.


This chapter is intended to give the reader a basic familiarity with the major organizational
elements that play a role in computer security.             It does not describe all responsibilities of each in

detail, nor will this chapter apply uniformly to all organizations.                  Organizations, like individuals,
have unique characteristics, and no single template can apply to all. Smaller organizations, in
particular, are not likely to have separate individuals performing many of the fiinctions described
in this chapter.    Even at some larger organizations, some of the duties described in this chapter
may not be staffed with full-time personnel. What is important is that these functions be handled
in a manner appropriate for the organization.



As with the rest of the handbook, this chapter is not intended to be used as an audit guide.




     Note that this includes groups within the organization; outside organizations (e.g., NIST and 0MB) are not
included in this chapter.


   " These categories are generalizations used to help aid the reader; if they are not applicable to the reader's particular
environment, they can be safely ignored. While all these categories may not exist in a particular organization, the
functionality implied by them will often still be present. Also, some organizations may fall into more than one category.
For example, the personnel office both supports the computer security program (e.g., by keeping track of employee
departures) and is also a user of computer services.

Ultimately, responsibility for the success of an
organization lies with its senior managers.
They establish the organization's computer
security program and its overall program goals, objectives, and priorities in order to support the
mission of the organization. Ultimately, the head of the organization is responsible for ensuring
that adequate resources are applied to the program and that it is successful.                 Senior managers are
also responsible for setting a good example for their employees by following all applicable
security practices.



3.2 Computer Security Management

The Computer Security Program Manager (and support staff) directs the organization's day-to-
day management of its computer security program. This individual is also responsible for
coordinating all security-related interactions among organizational elements involved in the
computer security program - as well as those external to the organization.


3.3 Program and Functional Managers/Application Owners


Program or Functional Managers/Application Owners are responsible for a program or function
(e.g., procurement or payroll) including the supporting computer system.'^                    Their responsibilities
include providing for appropriate security, including management, operational, and technical
controls.    These officials are usually assisted by a technical staff that oversees the actual workings
of the system. This kind of support is no different for other staff members who work on other
program implementation issues.

Also, the program or functional manager/application owner is often aided by a Security Officer
(frequently dedicated to that system, particularly if it is large or critical to the organization) in
developing and implementing security requirements.


3.4 Technology Providers


System Management/System Administrators. These personnel are the managers and technicians
who design and operate computer systems. They are responsible for implementing technical
security on computer systems and for being familiar with security technology that relates to their
system.     They also need to ensure the continuity of their services to meet the needs of functional



      The functional manager/application owner may or may not be the data owner.     Particularly within the government,
the concept of the data owner may not be the most appropriate, since citizens ultimately own the data.

Quality Assurance.       Many organizations have established a quality assurance program to improve
the products and services they provide to their customers.    The quality officer should have a
working knowledge of computer security and how it can be used to improve the quality of the
program, for example, by improving the integrity of computer-based information, the availability
of services, and the confidentiality of customer information, as appropriate.


Procurement. The procurement office is responsible for ensuring that organizational
procurements have been reviewed by appropriate officials. The procurement office cannot be
responsible for ensuring that goods and services meet computer security expectations, because it
lacks the technical expertise. Nevertheless, this office should be knowledgeable about computer
security standards and should bring them to the attention of those requesting such technology.


Training Office.   An organization has to decide whether the primary responsibility for training
users, operators, and managers in computer security rests with the training office or the computer
security program office.     In either case, the two organizations should work together to develop an
effective training program.

considered the "consumers" of the applications. Sometimes they directly interact with the system
(e.g., to generate a report on screen) - in which case they are also users of the system (as

discussed below). Other times, they may only read computer-prepared reports or only be briefed
on such material. Some users of information may be very far removed from the computer system.
Users of information are responsible for letting the functional mangers/application owners (or
their representatives) know what their needs are for the protection of information, especially for

its integrity and availability.



Users of Systems. Individuals who directly use computer systems (typically via a keyboard) are
responsible for following security procedures, for reporting security problems, and for attending
required computer security and functional training.

                         COMMON THREATS: A BRIEF OVERVIEW

Computer systems are vulnerable to many threats that can inflict various types of damage
resulting in significant losses. This damage can range from errors harming database integrity to
fires destroying entire computer centers.              Losses can stem, for example, from the actions of
supposedly trusted employees defrauding a system, from outside hackers, or from careless data
entry clerks. Precision in estimating computer security-related losses is not possible because
many losses are never discovered, and others are "swept under the carpet" to avoid unfavorable
publicity. The effects of various threats varies considerably: some affect the confidentiality or
integrity of data while others affect the availability of a system.


This chapter presents a broad view of the risky environment in which systems operate today. The
threats and associated losses presented in this chapter were selected based on their prevalence and
significance in the current computing environment and their expected growth. This list is not
exhaustive, and some threats may combine elements from more than one area.                                  This overview of
many of today's common threats may prove useful to organizations studying their own threat
environments; however, the perspective of this chapter is very broad. Thus, threats against
particular systems could be quite different from those discussed here.^°


To control the risks of operating an information system, managers and users need to know the
vulnerabilities of the system and the threats that may exploit them. Knowledge of the threat^'
environment allows the system manager to implement the most cost-effective security measures.
In some cases, managers may find it more cost-effective to simply tolerate the expected losses.
Such decisions should be based on the results of a risk analysis. (See Chapter 7.)




   " As is true for this publication as a whole, this chapter does not address threats to national security systems, which
fall outside of NIST's purview.    The term "national security systems" is defined in National Security Directive 42
(7/5/90) as being "those telecommunications and information systems operated by the U.S. Government, its contractors,
or agents, that contain classified information or, as set forth in 10 U.S.C. 2315, that involves intelligence activities,
involves cryptologic activities related to national security, involves command and control of military forces, involves
equipment that is an integral part of a weapon or weapon system, or involves equipment that is critical to the direct
fulfillment of military or intelligence missions."

/.   Introduction and Overview




4.1 Errors and Omissions


Errors and omissions are an important threat to data and system integrity. These errors are
caused not only by data entry clerks processing hundreds of transactions per day, but also by all
types of users who create and edit data.           Many programs, especially those designed by users for
personal computers, lack quality control measures. However, even the most sophisticated
programs cannot detect all types of input errors or omissions.                 A sound awareness and training
program can help an organization reduce the number and severity of errors and omissions.

Users, data entry clerks, system operators, and programmers frequently make errors that
contribute directly or indirectly to security problems. In some cases, the error is the threat, such
as a data entry error or a programming error that crashes a system.                   In other cases, the errors
create vulnerabilities. Errors can occur during all phases of the systems life cycle.                    A long-term
survey of computer-related economic losses conducted by Robert Courtney, a computer security
consultant and former member of the Computer System Security and Privacy Advisory Board,
found that 65 percent of losses to organizations were the result of errors and omissions.^^ This
figure was relatively consistent between both private and public sector organizations.


Programming and development errors, often called "bugs," can range in severity from benign to
catastrophic. In a 1989 study for the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology,
entitled Bugs in the Program, the staff of the Subcommittee on Investigations and Oversight
summarized the scope and severity of this problem in terms of government systems as follows:

       As expenditures grow, so do concerns about the reliability, cost and accuracy of ever-larger
       and more complex software systems. These concerns are heightened as computers perform
       more critical tasks, where mistakes can cause financial turmoil, accidents, or in extreme
       cases, death.^^


Since the study's publication, the software industry has changed considerably, with measurable
improvements in software quality. Yet software "horror stories" still abound, and the basic
principles and problems analyzed in the report remain the same.                   While there have been great

18. The categories into which the problems were placed and the percentages of economic loss attributed to each were:

65%, errors and omissions; 13%, dishonest employees; 6%, disgruntled employees; 8%, loss of supporting
infrastructure, including power, communications, water, sewer, transportation, fire, flood, civil unrest, and strikes; 5%,
water, not related to fires and floods; less than 3%, outsiders, including viruses, espionage, dissidents, and malcontents
of various kinds, and former employees who have been away for more than six weeks.

improvements in program quality, as reflected in decreasing errors per 1000 lines of code, the
concurrent growth in program size often seriously diminishes the beneficial effects of these
program quality enhancements.

Installation and maintenance errors are another source of security problems.                  For example, an
audit by the President's Council for Integrity and Efficiency (PCIE) in 1988 found that every one
of the ten mainframe computer sites studied had installation and maintenance errors that
introduced significant security vulnerabilities.^'*


4.2 Fraud and Theft

Computer systems can be exploited for both fraud and theft both by "automating" traditional
methods of fraud and by using new methods. For example, individuals may use a computer to
skim small amounts of money from a large number of financial accounts, assuming that small
discrepancies may not be investigated. Financial systems are not the only ones at risk. Systems
that control access to any resource are targets (e.g., time and attendance systems, inventory
systems, school grading systems, and long-distance telephone systems).


Computer fraud and theft can be committed by insiders or outsiders.                   Insiders (i.e., authorized
users of a system) are responsible for the majority of fraud.           A 1993 InformationWeek/Emst and
Young study found that 90 percent of Chief Information Officers viewed employees "who do not
need to know" information as threats.'^^ The U.S. Department of Justice's Computer Crime Unit
contends that "insiders constitute the greatest threat to computer systems. "^^ Since insiders have
both access to and familiarity with the victim computer system (including what resources it
controls and its flaws), authorized system users are in a better position to commit crimes. Insiders
can be both general users (such as clerks) or technical staff members.                An organization's former
employees, with their knowledge of an organization's operations, may also pose a threat,
particularly if their access is not terminated promptly.


In addition to the use of technology to commit fraud and theft, computer hardware and software
may be vulnerable to theft. For example, one study conducted by Safe ware Insurance found that
$882 million worth of personal computers was lost due to theft in 1992.^^

4.3 Employee Sabotage
                                                               Common examples of computer-related employee
                                                               sabotage include:
Employees are most familiar with their
employer's computers and applications,

who may retain potential system access (e.g.,                  •        changing data.
if system accounts are not deleted in a timely

manner).         The number of incidents of
employee sabotage is believed to be much
smaller than the instances of theft, but the cost of such incidents can be quite high.


Martin Sprouse, author of Sabotage in the American Workplace, reported that the motivation for
sabotage can range from altruism to revenge:


       As long as people feel cheated, bored, harassed, endangered, or betrayed at work, sabotage
       will be used as a direct method of achieving job satisfaction - the kind that never has to get

       the bosses' approval.^^


4.4 Loss of Physical and Infrastructure Support

The loss of supporting infrastructure includes power failures (outages, spikes, and brownouts),
loss of communications, water outages and leaks, sewer problems, lack of transportation services,
fire, flood, civil unrest,   and strikes. These losses include such dramatic events as the explosion at
the World Trade Center and the Chicago tunnel flood, as well as more common events, such as
broken water pipes.       Many of these issues are covered in Chapter 15. A loss of infrastructure
often results in system downtime, sometimes in unexpected ways. For example, employees may
not be able to get to work during a winter storm, although the computer system may be
fianctional.



4.5 Malicious Hackers

The term malicious hackers, sometimes called crackers, refers to those who break into computers

Francisco, CA: Pressure Drop Press, 1992), p. 7.

without authorization. They can include both outsiders and insiders.                  Much of the rise of hacker
activity is often attributed to increases in connectivity in both government and industry.                 One 1992
study of a particular Internet site (i.e., one computer system) found that hackers attempted to
break in at least once every other day.^°


The hacker threat should be considered in terms of past and potential ftiture damage. Although
current losses due to hacker attacks are significantly smaller than losses due to insider theft and
sabotage, the hacker problem is widespread and serious.              One example of malicious hacker
activity is that directed against the public telephone system.



Studies by the National Research Council and the National Security Telecommunications
Advisory Committee show that hacker activity is not limited to toll fraud.                It also   includes the
ability to break into telecommunications systems (such as switches), resulting in the degradation

or disruption of system availability. While unable to reach a conclusion about the degree of threat
or risk, these studies underscore the abUity of hackers to cause serious damage.^''


The hacker threat often receives more attention than more common and dangerous threats. The
U.S. Department of Justice's Computer Crime Unit suggests three reasons for this.


        •           First, the hacker threat is a more recently encountered threat.           Organizations have
                    always had to worry about the actions of their own employees and could use
                    disciplinary measures to reduce that threat.       However, these measures are
                    ineffective against outsiders who are not subject to the rules and regulations of the
                    employer.


        •           Second, organizations do not know the purposes of a hacker - some hackers
                    browse, some steal, some damage. This inability to identify purposes can suggest
                    that hacker attacks have no limitations.


        •           Third, hacker attacks make people feel vulnerable, particularly because their
                    identity is unknown.    For example, suppose a painter is hired to paint a house and,
                    once inside, steals a piece of jewelry. Other homeowners in the neighborhood may
                    not feel threatened by this crime and will protect themselves by not doing business
                    with that painter. But if a burglar breaks into the same house and steals the same

4.6 Industrial Espionage

Industrial espionage is the act of gathering proprietary data from private companies or the
government^'* for the purpose of aiding another company(ies). Industrial espionage can be
perpetrated either by companies seeking to improve their competitive advantage or by
governments seeking to aid their domestic industries. Foreign industrial espionage carried out by
a government is often referred to as economic espionage. Since information is processed and
stored on computer systems, computer security can help protect against such threats; it can do
little,    however, to reduce the threat of authorized employees selling that information.


Industrial espionage is on the rise.             A 1992 study sponsored by the American Society for
Industrial Security (ASIS) found that proprietary business information theft had increased 260
percent since 1985. The data indicated 30 percent of the reported losses in 1991 and 1992 had
foreign involvement. The study also found that 58 percent of thefts were perpetrated by current
or former employees.   The three most damaging types of stolen information were pricing
information, manufacturing process information, and product development and specification
information. Other types of information stolen included customer lists, basic research, sales data,
personnel data, compensation data, cost data, proposals, and strategic plans.


Within the area of economic espionage, the Central Intelligence Agency has stated that the main
objective is obtaining information related to technology, but that information on U.S. Government
policy deliberations concerning foreign affairs and information on commodities, interest rates, and
other economic factors is also a target.                 The Federal Bureau of Investigation concurs that
technology-related information is the main target, but also lists corporate proprietary information,
such as negotiating positions and other contracting data, as a target.

4.7 Malicious Code

Malicious code refers to viruses, worms, Trojan horses, logic bombs, and other "uninvited"
software.   Sometimes mistakenly associated only with personal computers, malicious code can
attack other platforms.


A 1993 study of viruses found that
while the number of known viruses is
increasing exponentially, the number of                                   Malicious Software: A Few Key Terms

concluded that viruses are becoming                   Virus:    A code segment that replicates by attaching copies of itself to
more prevalent, but only "gradually."                 existing executables.  The new copy of the virus is executed when a user
                                                      executes the new host program.    The virus may include an additional

4.8 Foreign Government Espionage

addition to possible economic espionage, foreign intelligence services may target unclassified

systems to further their intelligence missions.         Some unclassified information that may be of
interest includes travel plans of senior officials, civil defense and emergency preparedness,
manufacturing technologies, satellite data, personnel and payroll data, and law enforcement,
investigative, and security files.      Guidance should be sought from the cognizant security office
regarding such threats.


4.9 Threats to Personal Privacy

The accumulation of vast amounts of electronic information about individuals by governments,
credit bureaus, and private companies, combined with the ability of computers to monitor,
process, and aggregate large amounts of information about individuals have created a threat to
individual privacy.      The possibility that all of this information and technology may be able to be
linked together has arisen as a specter of the modern information age. This is often referred to as
"Big Brother."      To guard against such intrusion. Congress has enacted legislation, over the years,
such as the Privacy Act of 1974 and the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988,
which defines the boundaries of the legitimate uses of personal information collected by the
government.


The threat to personal privacy arises from many sources.             In several cases federal and state
employees have sold personal information to private investigators or other "information brokers."
One such case was uncovered in 1992 when the Justice Department announced the arrest of over
two dozen individuals engaged in buying and selling information from Social Security
Administration (SSA) computer files.'*^ During the investigation, auditors learned that SSA
employees had unrestricted access to over 130 million employment records. Another
investigation found that 5 percent of the employees in one region of the IRS had browsed through
tax records of friends, relatives, and celebrities.'*^      Some of the employees used the information to
create fraudulent tax refunds, but many were acting simply out of curiosity.


As more of these cases come to light, many individuals are becoming increasingly concerned
about threats to their personal privacy. A July 1993 special report in MacWorld cited polling data
taken by Louis Harris and Associates showing that in 1970 only 33 percent of respondents were
concerned about personal privacy.          By 1990, that number had jumped to 79 percent.'*'*

While the magnitude and cost to society of the personal privacy threat are difficult to gauge, it is

                                 COMPUTER SECURITY POLICY

In discussions of computer security, the term policy has more than one meaning.'*^ Policy is
senior management's directives to create a computer security program, establish its goals, and
assign responsibilities.      The term policy is also used to refer to the specific security rules for
particular systems.'*^ Additionally, policy may refer to entirely different matters, such as the
specific managerial decisions setting an organization's e-mail privacy policy or fax security policy.


In this chapter the term computer security
policy is defined as the "documentation of                         Policy means different things to different people.   The
computer security decisions" - which covers                        term "poUcy" is used in this chapter in a broad

competing objectives, and organizational
strategy related to protecting both technical and information resources as well as guiding
employee behavior. Managers at all levels make choices that can result in policy, with the scope
of the policy's applicability varying according to the scope of the manager's authority. In this
chapter we use the term policy in a broad manner to encompass all of the types of policy
described above - regardless of the level of manager who sets the particular policy.


Managerial decisions on computer security issues vary greatly.                    To differentiate among various
kinds of policy, this chapter categorizes them into three basic types:


      •            Program policy is used to create an organization's computer security program.

      •            Issue-specific policies address specific issues of concern to the organization.




     There are variations in the use of the term policy, as noted in a 1994 Office of Technology Assessment report,
Information Security and Privacy in Network Environments: "Security Policy refers here to the statements made by
organizations, corporations, and agencies to establish overall policy on information access and safeguards. Another
meaning comes from the Defense community and refers to the rules relating clearances of users to classification of
information. In another usage, security policies are used to refine and implement the broader, organizational security
policy...."



      These are the kind of policies that computer security experts refer to as being enforced by the system's technical
controls as well as its management and operational controls.


      In general, policy is set by a manager.   However, in some cases, it may be set by a group (e.g., an
intraorganizational policy board).



                                                              33
//.   Management Controls



      •            System- specific policies focus on decisions taken by management to protect a
                   particular system."*^


Procedures, standards, and guidelines are used to describe how these policies will be implemented
within an organization. (See following box.)




                                                  Tools to Implement Policy:
                                            Standards, Guidelines, and Procedures


       Because policy is written at a broad level, organizations also develop standards, guidelines, and procedures that
       offer users, managers, and others a clearer approach to implementing policy and meeting organizational goals.
       Standards and guidelines specify technologies and methodologies to be used to secure systems. Procedures are
       yet more detailed steps to be followed to accomplish particular security-related tasks. Standards, guidelines,
       and procedures may be promulgated throughout an organization via handbooks, regulations, or manuals.


       Organizational standards (not to be conftised with American National Standards, FEPS, Federal Standards, or
       other national or international standards) specify uniform use of specific technologies, parameters, or
       procedures when such uniform use will benefit an organization. Standardization of organizationwide
       identification badges is a typical example, providing ease of employee mobility and automation of entry/exit
       systems. Standards are normally compulsory within an organization.


       Guidelines assist users, systems personnel, and others in effectively securing their systems. The nature of
       guidelines, however, immediately recognizes that systems vary considerably, and imposition of standards is not
       always achievable, appropriate, or cost-effective. For example, an organizational guideline may be used to
       help develop system-specific standard procedures. Guidelines are often used to help ensure that specific
       security measures are not overlooked, although they can be implemented, and correctly so, in more than one
       way.


       Procedures normally assist in complying with applicable security policies, standards, and guidelines. They are
       detailed steps to be followed by users, system operations personnel, or others to accomplish a particular task
       (e.g., preparing   new user accounts and assigning the appropriate privileges).

       Some organizations issue overall computer security manuals, regulations, handbooks, or similar documents.
       These may mix policy, guidelines, standards, and procedures, since diey are closely linked. While manuals and
       regulations can serve as important tools, it is often useful if they clearly distinguish between policy and its
       implementation. This can help in promoting flexibility and cost-effectiveness by offering alternative
       implementation approaches to achieving policy goals.




Familiarity with various types and components of policy will aid managers in addressing computer
security issues important to the organization. Effective policies ultimately result in the

These types of policy are described to aid the reader's understanding/'                   It is not important    that
one categorizes specific organizational policies into these three categories; it is more important to
focus on the functions of each.


5.1 Program Policy


A management official, normally the head of the organization or the senior administration official,
issues program policy to establish (or restructure) the organization's computer security program
and its basic structure. This high-level policy defines the purpose of the program and its scope
within the organization; assigns responsibilities (to the computer security organization) for direct
program implementation, as well as other responsibilities to related offices (such as the
Information Resources Management [IRM] organization); and addresses compliance issues.


Program policy sets organizational strategic directions for security and assigns resources for its
implementation.


5.1.1 Basic Components of Program Policy


Components of program policy should address:

Purpose. Program policy normally includes a statement describing why the program is being
established.   This may include defining the goals of the program. Security-related needs, such as
integrity, availability, and confidentiality, can form the basis of organizational goals established in

policy.   For instance, in an organization responsible for maintaining large mission-critical
databases, reduction in errors, data loss, data corruption, and recovery might be specifically
stressed.   In an organization responsible for maintaining confidential personal data, however,
goals might emphasize stronger protection against unauthorized disclosure.


Scope. Program policy should be clear as to which resources ~ including facilities, hardware, and
software, information, and personnel — the computer security program covers. In many cases, the
program will encompass aU systems and organizational personnel, but this is not always true. In
some instances, it may be appropriate for an organization's computer security program to be more
limited in scope.




     No standard terms exist for various types of policies. These terms are used to aid the reader's understanding of this
topic; no impHcation of their widespread usage is intended.



                                                              35

Responsibilities. Once the computer security
program is established, its management is                           Program policy establishes the security program and

                                                                    responsibilities.
existing office.'°


The responsibilities of officials and offices
throughout the organization also need to be addressed, including line managers, applications
owners, users, and the data processing or IRM organizations. This section of the policy
statement, for example, would distinguish between the responsibilities of computer services
providers and those of the managers of applications using the provided services.                          The policy could
also establish operational security offices for major systems, particularly those at high risk or most
critical to organizational operations.            It also can serve as the basis for establishing          employee
accountability.


At the program level, responsibilities should be specifically assigned to those organizational
elements and officials responsible for the implementation and continuity of the computer security
policy.^'


Compliance. Program policy typically will address two compliance issues:


        1.           General compliance to ensure meeting the requirements to establish a program and
                     the responsibilities assigned therein to various organizational components. Often
                     an oversight office (e.g., the Inspector General) is assigned responsibility for
                     monitoring compliance, including how well the organization is implementing
                     management's priorities for the program.


        2.           The use of specified penalties and disciplinary actions. Since the security policy is
                     a high-level document, specific penalties for various infractions are normally not
                     detailed here; instead, the policy may authorize the creation of compliance
                     structures that include violations and specific disciplinary action(s).^^




        The program management structure should be organized to best address the goals of the program and respond to
the particular operating and risk environment of the organization. Important issues for the structure of the computer
security program include management and coordination of security-related resources, interaction with diverse
communities, and the ability to relay issues of concern, trade-offs, and recommended actions to upper management. (See
Chapter 6, Computer Security Program Management.)


        In assigning responsibilities, it is necessary to be specific; such assignments as "computer security is everyone's
responsibility," in reality, mean no one has specific responsibility.


      " The need to obtain guidance from appropriate legal counsel is critical when addressing issues involving penalties
and disciplinary action for individuals. The policy does not need to restate penalties already provided for by law,
although they can be listed if the policy will also be used as an awareness or training document.


                                                               36

Those developing compliance policy should remember that violations of policy can be
unintentional on the part of employees. For example, nonconformance can often be due to a lack
of knowledge or training.


5.2 Issue-Specific Policy

Whereas program policy is intended to address the broad organizationwide computer security
program, issue-specific policies are developed to focus on areas of current relevance and concern
(and sometimes controversy) to an organization. Management may find it appropriate, for
example, to issue a policy on how the organization wlU approach contingency planning
(centralized vs. decentralized) or the use of a particular methodology for managing risk to
systems. A policy could also be issued, for example, on the appropriate use of a cutting-edge
technology (whose security vulnerabilities are still largely unknown) within the organization.
Issue-specific policies may also be appropriate when new issues arise, such as when implementing
a recently passed law requiring additional protection of particular information.                     Program policy is
usually broad enough that it does not require much modification over time, whereas issue-specific
policies are likely to require more frequent revision as changes in technology and related factors
take place.


In general, for issue- specific and system-specific policy, the issuer is a senior official; the more
global, controversial, or resource-intensive, the more senior the issuer.


5.2.1 Example Topics for Issue-Specific

There are many areas for which issue-specific
policy may be appropriate.        Two examples are
explained below.


Internet Access.      Many organizations are looking at the Internet as a means for expanding their
research opportunities and communications. Unquestionably, connecting to the Internet yields
many benefits - and some disadvantages. Some issues an Internet access policy may address
include who will have access, which types of systems may be connected to the network, what
types of information may be transmitted via the network, requirements for user authentication for
Internet-connected systems, and the use of firewalls and secure gateways.




     Examples presented in this section are not all-inclusive nor meant to imply that policies in each of these areas are
required by all organizations.

offensive e-mail, or disclosing organizational
secrets.)   On the other hand, users may have
an expectation of privacy, similar to that accorded U.S. mail. Policy in this area addresses what
level of privacy will be accorded e-mail and the circumstances under which it may or may not be
read.


5.2.2 Basic Components of Issue-Specific Policy


As suggested for program policy, a useful structure for issue-specific policy is to break the policy
into its basic components.


Issue Statement.    To formulate a policy on an issue, managers first must define the issue with any
relevant terms, distinctions, and conditions included.     It is also often usefial to     specify the goal or
justification for the policy - which can be helpfiil in gaining compliance with the policy.             For
example, an organization might want to develop an issue-specific policy on the use of "unofficial
software," which might be defined to mean any software not approved, purchased, screened,
managed, and owned by the organization. Additionally, the applicable distinctions and conditions
might then need to be included, for instance, for software privately owned by employees but
approved for use at work, and for software owned and used by other businesses under contract to
the organization.


Statement of the Organization's Position. Once the issue is stated and related terms and
conditions are discussed, this section is used to clearly state the organization's position (i.e.,
management's decision) on the issue. To continue the previous example, this would mean stating
whether use of unofficial software as defined is prohibited in all or some cases, whether there are
fbrther guidelines for approval and use, or whether case-by-case exceptions will be granted, by
whom, and on what basis.

Applicability.   Issue-specific policies also need to include statements of applicability. This means
clarifying where, how, when, to whom, and to what a particular poUcy applies.                For example, it
could be that the hypothetical policy on unofficial software is intended to apply only to the
organization's own on-site resources and employees and not to contractors with offices at other


                                                    38

locations.   Additionally, the policy's applicability to employees travelling among different sites
and/or working at home who need to transport and use disks at multiple sites might need to be
clarified.



Roles and Responsibilities. The assignment of roles and responsibilities is also usually included in
issue-specific policies.   For example, if the policy
permits unofficial software privately owned by
employees to be used at work with the appropriate
approvals, then the approval authority granting                        Some Helpful Hints on Policy

tend to change less often than the people
occupying them, specific positions may be
preferable as the point of contact. For example, for some issues the point of contact might be a
line manager; for other issues it might be a facility manager, technical support person, system

administrator, or security program representative. Using the above example once more,
employees would need to know whether the point of contact for questions and procedural
information would be their immediate superior, a system administrator, or a computer security
official.

Guidelines and procedures often accompany policy.                       The issue-specific policy on unofficial
software, for example, might include procedural guidelines for checking disks brought to work
that had been used by employees at other locations.



5.3 System-Specific Policy

Program policy and issue-specific policy both address policy from a broad level, usually
encompassing the entire organization. However, they do not provide sufficient information or
direction, for example, to be used in establishing an access control list or in training users on what
actions are permitted.          System-specific policy fills this need.                    It is   much more focused, since it
addresses only one system.


Many security policy decisions may apply only at the system level and may vary from system to
system within the same organization. While these decisions may appear to be too detailed to be
policy, they can be extremely important, with significant impacts on system usage and security.
These types of decisions can be made by a management official, not by a technical system
administrator.^'* (The impacts of these decisions, however, are often analyzed by technical system
administrators.)

of security policies, officials may use a                             System- specific security policy includes two

security rules, which together comprise the
system- specific policy. Closely linked and often difficult to distinguish, however, is the
implementation of the policy in technology.


5.3.1 Security Objectives
                                                                                            Sample Security Objective

system. Although, this process may start with
                                                                      information used in payroll processing.

availability, and confidentiality, it should not

stop there.        A security objective needs to
more specific; it should be concrete and well defined.                      It   also should be stated so that it is clear




      It is   important to remember that policy is not created in a vacuum. For example, it is critical to understand the
system mission and how the system is intended to be used. Also, users may play an important role in setting policy.


                                                               40

that the objective is achievable.       This process will also draw upon other applicable organization
policies.



Security objectives consist of a series of statements that describe meaningful actions about explicit
resources. These objectives should be based on system functional or mission requirements, but
should state the security actions that support the requirements.


Development of system- specific policy will require management to make trade-offs, since it is
unlikely that all desired security objectives will be able to be fully met.            Management will face
cost, operational, technical, and other constraints.


5.3.2 Operational Security Rules


After management determines the security objectives, the rules for operating a system can be laid
out, for example, to define authorized and unauthorized modification.                  Who (by job category,
organization placement, or name) can do what
(e.g., modify, delete) to which specific classes

and records of data, and under what
                                                                      Sample Operational Security Rule

easier it is to know when one has been
violated.   It is also,   up to a point, easier to
automate policy enforcement. However,
overly detailed rules may make the job of instructing a computer to implement them difficult or
computationally complex.


In addition to deciding the level of detail, management should decide the degree of formality in
documenting the system-specific policy. Once again, the more formal the documentation, the
easier it is to enforce and to follow policy.        On the other hand, policy at the system level that is
too detailed and formal can also be an administrative burden. In general, good practice suggests a
reasonably detailed formal statement of the access privileges for a system. Documenting access
controls policy will make it substantially easier to follow and to enforce. (See Chapters 10 and
17, PersonnelAJser Issues and Lx)gical Access Control.)             Another area that normally requires a
detailed and formal statement is the assignment of security responsibilities.               Other areas that
should be addressed are the rules for system usage and the consequences of noncompliance.


Policy decisions in other areas of computer security, such as those described in this handbook, are
often documented in the risk analysis, accreditation statements, or procedural manuals.                     However,
any controversial, atypical, or uncommon policies will also need formal statements. Atypical

//.    Management Controls



policies would include any areas where the system policy is different from organizational policy or
from normal practice within the organization, either more or less stringent. The documentation
for a topical policy contains a statement explaining the reason for deviation from the
organization's standard policy.


5.3.3 System-Specific Policy Implementation


Technology plays an important - but not sole - role in enforcing system- specific policies.                          When
technology is used to enforce policy, it is important not to neglect nontechnology- based methods.
For example, technical system-based controls could be used to limit the printing of confidential
reports to a particular printer.          However, corresponding physical security measures would also
have to be in place to limit access to the printer output or the desired security objective would not
be achieved.


Technical methods frequently used to implement system- security policy are likely to include the
use of logical access controls. However, there are other automated means of enforcing or
supporting security policy that typically supplement logical access controls. For example,
technology can be used to block telephone users from calling certain numbers. Intrusion-
detection software can alert system administrators to suspicious activity or can take action to stop
the activity. Personal computers can be configured to prevent booting from a floppy disk.


Technology-based enforcement of system-security policy has both advantages and disadvantages.
A computer system, properly designed, programmed, installed, configured, and maintained,^^
consistently enforces policy within the computer system, although no computer can force users to
follow all procedures.         Management controls also play an important role - and should not be
neglected. In addition, deviations from the policy may sometimes be necessary and appropriate;
such deviations may be difficult to implement easily with some technical controls. This situation
occurs frequently if implementation of the security policy is too rigid (which can occur when the
system analysts fail to anticipate contingencies and prepare for them).


5.4 Interdependencies

Policy is related to many of the topics covered in this handbook:


Program Management. Policy is used to establish an organization's computer security program,
and is therefore closely tied to program management and administration. Both program and
system-specific policy may be established in any of the areas covered in this handbook. For
example, an organization may wish to have a consistent approach to incident handling for all its



      " Doing all of these things properly is, unfortunately, the exception rather than the rule. Confidence in the system's
ability to enforce system- specific policy is closely tied to assurance.   (See Chapter 9, Assurance.)


                                                               42
                                                                          5.   Computer Security Policy




systems - and would issue appropriate program policy to do so.        On the other hand, it may decide
that its applications are sufficiently independent of each other that   application managers should
deal with incidents on an individual basis.


Access Controls. System-specific policy is often implemented through the use of access controls.
For example, it may be a policy decision that only two individuals in an organization are
authorized to run a check-printing program. Access controls are used by the system to implement
(or enforce) this policy.


Links to Broader Organizational Policies. This chapter has focused on the types and
components of computer security policy. However, it is important to realize that computer
security policies are often extensions of an organization's information security policies for
handling information in other forms (e.g., paper documents). For example, an organization's e-
mail policy would probably be tied to its broader policy on privacy.      Computer security policies
may also be extensions of other policies, such as those about appropriate use of equipment and
facilities.



5.5 Cost Considerations


A number of potential costs are associated with developing and implementing computer security
policies.     Overall, the major cost of policy is the cost of implementing the policy and its impacts
upon the organization. For example, establishing a computer security program, accomplished
through policy, does not come at negligible cost.


Other costs may be those incurred through the policy development process. Numerous
administrative and management activities may be required for drafting, reviewing, coordinating,
clearing, disseminating, and publicizing policies.    In many organizations, successful policy
implementation may require additional staffing and training - and can take time. In general, the
costs to an organization for computer security policy development and implementation wiU
depend upon how extensive the change needed to achieve a level of risk acceptable to
management.

               COMPUTER SECURITY PROGRAM MANAGEMENT

Computers and the information they process are critical to many organizations' ability to perform
their mission and business functions.            It   therefore makes sense that executives view computer
security as a management issue and seek to protect their organization's computer resources as
they would any other valuable asset.           To do this effectively requires developing of a
comprehensive management approach.

approach to computer security and discusses                        OMB Circular A-130, "Management of Federal

possible to describe one ideal computer
security program. However, this chapter does describe some of the features and issues common
to many federal organizations.




6.1 Structure of a Computer Security Program


Many computer security programs that are distributed throughout the organization have different
elements performing various functions. While this approach has benefits, the distribution of the
computer security function in many organizations is haphazard, usually based upon history (i.e.,
who was available in the organization to do what when the need arose). Ideally, the distribution
of computer security functions should result from a planned and integrated management
philosophy.


Managing computer security at multiple levels brings many benefits. Each level contributes to the
overall computer security program with different types of expertise, authority, and resources. In
general, higher-level officials (such as those at the headquarters or unit levels in the agency
described above) better understand the organization as a whole and have more authority.                           On the
other hand, lower-level officials (at the computer facility and applications levels) are more familiar
with the specific requirements, both technical and procedural, and problems of the systems and




     This chapter is primarily directed at federal agencies, which are generally very large and complex organizations.
This chapter discusses programs which are suited to managing security in such environments. They may be wholly
inappropriate for smaller organizations or private sector firms.


   " This chapter addresses the management of security programs, not the various activities such as risk analysis or
contingency planning that make up an effective security program.

    A federal agency computer security program is created and operates in an environment rich in guidance
    and direction from other organizations. Figure 6. illustrates some of the external sources of

    requirements and guidance directed toward agency management with regard to computer security While
    a full discussion of each is outside the scope of this chapter, it is important to realize that a program does
    not operate in a vacuum; federal organizations are constrained — by both statute and regulation -- in a
    number of ways.

the users. The levels of computer security program management should be complementary; each
can help the other be more effective.


Since many organizations have at least two levels of computer security management, this chapter
divides computer security program management into two levels: the central level and the system
level.   (Each organization, though, may have its own unique structure.) The central computer

organization or a major component of an organization.                                   The system-level computer security
program addresses the management of computer security for a particular system.


6.2 Central Computer Security Programs


The purpose of a central computer security program is to address the overall management of


                                                                            47
//.   Management Controls



computer security within an organization. In the federal government, the organization could
consist of a department, agency, or other major operating unit.


As with the management of all resources, central computer security management can be
performed in many practical and cost-effective ways. The importance of sound management
cannot be overemphasized. There is also a downside to centrally managed computer security
programs. Specifically, they present greater risk that errors in judgement will be more widely
propagated throughout the organization. As they strive to meet their objectives, managers need
to consider the full impact of available options when establishing their computer security
programs.


6.2.1 Benefits of Central Computer Security Programs


A central security program should provide two quite distinct types of benefits:

      •           Increased efficiency and economy of security throughout the organization, and


      •           the ability to provide centralized enforcement and oversight.


Both of these benefits are in keeping with the purpose of the Paperwork Reduction Act, as
implemented in 0MB Circular A- 1 30.


      The Paperwork Reduction Act establishes a broad mandate for agencies to perform their
      information management activities in an efficient, effective, and economical manner...             .




      Agencies shall assure an adequate level of security for all agency automated information
      systems, whether maintained in-house or commercially.^^


6.2.2 Efficient, Economic Coordination of Information


A central computer security program helps to coordinate and manage effective use of security-
related resources throughout the organization.               The most important of these resources are
normally information          financial resources.


Sound and timely information is necessary for managers to accomplish their tasks effectively.
However, most organizations have trouble collecting information from myriad sources and
effectively processing and distributing it within the organization. This section discusses some of
the sources and elficient uses of computer security information.


Within the federal government, many organizations such as the Office of Management and

Budget, the General Services Administration, the National Institute of Standards and Technology,
and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, provide information on
computer, telecommunications, or information resources. This information includes security-
related policy, regulations, standards, and guidance.       A portion of the information is channelled
through the senior designated official for each agency (see Federal Information Resources
Management Regulation [FIRMR] Part 201-2). Agencies are expected to have mechanisms in
place to distribute the information the senior designated official receives.


Computer security-related information is also available from private and federal professional
societies and groups. These groups wiU often provide the information as a public service,
although some private groups charge a fee for it. However, even for information that is free or
inexpensive, the costs associated with personnel gathering the information can be high.


Internal security-related information, such as which procedures were effective, virus infections,
security problems, and solutions, need to be shared within an organization.              Often this information
is specific to the operating environment and culture of the organization.



A computer security program administered at the organization level can provide a way to coUect
the internal security-related information and distribute it as needed throughout the organization.
Sometimes an organization can also share this information with external groups. See Figure 6.3.


Another use of an effective conduit of information is to increase the central computer security
program's abihty to influence external and internal policy decisions. If the central computer
security program office can represent the entire organization, then its advice is more likely to be
heeded by upper management and external organizations. However, to be effective, there should
be excellent communication between the system-level computer security programs and the
organization level. For example, if an organization were considering consolidating its mainframes
into one site (or considering distributing the processing currently done at one site), personnel at
the central program could provide initial opinions about the security implications.            However, to
speak authoritatively, central program personnel would have to actually know the security
impacts of the proposed change - information that would have to be obtained from the system-
level computer security program.


Besides being able to help an organization use
information more cost effectively, a computer           An organization's components may develop

Besides allowing an organization to share expertise and, therefore, save money, a central
computer security program can use its position to consolidate requirements so the organization
can negotiate discounts based on volume purchasing of security hardware and software. It also
facilitates such activities as strategic planning and organizationwide incident handling and security

trend analysis.


6.2.3 Central Enforcement and Oversight


Besides helping an organization improve the economy and efficiency of its computer security
program, a centralized program can include an independent evaluation or enforcement fianction to
ensure that organizational subunits are cost-effectively securing resources and following
applicable policy. While the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) and external organizations,
such as the General Accounting Office (GAO), also perform a valuable evaluation role, they
operate outside the regular management channels. Chapters 8 and 9 ftirther discuss the role of
independent audit.


There are several reasons for having an oversight function within the regular management
channel. First, computer security is an important component in the management of organizational
resources. This is a responsibility that cannot be transferred or abandoned. Second, maintaining
an internal oversight function allows an organization to find and correct problems without the
potential embarrassment of an IG or    GAO audit or investigation. Third, the organization may find
different problems fi^om those that an outside organization may find.   The organization
understands its assets, threats, systems, and procedures better than an external organization;
additionally, people may have a tendency to be more candid with insiders.



6.3 Elements of an Effective Central Computer Security Program


For a central computer security program to be effective, it should be an established part of
organization management. If system managers and applications owners do not need to
consistently interact with the security program, then it can become an empty token of upper
management's "commitment to security."


Stable Program Management Function.         A well-established program will have a program
manager recognized within the organization as the central computer security program manager.
In addition, the program will be staffed with able personnel, and links will be established between
the program management function and computer security personnel in other parts of the
organization.     A computer security program is a complex function that needs a stable base from
which to direct the management of such security resources as information and money. The
benefits of an oversight function cannot be achieved if the computer security program is not
recognized within an organization as having expertise and authority.




                                                  51
//.   Management Controls



Stable Resource Base.    A well-established program will have a stable resource base in terms of
personnel, funds, and other support. Without a stable resource base, it is impossible to plan and
execute programs and projects effectively.


Existence of Policy. Policy provides the foundation for the central computer security program
and is the means for documenting and promulgating important decisions about computer security.
A central computer security program should also publish standards, regulations, and guidelines
that implement and expand on policy.      (See Chapter 5.)


Published Mission and Functions Statement.         A published mission statement grounds the central
computer security program into the unique operating environment of the organization. The
statement clearly establishes the function of the computer security program and defines
responsibilities for both the computer security program and other related programs and entities.
Without such a statement, it is impossible to develop criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of
the program.


Long-Term Computer Security Strategy. A well-established program explores and develops long-
term strategies to incorporate computer security into the next generation of information
technology. Since the computer and telecommunications field moves rapidly, it is essential to plan
for future operating environments.


Compliance Program.      A central computer security program needs to address compliance with
national policies and requirements, as well as organization-specific requirements. National
requirements include those prescribed under the Computer Security Act of 1987,                OMB Circular
A- 130, the FIRMR, and Federal Information Processing Standards.

computer security into the organization's
management. The relationships should
encompass more than just the sharing of information; the offices should influence each other.

Liaison with External Groups. There are many sources of computer security information, such as

NIST's Computer Security Program Managers' Forum, computer security clearinghouse, and the
Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST). An established program will be
knowledgeable of and will take advantage of external sources of information.                   It will also be a

provider of information.


6.4 System-Level Computer Security Programs

While the central program addresses the entire spectrum of computer security for an organization,
system-level programs ensure appropriate and cost-effective security for each system.                       This
includes influencing decisions about what controls to implement, purchasing and installing
technical controls, day-to-day computer security administration, evaluating system vulnerabilities,
and responding to security problems.            It   encompasses all the areas discussed in the handbook.


System-level computer security program personnel are the local advocates for computer security.
The system security manager/officer raises the issue of security with the cognizant system
manager and helps develop solutions for security problems. For example, has the application
owner made clear the system's security requirements? Will bringing a new function online affect
security, and if so, how? Is the system vulnerable to hackers and viruses? Has the contingency
plan been tested? Raising these kinds of questions will force system managers and application
owners to identify and address their security requirements.


6.5 Elements of Effective System-Level Programs


Like the central computer security program, many factors influence how successful a system-level
computer security program is. Many of these are similar to the central program. This section
addresses some additional considerations.


Security Plans.     The Computer Security Act mandates that agencies develop computer security
and privacy plans for sensitive systems. These plans ensure that each federal and federal interest
system has appropriate and cost-effective security. System-level security personnel should be in a
position to develop and implement security plans. Chapter 8 discusses the plans in more detail.


System-Specific Security Policy.          Many computer security policy issues need to be addressed on a
system-specific basis.      The issues can vary for each system, although access control and the
designation of personnel with security responsibility are likely to be needed for aU systems.                   A
cohesive and comprehensive set of security policies can be developed by using a process that




  As is implied by the name, an organization will typically have several system-level computer security programs. In
setting up these programs, the organization should carefully examine the scope of each system-level program.   System-
level computer security programs may address, for example, the computing resources within an operational element, a

major application, or a group of similar systems (either technologically or functionally).


                                                            53
//.    Management Controls



derives security rules from security goals, as discussed in Chapter 5.


Life Cycle Management.             As discussed in Chapter 8, security must be managed throughout a
system's life cycle.        This specifically includes ensuring that changes to the system are made with
attention to security and that accreditation is accomplished.


Integration With System Operations.               The system-level computer security program should consist
of people who understand the system, its mission, its technology, and its operating environment.
Effective security management usually needs to be integrated into the management of the system.
Effective integration will ensure that system managers and application owners consider security in
the planning and operation of the system.             The system security manager/officer should be able to
participate in the selection and implementation of appropriate technical controls and security
procedures and should understand system vulnerabilities. Also, the system-level computer
security program should be capable of responding to security problems in a timely manner.


For large systems, such as a mainframe data center, the security program will often include a
manager and several staff positions in such areas as access control, user administration, and
contingency and disaster planning. For small systems, such as an officewide local-area-network
(LAN), the LAN administrator may have adjunct security responsibilities.

Separation From Operations.              A natural tension often exists between computer security and
operational elements. In many instances, operational components — which tend to be far larger
and therefore more influential — seek to resolve this tension by embedding the computer security
program in computer operations. The typical result of this organizational strategy is a computer
security program that lacks independence, has minimal authority, receives little management
attention, and has few resources. As early as 1978, GAO identified this organizational mode as
one of the principal basic weaknesses in federal agency computer security programs.     System-
level programs face this problem most often.


This conflict between the need to be a part of system management and the need for independence

program and upper management, often through the central computer security program. A key
requirement of this setup is the existence of a reporting structure that does not include system
management. Another possibility is for the computer security program to be completely
independent of system management and to report directly to higher management. There are many
hybrids and permutations, such as co-location of computer security and systems management staff
but separate reporting (and supervisory) structures. Figure 6.4 presents one example of

6.6 Central and System-Level Program Interactions

A system-level program that is not integrated into the organizational program may have difficulty
influencing significant areas affecting security.   The system-level computer security program
implements the policies, guidance, and regulations of the central computer security program. The
system-level office also learns from the information disseminated by the central program and uses
the experience and expertise of the entire organization. The system-level computer security
program further distributes information to systems management as appropriate.

Communications, however, should not be just one way. System-level computer security
programs inform the central office about their needs, problems, incidents, and solutions.
Analyzing this information allows the central computer security program to represent the various
systems to the organization's management and to external agencies and advocate programs and
policies beneficial to the security of all the systems.



6.7 Interdependencies

The general purpose of the computer security program, to improve security, causes it to overlap
with other organizational operations as well as the other security controls discussed in the
handbook. The central or system computer security program will address most controls at the
policy, procedural, or operational level.


Policy. Policy is issued to establish the computer security program.     The central computer
security program(s) normally produces policy (and supporting procedures and guidelines)
concerning general and organizational security issues and often issue-specific policy. However,
the system-level computer security program normally produces policy for that system. Chapter 5
provides additional guidance.


Life Cycle Management.      The process of securing a system over its life cycle is the role of the
system-level computer security program.       Chapter 8 addresses these issues.


Independent Audit. The independent audit fiinction described in Chapters 8 and 9 should
complement a central computer security program's compliance functions.


6.8 Cost Considerations

This chapter discussed how an organizationwide computer security program can manage security
resources, including financial resources, more effectively.   The cost considerations for a system-
level computer security program are more closely aligned with the overall cost savings in having
security.



                                                    56

The most significant direct cost of a computer security program is personnel. In addition, many
programs make frequent and effective use of consultants and contractors. A program also needs
funds for training and for travel, oversight, information collection and dissemination, and meetings
with personnel at other levels of computer security management.

                   COMPUTER SECURITY RISK MANAGEMENT

Risk is the possibility of something adverse happening. Risk management is the process of
assessing risk, taking steps to reduce risk to an acceptable level and maintaining that level of risk.
Though perhaps not always aware of it, individuals manage risks every day. Actions as routine as
buckling a car safety belt, carrying an umbrella when rain is forecast, or writing down a list of
things to do rather than trusting to memory fall into the purview of risk management. People
recognize various threats to their best interests and take precautions to guard against them or to
minimize their effects.


Both government and industry routinely
manage a myriad of risks. For example, to                Management is concerned with many types of risk.

ever be fully secured. There is always risk,
whether it is from a trusted employee who defrauds the system or a fire that destroys critical
resources. Risk management is made up of two primary and one underlying activities; risk
assessment and risk mitigation are the primary activities and uncertainty analysis is the underlying
one.


7.1 Risk Assessment


Risk assessment, the process of analyzing and interpreting risk, is comprised of three basic
activities: (1) determining the assessment's scope and methodology; (2) collecting and analyzing




                                                  59

data; and 3) interpreting the risk analysis results.^^


7.1.1 Determining the Assessment's Scope and Methodology


The first step in assessing risk is to identify the system under consideration, the part of the system
that will be analyzed, and the analytical method including its level of detail and formality.


The assessment may be focused on certain
areas where either the degree of risk is                              A risk assessment can focus on many different areas
unknown or is known to be high. Different                             such as: technical and operational controls to be

                                                                  ,,,,,,,,^,1,,,,,^^,,,,,,,,^^^^^^,,^^^,,,^^^^^^^,^,,,,^^
assessment. Factors that influence scope
include what phase of the life cycle a system is
in:     more detail might be appropriate for a new system being developed than for an existing system
undergoing an upgrade. Another factor is the relative importance of the system under
examination: the more essential the system, the more thorough the risk analysis should be.                                A
third factor may be the magnitude and types of changes the system has undergone since the last
risk analysis. The addition of new interfaces would warrant a different scope than would
installing a new operating system.



Methodologies can be formal or informal, detailed or simplified, high or low level, quantitative
(computationally based) or qualitative (based on descriptions or rankings), or a combination of
these.         No single method is best for aU users and aU environments.

How the boundary, scope, and methodology are defined will have major consequences in terms of
( 1 )   the total amount of effort spent on risk management and (2) the type and usefulness of the
assessment's results.           The boundary and scope should be selected in a way that will produce an
outcome that is clear, specific, and useful to the system and environment under scrutiny.

7.1.2 Collecting and Analyzing Data
                                                                      Good documentation of risk assessments will make

and analyzing the information to make it useful.


Because it is possible to collect much more information than can be analyzed, steps need to be
taken to limit information gathering and analysis. This process is called screening.        A risk
management effort should focus on those areas that result in the greatest consequence to the
organization (i.e., can cause the most harm). This can be done by ranking threats and assets.


A risk management methodology does not necessarily need to analyze each of the components of
risk separately.   For example, assets/consequences or threats/likelihoods may be analyzed
together.


Asset Valuation. These include the information, software, personnel, hardware, and physical
assets (such as the computer facility).    The value of an asset consists of its intrinsic value and the
near-term impacts and long-term consequences of its compromise.


Consequence Assessment. The consequence assessment estimates the degree of harm or loss that
could occur. Consequences refers to the overall, aggregate harm that occurs, not just to the near-
term or immediate impacts. While such impacts often result in disclosure, modification,
destruction, or denial of service, consequences are the more significant long-term effects, such as
lost business, failure to perform the system's mission, loss of reputation, violation of privacy,

injury, or loss of life.   The more severe the consequences of a threat, the greater the risk to the
system (and, therefore, the organization).


Threat Identification.      A threat is an entity or event with the potential to harm the system. Typi
cal threats are errors, fraud, disgruntled employees, fires, water damage, hackers, and viruses.
Threats should be identified and analyzed to determine the likelihood of their occurrence and their
potential to harm assets.


In addition to looking at "big-ticket" threats, the risk analysis should investigate areas that are
poorly understood, new, or undocumented. If a facility has a well-tested physical access control
system, less effort to identify threats may be warranted for it than for unclear, untested software
backup procedures.


The risk analysis should concentrate on those threats most likely to occur and affect important
assets. In some cases, determining which threats are realistic is not possible until after the threat

analysis is begun. Chapter 4 provides additional discussion of today's most prevalent threats.


Safeguard Analysis.        A safeguard is any action, device, procedure, technique, or other measure
that reduces a system's vulnerability to a threat.    Safeguard analysis should include an examination
of the effectiveness of the existing security measures.    It can also identify   new safeguards that
could be implemented in the system; however, this is normally performed later in the risk
management process.

Vulnerability Analysis.          A vulnerability is a condition or weakness in (or absence of) security
procedures, technical controls, physical controls, or other controls that could be exploited by a
threat.    Vulnerabilities are often analyzed in terms of missing safeguards.                     Vulnerabilities
contribute to risk because they may "allow" a threat to harm the system.


The interrelationship of vulnerabilities, threats, and assets is critical to the analysis of risk. Some
of these interrelationships are pictured in Figure 7.1. However, there are other interrelationships
such as the presence of a vulnerability inducing a threat. (For example, a normally honest
employee might be tempted to alter data when the employee sees that a terminal has been left
logged on.)

well as the effectiveness of safeguards (or presence of vulnerabilities). In general, historical
information about many threats is weak, particularly with regard to human threats; thus,
experience in this area is important.       Some threat data — especially on physical threats such as
fires or floods    — is stronger. Care needs to be taken in using any statistical threat data; the source
of the data or the analysis may be inaccurate or incomplete. In general, the greater the likelihood
of a threat occurring, the greater the risk.

                    technical requirements; and
                    cultural constraints.


One method of selecting safeguards uses a "what if analysis. With this method, the effect of
adding various safeguards (and, therefore, reducing vulnerabilities) is tested to see what difference
each makes with regard to cost, effectiveness, and other relevant factors, such as those listed
above. Trade-offs among the factors can be seen. The analysis of trade-offs also supports the
acceptance of residual risk, discussed below. This method typically involves multiple iterations of
the risk analysis to see how the proposed changes affect the risk analysis result.


Another method is to categorize types of safeguards and recommend implementing them for
various levels of risk. For example, stronger controls would be implemented on high-risk systems
than on low-risk systems. This method normally does not require multiple iterations of the risk
analysis.


As with other aspects of risk management, screening can be used to concentrate on the highest-
risk areas.     For example once could focus on risks with very severe consequences, such as a very
high dollar loss or loss of life or on the threats that are most likely to occur.


7.2.2 Accept Residual Risk


At some point, management needs to decide if the operation of the computer system is acceptable,
given the kind and severity of remaining risks.   Many managers do not fully understand computer-
based risk for several reasons: (1) the type of risk may be different from risks previously
associated with the organization or function; (2) the risk may be technical and difficult for a lay
person to understand, or (3) the proliferation and decentralization of computing power can make
it    difficult to identify key assets that   may be at risk.

Risk acceptance, like the selection of safeguards, should take into account various factors besides
those addressed in the risk assessment. In addition, risk acceptance should take into account the
limitations of the risk assessment.         (See the section below on uncertainty.) Risk acceptance is
linked to the selection of safeguards since, in some cases, risk may have to be accepted because
safeguards are too expensive (in either monetary or nonmonetary factors).


Within the federal government, the acceptance of risk is closely linked with the authorization to
use a computer system, often called accreditation, discussed in Chapters 8 and 9. Accreditation
is the acceptance of risk     by management resulting in a formal approval for the system to become
operational or remain so.       As discussed earlier in this chapter, one of the two primary functions of
risk management is the interpretation of risk for the purpose of risk acceptance.

7.2.3 Implementing Controls and Monitoring Effectiveness


Merely selecting appropriate safeguards does not reduce risk; those safeguards need to be
effectively implemented.     Moreover, to continue to be effective, risk management needs to be an
ongoing process. This requires a periodic assessment and improvement of safeguards and re-
analysis of risks.   Chapter 8 discusses how periodic risk assessment is an integral part of the
overall management of a system.      (See especially the diagram on page 83.)


The risk management process normally produces security requirements that are used to design,
purchase, build, or otherwise obtain safeguards or implement system changes. The integration of
risk management into the life cycle process is discussed in Chapter 8.



7.3 Uncertainty Analysis

sources of uncertainty in the risk management process: (1) a lack of confidence or precision in the
risk management model or methodology and (2) a lack of sufficient information to determine the
exact value of the elements of the risk model, such as threat frequency, safeguard effectiveness, or
consequences.


The risk management framework presented in this chapter is a generic description of risk
management elements and their basic relationships. For a methodology to be useful, it should
further refine the relationships and offer some means of screening information. In this process,
assumptions may be made that do not accurately reflect the user's environment. This is especially
evident in the case of safeguard selection, where the number of relationships among assets,
threats, and vulnerabilities can become unwieldy.



The data are another source of uncertainty. Data for the risk analysis normally come from two
sources: statistical data and expert analysis. Statistics and expert analysis can sound more
authoritative than they really are. There are many potential problems with statistics. For
example, the sample may be too small, other parameters affecting the data may not be properly
accounted for, or the results may be stated in a misleading manner. In many cases, there may be
insufficient data.   When expert analysis is used to make projections about future events,           it   should
be recognized that the projection is subjective and is based on assumptions made (but not always
explicitly articulated) by the expert.

7.4 Interdependencies

Risk management touches on every control and every chapter in this handbook.            It is,   however,
most closely related to life cycle management and the security planning process. The requirement
to perform risk management is often discussed in organizational policy and is an issue for
organizational oversight. These issues are discussed in Chapters 5 and 6.


7.5 Cost Considerations

The building blocks of risk management presented in this chapter can be used creatively to
develop methodologies that concentrate expensive analysis work where it is most needed. Risk
management can become expensive very quickly if an expansive boundary and detailed scope are
selected.   It is very important to   use screening techniques, as discussed in this chapter, to limit the

or developed. The methodology should concentrate on areas where identification of risk and the
selection of cost-effective safeguards are needed.


The cost of different methodologies can be significant.       A "back-of-the-envelope" analysis or
high-medium-low ranking can often provide all the information needed. However, especially for
the selection of expensive safeguards or the analysis of systems with unknown consequences,
more in-depth analysis may be warranted.

                         IN THE COMPUTER SYSTEM LIFE CYCLE


Like other aspects of information processing systems, security is most effective and efficient if
planned and managed throughout a computer system's life cycle, from initial planning, through
design, implementation, and operation, to disposal.^^  Many security-relevant events and analyses
occur during a system's life. This chapter explains the relationship among them and how they fit
together.^^    It also   discusses the important role of security planning in helping to ensure that
security issues are addressed comprehensively.


This chapter examines:


      •             system security plans,


      •             the components of the computer system life cycle,


      •             the benefits of integrating security into the computer system life cycle, and


      •             techniques for addressing security in the life cycle.


8.1 Computer Security Act Issues for Federal Systems


Planning is used to help ensure that security is addressed in a comprehensive manner throughout a
system's life cycle. For federal systems, the Computer Security Act of 1987 sets forth a statutory
requirement for the preparation of computer security plans for all sensitive systems.^^ The intent
and spirit of the Act is to improve computer security in the federal government, not to create
paperwork. In keeping with this intent, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and NIST
have guided agencies toward a planning process that emphasizes good planning and management
of computer security within an agency and for each computer system. As emphasized in this
chapter, computer security management should be a part of computer systems management.                                 The



   " A computer system refers to a collection of processes, hardware, and software that perform a function. This
includes applications, networks, or support systems.


   ^ Although this chapter addresses a life cycle process that starts with system initiation, the process can be initiated at
any point in the life cycle.

   " An organization will typically have many computer security plans. However, it is not necessary that a separate and
distinct plan exist for every physical system (e.g., PCs). Plans may address, for example, the computing resources within
an operational element, a major application, or a group of similar systems (either technologically or functionally).

A "typical" plan briefly describes the
important security considerations for the system and provides references to more detaUed
documents, such as system security plans, contingency plans, training programs, accreditation
statements, incident handling plans, or audit results. This enables the plan to be used as a
management tool without requiring repetition of existing documents. For smaller systems, the
plan may include all security documentation.    As with other security documents, if a plan
addresses specific vulnerabilities or other information that could compromise the system, it should
be kept private.       It also has to be kept up-to-date.

a feature in a system after it has been designed than to include the feature in the system at the
initial design phase.The principal reason for implementing security during a system's
development is that it is more difficult to implement it later (as is usually reflected in the higher
costs of doing so).         It   also tends to disrupt ongoing operations.
Security also needs to be incorporated into the later phases of the computer system life cycle to
help ensure that security keeps up with changes in the system's environment, technology,
procedures, and personnel.             It   also ensures that security is considered in system upgrades,
including the purchase of new components or the design of new modules.                           Adding new security
controls to a system after a security breach, mishap, or audit can lead to haphazard security that

can be more expensive and less effective that security that is already integrated into the system.     It

can also significantly degrade system performance.      Of course, it is virtually impossible to
anticipate the whole array of problems that may arise during a system's lifetime. Therefore, it is
generally useful to update the computer security plan at least at the end of each phase in the life
cycle and after each re-accreditation. For many systems, it may be useful to update the plan more
often.


Life cycle management also helps document security-relevant decisions, in addition to helping
assure management that security is fully considered in all phases. This documentation benefits
system management officials as well as oversight and independent audit groups. System
management personnel use documentation as a self-check and reminder of why decisions were
made so that the impact of changes in the environment can be more easily assessed. Oversight
and independent audit groups use the documentation in their reviews to verify that system
management has done an adequate job and to highlight areas where security may have been
overlooked. This includes examining whether the documentation accurately reflects how the
system is actually being operated.


Within the federal government, the Computer Security Act of 1987 and its implementing
instructions provide specific requirements for computer security plans.      These plans are a form of
documentation that helps ensure that security is considered not only during system design and
development but also throughout the rest of the life cycle. Plans can also be used to be sure that
requirements of Appendix III to    0MB Circular A- 130, as well as other applicable requirements,
have been addressed.


8.3 Overview of the Computer System Life Cycle

There are many models for the computer system life cycle but most contain five basic phases, as
pictured in Figure 8.1.


•    Initiation.   During the initiation phase, the need for a system is expressed and the purpose of
     the system is documented.


•    Development/Acquisition. During this phase the system is designed, purchased,
     programmed, developed, or otherwise constructed. This phase often consists of other
     defined cycles, such as the system development cycle or the acquisition cycle.


•    Implementation. After initial system testing, the system is installed or fielded.


•    Operation/Maintenance. During this phase the system performs its work. The system is
     almost always modified by the addition of hardware and software and by numerous other
     events.




                                                   73
//.   Management Controls



•     Disposal.     The computer system is disposed of once the transition to a new computer system
      is completed.




Each phase can apply to an entire system, a
new component or module, or a system                                Many different "life cycles" are associated with
upgrade. As with other aspects of systems                           computer systems, including the system development,
                                                                    acquisition, and information life cycles.
management, the level of detail and analysis
for each activity described here is determined
by many factors including size, complexity,
system cost, and sensitivity.


Many people find the concept of a computer system life cycle confusing because many cycles
occur within the broad framework of the entire computer system life cycle. For example, an
organization could develop a system, using a system development life cycle. During the system's
life, the organization might purchase           new components, using the acquisition life cycle.

Moreover, the computer system life cycle itself is merely one component of other life cycles. For
example, consider the information life cycle. Normally information, such as personnel data, is
used much longer than the life of one computer system. If an employee works for an organization
for thirty years and collects retirement for another twenty, the employee's automated personnel
record will probably pass through many different organizational computer systems owned by the
company. In addition, parts of the information will also be used in other computer systems, such
as those of the Internal Revenue Service and the Social Security Administration.



8.4 Security Activities in the Computer System Life Cycle^^


This section reviews the security activities that arise in each stage of the computer system life
cycle.   (See Figure 8.1.)


8.4.1 Initiation


The conceptual and early design process of a system involves the discovery of a need for a new
system or enhancements to an existing system; early ideas as to system characteristics and
proposed functionality; brainstorming sessions on architectural, performance, or functional system
aspects; and environmental, financial, political, or other constraints.                   At the same time, the basic
security aspects of a system should be developed along with the early system design. This can be
done through a sensitivity assessment.




      For brevity and because of the uniqueness of each system, none of these discussions can include the details of all
possible security activities at any particular life cycle phase.


                                                               74

8.4.1.1 Conducting a Sensitivity
Assessment                                               The definition of sensitive is often misconstrued.
                                                         Sensitive is synonymous with important or valuable.

normally expressed in terms of integrity,
availability, and confidentiality.   Such factors
as the importance of the system to the
organization's mission and the consequences of unauthorized modification, unauthorized
disclosure, or unavailability of the system or data need to be examined when assessing sensitivity.
To address these types of issues, the people who use or own the system or information should
participate in the assessment.


A sensitivity assessment should answer the following questions:

      •         What information is handled by the system?

      •         What kind of potential damage could occur through error, unauthorized disclosure
                or modification, or unavailability of data or the system?


      •         What laws or regulations affect security (e.g., the Privacy Act or the Fair Trade
                Practices Act)?


      •         To what threats is the system or information particularly vulnerable?

      •         Are there significant environmental considerations (e.g., hazardous location of
                system)?


      •         What are the security-relevant characteristics of the user community (e.g., level of
                technical sophistication and training or security clearances)?


      •         What internal security standards, regulations, or guidelines apply to this system?

The sensitivity assessment starts an analysis of security that continues throughout the life cycle.
The assessment helps determine if the project needs special security oversight, if further analysis is

needed before committing to begin system development (to ensure feasibility at a reasonable
cost), or in rare instances, whether the security requirements are so strenuous and costly that
system development or acquisition will not be pursued. The sensitivity assessment can be
included with the system initiation documentation either as a separate document or as a section of
another planning document. The development of security features, procedures, and assurances,
described in the next section, builds on the sensitivity assessment.


A sensitivity assessment can also be performed during the planning stages of system upgrades (for
either upgrades being procured or developed in house). In this case, the assessment focuses on
the affected areas. If the upgrade significantly affects the original assessment, steps can be taken
to analyze the impact on the rest of the system.     For example, are new controls needed? WiU
some controls become unnecessary?

8.4.2 Development/Acquisition


For most systems, the development/acquisition phase is more complicated than the initiation
phase. Security activities can be divided into three parts:


     •         determining security features, assurances, and operational practices;


     •         incorporating these security requirements into design specifications; and


     •         actually acquiring them.


These divisions apply to systems that are designed and built in house, to systems that are
purchased, and to systems developed using a hybrid approach.


During this phase, technical staff and system sponsors should actively work together to ensure
that the technical designs reflect the system's security needs.    As with development and
incorporation of other system requirements, this process requires an open dialogue between
technical staff and system sponsors.   It is   important to address security requirements effectively in
synchronization with development of the overall system.


8.4.2.1 Determining Security Requirements


During the first part of the development/ acquisition phase, system planners define the
requirements of the system. Security requirements should be developed at the same time. These
requirements can be expressed as technical features (e.g., access controls), assurances (e.g.,
background checks for system developers), or operational practices (e.g., awareness and training).
System security requirements, like other system requirements, are derived from a number of
sources including law, policy, applicable standards and guidelines, functional needs of the system,
and cost-benefit trade-offs.


                                                     77
//.   Management Controls



Law. Besides specific laws that place security requirements on information, such as the Privacy
Act of 1974, there are laws, court cases, legal opinions, and other similar legal material that may
affect security directly or indirectly.


Policy.   As discussed in Chapter 5, management officials issue several different types of policy.
System security requirements are often derived from issue-specific policy.

Standards and Guidelines. International, national, and organizational standards and guidelines
are another source for determining security features, assurances, and operational practices.
Standards and guidelines are often written in an "if... then" manner (e.g., if the system is encrypting
data, then a particular cryptographic algorithm should be used).      Many organizations specify
baseline controls for different types of systems, such as administrative, mission- or business-
critical, or proprietary.   As required, special care should be given to interoperability standards.

Functional Needs of the System. The purpose of security is to support the Sanction of the system,
not to undermine it. Therefore, many aspects of the function of the system will produce related
security requirements.


Cost-Benefit Analysis.      When considering security, cost-benefit analysis is done through risk
assessment, which examines the assets, threats, and vulnerabilities of the system in order to
determine the most appropriate, cost-effective safeguards (that comply with applicable laws,
policy, standards, and the functional needs of the system).     Appropriate safeguards are normally
those whose anticipated benefits outweigh their costs. Benefits and costs include monetary and
nonmonetary issues, such as prevented losses, maintaining an organization's reputation, decreased
user friendliness, or increased system administration.


Risk assessment, like cost-benefit analysis, is used to support decision making.     It helps managers

select cost-effective safeguards.    The extent of the risk assessment. Like that of other cost-benefit
analyses, should be commensurate with the complexity and cost (normally an indicator of
complexity) of the system and the expected benefits of the assessment. Risk assessment is further
discussed in Chapter 7.


Risk assessment can be performed during the requirements analysis phase of a procurement or the
design phase of a system development cycle. Risk should also normally be assessed during the
development/acquisition phase of a system upgrade.        The risk assessment may be performed once
or multiple times, depending upon the project's methodology.


Care should be taken in differentiating between security risk assessment and project risk analysis.
Many system development and acquisition projects analyze the risk of failing to successfully
complete the project - a different activity from security risk assessment.

8.4.2.2 Incorporating Security Requirements Into Specifications


Determining security features, assurances, and operational practices can yield significant security
information and often voluminous requirements. This information needs to be validated, updated,
and organized into the detailed security protection requirements and specifications used by
systems designers or purchasers. Specifications can take on quite different forms, depending on
the methodology used for to develop the system, or whether the system, or parts of the system,
are being purchased off the shelf.


As specifications are developed, it may be necessary to update initial risk assessments.                A
safeguard recommended by the risk
assessment could be incompatible with other        m^mmmmmmmmmmmmBmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

while away from the office.


Besides the technical and operational controls of a system, assurance also should be addressed.
The degree to which assurance (that the security features and practices can and do work correctly
and effectively) is needed should be determined early. Once the desired level of assurance is
determined, it is necessary to figure out how the system will be tested or reviewed to determine
whether the specifications have been satisfied (to obtain the desired assurance). This applies to
both system developments and acquisitions. For example, if rigorous assurance is needed, the
ability to test the system or to provide another form of initial and ongoing assurance needs to be

designed into the system or otherwise provided for. See Chapter 9 for more information.


8.4.2.3 Obtaining the System and Related Security Activities


During this phase, the system is actually built or bought.     If the system is being built, security

activities may include developing the system's security aspects, monitoring the development

process itself for security problems, responding to changes, and monitoring                 threat.   Threats or
vulnerabilities that may arise during the development phase include Trojan horses, incorrect code,

poorly functioning development tools, manipulation of code, and malicious insiders.


If the system is being acquired off the shelf, security activities may include monitoring to ensure

security is a part of market surveys, contract solicitation documents, and evaluation of proposed
systems.   Many systems use a combination of development and acquisition. In this case, security
activities include both sets.




    This is an example of a risk-based decision.

architecture, or selecting a processing site or
platform. Additional security analysis will
probably be necessary.


In addition to obtaining the system, operational practices need to be developed.             These refer to
human activities that take place around the system such as contingency planning, awareness and
training, and preparing documentation. The chapters in the Operational Controls section of this
handbook discuss these areas. These need to be developed along with the system, although they
are often developed by different individuals. These areas, like technical specifications, should be
considered from the beginning of the development and acquisition phase.


8.4.3 Implementation


A separate implementation phase is not always specified in some life cycle planning efforts. (It is
often incorporated into the end of development and acquisition or the beginning of operation and
maintenance.) However, from a security point of view, a critical security activity, accreditation,
occurs between development and the start of system operation. The other activities described in
this section, turning on the controls and testing, are often incorporated at the end of the

development/acquisition phase.


8.4.3.1 Install/Turn-On Controls


While obvious, this activity is often overlooked.    When acquired, a system often comes with
security features disabled.   These need to be enabled and configured. For many systems this is a
complex task requiring significant skills. Custom-developed systems may also require similar
work.


8.4.3.2 Security Testing


System security testing includes both the testing of the particular parts of the system that have
been developed or acquired and the testing of the entire system. Security management, physical
facilities, personnel, procedures, the use of commercial or in-house services (such as networking

services), and contingency planning are examples of areas that affect the security of the entire
system, but may be specified outside of the development or acquisition cycle. Since only items
within the development or acquisition cycle will have been tested during system acceptance
testing, separate tests or reviews may need to be performed for these additional security elements

Security certification is a formal testing of the security safeguards implemented in the computer
system to determine whether they meet applicable requirements and specifications.^^                           To provide
more reliable technical information, certification is often performed by an independent reviewer,
rather than by the people who designed the system.


8.4.3.3 Accreditation


System security accreditation is the formal authorization by the accrediting (management) official
for system operation and an explicit acceptance of risk.                 It is usually supported by a review of the

system, including its management, operational, and technical controls. This review may include a
detailed technical evaluation (such as a Federal Information Processing Standard 102 certification,
particularly for complex, critical, or high-risk systems), security evaluation, risk assessment, audit,
or other such review. If the life cycle process is being used to manage a project (such as a system
upgrade), it is important to recognize that the accreditation is for the entire system, not just for
the new addition.

After deciding on the acceptability of security safeguards and residual risks, the accrediting
official should issue a formal accreditation statement.               While most flaws in system security are not
severe enough to remove an operational system from service or to prevent a new system from
becoming operational, the flaws may require some restrictions on operation (e.g., limitations on
dial- in access or electronic connections to other organizations).                 In some cases, an interim
accreditation may be granted, allowing the system to operate requiring review at the end of the

interim period, presumably after security upgrades have been made.


8.4.4 Operation and Maintenance


Many security activities take place during the operational phase of a system's life. In general,
these fall into three areas: (1) security operations and administration; (2) operational assurance;
and (3) periodic re-analysis of the security. Figure 8.2 diagrams the flow of security activities
during the operational phase.


8.4.4.1 Security Operations and Administration


Operation of a system involves many security activities discussed throughout this handbook.
Performing backups, holding training classes, managing cryptographic keys, keeping up with user
administration and access privileges, and updating security software are some examples.

                                                                    "mm

Changes in the system or the environment can
create new vulnerabilities. Strict adherence to
procedures is rare over time, and procedures become outdated. Thinking risk is minimal, users
may tend to bypass security measures and procedures.

As shown in Figure 8.2, changes occur. Operational assurance is one way of becoming aware of
these changes whether they are new vulnerabilities (or old vulnerabilities that have not been
corrected), system changes, or environmental changes.      Operational assurance is the process of
reviewing an operational system to see that security controls, both automated and manual, are
fianctioning correctly and effectively.


To maintain operational assurance, organizations use two basic methods: system audits and
monitoring. These terms are used loosely within the computer security community and often
overlap.   A system audit is a one-time or periodic event to evaluate security. Monitoring refers to
an ongoing activity that examines either the system or the users. In general, the more "real-time"
an activity is, the more it falls into the category of monitoring. (See Chapter 9.)

complaints, availability of new features and
services, or the discovery of new threats         j,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,^^


and vulnerabilities, system managers and
users modify the system and incorporate new features, new procedures, and software updates.


The environment in which the system operates also changes. Networking and interconnections
tend to increase. A new user group may be added, possibly external groups or anonymous
groups.    New threats may emerge, such as increases in network intrusions or the spread of
personal computer viruses. If the system has a configuration control board or other structure to
manage technical system changes, a security specialist can be assigned to the board to make
determinations about whether (and if so, how) changes will affect security.


Security should also be considered during system upgrades (and other planned changes) and in
determining the impact of unplanned changes.        As shown in Figure 8.2, when a change occurs or
is planned,   a determination is made whether the change is major or minor.          A major change, such
as reengineering the structure of the system, significantly affects the system.        Major changes often
involve the purchase of new hardware, software, or services or the development of new software
modules.


An organization does not need to have a specific cutoff for major-minor change decisions. A
sliding scale between the two can be implemented by using a combination of the following
methods:


       •         Major change.    A major change requires analysis to determine security
                 requirements.   The process described above can be used, although the analysis may
                 focus only on the area(s) in which the change has occurred or will occur. If the
                 original analysis and system changes have been documented throughout the life
                 cycle, the analysis will normally be much easier.        Since these changes result in
                 significant system acquisitions, development work, or changes in policy, the system
                 should be reaccredited to ensure that the residual risk is still acceptable.


       •         Minor change. Many of the changes made to a system do not require the
                 extensive analysis performed for major changes, but do require some analysis.
                 Each change can involve a limited risk assessment that weighs the pros (benefits)
                 and cons (costs) and that can even be performed on-the-fly at meetings. Even if
                 the analysis is conducted informally, decisions should still be appropriately
                 documented.     This process recognizes that even "small" decisions should be

risk-based.


8.4.4.4 Periodic Reaccreditation


Periodically, it is useful to formally reexamine the security of a system from a wider perspective.
The analysis, which leads to reaccreditation, should address such questions as: Is the security still
sufficient? Are major changes needed?


The reaccreditation should address high-level security and management concerns as well as the
implementation of the security.     It is not

always necessary to perform a new risk
assessment or certification in conjunction with
                                                           It is important to consider legal r^uirements for

uncover security concerns that result in
system changes. After the system has been changed, it may need testing (including certification).
Management then reaccredits the system for continued operation if the risk is acceptable.

8.4.5 Disposal


The disposal phase of the computer system life cycle involves the disposition of information,
hardware, and software. Information may be
moved to another system, archived, discarded,
or destroyed.    When archiving information,
                                                                              Media Sanitization

prevent the software from being transferred.


Measures may also have to be taken for the future use of data that has been encrypted, such as
taking appropriate steps to ensure the secure long-term storage of cryptographic keys.


8.5 Interdependencies


Like many management controls, life cycle planning relies upon other controls. Three closely
linked control areas are policy, assurance, and risk management.


Policy.   The development of system-specific policy is an integral part of determining the security
requirements.


Assurance.    Good life cycle management provides assurance that security is appropriately
considered in system design and operation.


Risk Management. The maintenance of security throughout the operational phase of a system is a
process of risk management: analyzing risk, reducing risk, and monitoring safeguards. Risk
assessment is a critical element in designing the security of systems and in reaccreditations.


8.6 Cost Considerations

Security is a factor throughout the life cycle of a system. Sometimes security choices are made by
default, without anyone analyzing why choices are made; sometimes security choices are made
carefully, based on analysis.   The first case is likely to result in a system with poor security that is
susceptible to many types of loss. In the second case, the cost of life cycle management should be
much smaller than the losses avoided. The major cost considerations for life cycle management
are personnel costs and some delays as the system progresses through the life cycle for
completing analyses and reviews and obtaining management approvals.


It is possible to   overmanage a system: to spend more time planning, designing, and analyzing risk
than is necessary. Planning, by itself, does not further the mission or business of an organization.
Therefore, while security life cycle management can yield significant benefits, the effort should be
commensurate with the system's size, complexity, and sensitivity and the risks associated with the
system. In general, the higher the value of the system, the newer the system's architecture,
technologies, and practices, and the worse the impact if the system security fails, the more effort
should be spent on life cycle management.

                                                 ASSURANCE

Computer security assurance is the degree of confidence one has that the security measures, both
technical and operational, work as intended to protect the system and the information it processes.
Assurance is not, however, an absolute guarantee that the measures work as intended. Like the
closely related areas of reliability and quality, assurance can be difficult to analyze; however, it is
something people expect and obtain (though often without realizing it). For example, people may
routinely get product recommendations from colleagues but may not consider such
recomjnendations as providing assurance.


Assurance is a degree of confidence, not a
true measure of how secure the system                           Security assurance is the degree of confidence one has

actually is. This distinction is necessary                      that the security controls operate correctly and protect
                                                                the system as intended.
because it is extremely difficult ~ and in many
cases virtually impossible — to know exactly
how secure a system is.

Assurance is a challenging subject because it is difficult to describe and even more difficult to
quantify.   Because of this, many people refer to assurance as a "warm fuzzy feeling" that controls
work as intended. However, it is possible to apply a more rigorous approach by knowing two
things: (1) who needs to be assured and (2) what types of assurance can be obtained. The person
who needs to be assured is the management official who is ultimately responsible for the security
of the system. Within the federal government, this person is the authorizing or accrediting
ojficiaV^


There are many methods and tools for obtaining assurance. For discussion purposes, this chapter
categorizes assurance in terms of a general system life cycle.              The chapter first discusses planning
for assurance and then presents the two categories of assurance methods and tools: (1) design and
implementation assurance and (2) operational assurance. Operational assurance is further
categorized into audits and monitoring.


The division between design and implementation assurance and operational assurance can be
fuzzy. While such issues as configuration management or audits are discussed under operational
assurance, they may also be vital during a system's development. The discussion tends to focus
more on technical issues during design and implementation assurance and to be a mixture of



     Accreditation is a process used primarily within the federal government.   It is the process of managerial

authorization for processing. Different agencies may use other terms for this approval function.   The terms used here are
consistent with Federal Information Processing Standard 102, Guideline for Computer Security Certification and
Accreditation. (See reference section of this chapter.)

management, operational, and technical issues under operational assurance. The reader should
keep in mind that the division is somewhat artificial and that there is substantial overlap.


9.1 Accreditation and Assurance


Accreditation is a management official's formal acceptance of the adequacy of a system's security.
The best way to view computer security accreditation is as a form of quality control. It forces
managers and technical staff to work together to find workable, cost-effective solutions given
security needs, technical constraints, operational constraints, and mission or business
requirements.       The accreditation process obliges managers to make the critical decision regarding
the adequacy of security safeguards and, therefore, to recognize and perform their role in securing
their systems.      In order for the decisions to be sound, they need to be based on reliable
information about the implementation of both technical and nontechnical safeguards. These
include:


         •          Technical features (Do they operate as intended?).


         •          Operational practices (Is the system operated according to stated procedures?).


         •          Overall security (Are there threats which the technical features and operational
                    practices do not address?).


         •           Remaining risks (Are they acceptable?).


A computer system should be accredited before the system becomes operational with periodic
reaccreditation after major system changes or when significant time has elapsed.^^                   Even if a
system was not initially accredited, the accreditation process can be initiated at any time.                Chapter
8 ftirther discusses accreditation.


9.1.1 Accreditation and Assurance


Assurance is an extremely important ~ but not the only ~ element in accreditation. As shown in
the diagram, assurance addresses whether the technical measures and procedures operate either
( 1 )   according to a set of security requirements and specifications or (2) according to general
quality principles.      Accreditation also addresses whether the system's security requirements are
correct and well implemented and whether the level of quality is sufficiently high. These activities
are discussed in Chapters 7 and 8.

9.1.2 Selecting Assurance Methods


The accrediting official makes the final decision about how much and what types of assurance are
needed for a system. For this decision to be informed, it is derived from a review of security, such
as a risk assessment or other study (e.g., certification), as deemed appropriate by the accrediting
official.^^    The accrediting official needs to be in a position to analyze the pros and cons of the
cost of assurance, the cost of controls, and the risks to the organization. At the end of the
accreditation process, the accrediting official wUl be the one to accept the remaining risk. Thus,




     In the past, accreditation has been defined to require a certification, which is an in-depth testing of technical
controls.   It is   now recognized within the federal government that other analyses (e.g., a risk analysis or audit) can also
provide sufficient assurance for accreditation.


                                                                 91
//.   Management Controls




the selection of assurance methods should be coordinated with the accrediting official.


In selecting assurance methods, the need for assurance should be weighed against its cost.
Assurance can be quite expensive, especially if extensive testing is done. Each method has
strengths and weaknesses in terms of cost and what kind of assurance is actually being delivered.
A combination of methods can often provide greater assurance, since no method is foolproof, and
can be less costly than extensive testing.


The accrediting official is not the only arbiter of assurance. Other officials who use the system
should also be consulted. (For example, a Production Manager who relies on a Supply System
should provide input to the Supply Manager.) In addition, there may be constraints outside the
accrediting official's control that also affect the selection of methods. For instance, some of the
methods may unduly restrict competition in acquisitions of federal information processing
resources or may be contrary to the organization's privacy policies. Certain assurance methods
may be required by organizational policy or directive.

9.2 Planning and Assurance

Assurance planning should begin during the planning phase of the system life cycle, either for new
systems or a system upgrades. Planning for assurance when planning for other system
requirements makes sense. If a system is going to need extensive testing, it should be built to
facilitate such testing.



Planning for assurance helps a manager make decisions about what kind of assurance will be cost-
effective.   If a manager waits until a system is buUt or bought to consider assurance, the number

of ways to obtain assurance may be much smaller than if the manager had planned for it earlier,
and the remaining assurance options may be more expensive.


9.3 Design and Implementation

                                                                                        9.   Assurance




with the development/acquisition and implementation phase of the system life cycle; however, it
should also be considered throughout the life cycle as the system is modified.


As stated earlier, assurance can address whether the product or system meets a set of security
specifications, or it can provide other evidence of quality.   This section outlines the major
methods for obtaining design and implementation assurance.


9.3.1 Testing and Certification


Testing can address the quality of the system as built, as implemented, or as operated. Thus, it
can be performed throughout the development cycle, after system installation, and throughout its
operational phase.    Some common testing techniques include functional testing (to see if a given
fiinction works according to its requirements) or penetration testing (to see if security can be

bypassed). These techniques can range from trying several test cases to in-depth studies using
metrics, automated tools, or multiple detailed test cases.


Certification is a formal process for testing components or systems against a specified set of
security requirements.   Certification is normally performed by an independent reviewer, rather
than one involved in building the system. Certification is more often cost-effective for complex or
high-risk systems. Less formal security testing can be used for lower-risk systems. Certification
can be performed at many stages of the system design and implementation process and can take
place in a laboratory, operating environment, or both.


9.3.2 NIST Conformance Testing and Validation Suites


NIST produces validation suites and conformance testing to determine if a product (software,
hardware, firmware) meets specified standards. These test suites are developed for specific
standards and use many methods. Conformance to standards can be important for many reasons,
including interoperability or strength of security provided.   NIST publishes a list of validated
products quarterly.


9.3.3 Use of Advanced or Trusted Development


In the development of both commercial off-the-shelf products and more customized systems, the
use of advanced or trusted system architectures, development methodologies, or software
engineering techniques can provide assurance. Examples include security design and development
reviews, formal modeling, mathematical proofs, ISO 9000 quality techniques, or use of security
architecture concepts, such as a trusted computing base (TCB) or reference monitor.


9.3.4 Use of Reliable Architectures


Some system architectures are intrinsically more reliable, such as systems that use fault-tolerance.

                                                  93
//.   Management Controls




redundance, shadowing, or redundant array of inexpensive disks (RAID) features. These
examples are primarily associated with system availability.


9.3.5 Use of Reliable Security


One factor in reliable security is the concept of ease of safe use, which postulates that a system
that is easier to secure will be more likely to be secure. Security features may be more likely to be
used when the initial system defaults to the "most secure" option. In addition, a system's security
may be deemed more reliable if it does not use very new technology that has not been tested in the
"real" world (often called "bleeding-edge" technology).    Conversely, a system that uses older,
well-tested software may be less likely to contain bugs.


9.3.6 Evaluations


A product evaluation normally includes testing. Evaluations can be performed by many types of
organizations, including government agencies, both domestic and foreign; independent
organizations, such as trade and professional organizations; other vendors or commercial groups;
or individual users or user consortia.   Product reviews in trade literature are a form of evaluation,
as are more formal reviews made against specific criteria.    Important factors for using evaluations
are the degree of independence of the evaluating group, whether the evaluation criteria reflect
needed security features, the rigor of the testing, the testing environment, the age of the
evaluation, the competence of the evaluating organization, and the limitations placed on the
evaluations by the evaluating group (e.g., assumptions about the threat or operating environment).


9.3.7 Assurance Documentation


The ability to describe security requirements and how they were met can reflect the degree to
which a system or product designer understands applicable security issues. Without a good
understanding of the requirements, it is not likely that the designer wiU be able to meet them.


Assurance documentation can address the security either for a system or for specific components.
System-level documentation should describe the system's security requirements and how they
have been implemented, including interrelationships among applications, the operating system, or
networks. System-level documentation addresses more than just the operating system, the
security system, and applications; it describes the system as integrated and implemented in a
particular environment.   Component documentation will generally be an off-the-shelf product,
whereas the system designer or implementer will generally develop system documentation.


9.3.8 Accreditation of Product to Operate in Similar Situation


The accreditation of a product or system to operate in a similar situation can be used to provide

                                                  94
                                                                                           9.   Assurance




some assurance. However, it is important to realize that an accreditation is environment- and
system-specific. Since accreditation balances risk against advantages, the same product may be
appropriately accredited for one environment but not for another, even by the same accrediting
official.



9.3.9 Self-Certification


A vendor's, integrator's, or system developer's self-certification does not rely on an impartial or
independent agent to perform a technical evaluation of a system to see how well it meets a stated
security requirement.    Even though it is not impartial, it can still provide assurance. The self-
certifier's reputation is on the Une, and a resulting certification report can be read to determine

whether the security requirement was defined and whether a meaningful review was performed.


A hybrid certification is possible where the work is performed under the auspices or review of an
independent organization by having that organization analyze the resulting report, perform spot
checks, or perform other oversight. This method may be able to combine the lower cost and
greater speed of a self-certification with the impartiality of an independent review.      The review,
however, may not be as thorough as independent evaluation or testing.


9.3.10 Warranties, Integrity Statements, and Liabilities


Warranties are another source of assurance. If a manufacturer, producer, system developer, or
integrator is willing to correct errors within certain time frames or by the next release, this should
give the system manager a sense of commitment to the product and of the product's quality.          An
integrity statement is a formal declaration or certification of the product.   It can be   backed up by a
promise to (a) fix the item (warranty) or (b) pay for losses (liability) if the product does not
conform to the integrity statement.

9.3.11 Manufacturer's Published Assertions


A manufacturer's or developer's published assertion or formal declaration provides a limited
amount of assurance based exclusively on reputation.

9.3.12 Distribution Assurance


It is often important to   know that software has arrived unmodified, especially if it is distributed
electronically.   In such cases, checkbits or digital signatures can provide high assurance that code
has not been modified. Anti-virus software can be used to check software that comes from
sources with unknown reliability (such as a bulletin board).




                                                    95
//.   Management Controls




9.4 Operational Assurance

Design and implementation assurance addresses the quality of security features built into systems.
Operational assurance addresses whether the system's technical features are being bypassed or
have vulnerabilities and whether required procedures are being followed.     It does not   address
changes in the system's security requirements, which could be caused by changes to the system
and its operating or threat environment. (These changes are addressed in Chapter 8.)


Security tends to degrade during the operational phase of the system life cycle. System users and
operators discover new ways to intentionally or unintentionally bypass or subvert security
(especially if there is a perception that bypassing security improves functionality).   Users and
administrators often think that nothing will happen to them or their system, so they shortcut
security.   Strict adherence to procedures is rare, and they become outdated, and errors in the

system's administration commonly occur.


Organizations use two basic methods to maintain operational assurance:


      •          A system audit — a one-time or periodic event to evaluate security. An audit can
                 vary widely in scope: it may examine an entire system for the purpose of
                 reaccreditation or it may investigate a single anomalous event.


      •          Monitoring — an ongoing activity that checks on the system, its users, or the
                 environment.


In general, the more "real-time" an activity is, the more it falls into the category of monitoring.
This distinction can create some unnecessary linguistic hairsplitting, especially concerning system-
generated audit trails. Daily or weekly reviewing of the audit traU (for unauthorized access
attempts) is generally monitoring, while an historical review of several months' worth of the trail
(tracing the actions of a specific user) is probably an audit.


9.4.1 Audit Methods and Tools


An audit conducted to support operational assurance examines whether the system is meeting
stated or implied security requirements including system and organization policies. Some audits
also examine whether security requirements are appropriate, but this is outside the scope of
operational assurance. (See Chapter 8.) Less formal audits are often called security reviews.




                                                  96
                                                                                                          9.   Assurance




Audits can be self-administered or independent (either internal or external).^'* Both types can
provide excellent information about technical, procedural, managerial, or other aspects of
security.   The essential difference between a
self-audit and an independent audit is

operated.    On the other hand, they may be
motivated by a strong desire to improve the security of the system. In addition, they are
knowledgeable about the system and may be able to find hidden problems.


The independent auditor, by contrast, should have no professional stake in the system.
Independent audit may be performed by a professional audit staff in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards.


There are many methods and tools, some of which are described here, that can be used to audit a
system. Several of them overlap.


9.4.1.1 Automated Tools


Even for small multiuser computer systems, it is a big job to manually review security features.
Automated tools make it feasible to review even large computer systems for a variety of security
flaws.


There are two types of automated tools: (1) active tools, which                   find vulnerabilities by trying to
exploit them, and (2) passive tests, which only examine the system and infer the existence of
problems from the state of the system.


Automated tools can be used to help find a variety of threats and vulnerabilities, such as improper
access controls or access control configurations, weak passwords, lack of integrity of the system
software, or not using all relevant software updates and patches. These tools are often very
successful at finding vulnerabilities and are sometimes used by hackers to break into systems.                         Not
taking advantage of these tools puts system administrators at a disadvantage.                       Many of the tools
are simple to use; however, some programs (such as access-control auditing tools for large




      An example of an mternal auditor in the federal government is the Inspector General. The General Accounting
Office can perform the role of external auditor in the federal government. In the private sector, the corporate audit staff
serves the role of internal auditor, while a public accounting firm would be an external auditor.

determine whether they are effective. The
auditor will often analyze both computer and       11^^11,1^^11^,1^^

noncomputer-based controls. Techniques
used include inquiry, observation, and testing (of both the controls themselves and the data). The
audit can also detect illegal acts, errors, irregularities, or a lack of compliance with laws and
regulations.   Security checklists and penetration testing, discussed below, may be used.

security plan is that it reflects the unique
security environment of the system, rather than a generic list of controls. Other checklists can be
developed, which include national or organizational security policies and practices (often referred
to as baselines).   Lists of "generally accepted security practices" (GSSPs) can also be used.                Care
needs to be taken so that deviations from the list are not automatically considered wrong, since
they may be appropriate for the system's particular environment or technical constraints.


Checklists can also be used to verify that changes to the system have been reviewed from a
security point of view.   A common audit examines the system's configuration to see if major
changes (such as connecting to the Internet) have occurred that have not yet been analyzed from a
security point of view.


9.4.1.4 Penetration Testing


Penetration testing can use many methods to attempt a system break-in. In addition to using
active automated tools as described above, penetration testing can be done "manually."                The most
useful type of penetration testing is to use methods that might really be used against the system.
For hosts on the Internet, this would certainly include automated tools. For many systems, lax
procedures or a lack of internal controls on applications are common vulnerabilities that
penetration testing can target. Another method is "social engineering," which involves getting

users or administrators to divulge information about systems, including their passwords.


9.4.2 Monitoring Methods and Tools


Security monitoring is an ongoing activity that looks for vulnerabilities and security problems.
Many of the methods are similar to those used for audits, but are done more regularly or, for
some automated tools, in real time.

9.4.2.1 Review of System Logs


As discussed in Chapter 8, a periodic review of system-generated logs can detect security
problems, including attempts to exceed access authority or gain system access during unusual
hours.


9.4.2.2 Automated Tools


Several types of automated tools monitor a system for security problems.                 Some examples follow:

•    Virus scanners are a popular means of checking for virus infections. These programs test for
     the presence of viruses in executable program files.


•    Checksumming presumes that program files should not change between updates. They work
     by generating a mathematical value based on the contents of a particular file. When the
     integrity of the file is to be verified, the checksum is generated on the current file and
     compared with the previously generated value. If the two values are equal, the integrity of
                         Program checksumming can detect viruses, Trojan horses, accidental
     the file is verified.
     changes to files caused by hardware failures, and other changes to files. However, they may
     be subject to covert replacement by a system intruder. Digital signatures can also be used.


•    Password crackers check passwords against a dictionary (either a "regular" dictionary or a
     specialized one with easy-to-guess passwords) and also check if passwords are common
     permutations of the user ID. Examples of special dictionary entries could be the names of
     regional sports teams and stars; common permutations could be the user ID spelled
     backwards.


•    Integrity verification programs can be used by such applications to look for evidence of data
     tampering, errors, and omissions. Techniques include consistency and reasonableness checks




    While penetration testing is a very powerful technique, it should preferably be conducted with the knowledge and
consent of system management.   Unknown penetration attempts can cause a lot of stress among operations personnel,
and may create unnecessary disturbances.

      and validation during data entry and processing. These techniques can check data elements,
      as input or as processed, against expected values or ranges of values; analyze transactions for
      proper flow, sequencing, and authorization; or examine data elements for expected
      relationships.     These programs comprise a very important set of processes because they can
      be used to convince people that, if they do what they should not do, accidentally or
      intentionally, they will be caught.   Many of these programs rely upon logging of individual
      user activities.


•     Intrusion detectors analyze the system audit trail, especially log-ons, connections, operating
      system calls, and various command parameters, for activity that could represent unauthorized
      activity.   Intrusion detection is covered in Chapters 12 and 18.


•     System performance monitoring analyzes system performance logs in real time to look for
      availability problems, including active attacks (such as the   1988 Internet worm) and system
      and network slowdowns and crashes.


9.4.2.3 Configuration Management


From a security point of view, configuration management provides assurance that the system in
operation is the correct version (configuration) of the system and that any changes to be made are
reviewed for security implications. Configuration management can be used to help ensure that
changes take place in an identifiable and controlled environment and that they do not
unintentionally harm any of the system's properties, including its security.    Some organizations,
particularly those with very large systems (such as the federal government), use a configuration
control board for configuration management.        When such a board exists,   it is   helpful to have a
computer security expert participate. In any case, it is useful to have computer security officers
participate in system management decision making.


Changes to the system can have security implications because they may introduce or remove
vulnerabilities and because significant changes may require updating the contingency plan, risk
analysis, or accreditation.


9.4.2.4 Trade Literature/Publications/Electronic News


In addition to monitoring the system, it is useful to monitor external sources for information.
Such sources as trade literature, both printed and electronic, have information about security
vulnerabilities, patches, and other areas that impact security. The Forum of Incident Response

Teams (FIRST) has an electronic mailing list that receives information on threats, vulnerabilities,

and patches.


9.5 Interdependencies

Assurance is an issue for every control and safeguard discussed in this handbook. Are user ID
and access privileges kept up to date? Has the contingency plan been tested? Can the audit trail
be tampered with? One important point to be reemphasized here is that assurance is not only for
technical controls, but for operational controls as well. Although the chapter focused on
information systems assurance, it is also important to have assurance that management controls
are working well.    Is the security program effective? Are policies understood and followed? As
noted in the introduction to this chapter, the need for assurance is more widespread than people
often realize.


Life Cycle.    Assurance is closely linked to the planning for security in the system life cycle.
Systems can be designed to facilitate various kinds of testing against specified security
requirements.    By planning for such testing early in the process, costs can be reduced; in some
cases, without proper planning, some kinds of assurance cannot be otherwise obtained.



9.6 Cost Considerations

There are many methods of obtaining assurance that security features work as anticipated. Since
assurance methods tend to be qualitative rather than quantitative, they wiU need to be evaluated.
Assurance can also be quite expensive, especially if extensive testing is done.     It is useful to

evaluate the amount of assurance received for the cost to make a best- value decision. In general,
personnel costs drive up the cost of assurance. Automated tools are generally limited to
addressing specific problems, but they tend to be less expensive.

                                    PERSONNEL/USER ISSUES

Many important issues in computer security involve human users, designers, implementors, and
managers. A broad range of security issues relate to how these individuals interact with
computers and the access and authorities they need to do their job.               No computer system can be
secured without properly addressing these security issues.


This chapter examines issues concerning the staffing of positions that interact with computer
systems; the administration of users on a system, including considerations for terminating
employee access; and special considerations that may arise when contractors or the public have
access to systems. Personnel issues are closely linked to logical access controls, discussed in
Chapter 17.


10.1              staffing

The staffing process generally involves at least four steps and can apply equally to general users as
well as to application managers, system management personnel, and security personnel. These
four steps are: (1) defining the job, normally involving the development of a position description;
(2) determining the sensitivity of the position; (3) filling the position, which involves screening
applicants and selecting an individual; and (4) training.


10.1.1 Groundbreaking - Position Definition


Early in the process of defining a position, security issues should be identified and dealt with.
Once a position has been broadly defined, the responsible supervisor should determine the type of
computer access needed for the position. There are two general principles to apply when granting
access: separation of duties and least privilege.


Separation of duties refers to dividing roles and responsibilities so that a single individual cannot
subvert a critical process. For example, in financial systems, no single individual should normally
be given authority to issue checks. Rather, one person initiates a request for a payment and
another authorizes that same payment. In effect, checks and balances need to be designed into
both the process as well as the specific, individual positions of personnel who will implement the
process. Ensuring that such duties are well defined is the responsibility of management.


Least privilege refers to the security objective of granting users only those accesses they need to




      A distinction is made between users and personnel, since some users (e.g., contractors and members of the public)
may not be considered personnel (i.e., employees).

                                                         107

perform their official duties. Data entry clerks, for example, may not have any need to run
analysis reports of their database.    However, least privilege does not mean that all users wiU have
extremely little functional access; some employees will have significant access if it is required for
their position.   However, applying this principle may limit the damage resulting from accidents,
errors, or unauthorized use of system resources.        It is important             to make certain that the
implementation of least privilege does not interfere with the ability to have personnel substitute
for each other without undue delay.      Without careful planning, access control can interfere with
contingency plans.


10.1.2 Determining Position Sensitivity


Knowledge of the duties and access levels that a particular position wiU require is necessary for
determining the sensitivity of the position. The responsible management official should correctly
identify position sensitivity levels so that appropriate, cost-effective screening can be completed.


Various levels of sensitivity are assigned to positions in the federal government. Determining the
appropriate level is based upon such factors as the type and degree of harm (e.g., disclosure of
private information, interruption of critical processing, computer fraud) the individual can cause
through misuse of the computer system as well as more traditional factors, such as access to
classified information and fiduciary responsibilities.      Specific agency guidance should be followed
on this matter.

It is important   to select the appropriate position sensitivity, since controls in excess of the
sensitivity of the position wastes resources, while too little may cause unacceptable risks.



10.1.3 Filling the Position -- Screening and Selecting


Once a position's sensitivity has been determined, the position is ready to be staffed.                  In the
federal government, this typically includes publishing a formal vacancy announcement and
                                                           More sensitive positions typically
identifying which applicants meet the position requirements.
require preemployment background screening; screening after employment has commenced (post-
entry-on-duty) may suffice for less sensitive positions.


Background screening helps determine

for a given position. For example, in                  duties and least privilege to limit the sensitivity of the

trustworthiness and appropriateness for a
particular position.   In the federal government, the screening process is formalized through a
series of background checks conducted through a central investigative office within the


                                                    108

organization or through another organization (e.g., the Office of Personnel Management).


Within the Federal Government, the most basic screening technique involves a check for a
criminal history, checking FBI fingerprint records, and other federal indices. More extensive
background checks examine other factors, such as a person's work and educational history,
personal interview, history of possession or use of illegal substances, and interviews with current
and former colleagues, neighbors, and friends. The exact type of screening that takes place
depends upon the sensitivity of the position and applicable agency implementing regulations.
Screening is not conducted by the prospective employee's manager; rather, agency security and
personnel officers should be consulted for agency-specific guidance.


Outside of the Federal Government, employee screening is accomplished in many ways. Policies
vary considerably among organizations due to the sensitivity of examining an individual's
background and qualifications. Organizational policies and procedures normally try to balance
fears of invasiveness and slander against the need to develop confidence in the integrity of
employees.      One technique may be to place the individual in a less sensitive position initially.

For both the Federal Government and private sector, finding something compromising in a
person's background does not necessarily mean they are unsuitable for a particular job.                     A
determination should be made based on the type of job, the type of finding or incident, and other
relevant factors. In the federal government, this process is referred to as adjudication.


10.1.4 Employee Training and Awareness


Even after a candidate has been hired, the staffing process cannot yet be considered complete -
employees still have to be trained to do their job, which includes computer security responsibilities
and duties. As discussed in Chapter 13, such security training can be very cost-effective in
promoting security.


Some computer security experts argue that employees must receive initial computer security
training before they are granted any access to computer systems.                 Others argue that this must be a
risk-based decision, perhaps granting only restricted access (or, perhaps, only access to their PC)
until the required training is completed. Both approaches recognize that adequately trained
employees are crucial to the effective functioning of computer systems and applications.
Organizations may provide introductory training prior to granting any access with follow-up more
extensive training. In addition, although training of new users is critical, it is important to
recognize that security training and awareness activities should be ongoing during the time an




     In the federal government, separate and unique screening procedures are not established for each position. Rather,
positions are categorized by general sensitivity and are assigned a corresponding level of background investigation or
other checks.

10.2            User Administration

Effective administration of users' computer access is essential to maintaining system security. User
account management focuses on identification, authentication, and access authorizations. This is
augmented by the process of auditing and otherwise periodically verifying the legitimacy of
current accounts and access authorizations. Finally, there are considerations involved in the
timely modification or removal of access and associated issues for employees who are reassigned,
promoted, or terminated, or who retire.

10.2.1 User Account Management


User account management involves (1) the process of requesting, establishing, issuing, and
closing user accounts; (2) tracking users and their respective access authorizations; and

(3) managing these functions.


User account management typically begins with a request from the user's supervisor to the system
manager for a system account.    If a user is to have access to a particular application, this request

may be sent through the application manager to the system manager. This will ensure that the
systems office receives formal approval from the "application manager" for the employee to be
given access. The request will normally state the level of access to be granted, perhaps by
function or by specifying a particular user profile. (Often when more than one employee is doing
the same job, a "profile" of permitted authorizations is created.)


Systems operations staff will normally then
use the account request to create an account                          Example of Access Levels
for the new user.   The access levels of the                           Within an Application

upon the operating system. "Add-on" access          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^m^m
applications are also used. These access
levels and authorizations are often tied to specific access levels within an application.



Next, employees will be given their account information, including the account identifier (e.g.,
user ID) and a means of authentication (e.g., password or smart card/PIN).            One issue that may
arise at this stage is whether the user ID is to be tied to the particular position an employee holds

(e.g.,   ACC5 for an accountant) or the individual employee (e.g., BSMITH for Brenda Smith).
Tying user IDs to positions may simplify administrative overhead in some cases; however, it may
make auditing more difficult as one tries to trace the actions of a particular individual.       It is

normally more advantageous to tie the user ID to the individual employee. However, if the user
ID is created and tied to a position, procedures will have to be established to change them if
employees switch jobs or are otherwise reassigned.


When employees are given their account, it is often convenient to provide initial or refresher
training and awareness on computer security issues.          Users should be asked to review a set of
rules and regulations for system access.   To indicate their understanding of these rules, many
organizations require employees to sign an "acknowledgment statement," which may also state
causes for dismissal or prosecution under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and other

It is essential to realize that access        and
authorization administration is a continuing
process. New user accounts are added whMe others are deleted. Permissions change: sometimes
permanently, sometimes temporarily. New applications are added, upgraded, and removed.
Tracking this information to keep it up to date is not easy, but is necessary to allow users access
to only those functions necessary to accomplish their assigned responsibilities - thereby helping to
maintain the principle of least privilege. In managing these accounts, there is a need to balance
timeliness of service and record keeping. While sound record keeping practices are necessary,
delays in processing requests (e.g., change requests) may lead to requests for more access than is
really necessary - just to avoid delays should such access ever be required.


Managing this process of user access is also one that, particularly for larger systems, is often
decentralized. Regional offices may be granted the authority to create accounts and change user
access authorizations or to submit forms requesting that the centralized access control function
make the necessary changes. Approval of these changes is important - it may require the
approval of the file owner and the supervisor of the employee whose access is being changed.


10.2.2 Audit and Management Reviews


From time to time, it is necessary to review user account management on a system. Within the
area of user access issues, such reviews may examine the levels of access each individual has,
conformity with the concept of least privilege, whether all accounts are still active, whether
management authorizations are up-to-date, whether required training has been completed, and so
forth.




   '"^
         Whenever users are asked to sign a document, appropriate review by organizational legal counsel and, if
applicable, by employee bargaining units should be accomplished.



                                                             112
                                                                                        10.   Personnel I User Issues




These reviews can be conducted on at least two levels:^" (1) on an application-by-application
basis or (2) on a systemwide basis. Both kinds of reviews can be conducted by, among others, in-
house systems personnel (a self-audit), the organization's internal audit staff, or external auditors.
For example, a good practice is for application managers (and data owners, if different) to review
all access levels of all application users every          month - and sign a formal access approval list,
which win provide a written record of the approvals. While it may initially appear that such
reviews should be conducted by systems personnel, they usually are not fully effective. System
personnel can verify that users only have those accesses that their managers have specified.
However because access requirements may change over time, it is important to involve the
application manager, who is often the only individual in a position to know current access
requirements.


Outside audit organizations (e.g., the Inspector General [IG] or the General Accounting Office)
may also conduct audits. For example, the IG may direct a more extensive review of permissions.
This may involve discussing the need for particular access levels for specific individuals or the
number of users with sensitive access. For example, how many employees should really have
authorization to the check-printing function? (Auditors will also examine non-computer access by
reviewing, for example, who should have physical access to the check printer or blank-check
stock.)


10.2.3 Detecting Unauthorized/Illegal Activities


Several mechanisms are used besides auditing^' and analysis of audit trails to detect unauthorized
and illegal acts. (See Chapters 9 and 18.) For example, fraudulent activities may require the
regular physical presence of the perpetrator(s). In such cases, the fraud may be detected during
the employee's absence.            Mandatory vacations for critical systems and applications personnel can
help detect such activity (however, this is not a guarantee, for example, if problems are saved for
the employees to handle upon their return).               It is useful to   avoid creating an excessive dependence
upon any single individual, since the system will have to function during periods of absence.
Particularly within the government, periodic rescreening of personnel is used to identify possible
indications of illegal activity (e.g., living a lifestyle in excess of known income level).


10.2.4 Temporary Assignments and In-house Transfers


One significant aspect of managing a system involves keeping user access authorizations up to
date.    Access authorizations are typically changed under two types of circumstances: (1) change
in job role, either temporarily (e.g., while covering for an employee on sick leave) or permanently

       The term auditing is used here in a broad sense to refer to the review and analysis of past events.

///.   Operational Controls




(e.g., after an in-house transfer) and (2) termination discussed in the following section.



Users often are required to perform duties outside their normal scope during the absence of
others. This requires additional access authorizations.               Although necessary, such extra access
authorizations should be granted sparingly and monitored careftilly, consistent with the need to
maintain separation of duties for internal control purposes. Also, they should be removed
promptly when no longer required.


Permanent changes are usually necessary when employees change positions within an
organization. In this case, the process of granting account authorizations (described in Section
10.2. 1) will occur again.       At this time, however, is it also important that access authorizations of
the prior position be removed.          Many instances of "authorization creep" have occurred with
employees continuing to maintain access rights for previously held positions within an
organization. This practice is inconsistent with the principle of least privilege.


10.2.5 Termination


Termination of a user's system access generally can be characterized as either "friendly" or
"unfriendly." Friendly termination may occur when an employee is voluntarily transferred, resigns
to accept a better position, or retires.         Unfriendly termination may include situations when the
user is being fired for cause, "RIFed,"*^ or involuntarily transferred. Fortunately, the former
situation is more common, but security issues have to be addressed in both situations.


10.2.5.1 Friendly Termination


Friendly termination refers to the removal of an employee from the organization when there is no
reason to believe that the termination is other than mutually acceptable. Since terminations can be
expected regularly, this is usually accomplished by implementing a standard set of procedures for
outgoing or transferring employees. These are part of the standard employee "out-processing,"
and are put in place, for example, to ensure that system accounts are removed in a timely manner.
Out-processing often involves a sign-out form initialed by each functional manager with an
interest in the separation.       This normally includes the group(s) managing access controls, the
control of keys, the briefing on the responsibilities for confidentiality and privacy, the library, the
property clerk, and several other functions not necessarily related to information security.


In addition, other issues should be examined as well.               The continued availability of data, for
example, must often be assured. In both the manual and the electronic worlds, this may involve
documenting procedures or filing schemes, such as how documents are stored on the hard disk,
and how are they backed up. Employees should be instructed whether or not to "clean up" their



       RIF is a term used within the government as shorthand for "reduction in force."

                                                            114
                                                                         10.   Personnel I User Issues




PC before leaving. If cryptography is used to protect data, the availability of cryptographic keys
to management personnel must be ensured.       Authentication tokens must be collected.


Confidentiality of data can also be an issue. For example, do employees know what information
they are allowed to share with their immediate organizational colleagues?   Does this differ from
the information they may share with the public?    These and other organizational-specific issues
should be addressed throughout an organization to ensure continued access to data and to provide
continued confidentiality and integrity during personnel transitions. (Many of these issues should
be addressed on an ongoing basis, not just during personnel transitions.) The training and
awareness program normally should address such issues.


10.2.5.2 Unfriendly Termination


Unfriendly termination involves the removal of an employee under involuntary or adverse
conditions. This may include termination for cause, RIF, involuntary transfer, resignation for
"personality conflicts," and situations with pending grievances.   The tension in such terminations
may multiply and complicate security issues.    Additionally, all of the issues involved in friendly
terminations are still present, but addressing them may be considerably more difficult.


The greatest threat from unfriendly terminations is likely to come from those personnel who are
capable of changing code or modifying the system or applications. For example, systems
personnel are ideally positioned to wreak considerable havoc on systems operations. Without
appropriate safeguards, personnel with such access can place logic bombs (e.g., a hidden program
to erase a disk) in code that will not even execute until after the employee's departure.   Backup
copies can be destroyed. There are even examples where code has been "held hostage." But
other employees, such as general users, can also cause damage. Errors can be input purposeftilly,
documentation can be misfiled, and other "random" errors can be made. Correcting these
situations can be extremely resource intensive.


Given the potential for adverse consequences, security specialists routinely recommend that
system access be terminated as quickly as possible in such situations. If employees are to be fired,
system access should be removed at the same time (or just before) the employees are notified of
their dismissal.   When an employee notifies an organization of a resignation and it can be
reasonably expected that it is on unfriendly terms, system access should be immediately
terminated. During the "notice" period, it may be necessary to assign the individual to a restricted
area and function. This may be particularly true for employees capable of changing programs or
modifying the system or applications. In other cases, physical removal from their offices (and, of
course, logical removal, when logical access controls exist) may suffice.

10.3              Contractor Access Considerations

Many federal agencies as well as private organizations use contractors and consultants to assist
with computer processing. Contractors are often used for shorter periods of time than regular
employees. This factor may change the cost-effectiveness of conducting screening. The often
higher turnover among contractor personnel generates additional costs for security programs in
terms of user administration.


10.4              Public Access Considerations

Many federal agencies have begun to design, develop, and implement public access systems for
electronic dissemination of information to the public. Some systems provide electronic interaction
by allowing the public to send information to the government (e.g., electronic tax filing) as well as
to receive it.   When systems are made available for access by the public (or a large or significant
subset thereof), additional security issues arise due to: (1) increased threats against public access
systems and (2) the difficulty of security administration.

access systems are subject to a greater threat
from hacker attacks on the confidentiality,
availability, and integrity of information processed by a system.        In general, it is safe to say that
when a system is made available for public access, the risk to the system increases - and often the
constraints on its use are tightened.


Besides increased risk of hackers, public access systems can be subject to insider malice. For
example, an unscrupulous user, such as a disgruntled employee, may try to introduce errors into
data files intended for distribution in order to embarrass or discredit the organization. Attacks on
public access systems could have a substantial impact on the organization's reputation and the
level of public confidence due to the high visibility of public access systems.            Other security
problems may arise from unintentional actions by untrained users.


In systems without public access, there are procedures for enrolling users that often involve some
user training and frequently require the signing of forms acknowledging user responsibilities. In
addition, user profiles can be created and sophisticated audit mechanisms can be developed to
detect unusual activity by a user. In public access systems, users are often anonymous. This can
complicate system security administration.

In most systems without public access, users are typically a mix of known employees or
contractors. In this case, imperfectly implemented access control schemes may be tolerated.
However, when opening up a system to public access, additional precautions may be necessary
because of the increased threats.


10.5              Interdependencies

User issues are tied to topics throughout this handbook.


Training and Awareness discussed in Chapter 13 is a critical part of addressing the user issues of
computer security.


Identification and Authentication and Access Controls in a computer system can only prevent
people from doing what the computer is instructed they are not allowed to do, as stipulated by
Policy.   The recognition by computer security experts that much more harm comes from people
doing what they are allowed to do, but should not do, points to the importance of considering
user issues in the computer security picture, and the importance of Auditing.


Policy, particularly its compliance component, is closely linked to personnel issues.                     A deterrent
effect arises among users when they are aware that their misconduct, intentional or unintentional,
will be detected.



These controls also depend on manager's (1) selecting the right type and level of access for their
employees and (2) informing system managers of which employees need accounts and what type
and level of access they require, and (3) promptly informing system managers of changes to
access requirements. Otherwise, accounts and accesses can be granted to or maintained for
people who should not have them.


10.6               Cost Considerations

There are many security costs under the category of user issues.                  Among these are:

Screening — Costs of initial background screening and periodic updates, as appropriate.^^


Training and Awareness ~ Costs of training needs assessments, training materials, course fees,
and so forth, as discussed separately in Chapter 13.


User Administration ~ Costs of managing identification and authentication which, particularly for



       When analyzing the costs of screening, it is important to realize that screening is often conducted to meet
requirements wholly unrelated to computer security.

III.   Operational Controls




large distributed systems, may be rather significant.


Access Administration — Particularly beyond the initial account set-up, are ongoing costs of
maintaining user accesses currently and completely.


Auditing ~ Although such costs can be reduced somewhat when using automated tools,
consistent, resource-intensive human review is still often necessary to detect and resolve security
anomalies.

               PREPARING FOR CONTINGENCIES AND DISASTERS

A computer security contingency is an event with the potential to disrupt computer operations,
thereby disrupting critical mission and business functions. Such an event could be a power
outage, hardware failure, fire, or storm. If the event is very destructive, it is often called a
disaster.^'*

planning,      this activity is closely related to

incident handling, which primarily addresses
malicious technical threats such as hackers
and viruses.*^


Contingency planning involves more than planning for a move offsite after a disaster destroys a
data center.    It   also addresses how to keep an organization's critical functions operating in the
event of disruptions, both large and small. This broader perspective on contingency planning is
based on the distribution of computer support throughout an organization.


This chapter presents the contingency planning process in six steps:^^


      1.             Identifying the mission- or business-critical functions.


     2.              Identifying the resources that support the critical functions.


      3.             Anticipating potential contingencies or disasters.


     4.              Selecting contingency planning strategies.

planning.


     Some organizations include incident handling as a subset of contingency planning. The relationship is further
discussed in Chapter 12, Incident Handling.


     Some organizations and methodologies may use a different order, nomenclature, number, or combination of steps.
The specific steps can be modified, as long as the basic functions are addressed.

critical mission or business functions is often

called a business plan.


Since the development of a business plan will be used to support contingency planning, it is
necessary not only to identify critical missions and businesses, but also to set priorities for them.
A fully redundant capability for each function is prohibitively expensive for most organizations.
In the event of a disaster, certain functions will not be performed. If appropriate priorities have
been set (and approved by senior management), it could mean the difference in the organization's
ability to survive a disaster.



11.2                Step 2: Identifying the Resources That Support Critical
Functions

After identifying critical missions and business
functions, it is necessary to identify the                       In many cases, the longer an organization is without a

which each resource is used (e.g., is the

or business of the unavailability of the
resource. In identifying resources, a traditional problem has been that different managers oversee
different resources.      They may not realize how resources interact to support the organization's
mission or business.       Many of these resources are not computer resources. Contingency planning
should address all the resources needed to perform a function, regardless whether they directly
relate to a computer.^^




       However, since this is a computer security handbook, the descriptions here focus on the computer-related
resources.   The logistics of coordinating contingency planning for computer-related and other resources is an important
consideration.



                                                           120

The analysis of needed resources should be conducted by those who understand how the function
is performed and the dependencies of various resources on other resources and other critical

relationships. This will allow an organization to assign priorities to resources since not all
elements of all resources are crucial to the critical functions.

11.2.2 Processing Capability


Traditionally contingency planning has focused        processing power (i.e., if the data center is
down, how can applications dependent on it
continue to be processed?). Although the
need for data center backup remains vital,
                                                                      Contingency Planning Teams

///.   Operational Controls




the complexity, it is normally necessary to periodically verify compatibility. (See Step 6, Testing
and Revising.)


11.2.4 Computer-Based Services


An organization uses many different kinds of computer-based services to perform its functions.
The two most important are normally communications services and information services.
Communications can be further categorized as data and voice communications; however, in many
organizations these are managed by the same service. Information services include any source of
information outside of the organization. Many of these sources are becoming automated,
including on-line government and private databases, news services, and bulletin boards.


11.2.5 Physical Infrastructure


For people to work effectively, they need a safe working environment and appropriate equipment
and utilities. This can include office space, heating, cooling, venting, power, water, sewage, other
utilities, desks,   telephones, fax machines, personal computers, terminals, courier services, file
cabinets, and many other items.      In addition, computers also need space and utilities, such as
electricity.   Electronic and paper media used to store applications and data also have physical
requirements.


11.2.6 Documents and Papers


Many functions rely on vital records and various documents, papers, or forms. These records
could be important because of a legal need (such as being able to produce a signed copy of a loan)
or because they are the only record of the information. Records can be maintained on paper,
microfiche, microfilm, magnetic media, or optical disk.


11.3                Step 3: Anticipating Potential Contingencies or Disasters

Although it is impossible to think of all the things that can go wrong, the next step is to identify a
likely range of problems.     The development of scenarios will help an organization develop a plan
to address the wide range of things that can go wrong.


Scenarios should include small and large contingencies. While some general classes of
contingency scenarios are obvious, imagination and creativity, as well as research, can point to
                                              The contingency scenarios should address each of

the resources described above. The following are examples of some of the types of questions that
contingency scenarios may address:

11.4               Step 4: Selecting Contingency Planning Strategies

The next step is to plan how to recover needed resources.                    In evaluating alternatives, it is
necessary to consider what controls are in place to prevent and minimize contingencies. Since no
set of controls can cost-effectively prevent all contingencies, it is necessary to coordinate

prevention and recovery efforts.


A contingency planning strategy normally consists of three parts: emergency response, recovery,
and resumption.        Emergency response encompasses the initial actions taken to protect lives and
limit damage. Recovery refers to the steps that are taken to continue support for critical
functions. Resumption is the return to normal operations. The relationship between recovery and
resumption is important. The longer it takes to resume normal operations, the longer the




     Some organizations divide a contingency strategy into emergency response, backup operations, and recovery. The
different terminology can be confusing (especially the use of conflicting definitions of recovery), although the basic
fiinctions performed are the same.



                                                            123

The selection of a strategy needs to be

of knowledge are needed. During a
major contingency, people will be
under significant stress and may panic.      If the contingency is a regional disaster, their first

concerns will probably be their family and property. In addition, many people will be either
unwilling or unable to come to work. Additional hiring or temporary services can be used.                        The
use of additional personnel may introduce security vulnerabilities.


Contingency planning, especially for emergency response, normally places the highest emphasis

on the protection of human life.


11.4.2 Processing Capability


Strategies for processing capability are normally grouped into five categories: hot site; cold site;
redundancy; reciprocal agreements; and hybrids. These terms originated with recovery strategies
for data centers but can be applied to other platforms.


1.   Hot site - A building already equipped with processing capability and other services.

2.   Cold site - A building for housing processors that can be easily adapted for use.

3.   Redundant site - A site equipped and configured exactly like the primary site. (Some
     organizations plan on having reduced processing capability after a disaster and use partial
     redundancy. The stocking of spare personal computers or LAN servers also provides some
     redundancy.)


4.   Reciprocal agreement - An agreement that allows two organizations to back each other up.
     (While this approach often sounds desirable, contingency planning experts note that this
     alternative has the greatest chance of failure due to problems keeping agreements and plans
     up-to-date as systems and personnel change.)


5.   Hybrids - Any combinations of the above such as using having a hot site as a backup in case
     a redundant or reciprocal agreement site is damaged by a separate contingency.


Recovery may include several stages, perhaps marked by increasing availability of processing
capability.   Resumption planning may include contracts or the ability to place contracts to replace
equipment.

///.   Operational Controls




11.4.4 Computer-Based Services


Service providers may offer contingency services. Voice communications carriers often can
reroute calls (transparently to the user) to a new location. Data communications carriers can also
reroute traffic.Hot sites are usually capable of receiving data and voice communications.         If one

service provider is down, it may be possible to use another. However, the type of
communications carrier lost, either local or long distance, is important. Local voice service may
be carried on cellular. Local data communications, especially for large volumes, is normally more
difficult.   In addition, resuming normal operations may require another rerouting of
communications services.


11.4.5 Physical Infrastructure


Hot sites and cold sites may also offer office space in addition to processing capability support.
Other types of contractual arrangements can be made for office space, security services, ftirniture,
and more in the event of a contingency.       If the contingency plan calls for moving offsite,

procedures need to be developed to ensure a smooth transition back to the primary operating
facility or to a new facility.   Protection of the physical infrastructure is normally an important part
of the emergency response plan, such as use of fire extinguishers or protecting equipment from
water damage.


11.4.6 Documents and Papers


The primary contingency strategy is usually backup onto magnetic, optical, microfiche, paper, or
other medium and offsite storage. Paper documents are generally harder to backup than
electronic ones.    A supply of forms and other needed papers can be stored offsite.

11.5               Step 5: Implementing the Contingency Strategies

Once the contingency planning strategies have been selected, it is necessary to make appropriate
preparations, document the strategies, and train employees.       Many of these tasks are ongoing.

11.5.1 Implementation


Much preparation is needed to implement the strategies for protecting critical functions and their
supporting resources. For example, one common preparation is to establish procedures for
backing up files and applications. Another is to establish contracts and agreements, //"the
contingency strategy calls for them. Existing service contracts may need to be renegotiated to
add contingency services. Another preparation may be to purchase equipment, especially to
support a redundant capability.

It is important to keep preparations,     including
documentation, up-to-date. Computer                         Backing up data files and applications is a critical part

changes. If additional equipment is needed, it
must be maintained and periodically replaced
when it is no longer dependable or no longer
fits the organization's   architecture.


Preparation should also include formally designating people who are responsible for various tasks
in the event of a contingency.     These people are often referred to as the contingency response
team. This team is often composed of people who were a part of the contingency planning team.


There are many important implementation issues for an organization.                Two of the most important
are 1) how many plans should be developed? and 2) who prepares each plan?                     Both of these
questions revolve around the organization's overall strategy for contingency planning.                The
answers should be documented in organization policy and procedures.


How Many Plans?

entire organization, and others have a plan for

upon the unique circumstances for each
organization.But it is critical to coordinate
between resource managers and functional
managers who are responsible for the mission or business.


Who Prepares the Plan ?

If an organization decides on a centralized approach to contingency planning, it may be best to

name a contingency planning coordinator. The coordinator prepares the plans in cooperation
with various functional and resource managers.        Some organizations place responsibility directly
with the functional and resource managers.

11.5.2 Documenting


The contingency plan needs to be written, kept up-to-date as the system and other factors change,
and stored in a safe place.   A written plan is critical during a contingency, especially if the person
who developed the plan is unavailable. It should clearly state in simple language the sequence of
tasks to be performed in the event of a contingency so that someone with minimal knowledge
could immediately begin to execute the plan.     It is generally helpful to        store up-to-date copies of
the contingency plan in several locations, including any off-site locations, such as alternate
processing sites or backup data storage facilities.


11.5.3 Training


All personnel should be trained in their contingency-related duties.           New personnel should be
trained as they join the organization, refresher training may be needed, and personnel will need to
practice their skills.


Training is particularly important for effective employee response during emergencies. There is
no time to check a manual to determine correct procedures if there is a fire. Depending on the
nature of the emergency, there may or may not be time to protect equipment and other assets.
Practice is necessary in order to react correctly, especially when human safety is involved.


11.6             Step 6: Testing and Revising

should be specifically assigned. The extent and frequency of testing will vary between
organizations and among systems. There are several types of testing, including reviews, analyses,
and simulations of disasters.


A review can be a simple test to check the accuracy of contingency plan documentation. For
instance, a reviewer could check if individuals listed are still in the organization and still have the
responsibilities that caused them to be included in the plan.       This test can check home and work
telephone numbers, organizational codes, and building and room numbers. The review can
determine if files can be restored from backup tapes or if employees know emergency procedures.

An analysis may be performed on the entire
plan or portions of it, such as emergency
response procedures.   It is beneficial if the
                                                         The results of a "test" often implies a grade assigned

analyst(s) may mentally follow the strategies in
the contingency plan, looking for flaws in the
logic or process used by the plan's developers.
The analyst may also interview functional managers, resource managers, and their staff to uncover
missing or unworkable pieces of the plan.


Organizations may also arrange disaster simulations. These tests provide valuable information
about flaws in the contingency plan and provide practice for a real emergency. While they can be
expensive, these tests can also provide critical information that can be used to ensure the
continuity of important functions. In general, the more critical the functions and the resources
addressed in the contingency plan, the more cost-beneficial it is to perform a disaster simulation.


11.7           Interdependencies

Since all controls help to prevent contingencies, there is an interdependency with all of the
controls in the handbook.


Risk Management provides a tool for analyzing the security costs and benefits of various
contingency planning options. In addition, a risk management effort can be used to help identify
critical resources needed to support the organization and the likely threat to those resources.                It is

not necessary, however, to perform a risk assessment prior to contingency planning, since the
identification of critical resources can be performed during the contingency planning process
itself.



Physical and Environmental Controls help prevent contingencies. Although many of the other
controls, such as logical access controls, also prevent contingencies, the major threats that a
contingency plan addresses are physical and environmental threats, such as fires, loss of power,
plumbing breaks, or natural disasters.


Incident Handling can be viewed as a subset of contingency planning.               It is the   emergency
response capability for various technical threats. Incident handling can also help an organization
prevent future incidents.


Support and Operations in most organizations includes the periodic backing up of files.                 It also

includes the prevention and recovery from more common contingencies, such as a disk failure or
corrupted data files.


Policy is needed to create and document the organization's approach to contingency planning.
The policy should explicitly assign responsibilities.


11.8            Cost Considerations

The cost of developing and implementing contingency planning strategies can be significant,
especially if the strategy includes contracts for backup services or duplicate equipment.   There are
too many options to discuss cost considerations for each type.


One contingency cost that is often overlooked is the cost of testing a plan. Testing provides many
benefits and should be performed, although some of the less expensive methods (such as a review)
may be sufficient for less critical resources.

                  COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING

Computer systems are subject to a wide range of mishaps - from corrupted data files, to viruses,
to natural disasters.    Some of these mishaps can be fixed through standard operating procedures.
For example, frequently occurring events (e.g., a mistakenly deleted file) can usually be readily
repaired (e.g., by restoration from the backup file).            More severe mishaps, such as outages caused
by natural disasters, are normally addressed in an organization's contingency plan. Other
damaging events result from deliberate malicious technical activity (e.g., the creation of viruses
or system hacking).


A computer security incident can result from a
computer virus, other malicious code, or a                       Malicious code include viruses as well as Trojan

more generally refer to those incidents that,
without technically expert response, could
result in severe damage.^'      This definition of a
computer security incident is somewhat flexible and may vary by organization and computing
environment.


Although the threats that hackers and malicious code pose to systems and networks are well
known, the occurrence of such harmful events remains unpredictable. Security incidents on larger
networks (e.g., the Internet), such as break-ins and service disruptions, have harmed various
organizations' computing capabilities. When initially confronted with such incidents, most
organizations respond in an ad hoc manner. However recurrence of similar incidents often makes
it cost-beneficial to develop a standing capability for quick discovery of and response to such


events. This is especially true, since incidents can often "spread" when left unchecked thus
increasing damage and seriously harming an organization.


Incident handUng is closely related to contingency planning as well as support and operations.                             An
incident handling capability may be viewed as a component of contingency planning, because it
provides the ability to react quickly and efficiently to disruptions in normal processing. Broadly
speaking, contingency planning addresses events with the potential to interrupt system operations.
Incident handling can be considered that portion of contingency planning that responds to

malicious technical threats.


This chapter describes how organizations can address computer security incidents (in the context
of their larger computer security program) by developing a computer security incident handling
capability^


Many organizations handle incidents as part of their user support capability (discussed in Chapter
14) or as a part of general system support.



12.1                  Benefits of an Incident Handling Capability

The primary benefits of an incident handling capability are containing and repairing damage from
incidents, and preventing future damage.               In addition, there are less obvious side benefits related
to establishing an incident handling capability.


12.1.1 Containing and Repairing Damage From Incidents

Without an incident handling capability,

         A good incident handling capability is closely linked to an organization's training and awareness program.      It   will

have educated users about such incidents and what to do when they occur. This can increase the likelihood that incidents
will be reported early, thus helping to minimize damage.



                                                              134

other systems.When viruses spread to local area networks (LANs), most or all of the connected
computers can be infected within hours. Moreover, uncoordinated efforts to rid LANs of viruses
can prevent their eradication.


Many organizations use large LANs internally and also connect to public networks, such as the
Internet. By doing so, organizations increase their exposure to threats from intruder activity,
especially if the organization has a high profile (e.g., perhaps it is involved in a controversial
program).    An incident handling capability can provide enormous benefits by responding quickly
to suspicious activity and coordinating incident handling with responsible offices and individuals,
as necessary.    Intruder activity, whether hackers or malicious code, can often affect many systems
located at many different network sites; thus, handling the incidents can be logisticaUy complex
and can require information from outside the organization.           By planning ahead, such contacts can
be preestablished and the speed of response improved, thereby containing and minimizing damage.
Other organizations may have already dealt with similar situations and may have very useful
guidance to offer in speeding recovery and minimizing damage.


12.1.2 Preventing Future Damage


An incident handling capability also assists an organization in preventing (or at least minimizing)
damage from future incidents.     Incidents can be studied internally to gain a better understanding
of the organizations's threats and vulnerabilities so more effective safeguards can be implemented.
Additionally, through outside contacts (established by the incident handling capability) early
warnings of threats and vulnerabilities can be provided. Mechanisms will already be in place to
warn users of these risks.

The incident handling capability allows an organization to learn from the incidents that it has
experienced. Data about past incidents (and the corrective measures taken) can be collected.                   The
data can be analyzed for patterns - for example, which viruses are most prevalent, which
corrective actions are most successful, and which systems and information are being targeted by
hackers. Vulnerabilities can also be identified in this process - for example, whether damage is
occurring to systems when a new software package or patch is used. Knowledge about the types
of threats that are occurring and the presence of vulnerabilities can aid in identifying security
solutions.   This information will also prove useful in creating a more effective training and
awareness program, and thus help reduce the potential for losses. The incident handling
capability assists the training and awareness program by providing information to users as to (1)
measures that can help avoid incidents (e.g.,
virus scanning) and (2) what should be done         ^^mmmmmm^^^mmmmmmmm^^^mmmmmmsm

capability, contacts will have been established with counterparts outside the organization. This
allows for early warning of threats and vulnerabilities that the organization may have not yet
experienced. Early preventative measures (generally more cost-effective than repairing damage)
can then be taken to reduce future losses. Data is also shared outside the organization to allow
others to learn from the organization's experiences.


12.1.3 Side Benefits


Finally, establishing an incident handling capability helps an organization in perhaps unanticipated

ways. Three are discussed here.


Uses of Threat and Vulnerability Data: Incident handling can greatly enhance the risk assessment
process. An incident handling capability will allow organizations to collect threat data that may be
useful in their risk assessment and safeguard selection processes (e.g., in designing new systems).
Incidents can be logged and analyzed to determine whether there is a recurring problem (or if
other patterns are present, as are sometimes seen in hacker attacks), which would not be noticed
if each incident were only viewed in isolation.                 Statistics on the numbers and types of incidents in

the organization can be used in the risk assessment process as an indication of vulnerabilities and
threats.^'*



Enhancing Internal Communications and Organization Preparedness. Organizations often find
that an incident handling capability enhances internal communications and the readiness of the
organization to respond to any type of incident, not just computer security incidents. Internal
communications will be improved; management will be better organized to receive
communications; and contacts within public affairs, legal staff, law enforcement, and other groups
win have been preestabUshed. The structure set up for reporting incidents can also be used for
other purposes.


Enhancing the Training and Awareness Program. The organization's training process can also
benefit from incident handling experiences. Based on incidents reported, training personnel will
have a better understanding of users' knowledge of security issues. Trainers can use actual
incidents to vividly illustrate the importance of computer security. Training that is based on
current threats and controls recommended by incident handling staff provides users with
information more specifically directed to their current needs - thereby reducing the risks to the
organization from incidents.




        It is   important, however, not to assume that since only n reports were made, that n is the total number of incidents;
it   is not likely that all incidents will be reported.

12.2            Characteristics of a Successful Incident Handling Capability

A successful incident handling capability has several core characteristics:

     •          an understanding of the constituency it will serve;


     •          an educated constituency;


     •          a means for centralized communications;


     •          expertise in the requisite technologies; and


     •          links to other groups to assist in incident handling (as needed).

organization. For example, an organization
may use several types of computers and
networks but may decide that its incident handling capability is cost-justified only for its personal
computer users. In doing so, the organization may have determined that computer viruses pose a
much larger risk than other malicious technical threats on other platforms. Or, a large
organization composed of several sites may decide that current computer security efforts at some
sites do not require an incident handling capability, whereas other sites do (perhaps because of the

criticality of processing).



12.2.2 Educated Constituency
                                                         Managers need to know details about incidents,

reliable performance.



12.2.3 Centralized Reporting and Communications


Successful incident handling requires that users be able to report incidents to the incident handling
team in a convenient, straightforward fashion; this is referred to as centralized reporting. A
successful incident handling capability depends on timely reporting. If it is difficult or time
consuming to report incidents, the incident handling capability may not be fully used. Usually,
some form of a hotline, backed up by pagers, works well.

Centralized communications is very useful for accessing or distributing information relevant to
the incident handling effort. For example, if users are linked together via a network, the incident
handling capability can then use the network to send out timely announcements and other
information. Users can take advantage of the network to retrieve security information stored on
servers and communicate with the incident response team via e-mail.


12.2.4 Technical Platform and Communications Expertise


The technical staff members who comprise the incident handling capability need specific
knowledge, skills, and abilities. Desirable qualifications for technical staff members may include
the ability to:


       •          work expertly with some or all of the constituency's core technology;

       •          work in a group environment;

       •          communicate effectively with different types of users, who will range from system
                  administrators to unskilled users to management to law-enforcement officials;


       •          be on-call 24 hours as needed; and


       •          travel on short notice (of course, this depends upon the physical location of the
                  constituency to be served).


12.2.5 Liaison With Other Organizations


Due to increasing computer connectivity, intruder activity on networks can affect many
organizations, sometimes including those in foreign countries. Therefore, an organization's
incident handling team may need to work with other teams or security groups to effectively handle
incidents that range beyond its constituency. Additionally, the team may need to pool its
knowledge with other teams at various times. Thus, it is vital to the success of an incident
handling capability that it establish ties and contacts with other related counterparts and

Especially important to incident handling are

organization's public affairs office, which is
trained in dealing with the news media. In
presenting information to the press, it is important that (1) attackers are not given information
that would place the organization at greater risk and (2) potential legal evidence is properly
protected.


12.3            Technical Support for Incident Handling

Incident handling will be greatly enhanced by technical mechanisms that enable the dissemination
of information quickly and conveniently.


12.3.1 Communications for Centralized Reporting of Incidents


The technical ability to report incidents is of primary importance, since without knowledge of an
incident, response is precluded.   Fortunately, such technical mechanisms are already in place in
many organizations.

For rapid response to constituency problems, a simple telephone "hotline" is practical and
convenient.  Some agencies may already have a number used for emergencies or for obtaining
help with other problems; it may be practical (and cost-effective) to also use this number for
incident handling. It may be necessary to provide 24-hour coverage for the hotline. This can be
done by staffing the answering center, by providing an answering service for nonoffice hours, or
by using a combination of an answering machine and personal pagers.

                                                         an agency may be able to signijficantly improve its
                                                         ability to handle many different types of incidents at
12.3.2 Rapid Communications Facilities                   minimal cost.


Some form of rapid communications is
essential for quickly communicating with the
constituency as well as with management officials and outside organizations. The team may need
to send out security advisories or collect information quickly, thus some convenient form of
communications, such as electronic mail, is generally highly desirable. With electronic mail, the
team can easily direct information to various subgroups within the constituency, such as system
managers or network managers, and broadcast general alerts to the entire constituency as needed.
When connectivity already exists, e-mail has low overhead and is easy to use. (However, it is
possible for the e-mail system itself to be attacked, as was the case with the 1988 Internet worm.)


Although there are substitutes for e-mail, they tend to increase response time.             An electronic
bulletin board system (BBS) can work well for distributing information, especially if it provides a
convenient user interface that encourages its use.   A BBS connected to a network is more
convenient to access than one requiring a terminal and modem; however, the latter may be the
only alternative for organizations without sufficient network connectivity. In addition,
telephones, physical bulletin boards, and flyers can be used.


12.3.3 Secure Communications Facilities


Incidents can range from the trivial to those involving national security.          Often when exchanging
information about incidents, using encrypted communications may be advisable. This will help
prevent the unintended distribution of incident-related information. Encryption technology is
available for voice, fax, and e-mail communications.



12.4            Interdependencies

An incident handling capability generally depends upon other safeguards presented in this
handbook. The most obvious is the strong link to other components of the contingency plan. The
following paragraphs detail the most important of these interdependencies.



                                                   140
                                                                             12. Incident Handling




Contingency Planning. As discussed in the introduction to this chapter, an incident handling
capability can be viewed as the component of contingency planning that deals with responding to
technical threats, such as viruses or hackers. Close coordination is necessary with other
contingency planning efforts, particularly when planning for contingency processing in the event
of a serious unavailability of system resources.


Support and Operations. Incident handling is also closely linked to support and operations,
especially user support and backups.   For example, for purposes of efficiency and cost savings,
the incident handling capability is often co-operated with a user "help desk." Also, backups of
system resources may need to be used when recovering from an incident.


Training and Awareness. The training and awareness program can benefit from lessons learned
during incident handling. Incident handling staff will be able to help assess the level of user
awareness about current threats and vulnerabilities. Staff members may be able to help train
system administrators, system operators, and other users and systems personnel. Knowledge of
security precautions (resulting from such training) helps reduce ftiture incidents.   It is also

important that users are trained what to report and how to report it.


Risk Management. The risk analysis process wiU benefit from statistics and logs showing the
numbers and types of incidents that have occurred and the types of controls that are effective in
preventing incidents. This information can be used to help select appropriate security controls
and practices.


12.5             Cost Considerations

There are a number of start-up costs and funding issues to consider when planning an incident
handling capability. Because the success of an incident handling capability relies so heavily on
users' perceptions of its worth and whether they use it, it is very important that the capability be

able to meet users' requirements.   Two important funding issues are:

Personnel.   An incident handling capability plan might call for at least one manager and one or
more technical staff members (or their equivalent) to accomplish program objectives. Depending
on the scope of the effort, however, full-time staff members may not be required. In some
situations, some staff may be needed part-time or on an on-call basis. Staff may be performing
incident handling duties as an adjunct responsibility to their normal assignments.


Education and Training. Incident handling staff will need to keep current with computer system
and security developments. Budget aDowances need to be made, therefore, for attending
conferences, security seminars, and other continuing-education events. If an organization is
located in more than one geographic areas, funds will probably be needed for travel to other sites
for handling incidents.

                     AWARENESS, TRAINING, AND EDUCATION

People, who are aU fallible, are usually recognized as one of the weakest links in securing systems.
The purpose of computer security awareness, training, and education is to enhance security by:

     •             improving awareness of the need to protect system resources;


     •             developing skills and knowledge so computer users can perform their jobs more
                   securely; and


     •             building in-depth knowledge, as needed, to design, implement, or operate security
                   programs for organizations and systems.


Making computer system users aware of their security responsibilities and teaching them correct
practices helps users change their behavior.^^           It   also supports individual accountability, which is
one of the most important ways to improve computer security. Without knowing the necessary
security measures (and to how to use them), users cannot be truly accountable for their actions.
The importance of this training is emphasized in the Computer Security Act, which requires
training for those involved with the management, use, and operation of federal computer systems.


This chapter first discusses the two overriding benefits of awareness, training, and education,
namely: (1) improving employee behavior and (2) increasing the ability to hold employees
accountable for their actions. Next, awareness, training, and education are discussed separately,
with techniques used for each. Finally, the chapter presents one approach for developing a
computer security awareness and training program.


13.1               Behavior

People are a crucial factor in ensuring the security of computer systems and valuable information
resources.    Human actions account for a far greater degree of computer-related loss than all other
sources combined.       Of such losses, the actions of an organization's insiders normally cause far
more harm than the actions of outsiders. (Chapter 4 discusses the major sources of computer-
related loss.)




   " One often-cited goal of training is changing people's attitudes. This chapter views changing attitudes as just one
step toward changing behavior.


   ^ This chapter does not discuss the specific contents of training programs. See the references for details of suggested
course contents.


                                                              143

The major causes of loss due to an organization's own employees are: errors and omissions, fraud,
and actions by disgruntled employees. One principal purpose of security awareness, training, and
education is to reduce errors and omissions. However, it can also reduce fraud and unauthorized
activity by disgruntled employees by increasing employees' knowledge of their accountability and
the penalties associated with such actions.


Management sets the example for behavior within an organization.               If employees know that

management does not care about security, no training class teaching the importance of security
and imparting valuable skills can be truly effective. This "tone from the top" has myriad effects an
organization's security program.

expected to follow policies and procedures of
which they are unaware. In addition,
enforcing penalties may be difficult if users can claim ignorance when caught doing something
wrong.


Training employees may also be necessary to show that a standard of due care has been taken in
protecting information. Simply issuing policy, with no foUow-up to implement that policy, may
not suffice.


Many organizations use acknowledgment statements which state that employees have read and
understand computer security requirements. (An example is provided in Chapter 10.)


13.3            Awareness
                                                         Security awareness programs: (1) set the stage for

attitudes toward security.       Appropriate awareness for other groups, such as system programmers
or information analysts, should address the need for security as it relates to their job. In today's
systems environment, almost everyone in an organization may have access to system resources -
and therefore may have the potential to cause harm.

               Figure 13.1 compares some of the differences in awareness, training, and education.




Awareness is used to reinforce the fact that security supports the mission of the organization by
protecting valuable resources. If employees view security as just bothersome rules and
procedures, they are more likely to ignore them. In addition, they may not make needed
suggestions about improving security nor recognize and report security threats and vulnerabilities.


Awareness also is used to remind people of basic security practices, such as logging off a
computer system or locking doors.


Techniques.   A security awareness program can use many teaching methods, including video

notices at log-on, talks, or lectures.   Awareness is often incorporated into basic security training
and can use any method that can change employees' attitudes.

13.4            Training

The purpose of training is to teach people the skills that will enable them to perform their jobs
more securely. This includes teaching people what they should do and how they should (or can)
do it. Training can address many levels, from basic security practices to more advanced or
specialized skills. It can be specific to one computer system or generic enough to address aU
systems.


Training is most effective when targeted to a specific audience. This enables the training to focus
on security-related job skills and knowledge that people need performing their duties.                 Two types
of audiences are general users and those who require specialized or advanced skills.


General Users. Most users need to understand good computer security practices, such as:


       •        protecting the physical area and equipment (e.g., locking doors, caring for floppy
                diskettes);


       •        protecting passwords (if used) or other authentication data or tokens (e.g., never
                divulge PINs); and


       •        reporting security violations or incidents (e.g., whom to call if a virus is
                suspected).


In addition, general users should be taught the organization's policies for protecting information
and computer systems and the roles and responsibilities of various organizational units with which
they may have to interact.

In teaching general users, care should be taken not to overburden them with unneeded details.
These people are the target of multiple training programs, such as those addressing safety, sexual
harassment, and AIDS in the workplace. The training should be made useful by addressing
security issues that directly affect the users.   The goal is to improve basic security practices, not
to make everyone literate in all the jargon or philosophy of security.


Specialized or Advanced Training.       Many groups need more advanced or more specialized
training than just basic security practices.   For example, managers may need to understand
security consequences and costs so they can factor security into their decisions, or system
administrators may need to know how to implement and use specific access control products.


There are many different ways to identify
individuals or groups who need specialized or             One group that has been targeted for speciahzed

advanced training for user groups and training
for a new system. This is further discussed in
the section 13.6 of this chapter.


Techniques.    A security training program normally includes training classes, either strictly devoted
to security or as added special sections or modules within existing training classes. Training may
be computer- or lecture-based (or both), and may include hands-on practice and case studies.
Training, like awareness, also happens on the job.


13.5             Education

Security education is more in-depth than security training and is targeted for security professionals
and those whose jobs require expertise in security.


Techniques. Security education is normally outside the scope of most organization awareness and
training programs.   It is   more appropriately a part of employee career development. Security
education is obtained through college or graduate classes or through specialized training
programs. Because of this, most computer security programs focus primarily on awareness and

training, as does the remainder of this chapter.



13.6                 Implementation^^

An effective computer security awareness and training (CSAT) program requires proper planning,
implementation, maintenance, and periodic evaluation. The following seven steps constitute one
approach for developing a CSAT program.


        Step 1   :   Identify Program Scope, Goals, and Objectives.


       Step 2:       Identify Training Staff.


        Step 3:      Identify Target Audiences.


        Step 4:      Motivate Management and Employees.


        Step 5:      Administer the Program.


        Step 6:      Maintain the Program.


        Step 7:      Evaluate the Program.

particular systems, a large organizationwide program may need to be supplemented by more
specific programs.      In addition, the organization should specifically address whether the program
applies to employees only or also to other users of organizational systems.


Generally, the overall goal of a CS    AT program is to sustain an appropriate level of protection for
computer resources by increasing employee awareness of their computer security responsibilities
and the ways to fulfill them. More specific goals may need to be established. Objectives should
be defined to meet the organization's specific goals.


13.6.2 Identify Training Staff


There are many possible candidates for conducting the training including internal training
departments, computer security staff, or contract services. Regardless of who is chosen, it is
important that trainers have sufficient knowledge of computer security issues, principles, and
techniques.   It is   also vital that they know how to communicate information and ideas effectively.


13.6.3 Identify Target Audiences


Not everyone needs the same degree or type of computer security information to do their jobs. A
CSAT program that distinguishes between groups of people, presents only the information needed
by the particular audience, and omits irrelevant information will have the best results. Segmenting
audiences (e.g., by their function or familiarity with the system) can also improve the effectiveness
of a CSAT program. For larger organizations, some individuals will fit into more than one group.
For smaller organizations, segmenting may not be needed. The following methods are some
examples of ways to do this.


Segment according to level of awareness. Individuals may be separated into groups according to
their current level of awareness.     This may require research to determine how well employees
follow computer security procedures or understand how computer security fits into their jobs.


Segment according to general job task or function. Individuals may be grouped as data
providers, data processors, or data users.


Segment according to specific job category. Many organizations assign individuals to job
categories. Since each job category generally has different job responsibilities, training for each
                Examples of job categories could be general management, technology
will be different.

management, applications development, or security.


Segment according to level of computer knowledge. Computer experts may be expected to find a
program containing highly technical information more valuable than one covering the management
issues in computer security. Similarly, a computer novice would benefit more from a training
program that presents introductory fundamentals.

                                                    149
///.   Operational Controls




Segment according to types of technology or systems used. Security techniques used for each
off-the-shelf product or application system will usually vary. The users of major applications will
normally require training specific to that application.


13.6.4 Motivate Management and Employees


To successfully implement an awareness and training program, it is important to gain the support
of management and employees. Consideration should be given to using motivational techniques
to show management and employees how their participation in the            CSAT program will benefit the
organization.


Management. Motivating management normally relies upon increasing awareness. Management
needs to be aware of the losses that computer security can reduce and the role of training in
computer security. Management commitment is necessary because of the resources used in
developing and implementing the program and also because the program affects their staff.


Employees. Motivation of managers alone is
not enough. Employees often need to be                  Employees and managers should be solicited to
convinced of the merits of computer security            provide input to the CSAT program. Individuals are
                                                        more likely to support a program when they have

appropriate training, many employees will not
fully comprehend the value of the system

resources with which they work.


Some awareness techniques were discussed above. Regardless of the techniques that are used,
employees should feel that their cooperation will have a beneficial impact on the organization's
future (and, consequently, their own).


13.6.5 Administer the Program


There are several important considerations for administering the CSAT program.


Visibility. The visibility of a CSAT program plays a key role in its success. Efforts to achieve
high visibility should begin during the early stages of CSAT program development. However,
care should be give not to promise what
cannot be delivered.

above (in the Techniques sections). Computer security awareness and training can be added to
existing courses and presentations or taught separately.     On-the-job training should also be
considered.


Training Topics. There are more topics in computer security than can be taught in any one
course. Topics should be selected based on the audience's requirements.


Training Materials. In general, higher-quality training materials are more favorably received and
are more expensive. Costs, however, can be minimized since training materials can often be
obtained from other organizations. The cost of modifying materials is normally less than
developing training materials from scratch.


Training Presentation. Consideration should be given to the frequency of training (e.g., annually
or as needed), the length of training presentations (e.g., 20 minutes for general presentations, one
hour for updates or one week for an off-site class), and the style of training presentation (e.g.,
formal presentation, informal discussion, computer-based training, humorous).


13.6.6 Maintain the Program


Computer technology is an ever-changing field. Efforts should be made to keep abreast of
changes in computer technology and security requirements. A training program that meets an
organization's needs today may become ineffective when the organization starts to use a new
application or changes its environment, such as by connecting to the Internet. Likewise, an
awareness program can become obsolete if laws or organization policies change. For example,
the awareness program should make employees aware of a new policy on e-mail usage.
Employees may discount the CS AT program, and by association the importance of computer
security, if the program does not provide current information.


13.6.7 Evaluate the Program


It is often difficult to   measure the effectiveness of an awareness or training program.
Nevertheless, an evaluation should attempt to ascertain how much information is retained, to what
extent computer security procedures are being followed, and general attitudes toward computer
security. The results of such an evaluation should help identify and correct problems. Some
evaluation methods (which can be used in conjunction with one another) are:


     •           Use student evaluations.

     •           Observe how well employees follow recommended security procedures.


     •           Test employees on material covered.

       •           Monitor the number and kind of computer security incidents reported before and
                   after the program is implemented.



13.7               Interdependencies

Training can, and in most cases should, be used to support every control in the handbook. All
controls are more effective if designers, implementers, and users are thoroughly trained.


Policy. Training is a critical means of informing employees of the contents of and reasons for the
organization's policies.


Security Program Management. Federal agencies need to ensure that appropriate computer
security awareness and training is provided, as required under the Computer Security Act of
1987.      A security program should ensure that an organization is meeting all applicable laws and
regulations.


Personnel/User Issues. Awareness, training, and education are often included with other
personnel/user issues. Training is often required before access is granted to a computer system.


13.8               Cost Considerations

The major cost considerations in awareness, training, and education programs are:

       •           the cost of preparing and updating materials, including the time of the preparer;


       •           the cost of those providing the instruction;


       •           employee time attending courses and lectures or watching videos; and

       •           the cost of outside courses and consultants (both of which may including travel
                   expenses), including course maintenance.

      The number of incidents will not necessarily go down. For example, virus-related losses may decrease when users
know the proper procedures to avoid infection. On the other hand, reports of incidents may go up as users employ virus
scanners and find more viruses. In addition, users will now know that virus incidents should be reported and to whom
the reports should be sent.

It does not   include system planning or design         may have a part-time administrator.
The support and operation of any computer
system, from a three-person local area
network to a worldwide application serving
thousands of users, is critical to maintaining the security of a system. Support and operations are
routine activities that enable computer systems to function correctly. These include fixing
software or hardware problems, loading and maintaining software, and helping users resolve
problems.


The failure to consider security as part of the support and operations of computer systems is, for
many organizations, their Achilles heel. Computer security system literature includes many
examples of how organizations undermined their often expensive security measures because of
poor documentation, old user accounts, conflicting software, or poor control of maintenance
accounts. Also, an organization's policies and procedures often fail to address many of these
important issues.


The important security considerations within some of the major categories of support and
operations are:


                  user support,
                  software support,                     Ttie primary goal of computer support and operations

Some special considerations are noted for larger or smaller systems.

This chapter addresses the support and operations activities directly related to security. Every
control discussed in this handbook relies, in one way or anothfer, on computer system support and
operations. This chapter, however, focuses on areas not covered in other chapters. For example,
operations personnel normally create user accounts on the system. This topic is covered in the
Identification and Authentication chapter, so it is not discussed here.             Similarly, the input from
support and operations staff to the security awareness and training program is covered in the
Security Awareness, Training, and Education chapter.


14.1              User Support

In many organizations, user support takes place through a Help Desk. Help Desks can support an
entire organization, a subunit, a specific system, or a combination of these.               For smaller systems,
the system administrator normally provides direct user support. Experienced users provide
informal user support on most systems.


An important security consideration for user
support personnel is being able to recognize                  User support should be closely linked to the
which problems (brought to their attention by                 organization's incident handling capability. In many

users) are security-related. For example,
                                                              ^a^^^'    ^"^^ personnel perform these ftmctions.

users' inability to log onto a com.puter system           ^^i^ammmi^mmm^^^^^^^K^m^mmmmt^
may result from the disabling of their accounts
due to too many failed access attempts. This could indicate the presence of hackers trying to
guess users' passwords.


In general, system support and operations staff need to be able to identify security problems,
respond appropriately, and inform appropriate individuals.             A wide range of possible security
problems exist.     Some will be internal to custom applications, while others apply to off-the-shelf
products. Additionally, problems can be software- or hardware-based.


The more responsive and knowledgeable
system support and operation staff personnel                  SmaU systems are especially susceptible to viruses,

       In general, larger systems include mainframes, large minicomputers, and WANs. Smaller systems include PCs
and LANs.

14.2              Software Support

Software is the heart of an organization's computer operations, whatever the size and complexity
of the system. Therefore, it is essential that software function correctly and be protected from
corruption. There are many elements of software support.


One is controlling what software is used on a system.             If users or systems personnel can load and

execute any software on a system, the system is more vulnerable to viruses, to unexpected
software interactions, and to software that may subvert or bypass security controls.                       One method
of controlling software is to inspect or test software before it is loaded (e.g., to determine
compatibility with custom applications or identify other unforeseen interactions). This can apply
to new software packages, to upgrades, to off-the-shelf products, or to custom software, as
deemed appropriate.       In addition to controlling the loading and execution of new software,
organizations should also give care to the configuration and use of powerful system utilities.
System utilities can compromise the integrity of operating systems and logical access controls.

A second element in software support can be
to ensure that software has not been modified                 Viruses take advantage of the weak software controls
without proper authorization. This involves                   in personal computers. Also, there are powerful
                                                              utilities available for   PCs that can restore deleted

This can be done with a combination of

Many organizations also include a program to
                                                              There are several widely available utilities that look

required.    For example, an organization may

with PCs and LANs, but can apply to any type
of system.


14.3              Configuration Management

Closely related to software support is configuration management - the process of keeping track
of changes to the system and, if needed, approving them.'°^ Configuration management normally
addresses hardware, software, networking, and other changes; it can be formal or informal. The
primary security goal of configuration management is ensuring that changes to the system do not
unintentionally or unknowingly diminish security. Some of the methods discussed under software




       This chapter only addresses configuration management during the operational phase. Configuration management
can have extremely important security consequences during the development phase of a system.

support, such as inspecting and testing software changes, can be used. Chapter 9 discusses other
methods.


Note that the security goal is to know what
changes occur, not to prevent security from             For networked systems, configuration management

when security will be reduced. However, the

decision based on all appropriate factors.


A second security goal of configuration
management is ensuring that changes to the system are reflected in other documentation, such as
the contingency plan. If the change is major, it may be necessary to reanalyze some or all of the
security of the system. This is discussed in Chapter 8.



14.4            Backups

Support and operations personnel and
sometimes users back up software and data.              Users of smaller systems are often responsible for

what backup schedule is appropriate. Also, as
a safety measure, it is useful to test that
backup copies are actually usable.    Finally, backups should be stored securely, as appropriate

(discussed below).


14.5            Media Controls

Media controls include a variety of measures to provide physical and environmental protection
and accountability for tapes, diskettes, printouts, and other media. From a security perspective,
media controls should be designed to prevent the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability of
information, including data or software, when stored outside the system. This can include storage
of information before it is input to the system and after it is output.


The extent of media control depends upon many factors, including the type of data, the quantity
of media, and the nature of the user environment. Physical and environmental protection is used
to prevent unauthorized individuals from accessing the media.         It   also protects against such
factors as heat, cold, or harmful magnetic fields.   When necessary, logging the use of individual

                                 14.   Security Considerations in Computer Support and Operations




media (e.g., a tape cartridge) provides detailed accountability - to hold authorized people
responsible for their actions.


14.5.1 Marking


Controlling media may require some form of physical labeling.             The labels can be used to identify
media with special handling instructions, to locate needed information, or to log media (e.g., with
serial/control numbers or bar codes) to support accountability.           Identification is often by colored
labels on diskettes or tapes or banner pages on printouts.


If labeling is used for special handling

instructions, it is critical that people be              Typical markings for media could include: Privacy

14.5.2 Logging


The logging of media is used to support
accountability. Logs can include control numbers (or other tracking data), the times and dates of
transfers, names and signatures of individuals involved, and other relevant information. Periodic

spot checks or audits may be conducted to determine that no controlled items have been lost and
that all are in the custody of individuals named in control logs.         Automated media tracking
systems may be helpful for maintaining inventories of tape and disk libraries.


14.5.3 Integrity Verification


When electronically stored information is read into a computer system, it may be necessary to
determine whether it has been read correctly or subject to any modification. The integrity of
electronic information can be verified using error detection and correction or, if intentional
modifications are a threat, cryptographic-based technologies. (See Chapter 19.)


14.5.4 Physical Access Protection


Media can be stolen, destroyed, replaced with a look-alike copy, or lost. Physical access controls,
which can limit these problems, include locked doors, desks, file cabinets, or safes.


If the media requires protection at all times, it m^y be necessary to actually output data to the

media in a secure location (e.g., printing to a printer in a locked room instead of to a general-
purpose printer in a common area).


                                                   159
///.   Operational Controls




Physical protection of media should be extended to backup copies stored offsite.     They generally
should be accorded an equivalent level of protection to media containing the same information
stored onsite. (Equivalent protection does not mean that the security measures need to be exactly
the same. The controls at the off-site location are quite likely to be different from the controls at
the regular site.) Physical access is discussed in Chapter 15.


14.5.5 Environmental Protection


Magnetic media, such as diskettes or magnetic tape, require environmental protection, since they
are sensitive to temperature, liquids, magnetism, smoke, and dust. Other media (e.g., paper and
optical storage) may have different sensitivities to environmental factors.


14.5.6 Transmittal


Media control may be transferred both within the organization and to outside elements.
Possibilities for securing such transmittal include sealed and marked envelopes, authorized

messenger or courier, or U.S. certified or registered mail.


14.5.7 Disposition
                                                        Many people throw away old diskettes, believing that

process of removing information from media
is called sanitization.




Three techniques are commonly used for media sanitization: overwriting, degaussing, and
destruction. Overwriting is an effective method for clearing data from magnetic media. As the
name implies, overwriting uses a program to write ( 1 s, Os, or a combination) onto the media.
Common practice is to overwrite the media three times. Overwriting should not be conftised with
merely deleting the pointer to a file (which typically happens when a delete command is used).
Overwriting requires that the media be in working order. Degaussing is a method to magnetically
erase data from magnetic media.     Two types of degausser exist: strong permanent magnets and
electric degaussers.   The final method of sanitization is destruction of the media by shredding or
burning.

14.6              Documentation

Documentation of all aspects of computer support and operations is important to ensure
continuity and consistency. Formalizing operational practices and procedures with sufficient
detail helps to eliminate security lapses and oversights, gives new personnel sufficiently detailed
instructions, and provides a quality assurance function to help ensure that operations will be
performed correctly and efficiently.


The security of a system also needs to be documented. This includes many types of
documentation, such as security plans, contingency plans, risk analyses, and security policies and
procedures.     Much of this information, particularly risk and threat analyses, has to be protected
against unauthorized disclosure. Security documentation also needs to be both current and
accessible.    Accessibility should take special factors into account (such as the need to find the
contingency plan during a disaster).


Security documentation should be designed to fulfill the needs of the different types of people
who use it. For this reason, many organizations separate documentation into policy dLnd
procedures.     A security procedures manual should be written to inform various system users how
to do their jobs securely.   A security procedures manual for systems operations and support staff
may address a wide variety of technical and operational concerns in considerable detail.

14.7              Maintenance

System maintenance requires either physical or logical access to the system. Support and
operations staff, hardware or software vendors, or third-party service providers may maintain a
system. Maintenance may be performed on site, or it may be necessary to move equipment to a
repair site.   Maintenance may also be performed remotely via communications connections.                   If

someone who does not normally have access to the system performs maintenance, then a security
vulnerability is introduced.


In some circumstances, it may be necessary to take additional precautions, such as conducting
background investigations of service personnel. Supervision of maintenance personnel may
prevent some problems, such as "snooping around" the physical area. However, once someone
has access to the system, it is very difficult for supervision to prevent damage done through the
maintenance process.


Many computer systems provide maintenance
accounts. These special log-in accounts are               One of the most common methods hackers use to

otherwise disable the accounts until they are needed. Procedures should be developed to ensure
that only authorized maintenance personnel can use these accounts.      If the account is to be used

remotely, authentication of the maintenance provider can be performed using call-back
confirmation. This helps ensure that remote diagnostic activities actually originate from an
established phone number at the vendor's site. Other techniques can also help, including
encryption and decryption of diagnostic communications; strong identification and authentication
techniques, such as tokens; and remote disconnect verification.


Larger systems may have diagnostic ports. In addition, manufacturers of larger systems and
third-party providers may offer more diagnostic and support services.     It is critical to ensure that

these ports are only used by authorized personnel and cannot be accessed by hackers.


14.8            Interdependencies

There are support and operations components in most of the controls discussed in this handbook.


Personnel.   Most support and operations staff have special access to the system. Some
organizations conduct background checks on individuals filling these positions to screen out
possibly untrustworthy individuals.


Incident Handling. Support and operations may include an organization's incident handling staff.
Even if they are separate organizations, they need to work together to recognize and respond to
incidents.


Contingency Planning. Support and operations normally provides technical input to contingency
planning and carries out the activities of making backups, updating documentation, and practicing
responding to contingencies.


Security Awareness, Training, and Education. Support and operations staff should be trained in
security procedures and should be aware of the importance of security. In addition, they provide
technical expertise needed to teach users how to secure their systems.


Physical and Environmental. Support and operations staff often control the immediate physical
area around the computer system.


Technical Controls. The technical controls are installed, maintained, and used by support and
operations staff.   They create the user accounts, add users to access control lists, review audit
logs for unusual activity, control bulk encryption over telecommunications links, and perform the
countless operational tasks needed to use technical controls effectively. In addition, support and
operations staff provide needed input to the selection of controls based on their knowledge of
system capabilities and operational constraints.



                                                   162
                               14.   Security Considerations in Computer Support and Operations




Assurance. Support and operations staff ensure that changes to a system do not introduce
security vulnerabilities by using assurance methods to evaluate or test the changes and their effect
on the system. Operational assurance is normally performed by support and operations staff.


14.9            Cost Considerations

The cost of ensuring adequate security in day-to-day support and operations is largely dependent
upon the size and characteristics of the operating environment and the nature of the processing
being performed. If sufficient support personnel are already available, it is important that they be
trained in the security aspects of their assigned jobs; it is usually not necessary to hire additional
support and operations security specialists. Training, both initial and ongoing, is a cost of
successfully incorporating security measures into support and operations activities.


Another cost is that associated with creating and updating documentation to ensure that security
concerns are appropriately reflected in support and operations policies, procedures, and duties.

                  PHYSICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SECURITY

The term physical and environmental
security, as used in this chapter, refers to                  Physical and environmental security controls are
measures taken to protect systems, buildings,                 implemented to protect the facility housing system
                                                              resources, the system resources themselves, and the
and related supporting infrastructure against
                                                              facilities used to support their operation.
threats associated with their physical
environment.       Physical and environmental
security controls include the following three
broad areas:


     1.   The physical facility is usually the building, other structure, or vehicle housing the system
     and network components. Systems can be characterized, based upon their operating
     location, as static, mobile, or portable.      Static systems are installed in structures at fixed
     locations.   Mobile systems are installed in vehicles that perform the function of a structure,
     but not at a fixed location. Portable systems are not installed in fixed operating locations.
     They may be operated in wide variety of locations, including buildings or vehicles, or in the
     open. The physical characteristics of these structures and vehicles determine the level of
     such physical threats as fire, roof leaks, or unauthorized access.


     2.   The facility's general geographic operating location determines the characteristics of
     natural threats, which include earthquakes and flooding; man-made threats such as burglary,
     civil disorders, or interception of transmissions and emanations; and damaging nearby

     activities, including toxic chemical spills, explosions, fires, and electromagnetic interference

     from emitters, such as radars.

     3.   Supporting facilities are those services (both technical and human) that underpin the
     operation of the system.      The system's operation usually depends on supporting facilities such
     as electric power, heating and air conditioning, and telecommunications.     The failure or
     substandard performance of these facilities may interrupt operation of the system and may
     cause physical damage to system hardware or stored data.


This chapter first discusses the benefits of physical security measures, and then presents an
overview of common physical and environmental security controls. Physical and environmental
security measures result in many benefits, such as protecting employees. This chapter focuses on
the protection of computer systems from the following:

///.   Operational Controls




Interruptions in Providing Computer Services.          An external threat may interrupt the scheduled
operation of a system.     The magnitude of the losses depends on the duration and timing of the
service interruption and the characteristics of the operations end users perform.


Physical Damage.        If a system's hardware is damaged or destroyed, it usually has to be repaired
or replaced. Data may be destroyed as an act of sabotage by a physical attack on data storage
media (e.g., rendering the data unreadable or only partly readable).        If data stored by a system for

operational use is destroyed or corrupted, the data needs to be restored from back-up copies or
from the original sources before the system can be used. The magnitude of loss from physical
damage depends on the cost to repair or replace the damaged hardware and data, as well as costs
arising from service interruptions.


Unauthorized Disclosure of Information. The physical characteristics of the facility housing a
system may permit an intruder to gain access both to media external to system hardware (such as
diskettes, tapes and printouts) and to media within system components (such as frxed disks),
transmission lines or display screens. All may result in loss of disclosure-sensitive information.


Loss of Control over System Integrity.        If an intruder gains access to the central processing unit, it

is usually possible to reboot the system and bypass logical access controls.        This can lead to
information disclosure, fraud, replacement of system and application software, introduction of a
Trojan horse, and more. Moreover, if such access is gained, it may be very difficult to determine
what has been modified, lost, or corrupted.


Physical Theft.     System hardware may be stolen. The magnitude of the loss is determined by the
costs to replace the stolen hardware and restore data stored on stolen media. Theft may also
result in service interruptions.



This chapter discusses seven major areas of physical and environmental security controls:


       •          physical access controls,

only the area containing system hardware, but

must be identified.


It is also important to review the effectiveness

of physical access controls in each area, both            There are many types of physical access controls,

unoccupied. Effectiveness depends on both
the characteristics of the control devices used      mmmmm^^^^^^^^m^^^^^^^^^^^^^

implementation and operation. Statements to the effect that "only authorized persons may enter
this area" are not particularly effective.   Organizations should determine whether intruders can
easily defeat the controls, the extent to which strangers are challenged, and the effectiveness of
other control procedures. Factors like these modify the effectiveness of physical controls.


The feasibility of surreptitious entry also needs to be considered. For example, it may be possible
to go over the top of a partition that stops at the underside of a suspended ceiling or to cut a hole
in a plasterboard partition in a location hidden by fijrniture.      If a door is controlled by a

combination. If keycards are not carefully controlled, an intruder may be able to steal a card left
on a desk or use a card passed back by an accomplice.

Corrective actions can address any of the factors listed above. Adding an additional barrier
reduces the risk to the areas behind the barrier.
Enhancing the screening at an entry point can reduce
the number of penetrations. For example, a guard

supply of fiiel, material that will burn to support its growth, and an adequate supply of oxygen.
Once a fire becomes established, it depends on the combustible materials in the building (referred
to as the fire load) to support its further growth. The more fuel per square meter, the more
intense the fire will be.


Building Operation.          If a building is well maintained and operated so as to minimize the

accumulation of fuel (such as maintaining the integrity of fire barriers), the fire risk wiU be
minimized.


Building Occupancy.           Some occupancies are inherently more dangerous than others because of
an above-average number of potential ignition sources. For example, a chemical warehouse may
contain an above-average fuel load.


Fire Detection.       The more quickly a fire is detected, all other things being equal, the more easily
it   can be extinguished, minimizing damage.             It is also important to accurately pinpoint the location

of the fire.


Fire Extinguishment.          A fire will burn until     it   consumes all of the fuel in the building or until it is
extinguished. Fire extinguishment may be automatic, as with an automatic sprinkler system or a
HALON discharge system, or             it   may be performed by people using portable extinguishers, cooling
the fire site with a stream of water, by limiting the supply of oxygen with a blanket of foam or
powder, or by breaking the combustion chemical reaction chain.

systems cause the water damage.                In short,
sprinkler systems reduce fire damage, protect the lives of building occupants, and limit the fire
damage to the building itself.         All these factors contribute to more rapid recovery of systems




       As discussed in this section, many variables affect fire safety and should be taken into account in selecting a fire
extinguishment system. While automatic sprinklers can be very effective, selection of a fire extinguishment system for a
particular building should take into account the particular fire risk factors. Other factors may include rate changes from
either a fire insurance carrier or a business interruption insurance carrier. Professional advice is required.

following a fire.


Each of these factors is important when estimating the occurrence rate of fires and the amount of
damage that will result. The objective of a fire-safety program is to optimize these factors to
minimize the risk of fire.


15.3            Failure of Supporting Utilities

Systems and the people who operate them need to have a reasonably well-controlled operating
environment. Consequently, failures of heating and air-conditioning systems will usually cause a
service interruption and may damage hardware.      These utilities are composed of many elements,
each of which must function properly.


For example, the typical air-conditioning system consists of ( 1 ) air handlers that cool and humidify
room air, (2) circulating pumps that send chilled water to the air handlers, (3) chillers that extract
                                                                                   Each of
heat from the water, and (4) cooling towers that discharge the heat to the outside air.
these elements has a mean-time-bet ween-failures (MTBF) and a mean-time-to-repair (MTTR).
Using the MTBF and MTTR values for each of the elements of a system, one can estimate the
occurrence rate of system failures and the range of resulting service interruptions.


This same line of reasoning applies to electric power distribution, heating plants, water, sewage,
and other utilities required for system operation or staff comfort.      By identifying the failure modes
of each utility and estimating the MTBF and MTTR, necessary failure threat parameters can be
developed to calculate the resulting risk. The risk of utility failure can be reduced by substituting
units with lower MTBF values. MTTR can be reduced by stocking spare parts on site and
training maintenance personnel. And the outages resulting from a given MTBF can be reduced by
installing redundant units under the assumption that failures are distributed randomly in time.

Each of these strategies can be evaluated by comparing the reduction in risk with the cost to
achieve it.


15.4            Structural Collapse

A building may be subjected to a load greater than      it   can support. Most commonly this is a result
of an earthquake, a snow load on the roof beyond design criteria, an explosion that displaces or
cuts structural members, or a fire that weakens structural members.         Even if the structure is not
completely demolished, the authorities may decide to ban its further use, sometimes even banning
entry to remove materials. This threat applies primarily to high-rise buildings and those with large
interior spaces without supporting columns.

15.5                Plumbing Leaks

While plumbing leaks do not occur every day, they can be seriously disruptive. The building's
plumbing drawings can help locate plumbing lines that might endanger system hardware. These
lines include hot and cold water, chilled water supply and return lines, steam lines, automatic

sprinkler lines, fire hose standpipes, and drains. If a building includes a laboratory or
manufacturing spaces, there may be other lines that conduct water, corrosive or toxic chemicals,
or gases.


As a rule, analysis often shows that the cost to relocate threatening lines is difficult to justify.
However, the location of shutoff valves and procedures that should be followed in the event of a
failure must be specified.        Operating and security personnel should have this information
immediately available for use in an emergency. In some cases, it may be possible to relocate
system hardware, particularly distributed LAN hardware.


15.6                Interception of Data

Depending on the type of data a system processes, there may be a significant risk if the data is
intercepted. There are three routes of data interception: direct observation, interception of data
transmission, and electromagnetic interception.


Direct Observation. System terminal and workstation display screens may be observed by
unauthorized persons. In most cases, it is relatively easy to relocate the display to eliminate the
exposure.


Interception of Data Transmissions.                If an interceptor can gain access to data transmission lines,

itmay be feasible to tap into the lines and read the data being transmitted. Network monitoring
tools can be used to capture data packets. Of course, the interceptor cannot control what is
transmitted, and so may not be able to immediately observe data of interest. However, over a
period of time there may be a serious level of disclosure. Local area networks typically broadcast
messages."^ Consequently, all traffic, including passwords, could be retrieved. Interceptors
could also transmit spurious data on tapped lines, either for purposes of disruption or for fraud.


Electromagnetic Interception. Systems routinely radiate electromagnetic energy that can be
detected with special-purpose radio receivers. Successful interception will depend on the signal
strength at the receiver location; the greater the separation between the system and the receiver,
the lower the success rate.         TEMPEST shielding, of either equipment or rooms, can be used to
minimize the spread of electromagnetic signals. The signal-to-noise ratio at the receiver.



      An insider may be able to easily collect data by configuring their ethernet network interface to receive all network
traffic, rather than just network traffic intended for this node.   This is called the promiscuous mode.


                                                               171
III.   Operational Controls




determined in part by the number of competing emitters will also affect the success rate. The
more workstations of the same type in the same location performing "random" activity, the more
difficult it is to intercept a given workstation's radiation.          On the other hand, the trend toward
wireless (i.e., deliberate radiation)    LAN connections may increase the likelihood of successful
interception.



15.7                Mobile and Portable Systems

The analysis and management of risk usually has to be modified if a system is installed in a vehicle
or is portable, such as a laptop computer. The system in a vehicle will share the risks of the
vehicle, including accidents and theft, as well as regional and local risks.


Portable and mobile systems share an
increased risk of theft and physical damage.                 Encryption of data files on stored media may also be a
In addition, portable systems can be                         cost-eifective precaution against disclosure of

users.      Secure storage of laptop computers is
often required when they are not in use.


If a mobile or portable system uses particularly valuable or important data, it may be appropriate

to either store its data on a medium that can be removed from the system when it is unattended or
to encrypt the data.      In any case, the issue of how custody of mobile and portable computers are
to be controlled should be addressed.        Depending on the sensitivity of the system and its
application, it may be appropriate to require briefings of users and signed briefing
acknowledgments. (See Chapter 10 for an example.)


15.8                Approach to Implementation

Like other security measures, physical and environmental security controls are selected because
they are cost-beneficial. This does not mean that a user must conduct a detailed cost-benefit
analysis for the selection of every control.      There are four general ways to justify the selection of
controls:


       1.    They are required by law or regulation.     Fire exit doors with panic bars and exit lights
       are examples of security measures required by law or regulation. Presumably, the regulatory
       authority has considered the costs and benefits and has determined that it is in the public
       interest to require the security measure.     A lawfully conducted organization has no option but
       to implement all required security measures.


       2.    The cost is insignificant, but the benefit is material.       A good example of this is a facility
       with a key-locked low-traffic door to a restricted access. The cost of keeping the door



                                                       172
                                                          15. Physical and Environmental Security




     locked is minimal, but there is a significant benefit. Once a significant benefit/minimal cost
     security measure has been identified, no further analysis is required to justify its
     implementation.


     3. The security measure addresses a potentially "fatal" security exposure but has a
     reasonable cost. Backing up system software and data is an example of this justification           .




     For most systems, the cost of making regular backup copies is modest (compared to the
     costs of operating the system), the organization would not be able to function if the stored
     data were lost, and the cost impact of the failure would be material. In such cases, it would
     not be necessary to develop any further cost justification for the backup of software and data.
     However, this justification depends on what constitutes a modest cost, and it does not
     identify the optimum backup schedule.     Broadly speaking, a cost that does not require
     budgeting of additional funds would qualify.


     4. The security measure is estimated to be cost-beneficial. If the cost of a potential security
     measure is significant, and it cannot be justified by any of the first three reasons listed above,
     then its cost (both implementation and ongoing operation) and its benefit (reduction in future
     expected losses) need to be analyzed to determine if it is cost-beneficial. In this context,
     cost-beneficial means that the reduction in expected loss is significantly greater than the cost
     of implementing the security measure.


Arriving at the fourth justification requires a detailed analysis. Simple rules of thumb do not
apply.    Consider, for example, the threat of electric power failure and the security measures that
can protect against such an event. The threat parameters, rate of occurrence, and range of outage
durations depend on the location of the system, the details of its connection to the local electric
power utility, the details of the internal power distribution system, and the character of other
activities in the building that use electric power. The system's potential losses fi^om service

interruption depends on the details of the functions it performs. Two systems that are otherwise
identical can support functions that have quite different degrees of urgency. Thus, two systems
may have the same electric power failure threat and vulnerability parameters, yet entirely different
loss potential parameters.


Furthermore, a number of different security measures are available to address electric power
failures.   These measures differ in both cost and performance. For example, the cost of an
uninterruptible power supply (UPS) depends on the size of the electric load it can support, the
number of minutes it can support the load, and the speed with which it assumes the load when the
primary power source fails. An on-site power generator could also be installed either in place of a
UPS (accepting the fact that a power failure will cause a brief service interruption) or in order to
provide long-term backup to a UPS system. Design decisions include the magnitude of the load
the generator will support, the size of the on-site fuel supply, and the details of the facilities to
switch the load from the primary source or the UPS to the on-site generator.

This example shows systems with a wide range of risks and a wide range of available security
measures (including, of course, no action), each with its own cost factors and performance
parameters.


15.9               Interdependencies

Physical and environmental security measures rely on and support the proper functioning of many
of the other areas discussed in this handbook.    Among the most important are the following:

Logical Access Controls. Physical security controls augment technical means for controlling
access to information and processing.     Even if the most advanced and best-implemented logical
access controls are in place, if physical security measures are inadequate, logical access controls
may be circumvented by directly accessing the hardware and storage media. For example, a
computer system may be rebooted using different software.

Contingency Planning.      A large portion of the contingency planning process involves the failure
of physical and environmental controls. Having sound controls, therefore, can help minimize
losses from such contingencies.


Identification and Authentication (I&A).      Many physical access control systems require that
people be identified and authenticated. Automated physical security access controls can use the
same types of I&A as other computer systems. In addition, it is possible to use the same tokens
(e.g., badges) as those used for other computer-based I&A.



Other.    Physical and environmental controls are also closely linked to the activities of the local
guard force, fire house, life safety office, and medical office. These organizations should be
consulted for their expertise in planning controls for the systems environment.


15.10              Cost Considerations

Costs associated with physical security measures range greatly. Useful generalizations about
costs, therefore, are difficult make.   Some measures, such as keeping a door locked, may be a
trivial expense.   Other features, such as fire-detection and -suppression systems, can be far more
costly.   Cost considerations should include operation. For example, adding controlled-entry
doors requires persons using the door to stop and unlock it. Locks also require physical key
management and accounting (and rekeying when keys are lost or stolen). Often these effects will
be inconsequential, but they should be fully considered. As with other security measures, the
objective is to select those that are cost-beneficial.

                      IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION

For most systems, identification and authentication (I&A) is the first line of defense.                     I&A is a
technical measure that prevents unauthorized people (or unauthorized processes) from entering a
computer system.


I&A is a critical building block of computer security since              it is    the basis for most types of access
control and for establishing user accountability.              Access control often requires that the system
be able to identify and differentiate among users. For example, access control is often based on
least privilege, which refers to the granting to users of only those accesses required to perform
their duties.   User accountability requires the linking of activities on a computer system to specific
individuals and, therefore, requires the system to identify users.


Identification is the means by which a user
provides a claimed identity to the system.                       A typical user identification could be JSMITH (for

important implementation issues.


Computer systems recognize people based on the authentication data the systems receive.
Authentication presents several challenges: collecting authentication data, transmitting the data
securely, and knowing whether the person who was originally authenticated is still the person
using the computer system. For example, a user may walk away from a terminal while still logged
on, and another person may start using it.


There are three means of authenticating a user's identity which can be used alone or in
combination:


     •            something the individual knows (a secret- e.g., a password, Personal Identification
                  Number (PIN), or cryptographic key);



     Not all types of access control require identification and authentication.


     Computers also use authentication to verily that a message or file has not been altered and to verify that a message
originated with a certain person. This chapter only addresses user authentication. The other forms of authentication are
addressed in the Chapter 19.

      •        something the individual possesses (a token - e.g., an         ATM card or a smart card);
               and


      •        something the individual is (a biometric - e.g., such characteristics as a voice
               pattern, handwriting dynamics, or a fingerprint).

computer system, they can guess or learn that
individual's password; they can also steal or
fabricate tokens.   Each method also has
drawbacks for legitimate users and system administrators: users forget passwords and may lose
tokens, and administrative overhead for keeping track of I&A data and tokens can be substantial.
Biometric systems have significant technical, user acceptance, and cost problems as well.


This section explains current I&A technologies and their benefits and drawbacks as they relate to
the three means of authentication. Although some of the technologies make use of cryptography
because it can significantly strengthen authentication, the explanations of cryptography appear in
Chapter 19, rather than in this chapter.


16.1           I&A Based on Something the User Knows
The most common form of I&A is a user ID coupled with a password. This technique is based
solely on something the user knows. There are other techniques besides conventional passwords
that are based on knowledge, such as knowledge of a cryptographic key.


16.1.1 Passwords


In general, password systems work by requiring the user to enter a user ID and password (or
passphrase or personal identification number). The system compares the password to a previously
stored password for that user ID. If there is a match, the user is authenticated and granted access.


Benefits of Passwords. Passwords have been successfully providing security for computer
systems for a long time. They are integrated into many operating systems, and users and system
administrators are familiar with them.     When properly managed in a controlled environment, they
can provide effective security.


Problems With Passwords. The security of a password system is dependent upon keeping
passwords secret. Unfortunately, there are many ways that the secret may be divulged. All of the

discussed in the sidebar. However, there is no    i   for the problem of electronic monitoring,
except to use more advanced authentication (e.    ,   based on cryptographic techniques or tokens).

    tricked into divulging their passwords.
    This process is referred to as social
    engineering.


    3.   Electronic monitoring.   When passwords are transmitted to a computer system, they can
    be electronically monitored. This can happen on the network used to transmit the password
    or on the computer system itself Simple encryption of a password that wiU be used again
    does not solve this problem because encrypting the same password will create the same
    ciphertext; the ciphertext becomes the password.

      4.   Accessing the password file.         If the password file is not protected by strong access

      controls, the file can be downloaded.           Password files are often protected with one-way
      encryption'"^ so that plain-text passwords are not available to system administrators or
      hackers (if they successfully bypass access controls). Even if the file is encrypted, brute force
      can be used to learn passwords if the file is downloaded (e.g., by encrypting English words
      and comparing them to the file).


Passwords Used as Access Control. Some mainframe operating systems and many PC
applications use passwords as a means of restricting access to specific resources within a system.
Instead of using mechanisms such as access control lists (see Chapter 17), access is granted by
entering a password.  The result is a proliferation of passwords that can reduce the overall
security of a system. While the use of passwords as a means of access control is common, it is an
approach that is often less than optimal and not cost-effective.


16.1.2 Cryptographic Keys


Although the authentication derived from the knowledge of a cryptographic key may be based
entirely on something the user knows, it is necessary for the user to also possess (or have access
to) something that can perform the cryptographic computations, such as a                   PC or a smart card.
For this reason, the protocols used are discussed in the Smart Tokens section of this chapter.
However, it is possible to implement these types of protocols without using a smart token.
Additional discussion is also provided under the Single Log-in section.


16.2               I&A Based on Something the User Possesses
Although some techniques are based solely on something the user possesses, most of the
techniques described in this section are combined with something the user knows. This
combination can provide significantly stronger security than either something the user knows or
                     "°
possesses alone.


Objects that a user possesses for the purpose of I&A are called tokens. This section divides
tokens into two categories: memory tokens and smart tokens.




      One-way encryption algorithms only provide for the encryption of data. The resulting ciphertext cannot be
decrypted.   When passwords are entered into the system, they are one-way encrypted, and the result is compared with the
stored ciphertext. (See the Chapter 19.)


   "° For the purpose of understanding how possession-based I&A works, it is not necessary to distinguish whether

possession of a token in various systems is identification or authentication.

16.2.1 Memory Tokens


Memory tokens store, but do not process, information. Special reader/writer devices control the
writing and reading of data to and from the tokens. The most common type of memory token is a
magnetic striped card, in which a thin stripe of magnetic material is affixed to the surface of a card
(e.g., as on the back of credit cards).   A common application of memory tokens for authentication
to computer systems is the automatic teller machine (ATM) card.            This uses a combination of
something the user possesses (the card) with something the user knows (the PIN).


Some computer systems authentication technologies are based solely on possession of a token,
but they are less common. Token-only systems are more likely to be used in other applications,
such as for physical access. (See Chapter 15.)


Benefits of Memory Token Systems.         Memory tokens when used with PINs provide significantly
more security than passwords.     In addition, memory cards are inexpensive to produce. For a
hacker or other would-be masquerader to pretend to be someone else, the hacker must have both
a valid token and the corresponding PIN. This is much more difficult than obtaining a valid
password and user ID combination (especially since most user IDs are common knowledge).


Another benefit of tokens is that they can be used in support of log generation without the need
for the employee to key in a user ID for each transaction or other logged event since the token
can be scanned repeatedly. If the token is required for physical entry and exit, then people will be
forced to remove the token when they leave the computer. This can help maintain authentication.


Problems With Memory Token Systems. Although sophisticated technical attacks are possible
against memory token systems, most of the problems associated with them relate to their cost,
administration, token loss, user dissatisfaction, and the compromise of PINs. Most of the
techniques for increasing the security of memory token systems relate to the protection of PINs.
Many of the techniques discussed in the sidebar on Improving Password Security apply to PINs.

     1.   Requires special reader. The need for a special reader increases the cost of using
    memory tokens. The readers used for memory tokens must include both the physical unit
    that reads the card and a processor that determines whether the card and/or the PIN entered
    with the card is valid. If the PIN or
    token is validated by a processor that is
    not physically located with the reader,              Attacks on memory-card systems have sometimes

    cryptography can be used to solve this               corresponding PINs, which the thieves used to forge
    problem).                                            cards.The forged cards were then used to withdraw
                                                         money from legitimate ATMs.
    2.    Token loss.   A lost token may prevent

                                                   183
IV.   Technical Controls




      the user from being able to log in until a replacement is provided. This can increase
      administrative overhead costs.


      The lost token could be found by someone who wants to break into the system, or could be
      stolen or forged.   If the token is also used with a PIN, any of the methods described above in

      password problems can be used to obtain the PIN.       Common methods are finding the PIN
      taped to the card or observing the PIN being entered by the legitimate user. In addition, any
      information stored on the magnetic stripe that has not been encrypted can be read.


      3.   User Dissatisfaction. In general, users want computers to be easy to use.   Many users
      find it inconvenient to carry and present a token.   However, their dissatisfaction may be
      reduced if they see the need for increased security.


16.2.2 Smart Tokens


A smart token expands the functionality of a memory token by incorporating one or more
integrated circuits into the token itself.   When used for authentication, a smart token is another
example of authentication based on something a user possesses (i.e., the token itself).   A smart
token typically requires a user also to provide something the user knows (i.e., a PIN or password)
in order to "unlock" the smart token for use.



There are many different types of smart tokens. In general, smart tokens can be divided three
different ways based on physical characteristics, interface, and protocols used.   These three
divisions are not mutually exclusive.


Physical Characteristics. Smart tokens can be divided into two groups: smart cards and other
types of tokens.    A smart card looks like a credit card, but incorporates an embedded
microprocessor. Smart cards are defined by an International Standards Organization (ISO)
standard. Smart tokens that are not smart cards can look like calculators, keys, or other small
portable objects.


Interface.    Smart tokens have either a manual or an electronic interface. Manual or human
interface tokens have displays and/or keypads to allow humans to communicate with the card.
Smart tokens with electronic interfaces must be read by special reader/writers. Smart cards,
described above, have an electronic interface. Smart tokens that look like calculators usually have
a manual interface.


Protocol. There are many possible protocols a smart token can use for authentication. In
general, they can be divided into three categories: static password exchange, dynamic password
generators, and challenge-response.


•     Static tokens work similarly to memory tokens, except that the users authenticate themselves


                                                    184
                                                              16. Identification and Authentication




    to the token and then the token authenticates the user to the computer.


•   A token that uses a dynamic password generator protocol creates a unique value, for
    example, an eight-digit number, that changes periodically (e.g., every minute). If the token
    has a manual interface, the user simply reads the current value and then types it into the
    computer system for authentication.     If the token has an electronic interface, the transfer is

    done automatically.    If the correct value is provided, the log-in is permitted, and the user is

    granted access to the system.


•   Tokens that use a challenge-response protocol work by having the computer generate a
    challenge, such as a random string of numbers. The smart token then generates a response
    based on the challenge. This is sent back to the computer, which authenticates the user based
    on the response. The challenge-response protocol is based on cryptography. Challenge-
    response tokens can use either electronic or manual interfaces.


There are other types of protocols, some more sophisticated and some less so. The three types
described above are the most common.


Benefits of Smart Tokens


Smart tokens offer great flexibility and can be used to solve many authentication problems. The
benefits of smart tokens vary, depending on the type used. In general, they provide greater
security than memory cards.    Smart tokens can solve the problem of electronic monitoring even if
the authentication is done across an open network by using one-time passwords.


    1.   One-time passwords. Smart tokens that use either dynamic password generation or
    challenge-response protocols can create one-time passwords. Electronic monitoring is not a
    problem with one-time passwords because each time the user is authenticated to the
    computer, a different "password" is used. (A hacker could learn the one-time password
    through electronic monitoring, but would be of no value.)


    2. Reduced risk offorgery. Generally, the memory on a smart token is not readable unless
    the PIN is entered. In addition, the tokens are more complex and, therefore, more difficult to
    forge.


    3.   Multi-application. Smart tokens with electronic interfaces, such as smart cards, provide a
    way for users to access many computers using many networks with only one log-in.           This is
    further discussed in the Single Log-in section of this chapter.   In addition, a single smart card
    can be used for multiple functions, such as physical access or as a debit card.

Problems with Smart Tokens


Like memory tokens, most of the problems associated with smart tokens relate to their cost, the
administration of the system, and user dissatisfaction. Smart tokens are generally less vulnerable
to the compromise of PINs because authentication usually takes place on the card.                  (It is possible,

of course, for someone to watch a PIN being entered and steal that card.) Smart tokens cost
more than memory cards because they are more complex, particularly challenge-response
calculators.

      intervention.   Smart tokens can use either         Electronic reader/writers can take many forms, such

      which creates additional expense.              iBBHBBBBHaHaHHH^^
      Human interfaces require more actions
      from the user. This is especially true for challenge-response tokens with a manual interface,
      which require the user to type the challenge into the smart token and the response into the
      computer. This can increase user dissatisfaction.


      2.    Substantial Administration. Smart tokens, like passwords and memory tokens, require
      strong administration. For tokens that use cryptography, this includes key management.
      (See Chapter 19.)


16.3              I&A Based on Something the User Is
Biometric authentication technologies use the unique characteristics (or attributes) of an
individual to authenticate that person's
identity.    These include physiological
attributes (such as fingerprints, hand                    Biometric authentication generally operates in the
geometry, or retina patterns) or behavioral               following manner:

Biometric systems can provide an increased level of security for computer systems, but the
technology is still less mature than that of memory tokens or smart tokens. Imperfections in
biometric authentication devices arise from technical difficulties in measuring and profiling
physical attributes as well as from the somewhat variable nature of physical attributes. These may
change, depending on various conditions. For example, a person's speech pattern may change
under stressful conditions or when suffering from a sore throat or cold.


Due to their relatively high cost, biometric systems are typically used with other authentication
means in environments requiring high security.


16.4             Implementing I&A Systems

Some of the important implementation issues for I&A systems include administration, maintaining
authentication, and single log-in.


16.4.1 Administration


Administration of authentication data is a critical element for aU types of authentication systems.
The administrative overhead associated with I&A can be significant. I&A systems need to create,
distribute, and store authentication data.   For passwords, this includes creating passwords, issuing
them to users, and maintaining a password file. Token systems involve the creation and
distribution of tokens/PENs and data that tell the computer how to recognize valid tokens/PINs.
For biometric systems, this includes creating and storing profiles.


The administrative tasks of creating and distributing authentication data and tokens can be a
substantial.   Identification data has to be kept current by adding new users and deleting former
users.   If the distribution of passwords or tokens is not controlled, system administrators will not

know if they have been given to someone other than the legitimate user. It is critical that the
distribution system ensure that authentication data is firmly linked with a given individual. Some
of these issues are discussed in Chapter 10 under User Administration.


In addition, I&A administrative tasks should
address lost or stolen passwords or tokens.     It         One method of looking for improperly used accounts

                                                           used their account.

Authentication data needs to be stored                ^^^^mm^^^^^mm^^^^^^^mmmmmmmmm
securely, as discussed with regard to accessing
password files. The value of authentication data lies in the data's confidentiality, integrity, and
availability. If confidentiality is compromised, someone may be able to use the information to

masquerade as a legitimate user.     If system administrators can read the authentication file, they




                                                     187
IV.            Technical Controls




can masquerade as another user.                   Many systems use encryption to hide the authentication data
from the system administrators.'"                   If integrity is compromised, authentication data can be added

or the system can be disrupted. If availability is compromised, the system cannot authenticate
users, and the users may not be able to work.


16.4.2 Maintaining Authentication


So far, this chapter has discussed initial authentication only.                        It is also possible for    someone to use
a legitimate user's account after log-in."^                  Many computer systems handle this problem by logging
a user out or locking their display or session after a certain period of inactivity.                            However, these
methods can affect productivity and can make the computer less user-friendly.


16.4.3 Single Log-in


From an efficiency viewpoint, it is desirable for users to authenticate themselves only once and
then to be able to access a wide variety of applications and data available on local and remote
systems, even if those systems require users to authenticate themselves. This is known as single
log-in}^^ If the access is within the same host computer, then the use of a modern access control
system (such as an access control list) should allow for a single log-in.                             If the access is across

multiple platforms, then the issue is more complicated, as discussed below. There are three main
techniques that can provide single log-in across multiple computers: host-to-host authentication,
authentication servers, and user-to-host authentication.


Host-to-Host Authentication. Under a host-to-host authentication approach, users authenticate
themselves once to a host computer. That computer then authenticates itself to other computers
and vouches for the specific user. Host-to-host authentication can be done by passing an
identification, a password, or by a challenge-response mechanism or other one-time password

scheme. Under this approach, it is necessary for the computers to recognize each other and to
trust each other.



Authentication Servers.                When using authentication server, the users authenticate themselves to a
special host computer (the authentication server). This computer then authenticates the user to




   '   '

           '   Masquerading by system administrators cannot be prevented entirely. However, controls can be set up so that
improper actions by the system administrator can be detected in audit records.


               After a user signs on, the computer treats all commands originating from the user's physical device (such as a PC
or terminal) as being from that user.


               Single log-in is somewhat of a misnomer.   It is currently not feasible to   have one sign-on for every computer
system a user might wish to access. The types of single log-in described apply mainly to groups of systems (e.g., within
an organization or a consortium).


                                                                    188

other host computers the user wants to

a separate computer, although in some
environments this may be a cost-effective way        bbbbbbbmbbbbbbmbbbb^b^
to increase the security of the server.)
Authentication servers can be distributed geographically or logically, as needed, to reduce
workload.


User-to-Host.     A user-to-host authentication approach requires the user to log-in to each host
computer. However, a smart token (such as a smart card) can contain all authentication data and
perform that service for the user. To users, it looks as though they were only authenticated once.


16.5             Interdependencies

There are many interdependencies among I&A and other controls. Several of them have been
discussed in the chapter.


Logical Access Controls. Access controls are needed to protect the authentication database.
I&A is often the basis for access controls. Dial-back modems and firewalls, discussed in Chapter
17, can help prevent hackers from trying to log-in.



Audit.    I&A is necessary if an audit log is going to be used for individual accountability.

Cryptography. Cryptography provides two basic services to I&A: it protects the confidentiality
of authentication data, and it provides protocols for proving knowledge and/or possession of a
token without having to transmit data that could be replayed to gain access to a computer system.


16.6              Cost Considerations

In general, passwords are the least expensive authentication technique and generally the least
secure.   They are already embedded in many systems. Memory tokens are less expensive than
smart tokens, but have less functionality. Smart tokens with a human interface do not require
readers, but are more inconvenient to use. Biometrics tend to be the most expensive.


For I&A systems, the cost of administration is often underestimated. Just because a system
comes with a password system does not mean that using it is free. For example, there is
significant overhead to administering the    I&A system.

some may be needed by several groups or
departments, and some should be accessed by
only a few individuals. While it is obvious that users must have access to the information they
need to do their jobs, it may also be required to deny access to non-job-related information.                        It

may also be important to control the kind of access that is afforded (e.g., the ability for the
average user to execute, but not change, system programs). These types of access restrictions
enforce policy and help ensure that unauthorized actions are not taken.

This chapter first discusses basic criteria that can be used to decide whether a particular user
should be granted access to a particular system resource.           It then reviews the use of these criteria

by those who set policy (usually system-specific policy), commonly used technical mechanisms
for implementing logical access control, and issues related to administration of access controls.

are typically used in some combination. Many
of the advantages and complexities involved in implementing and managing access control are
related to the different kinds of user accesses supported.


17.1.1 Identity


It is probably fair to   say that the majority of access controls are based upon the identity of the user

(either human or process), which is usually obtained through identification and authentication
(I&A). (See Chapter 16.) The identity is usually unique, to support individual accountability, but
can be a group identification or can even be anonymous. For example, public information
dissemination systems may serve a large group called "researchers" in which the individual
researchers are not known,


17.1.2 Roles
                                                           Many systems already support a small number of

The use of roles can be a very effective way of providing access control. The process of defining
roles should be based on a thorough analysis of how an organization operates and should include
input from a wide spectrum of users in an organization.


17.1.3 Location


Access to particular system resources may also be based upon physical or logical location. For
example, in a prison, all users in areas to which prisoners are physically permitted may be limited
to read-only access.   Changing or deleting is limited to areas to which prisoners are denied
physical access. The same authorized users (e.g., prison guards) would operate under
significantly different logical access controls, depending upon their physical location. Similarly,
users can be restricted based upon network addresses (e.g., users from sites within a given
organization may be permitted greater access than those from outside).

IV.   Technical Controls




17.1.4 Time


Time-of-day or day-of-week restrictions are common limitations on access. For example, use of
confidential personnel files may be allowed only during normal working hours - and maybe denied
before 8:00 a.m. and after 6:00 p.m. and all day during weekends and holidays.


17.1.5 Transaction


Another approach to access control can be used by organizations handling transactions (e.g.,
account inquiries). Phone calls may first be answered by a computer that requests that callers key
in their account number and perhaps a PIN.               Some routine transactions can then be made directly,
but more complex ones may require human intervention. In such cases, the computer, which
already knows the account number, can grant a clerk, for example, access to a particular account
for the duration of the transaction. When completed, the access authorization is terminated.
This means that users have no choice in which accounts they have access to, and can reduce the
potential for mischief        It   also eliminates employee browsing of accounts (e.g., those of celebrities
or their neighbors) and can thereby heighten privacy.


17.1.6 Service Constraints


Service constraints refer to those restrictions that depend upon the parameters that may arise
during use of the application or that are preestablished by the resource owner/manager. For
example, a particular software package may only be licensed by the organization for five users at a
time.    Access would be denied for a sixth user, even if the user were otherwise authorized to use
the application.      Another type of service constraint is based upon application content or numerical
thresholds. For example, an    ATM machine may restrict transfers of money between accounts to
certain dollar limits or may limit maximum ATM withdrawals to $500 per day. Access may also
be selectively permitted based on the type of service requested. For example, users of computers
on a network may be permitted to exchange electronic mail but may not be allowed to log in to
each others' computers.


17.1.7 Common Access Modes


In addition to considering criteria for when access should occur, it is also necessary to consider
the types of access, or access modes.            The concept of access modes is fundamental to access
control.     Common access modes, which can be used in both operating or application systems,
include the following:"^




        These access modes are described generically; exact definitions and capabilities will vary from implementation to
implementation. Readers are advised to consult their system and application documentation.


                                                            196
                                                                                    17. Logical Access Controls




     Read access provides users with the capability to view information in a system resource (such
     as a file, certain records, certain fields, or some combination thereof), but not to alter it, such
     as delete from, add to, or modify in any way. One must assume that information can be
     copied and printed if it can be read (although perhaps only manually, such as by using a print
     screen function and retyping the information into another file).


     Write access allows users to add to, modify, or delete information in system resources (e.g.,
     files, records, programs).       Normally user have read access to anything they have write access
     to.



     Execute privilege allows users to run programs.


     Delete access allows users to erase system resources (e.g., files, records, fields, programs)."^
     Note that if users have write access but not delete access, they could overwrite the field or
     file with gibberish or otherwise inaccurate information and, in effect, delete the information.



Other specialized access modes (more often found in applications) include:


     Create access allows users to create new files, records, or fields.


     Search access allows users to list the files in a directory.


Of course, these criteria can be used in conjunction with one another. For example, an
organization may give authorized individuals write access to an application at any time from
within the office but only read access during normal working hours if they dial-in.


Depending upon the technical mechanisms available to implement logical access control, a wide
variety of access permissions and restrictions are possible.            No discussion can present all
possibilities.



17.2              Policy: The Impetus for Access Controls

Logical access controls are a technical means of implementing policy decisions. Policy is made by
a management official responsible for a particular system, application, subsystem, or group of
systems.   The development of an access control policy may not be an easy endeavor.                     It requires

balancing the often-competing interests of security, operational requirements, and user-
friendliness.    In addition, technical constraints have to be considered.




      "Deleting" information does not necessarily physically remove the data from the storage media. This can have
serious implications for information that must be kept confidential. See "Disposition of Sensitive Automated
Information," CSL Bulletin, NIST, October 1992.

and they vary significantly in terms of
precision, sophistication, and cost.         These
methods are not mutually exclusive and are often employed in combination. Managers need to
analyze their organization's protection requirements to select the most appropriate, cost-effective
logical access controls.


17.3.1 Internal Access Controls


Internal access controls are a logical means of separating what defmed users (or user groups) can
or cannot do with system resources. Five methods of internal access control are discussed in this
section: passwords, encryption, access control lists, constrained user interfaces, and labels.


17.3.1.1 Passwords


Passwords are most often associated with user authentication. (See Chapter 16.) However, they
are also used to protect data and applications on many systems, including PCs. For instance, an
accounting application may require a password to access certain financial data or to invoke a




        Some policies may not be technically implementable; appropriate technical controls may simply not exist.

may find it difficult to remember additional
application passwords, which, if written down
or poorly chosen, can lead to their
compromise. Password-based access controls for PC applications are often easy to circumvent if
the user has access to the operating system (and knowledge of what to do).                        As discussed in
Chapter 16, there are other disadvantages to using passwords.


17.3.1.2 Encryption


Another mechanism that can be used for logical access control is encryption. Encrypted
information can only be decrypted by those possessing the appropriate cryptographic key. This is
especially useful if strong physical access controls cannot be provided, such as for laptops or
floppy diskettes. Thus, for example, if information is encrypted on a laptop computer, and the
laptop is stolen, the information cannot be accessed. While encryption can provide strong access
control, it is accompanied by the need for strong key management.                      Use of encryption may also
affect availability.     For example, lost or stolen keys or read/write errors may prevent the
decryption of the information. (See the cryptography chapter.)


17.3.1.3 Access Control Lists


Access Control Lists (ACLs) refer to a register of: (1) users (including groups, machines,
processes) who have been given permission to use a particular system resource, and (2) the types
of access they have been permitted.


ACLs vary considerably in their capability and flexibility. Some only allow specifications for
certain pre-set groups (e.g., owner, group, and world) while more advanced ACLs allow much
more flexibility, such as user-defined groups. Also, more advanced ACLs can be used to
                                                          With more advanced ACLs, access can
explicitly deny access to a particular individual or group.

be at the discretion of the policymaker (and implemented by the security administrator) or
individual user, depending upon how the controls are technically implemented.


Elementary ACLs. Elementary ACLs (e.g., "permission bits") are a widely available means of
providing access control on mukiuser systems. In this scheme, a short, predefined list of the
access rights to flies or other system resources is maintained.

Elementary ACLs are typically based on the
concepts of owner, group, and world. For                  Example of Elementary ACL for the file "payroll":

resource. The owner is usually its creator,               Group: COMPENSAHON-OFHCE

creator. File owners often have all privileges
for their resources.


In addition to the privileges assigned to the owner, each resource is associated with a named
group of users. Users who are members of the group can be granted modes of access distinct
from nonmembers, who belong to the rest of the "world" that includes all of the system's users.
User groups may be arranged according to departments, projects, or other ways appropriate for
the particular organization. For example, groups may be established for members of the
Personnel and Accounting departments. The system administrator is normally responsible for
technically maintaining and changing the membership of a group, based upon input from the
owners/custodians of the particular resources to which the groups may be granted access.

all implementations and can be confusing to

are introduced, they should be coupled with training to ensure their correct use.


17.3.1.4 Constrained User Interfaces


Often used in conjunction with ACLs are constrained user interfaces, which restrict users' access
to specific functions by never allowing them to request the use of information, functions, or other
specific system resources for which they do not have access.             Three major types exist: (1) menus,
(2) database views, and (3) physically constrained user interfaces.


Constrained user interfaces can provide a
form of access control that closely models                 Menu-driven systems are a common constrained user

directly.   Users can only execute commands
that are provided by the administrator, typically in the form of a menu.                 Another means of
restricting users is through restricted shells which limit the system commands the user can invoke.
The use of menus and shells can often make the system easier to use and can help reduce errors.

Database views is a mechanism for restricting user access to data contained in a database. It may
be necessary to allow a user to access a database, but that user may not need access to all the data
in the database (e.g., not all fields of a record nor all records in the database). Views can be used

to enforce complex access requirements that are often needed in database situations, such as those
based on the content of a field. For example, consider the situation where clerks maintain
personnel records in a database. Clerks are assigned a range of clients based upon last name (e.g.,
A-C, D-G). Instead of granting a user access to all records, the view can grant the user access to
the record based upon the first letter of the last name field.


Physically constrained user interfaces can also limit a user's abilities.          A common example is an
ATM    machine, which provides only a limited number of physical buttons to select options; no

A security label is a designation assigned to a
resource (such as a file). Labels can be used

for a variety of purposes, including controlling
                                                          requirements. For example, a label could be

perhaps under carefully controlled conditions
that are subject to auditing).


When used for access control, labels are also assigned to user sessions. Users are permitted to
initiate sessions with specific labels only.   For example, a file bearing the label "Organization
Proprietary Information" would not be accessible (readable) except during user sessions with the
corresponding label. Moreover, only a restricted set of users would be able to initiate such
sessions. The labels of the session and those of the files accessed during the session are used, in
turn, to label output from the session.   This ensures that information is uniformly protected
throughout its life on the system.


Labels are a very strong form of access
control; however, they are often inflexible and
can be expensive to administer. Unlike
permission bits or access control Usts, labels
cannot ordinarily be changed. Since labels are
permanently linked to specific information,

data cannot be disclosed by a user copying information and changing the access to that file so that
the information is more accessible than the original owner intended.            By removing users' ability to
arbitrarily designate the accessibility of files they own, opportunities for certain kinds of human

errors and malicious software problems are eliminated. In the example above, it would not be
possible to copy Organization Proprietary Information into a file with a different label. This
prevents inappropriate disclosure, but can interfere with legitimate extraction of some
information.


Labels are well suited for consistently and uniformly enforcing access restrictions, although their
administration and inflexibility can be a significant deterrent to their use.

Fitted to a communications port of a host
computer, a port protection device (PPD)
authorizes access to the port itself, prior to and independent of the computer's own access control
functions.      A PPD can be a separate device in the communications stream,                    or it may be
incorporated into a communications device (e.g., a modem).                       PPDs typically require a separate
authenticator, such as a password, in order to access the communications port.


17.3.2.2 Secure Gateways/Firewalls


Often called //revva//^, secure gateways block or filter access between two networks, often
between a private'^' network and a larger, more public network such as the Internet, which attract
malicious hackers. Secure gateways allow internal users to connect to external networks and at
                                                                                                              '^^

Some secure gateways are set up to allow all traffic to pass through except for specific traffic
which has known or suspected vulnerabilities or security problems, such as remote log-in services.
Other secure gateways are set up to disallow all traffic except for specific types, such as e-mail.
Some secure gateways can make access-control decisions based on the location of the requester.
There are several technical approaches and mechanisms used to support secure gateways.

         Typically PPDs are found only in serial communications streams.


         Private network is somewhat of a misnomer.     Private does not mean that the organization's network is totally
inaccessible to outsiders or prohibits use of the outside network from insiders (or the network would be disconnected).
It also does   not mean that all the information on the network requires confidentiality protection. It does mean that a
network (or part of a network) is, in some way, separated from another network.


         Questions frequently arise as to whether secure gateways help prevent the spread of viruses. In general, having a
gateway scan u-ansmitted files for viruses requires more system overhead than is practical, especially smce the scanning
would have to handle many different file formats. However, secure gateways may reduce the spread of network worms.

and security.


In addition to reducing the risks from
malicious hackers, secure gateways have several other benefits.  They can reduce internal system
security overhead, since they allow an organization to concentrate security efforts on a limited
number of machines. (This is similar to putting a guard on the first floor of a building instead of
needing a guard on every floor.)


A second benefit is the centralization of services. A secure gateway can be used to provide a
central management point for various services, such as advanced authentication (discussed in
Chapter 16), e-mail, or public dissemination of information. Having a central management point
can reduce system overhead and improve service.

fairly easy to masquerade as the legitimate host, especially if the masquerading host is physically

located close to the host being impersonated. Security measures to protect against misuse of
some host-based authentication systems are available (e.g.. Secure RPC'^^ uses DES to provide a
more secure identification of the client host).


17.4              Administration of Access Controls

One of the most complex and challenging aspects of access control, administration involves
implementing, monitoring, modifying, testing, and terminating user accesses on the system. These
can be demanding tasks, even though they typically do not include making the actual decisions as

to the type of access each user may have.'^'* Decisions regarding accesses should be guided by
organizational policy, employee job descriptions and tasks, information sensitivity, user "need-to-

There are three basic approaches to
administering access controls: centralized,                              System and Security Administration

relatively few individuals oversee the process,

consistent and uniform procedures and criteria are usually not difficult to enforce.                       However,
when changes are needed quickly, going through a central administration office can be frustrating
and time-consuming.


17.4.2 Decentralized Administration


In decentralized administration, access is directly controlled by the owners or creators of the files,
often the functional manager. This keeps control in the hands of those most accountable for the
information, most familiar with it and its uses, and best able to judge who needs what kind of




     As discussed in the policy section earlier in this chapter, those decisions are usually the responsibility of the
applicable application manager or cognizant management official. See also the discussion of system-specific policy in
Chapters 5 and 10.


                                                            205
IV.       Technical Controls




access. This may lead, however, to a lack of consistency among owners/creators as to procedures
and criteria for granting user accesses and capabilities. Also, when requests are not processed
centrally, it may be much more difficult to form a systemwide composite view of all user accesses
on the system at any given time. Different application or data owners may inadvertently
implement combinations of accesses that introduce conflicts of interest or that are in some other
way not in the organization's best interest.'" It may also be difficult to ensure that all accesses are
properly terminated when an employee transfers internally or leaves an organization.


17.4.3 Hybrid Approach


A hybrid approach combines centralized and decentralized administration. One typical
arrangement is that central administration is responsible for the broadest and most basic accesses,
and the owners/creators of files control types of accesses or changes in users' abilities for the files
under their control. The main disadvantage to a hybrid approach is adequately defining which
accesses should be assignable locally and which should be assignable centrally.


17.5                  Coordinating Access Controls

It is vital that     access controls protecting a system work together. At a minimum, three basic types
of access controls should be considered: physical, operating system, and application. In general,
access controls within an application are the most specific. However, for application access
controls to be fully effective they need to be supported by operating system access controls.
Otherwise access can be made to application resources without going through the application.'^^
Operating system and application access controls need to be supported by physical access
controls.



17.6                  Interdependencies

Logical access controls are closely related to many other controls. Several of them have been
discussed in the chapter.


Policy and Personnel. The most fundamental interdependencies of logical access control are with
policy and personnel. Logical access controls are the technical implementation of system- specific
and organizational policy, which stipulates who should be able to access what kinds of
information, applications, and functions. These decisions are normally based on the principles of




          Without necessary review mechanisms, central administration does not a priori preclude this.

   '^'^
          For example, logical access controls within an application block User A from viewing File F. However, if
operating systems access controls do not also block User    A from viewing File F, User A can use a utility program (or
another application) to view the file.


                                                             206
                                                                         17. Logical Access Controls




separation of duties and least privilege.


Audit Trails. As discussed earlier, logical access controls can be difficult to implement correctly.
Also, it is sometimes not possible to make logical access control as precise, or fine-grained, as
would be ideal for an organization.    In such situations, users may either deliberately or
inadvertently abuse their access. For example, access controls cannot prevent a user from
modifying data the user is authorized to modify, even if the modification is incorrect. Auditing
provides a way to identify abuse of access permissions.     It also provides a   means to review the
actions of system or security administrators.


Identification and Authentication. In most logical access control scenarios, the identity of the
user must be established before an access control decision can be made.      The access control
process then associates the permissible forms of accesses with that identity. This means that
access control can only be as effective as the I&A process employed for the system.


Physical Access Control. Most systems can be compromised if someone can physically access the
machine (i.e., CPU or other major components) by, for example, restarting the system with
different software.    Logical access controls are, therefore, dependent on physical access controls
(with the exception of encryption, which can depend solely on the strength of the algorithm and
the secrecy of the key).


17.7              Cost Considerations

Incorporating logical access controls into a computer system involves the purchase or use of
access control mechanisms, their implementation, and changes in user behavior.


Direct Costs.     Among the direct costs associated with the use of logical access controls are the
purchase and support of hardware, operating systems, and applications that provide the controls,
and any add-on security packages. The most significant personnel cost in relation to logical
access control is usually for adrmnistration (e.g., initially determining, assigning, and keeping
access rights up to date). Label-based access control is available in a limited number of
commercial products, but at greater cost and with less variety of selection. Role-based systems
are becoming more available, but there are significant costs involved in customizing these systems
for a particular organization. Training users to understand and use an access control system is
another necessary cost.


Indirect Costs.  The primary indirect cost associated with introducing logical access controls into
a computer system is the effect on user productivity. There may be additional overhead involved
in having individual users properly determine (when under their control) the protection attributes

of information. Another indirect cost that may arise results from users not being able to
immediately access information necessary to accomplish their jobs because the permissions were

problems.


This chapter focuses on audit trails as a technical control, rather than the process of security
auditing, which is a review and analysis of the security of a system as discussed in Chapter 9. This
chapter discusses the benefits and objectives of audit trails, the types of audit trails, and some
common implementation issues.

18.1                Benefits and Objectives
                                                                    An event is any action that happens on a computer
                                                                    system. Examples include logging into a system,
Audit trails can provide a means to help

accomplish several security-related objectives,
including individual accountability.




        Some security experts make a distinction between an audit trail and an audit log as follows: a log is a record of
events made by a particular software package, and an audit trail is an entire history of an event, possibly using several
logs.   However, common usage within the security community does not make use of this definition. Therefore, this
document does not distinguish between trails and logs.


        The type and amount of detail recorded by audit trails vary by both the technical capability of the logging
application and the managerial decisions. Therefore, when we state that "audit trails can...," the reader should be aware
that capabilities vary widely.

IV.   Technical Controls




reconstruction of events, intrusion detection, and problem analysis.


18.1.1 Individual Accountability


Audit trails are a technical mechanism that help managers maintain individual accountability.              By
advising users that they are personally accountable for their actions, which are tracked by an audit
trail that logs user activities,   managers can help promote proper user behavior. '^^ Users are less
likely to attempt to circumvent security policy if they know that their actions will be recorded in

an audit log.


For example, audit trails can be used in concert with access controls to identify and provide
information about users suspected of improper modification of data (e.g., introducing errors into a
database).    An audit trail may record "before" and "after" versions of records. (Depending upon
the size of the file and the capabilities of the audit logging tools, this may be very resource-
intensive.)Comparisons can then be made between the actual changes made to records and what
was expected. This can help management determine if errors were made by the user, by the
system or application software, or by some other source.


Audit trails work in concert with logical access controls, which restrict use of system resources.
Granting users access to particular resources usually means that they need that access to
accomplish their job. Authorized access, of course, can be misused, which is where audit trail
analysis is useful.   While users cannot be prevented from using resources to which they have
legitimate access authorization, audit traU analysis is used to examine their actions. For example,
consider a personnel office in which users have access to those personnel records for which they
are responsible.    Audit trails can reveal that an individual is printing far more records than the
average user, which could indicate the selling of personal data. Another example may be an
engineer who is using a computer for the design of a new product. Audit trail analysis could
reveal that an outgoing modem was used extensively by the engineer the week before quitting.
This could be used to investigate whether proprietary data files were sent to an unauthorized
party.


18.1.2 Reconstruction of Events


Audit trails can also be used to reconstruct events after a problem has occurred.  Damage can be
more easily assessed by reviewing audit trails of system activity to pinpoint how, when, and why
normal operations ceased. Audit trail analysis can often distinguish between operator-induced
errors (during which the system may have performed exactly as instructed) or system-created
errors (e.g., arising from a poorly tested piece of replacement code).           If,   for example, a system
fails or the integrity of a file (either program or data) is questioned,       an analysis of the audit trail

can reconstruct the series of steps taken by the system, the users, and the application. Knowledge
of the conditions that existed at the time of, for example, a system crash, can be useful in avoiding
future outages. Additionally, if a technical problem occurs (e.g., the corruption of a data file)
audit trails can aid in the recovery process (e.g., by using the record of changes made to
reconstruct the file).


18.1.3 Intrusion Detection
                                                                    Intrusion detection refers to the process of identifying

                                                                    access.
implemented to record appropriate
information, they can assist in intrusion                       ^mi^m^—M^^^^^^^^^MmnMiifciMtiiiMM
detection.     Although normally thought of as a
real-time effort, intrusions can be detected in real time, by examining audit records as they are
created (or through the use of other kinds of warning flags/notices), or after the fact (e.g., by
examining audit records in a batch process).


Real-time intrusion detection is primarily aimed at outsiders attempting to gain unauthorized
access to the system.        It   may also be used to detect changes in the system's performance indicative
of, for example, a virus or         worm attack.    There may be difficulties in implementing real-time
auditing, including unacceptable system performance.


After-the-fact identification may indicate that unauthorized access was attempted (or was
successful).     Attention can then be given to damage assessment or reviewing controls that were
attacked.


18.1.4 Problem Analysis


Audit trails may also be used as on-line tools to help identify problems other than intrusions as
they occur. This is often referred to as real-time auditing or monitoring. If a system or
application is deemed to be critical to an organization's business or mission, real-time auditing
may be implemented to monitor the status of these processes (although, as noted above, there can
be difficulties with real-time analysis). An analysis of the audit trails may be able to verify that the
system operated normally (i.e., that an error may have resulted from operator error, as opposed to
a system-originated error). Such use of audit trails may be complemented by system performance
logs.    For example, a significant increase in the use of system resources (e.g., disk file space or
outgoing modem use) could indicate a security problem.

18.2               Audit Trails and Logs

A system can maintain several different audit trails concurrently. There are typically two kinds of
audit records, (1) an event-oriented log and (2) a record of every keystroke, often called
keystroke monitoring. Event-based logs usually contain records describing system events,
application events, or user events.


An audit trail should include sufficient information to establish what events occurred and who (or
what) caused them. In general, an event record should specify when the event occurred, the user
ID associated with the event, the program or command used to initiate the event, and the result.
Date and time can help determine if the user was a masquerader or the actual person specified.


18.2.1 Keystroke Monitoring'^'


Keystroke monitoring is the process used to view or record both the keystrokes entered by a
computer user and the computer's response during an interactive session. Keystroke monitoring
is                                                 Examples of keystroke monitoring would
     usually considered a special case of audit trails.
include viewing characters as they are typed by users, reading users' electronic mail, and viewing
other recorded information typed by users.


Some forms of routine system maintenance may record user keystrokes. This could constitute
keystroke monitoring if the keystrokes are preserved along with the user identification so that an
administrator could determine the keystrokes entered by specific users. Keystroke monitoring is
conducted in an effort to protect systems and data from intruders who access the systems without
authority or in excess of their assigned authority. Monitoring keystrokes typed by intruders can
help administrators assess and repair damage caused by intruders.


18.2.2 Audit Events


System audit records are generally used to monitor and fine-tune system performance.
Application audit trails may be used to discern flaws in applications, or violations of security
policy committed within an application.            User audits records are generally used to hold
individuals accountable for their actions.          An analysis of user audit records may expose a variety


       The Department of Justice has advised that an ambiguity in U.S. law makes it unclear whether keystroke
monitoring is considered equivalent to an unauthorized telephone wiretap. The ambiguity results from the fact that
current laws were written years before such concerns as keystroke monitoring or system intruders became prevalent.
Additionally, no legal precedent has been set to determine whether keystroke monitoring is legal or illegal. System
administrators conducting such monitoring might be subject to criminal and civil liabilities.   The Department of Justice
advises system administrators to protect themselves by giving notice to system users if keystroke monitoring is being
conducted. Notice should include agency/organization policy statements, training on the subject, and a banner notice on
each system being monitored. [NIST, CSL Bulletin, March 1993]

The system itself enforces certain aspects of policy (particularly system-specific policy) such as
access to files and access to the system itself. Monitoring the alteration of systems configuration
flies that implement the policy is important.        If special accesses (e.g., security administrator

access) have to be used to alter configuration files, the system should generate audit records
whenever these accesses are used.

Sometimes a finer level of detail than system audit trails is required. Application audit trails can
provide this greater level of recorded detail. If an application is critical, it can be desirable to
record not only who invoked the application, but certain details specific to each use. For
example, consider an e-mail application.        It   may be desirable to record who sent mail, as well as to
whom they sent mail and the length of messages. Another example would be that of a database
application.   It   may be useful to record who accessed what database as well as the individual rows

    A user audit trail monitors and logs user activity in a system or application by recording events
    initiated by the user (e.g., access of a file, record or field, use
                                                                                       of a modem).

    Flexibility is a critical feature of audit trails.
                                                 Ideally (from a security point of view), a system
    administrator would have the ability to monitor all system and user activity, but

    how much to log and how much to review should be a function of application/data sensitivity and
    should be decided by each functional manager/application owner with guidance

    administrator and the computer security manager/officer, weighing the costs
                                                                                and benefits of the

related, such as system operations, cost-accounting charges, and network performance.



18.2.2.2 Application-Level Audit Trails


System-level audit trails may not be able to track and log events within applications, or may not
be able to provide the level of detail needed by application or data owners, the system
administrator, or the computer security manager. In general, application-level audit trails monitor
and log user activities, including data files
opened and closed, specific actions, such as
reading, editing, and deleting records or fields,
and printing reports.      Some applications may                        Audit Logs for Physical Access

best planned and implemented audit trail is of limited value without timely review of the logged
data.     Audit trails may be reviewed periodically, as needed (often triggered by occurrence of a
security event), automatically in realtime, or in some combination of these.    System managers and
administrators, with guidance from computer security personnel, should determine how long audit
trail data will be maintained   - either on the system or in archive files.

Following are examples of implementation issues that may have to be addressed when using audit
trails.



18.3.1 Protecting Audit Trail Data


Access to on-line audit logs should be strictly controlled. Computer security managers and
system administrators or managers should have access for review purposes; however, security
and/or administration personnel who maintain logical access functions may have no need for
access to audit logs.


It is particularly important to ensure the integrity of audit trail data against modification. One
way to do this is to use digital signatures. (See Chapter 19.) Another way is to use write-once
devices. The audit trail files needs to be protected since, for example, intruders may try to "cover
their tracks" by modifying audit trail records.    Audit trail records should be protected by strong
access controls to help prevent unauthorized access.   The integrity of audit trail information may
be particularly important when legal issues arise, such as when audit trails are used as legal
evidence. (This may, for example, require daily printing and signing of the logs.) Questions of
such legal issues should be directed to the cognizant legal counsel.


The confidentiality of audit trail information may also be protected, for example, if the audit trail
is recording information about users that     may be disclosure-sensitive such as transaction data
containing personal information (e.g., "before" and "after" records of modification to income tax
data).    Strong access controls and encryption can be particularly effective in preserving
confidentiality.


18.3.2 Review of Audit Trails


Audit trails can be used to review what occurred after an event, for periodic reviews, and for real-
time analysis. Reviewers should know what to look for to be effective in spotting unusual
activity.   They need to understand what normal activity looks like. Audit trail review can be
easier if the audit trail function can be queried by user ID, terminal ID, application name, date and
time, or some other set of parameters to run reports of selected information.


Audit Trail Review After an Event. Following a known system or application software problem, a
known violation of existing requirements by a user, or some unexplained system or user problem,
the appropriate system-level or application-level administrator should review the audit trails.

Review by the application/data owner would normally involve a separate report, based upon audit
trail data, to determine if their resources are being misused.



Periodic Review of Audit Trail Data. Application owners, data owners, system administrators,
data processing function managers, and computer security managers should determine how much
review of audit trail records is necessary, based on the importance of identifying unauthorized
activities.   This determination should have a direct correlation to the frequency of periodic
reviews of audit trail data.


Real-Time Audit Analysis. Traditionally, audit trails are analyzed in a batch mode at regular
intervals (e.g., daily).   Audit records are archived during that interval for later analysis. Audit
analysis tools can also be used in a real-time, or near real-time fashion.Such intrusion detection
tools are based on audit reduction, attack signature, and variance techniques.   Manual review of
audit records in real time is almost never feasible on large multiuser systems due to the volume of
records generated. However, it might be possible to view all records associated with a particular
user or application, and view them in real time.^"


18.3.3 Tools for Audit Trail Analysis


Many types of tools have been developed to help to reduce the amount of information contained
in audit records, as well as to distill useful information from the raw data.           Especially on larger
systems, audit trail software can create very large files, which can be extremely difficult to analyze
manually.     The use of automated tools is likely to be the difference between unused audit trail data
and a robust program.        Some of the types of tools include:

Audit reduction tools are preprocessors designed to reduce the volume of audit records to
facilitate manual review.      Before a security review, these tools can remove many audit records
known to have little security significance.          (This alone may cut in half the number of records in the
audit trail.)   These tools generally remove records generated by specified classes of events, such
as records generated by nightly backups might be removed.


Trends/variance-detection tools look for anomalies in user or system behavior.               It is possible to

construct more sophisticated processors that monitor usage trends and detect major variations.
For example, if a user typically logs in at 9 a.m., but appears at 4:30 a.m. one morning, this may
indicate a security problem that may need to be investigated.


Attack signature-detection tools look for an attack signature, which is a specific sequence of
events indicative of an unauthorized access attempt.              A simple example would be repeated failed
log-in attempts.




      This is similar to keystroke monitoring, though, and may be legally restricted.

18.4      Interdependencies

The ability to audit supports many of the controls presented in this handbook. The following
paragraphs describe some of the most important interdependencies.


Policy.    The most fundamental interdependency of audit trails is with policy. Policy dictates who
is   authorized access to what system resources. Therefore it specifies, directly or indirectly, what
violations of policy should be identified through audit trails.


Assurance. System auditing is an important aspect of operational assurance. The data recorded
                                                     The analysis of audit trail data and the

process of auditing systems are closely linked; in some cases, they may even be the same thing.          In
most cases, the analysis of audit traU data is a critical part of maintaining operational assurance.


Identification and Authentication. Audit trails are tools often used to help hold users accountable
for their actions.   To be held accountable, the users must be known to the system (usually
accomplished through the identification and authentication process). However, as mentioned
earlier, audit trails record events and associate them with the perceived user (i.e., the user ID).      If

a user is impersonated, the audit trail wiU establish events but not the identity of the user.


Logical Access Control. Logical access controls restrict the use of system resources to
authorized users. Audit trails complement this activity in two ways.     First, they    may be used to
identify breakdowns in logical access controls or to verify that access control restrictions are
behaving as expected, for example, if a particular user is erroneously included in a group
permitted access to a file. Second, audit trails are used to audit use of resources by those who
have legitimate access. Additionally, to protect audit trail files, access controls are used to ensure
that audit trails are not modified.


Contingency Planning. Audit trails assist in contingency planning by leaving a record of activities
performed on the system or within a specific application. In the event of a technical malfunction,
this log can be used to help reconstruct the state of the system (or specific files).



Incident Response. If a security incident occurs, such as hacking, audit records and other
intrusion detection methods can be used to help determine the extent of the incident. For
example, was just one file browsed, or was a Trojan horse planted to collect passwords?


Cryptography. Digital signatures can be used to protect audit trails from undetected
modification. (This does not prevent deletion or modification of the audit trail, but will provide
an alert that the audit trail has been altered.) Digital signatures can also be used in conjunction
with adding secure time stamps to audit records. Encryption can be used if confidentiality of
audit traU information is important.

18.5     Cost Considerations

Audit trails involve many costs.   First, some system overhead is incurred recording the audit trail.

Additional system overhead will be incurred storing and processing the records. The more
detailed the records, the more overhead is required.    Another cost involves human and machine
time required to do the analysis. This can be minimized by using tools to perform most of the
analysis.   Many simple analyzers can be constructed quickly (and cheaply) from system utilities,
but they are limited to audit reduction and identifying particularly sensitive events.   More complex
tools that identify trends or sequences of events are slowly becoming available as off-the-shelf
software. (If complex tools are not available for a system, development may be prohibitively
expensive.     Some intrusion detection systems, for example, have taken years to develop.)

The final cost of audit trails is the cost of investigating anomalous events. If the system is
identifying too many events as suspicious, administrators may spend undue time reconstructing
events and questioning personnel.

                                         CRYPTOGRAPHY

    Cryptography is a branch of mathematics based on the transformation of data.              It provides an

    important tool for protecting information and is used in many aspects of computer security.                  For
    example, cryptography can help provide data confidentiality, integrity, electronic signatures, and
    advanced user authentication. Although modern cryptography relies upon advanced mathematics,
    users can reap its benefits without understanding its mathematical underpinnings.

    the important issues that should be considered
    when incorporating cryptography into computer systems.


    19.1   Basic Cryptographic Technologies

    Cryptography relies upon two basic components: an algorithm (or cryptographic methodology)
    and a key. In modern cryptographic systems, algorithms are complex mathematical formulae and
    keys are strings of bits. For two parties to communicate, they must use the same algorithm (or
    algorithms that are designed to work together). In some cases, they must also use the same key.
    Many cryptographic keys must be kept secret;                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    sometimes algorithms are also kept secret.
                                                            There are two basic types of cryptography: "secret

    secret key systems (also called symmetric          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    systems) and public key systems (also called
    asymmetric systems). Table 19.1 compares some of the distinct features of secret and public key
    systems. Both types of systems offer advantages and disadvantages. Often, the two are combined
    to form a hybrid system to exploit the strengths of each type.       To determine which type of
    cryptography best meets its needs, an organization first has to identify its security requirements
    and operating environment.

 encrypt and decrypt data.    As the name impUes, secret key cryptography reUes on keeping the key
 secret.   If the key is compromised, the security offered by

 eliminated. Secret key    cryptography assumes that the parties who share a key rely upon each
 other not to disclose the key and protect it against modification.

19.1.2 Public Key Cryptography


Whereas secret key cryptography uses a single
key shared by two (or more) parties, public            Public key cryptography is a modern invention and
key cryptography uses a pair of keys for each          requires the use of advanced mathematics.

party. One of the keys of the pair is "public"  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^g^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
and the other is "private." The public key can
be made known to other parties; the private key must be kept confidential and must be known
only to its owner. Both keys, however, need to be protected against modification.


Public key cryptography is particularly useful when the parties wishing to communicate cannot
rely upon each other or do not share a common key.       There are several public key cryptographic
systems.    One of the first public key systems is RS A, which can provide many different security
services.   The Digital Signature Standard (DSS), described later in the chapter, is another example
of a public key system.


19.1.3 Hybrid Cryptographic Systems


Public and secret key cryptography have relative advantages and disadvantages. Although public
key cryptography does not require users to share a common key, secret key cryptography is much
faster: equivalent implementations of secret

key cryptography can run 1,000 to 10,000 times
faster than public key cryptography.                   secret key systems are often used for bulk data

disadvantages of both secret and public key        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
cryptography, a computer system can use both
types in a complementary manner, with each performing different functions. Typically, the speed
advantage of secret key cryptography means that it is used for encrypting data. Public key
cryptography is used for applications that are less demanding to a computer system's resources,
such as encrypting the keys used by secret key cryptography (for distribution) or to sign
messages.


19.1.4 Key Escrow


Because cryptography can provide extremely strong encryption, it can thwart the government's
efforts to lawflilly perform electronic surveillance. For example, if strong cryptography is used to
encrypt a phone conversation, a court-authorized wiretap will not be effective. To meet the needs
of the government and to provide privacy, the federal government has adopted voluntary key
escrow cryptography. This technology allows the use of strong encryption, but also allows the
government when legally authorized to obtain decryption keys held by escrow agents. NIST has
published the Escrowed Encryption Standard as FTPS 185. Under the Federal Government's

voluntary key escrow initiative, the decryption keys are split into parts and given to separate
escrow authorities. Access to one part of the key does not help decrypt the data; both keys must
be obtained.


19.2          Uses of Cryptography

Cryptography is used to protect data both inside and outside the boundaries of a computer
system. Outside the computer system, cryptography is sometimes the only way to protect data.
While in a computer system, data is normally protected with logical and physical access controls
(perhaps supplemented by cryptography). However, when in transit across communications lines
or resident on someone else's computer, data cannot be protected by the originator's'^'* logical or
physical access controls. Cryptography provides a solution by protecting data even when the data
is   no longer in the control of the
originator.                                                                                    Secret Key

In computer systems, it is not
always possible for humans to scan information to determine if data has been erased, added, or
modified.   Even if scanning were possible, the individual may have no way of knowing what the
correct data should be. For example, "do" may be changed to "do not," or $1,000 may be
changed to $10,000.    It is therefore desirable to have an   automated means of detecting both
intentional and unintentional modifications of data.


While error detecting codes have long been used in communications protocols (e.g., parity bits),
these are more effective in detecting (and correcting) unintentional modifications.              They can be
defeated by adversaries. Cryptography can effectively detect both intentional and unintentional
modification; however, cryptography does not protect files from being modified.     Both secret key
and public key cryptography can be used to ensure integrity. Although newer public key methods
may offer more flexibility than the older secret key method, secret key integrity verification
systems have been successfully integrated into many applications.


When secret key cryptography is used, a message authentication code (MAC) is calculated from
and appended to the data. To verify that the data has not been modified at a later time, any party
with access to the correct secret key can recalculate the MAC. The new MAC is compared with
the original MAC, and if they are identical, the verifier has confidence that the data has not been
modified by an unauthorized party. FTPS 113, Computer Data Authentication, specifies a
standard technique for calculating a   MAC for integrity verification.
Public key cryptography verifies integrity by using of public key signatures and secure hashes.                   A
secure hash algorithm is used to create a message digest.      The message digest, called a hash, is a

short form of the message that changes if the message is modified.     The hash is then signed with a
private key.      Anyone can recalculate the hash and use the corresponding public key to verify the

legal status as a written signature.          In addition
to the integrity protections, discussed above,
cryptography can provide a means of linking a
document with a particular person, as is done with a written signature. Electronic signatures can
use either secret key or public key cryptography; however, public key methods are generally
easier to use.


Cryptographic signatures provide extremely strong proof that a message has not been altered and
was signed by a specific key.'^^ However, there are other mechanisms besides cryptographic-
based electronic signatures that perform a similar function. These mechanisms provide some
assurance of the origin of a message, some verification of the message's integrity, or both.'^^




      Sometimes a secure hash is used for integrity verification. However, this can be defeated if the hash is not stored
in a secure location, since it may be possible for someone to change the message and then replace the old hash with a

new one based on the modified message.

      Electronic signatures rely on the secrecy of the keys and the link or binding between the owner of the key and the
key itself   If a key is compromised (by theft, coercion, or trickery), then the electronic originator of a message    may not
be the same as the owner of the key. Although the binding of cryptographic keys to actual people is a significant
problem, it does not necessarily make electronic signatures less secure than written signatures. Trickery and coercion
are problems for written signatures as well. In addition, written signatures are easily forged.


      The strength of these mechanisms relative to electronic signatures varies depending on the specific
implementation; however, in general, electronic signatures are stronger and more flexible. These mechanisms may be
used in conjunction with electronic signatures or separately, depending upon the system's specific needs and limitations.

             Examination of the transmission path of a message.  When messages are sent across a
             network, such as the Internet, the message source and the physical path of the message are
             recorded as a part of the message. These can be examined electronically or manually to
             help ascertain the origin of a message.


             Use of a value-added network provider.       If two or more parties are communicating via a
             third party network, the network provider may be able to provide assurance that messages
             originate from a given source and have not been modified.


             Acknowledgment statements. The recipient of an electronic message may confirm the
             message's origin and contents by sending back an acknowledgement statement.


•            Use of audit trails. Audit trails can track the sending of messages and their contents for
             later reference.



Simply taking a digital picture of a written signature does not provide adequate security. Such a
digitized written signature could easily be copied from one electronic document to another with
no way to determine whether it is legitimate. Electronic signatures, on the other hand, are unique
to the message being signed and will not verify if they are copied to another document.

(MACs). For example, if two parties share a
secret key, and one party receives data with a
MAC that         is correctly verified   using the
shared key, that party may assume that the other party signed the data. This assumes, however,
that the two parties trust each other.          Thus, through the use of a MAC, in addition to data
integrity, a form of electronic signature is obtained.          Using additional controls, such as key
notarization and key attributes, it is possible to provide an electronic signature even if the two
parties do not trust each other.


19.2.3.2 Public Key Electronic Signatures


Another type of electronic signature called a digital signature is implemented using public key
cryptography. Data is electronically signed by applying the originator's private key to the data.
(The exact mathematical process for doing this is not important for this discussion.) To increase
the speed of the process, the private key is applied to a shorter form of the data, called a "hash" or
"message digest," rather than to the entire set of data. The resulting digital signature can be
stored or transmitted along with the data. The signature can be verified by any party using the
public key of the signer. This feature is very useful, for example, when distributing signed copies

Cryptography can increase security in
user authentication techniques.       As                  Person B knows that only Person A could have sent the message.
discussed in Chapter 16, cryptography
is   the basis for several advanced
authentication methods. Instead of communicating passwords over an open network,
authentication can be performed by demonstrating knowledge of a cryptographic key. Using
these methods, a one-time password, which is not susceptible to eavesdropping, can be used.
User authentication can use either secret or pubUc key cryptography.


19.3        Implementation Issues

This section explores several miportant issues that should be considered when using (e.g.,
designing, implementing, integrating) cryptography in a computer system.


19.3.1 Selecting Design and Implementation Standards


NIST and other organizations have developed numerous standards for designing, implementing,
and using cryptography and for integrating it
into automated systems.         By using these    mm^mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm^^^^nmmmmm
standards, organizations can reduce costs and

Standards help ensure interoperability among different vendors' equipment, thus allowing an

organization to select from among various products in order to find cost-effective equipment.


Managers and users of computer systems will have to select among various standards when
deciding to use cryptography. Their selection should be based on cost-effectiveness analysis,
trends in the standard's acceptance, and interoperability requirements. In addition, each standard
should be carefully analyzed to determine if it is applicable to the organization and the desired
application.   For example, the Data Encryption Standard and the Escrowed Encryption Standard
are both applicable to certain applications involving communications of data over commercial
modems. Some federal standards are mandatory for federal computer systems, including DES
(HPS 46-2) and the DSS (HPS 181).

19.3.2 Deciding on Hardware vs. Software Implementations


The trade-offs among security, cost, simplicity, efficiency, and ease of implementation need to be
studied by managers acquiring various security products meeting a standard. Cryptography can
be implemented in either hardware or software. Each has its related costs and benefits.


In general, software is less expensive and slower than hardware, although for large applications,
hardware may be less expensive. In addition, software may be less secure, since it is more easily
modified or bypassed than equivalent hardware products. Tamper resistance is usually considered
better in hardware.


In many cases, cryptography is implemented in a hardware device (e.g., electronic chip,     ROM-
protected processor) but is controlled by software. This software requires integrity protection to
ensure that the hardware device is provided with correct information (i.e., controls, data) and is
not bypassed. Thus, a hybrid solution is generally provided, even when the basic cryptography is
implemented in hardware. Effective security requires the correct management of the entire hybrid
solution.


19.3.3 Managing Keys


The proper management of cryptographic keys is essential to the effective use of cryptography for
security. Ultimately, the security of information protected by cryptography directly depends upon
the protection afforded to keys.


All keys need to be protected against modification, and secret keys and private keys need
protection against unauthorized disclosure.   Key management involves the procedures and
protocols, both manual and automated, used throughout the entire life cycle of the keys. This
includes the generation, distribution, storage, entry, use, destruction, and archiving of
cryptographic keys.


With secret key cryptography, the secret key(s) should be securely distributed (i.e., safeguarded

                                                 231
IV.   Technical Controls




against unauthorized replacement, modification, and disclosure) to the parties wishing to
communicate. Depending upon the number and location of users, this task may not be trivial.
Automated techniques for generating and distributing cryptographic keys can ease overhead costs
of key management, but some resources have to be devoted to this task. FTPS 171, Key
Management Using ANSI X9. 7, provides key management solutions for a variety of operational
environments.


Public key cryptography users also have to satisfy certain key management requirements. For
example, since a private-public key pair is associated with (i.e., generated or held by) a specific
user, it is necessary to bind the public part of the key pair to the user.'^^


In a small community of users, public keys and their "owners" can be strongly bound by simply
exchanging public keys (e.g., putting them on a CD-ROM or other media). However, conducting
electronic business on a larger scale, potentially involving geographically and organizationally
distributed users, necessitates a means for obtaining public keys electronically with a high degree
of confidence in their integrity and binding to individuals. The support for the binding between a
key and its owner is generally referred to as a public key infrastructure.


Users also need to be able enter the community of key holders, generate keys (or have them
generated on their behalf), disseminate public keys, revoke keys (in case, for example, of
compromise of the private key), and change keys. In addition, it may be necessary to build in
time/date stamping and to archive keys for verification of old signatures.


19.3.4 Security of Cryptographic Modules


Cryptography is typically implemented in a
module of software, firmware, hardware, or                       HPS 140-1, Security Requirements for
some combination thereof This module                             Cryptographic Modules, specifies the physical and

certain control parameters, and temporary

      In some cases, the key may be bound to a position or an organization, rather than to an individual user.

19.3.5 Applying Cryptography to Networks


The use of cryptography within networking applications often requires special considerations.          In
these applications, the suitability of a cryptographic module may depend on its capability for
handling special requirements imposed by locally attached communications equipment or by the
network protocols and software.


Encrypted information, MACs, or digital signatures may require transparent communications
protocols or equipment to avoid being misinterpreted by the communications equipment or
software as control information.    It   may be necessary to format the encrypted information, MAC,
or digital signature to ensure that it does not confuse the communications equipment or software.
It is essential that cryptography satisfy the requirements imposed by the communications

equipment and does not interfere with the proper and efficient operation of the network.


Data is encrypted on a network using either link or end-to-end encryption. In general, link
encryption is performed by service providers, such as a data communications provider. Link
encryption encrypts all of the data along a communications path (e.g., a satellite link, telephone
circuit, or Tl line).   Since link encryption also encrypts routing data, communications nodes need
to decrypt the data to continue routing.      End-to-end encryption is generally performed by the end-
user organization. Although data remains encrypted when being passed through a network,
routing information remains visible.      It is possible to   combine both types of encryption.


19.3.6 Complying with Export Rules


The U.S. Government controls the export of cryptographic implementations. The rules governing
export can be quite complex, since they consider multiple factors. In addition, cryptography is a
rapidly changing field, and rules may change fi"om time to time. Questions concerning the export
of a particular implementation should be addressed to appropriate legal counsel.


19.4    Interdependencies

There are many interdependencies among cryptography and other security controls highlighted in
this handbook. Cryptography both depends on other security safeguards and assists in providing

them.


Physical Security. Physical protection of a cryptographic module is required to prevent - or at
least detect - physical replacement or modification of the cryptographic system and the keys

within it. In many environments (e.g., open offices, portable computers), the cryptographic
module itself has to provide the desired levels of physical security. In other environments (e.g.,
closed communications facilities, steel-encased Cash-Issuing Terminals), a cryptographic module
may be safely employed within a secured facility.


                                                      233
IV. Technical Controls




User Authentication. Cryptography can be used both to protect passwords that are stored in
computer systems and to protect passwords that are communicated between computers.
Furthermore, cryptographic-based authentication techniques may be used in conjunction with, or
in place of, password-based techniques to provide stronger authentication of users.



Logical Access Control. In many cases, cryptographic software may be embedded within a host
system, and it may not be feasible to provide extensive physical protection to the host system. In
these cases, logical access control may provide a means of isolating the cryptographic software
from other parts of the host system and for protecting the cryptographic software from tampering
and the keys from replacement or disclosure. The use of such controls should provide the
equivalent of physical protection.


Audit Trails. Cryptography may play a useful role in audit trails. For example, audit records may
need to be signed. Cryptography may also be needed to protect audit records stored on computer
systems from disclosure or modification. Audit trails are also used to help support electronic
signatures.


Assurance. Assurance that a cryptographic module is properly and securely implemented is
essential to the effective use of cryptography.     NIST maintains validation programs for several of
its   standards for cryptography. Vendors can have their products validated for conformance to the
standard through a rigorous set of tests. Such
testing provides increased assurance that a           hh^^^^^h^^^^^h^^^^h^^^hmh

                                                                                                                ^.

A cryptographic system should be monitored and periodically audited to ensure that                 it is   satisfying
its   security objectives.   All parameters associated with correct operation of the cryptographic
system should be reviewed, and operation of the system itself should be periodically tested and the
results audited.    Certain information, such as secret keys or private keys in public key systems,
should not be subject to audit. However, nonsecret or nonprivate keys could be used in a
simulated audit procedure.


19.5      Cost Considerations

Using cryptography to protect information has both direct and indirect costs. Cost is determined
in part by product availability; a wide variety of products exist for implementing cryptography in

integrated circuits, add-on boards or adapters, and stand-alone units.

19.5.1 Direct Costs


The direct costs of cryptography include:

•        Acquiring or implementing the cryptographic module and integrating it into the computer
         system.   The medium (i.e., hardware, software, firmware, or combination) and various
         other issues such as level of security, logical and physical configuration, and special
         processing requirements will have an impact on cost.


•        Managing the cryptography and, in particular, managing the cryptographic keys, which
         includes key generation, distribution, archiving, and disposition, as well as security
         measures to protect the keys, as appropriate.


19.5.2 Indirect Costs


The indirect costs of cryptography include:

•        A decrease in system or network performance, resulting fi-om the additional overhead of
         applying cryptographic protection to stored or communicated data.


•        Changes in the way users interact with the system, resulting from more stringent security
         enforcement. However, cryptography can be made nearly transparent to the users so that
         the impact is minimal.

This chapter illustrates how a hypothetical government agency (HGA) deals with computer
security issues in its operating environment.             It follows the evolution of        HGA's initiation of an
assessment of the threats to its computer security system all the way through to HGA's
recommendations for mitigating those risks. In the real world, many solutions exist for computer
security problems.         No single solution can solve similar security problems in all environments.
Likewise, the solutions presented in this example may not be appropriate for all environments.

applicable factors.


20.1        Initiating the Risk Assessment

HGA has information systems that comprise and are intertwined with several different kinds of
assets valuable enough to merit protection.            HGA's systems play a key role in transferring U.S.
Government funds to individuals in the form of paychecks; hence, financial resources are among
the assets associated with HGA's systems. The system components owned and operated by HGA




       While this chapter draws upon many actual systems, details and characteristics were changed and merged.
Although the chapter is arranged around an agency, the case study could also apply to a large division or office within an
agency.

are also assets, as are personnel information, contracting and procurement documents, draft
regulations, internal correspondence, and a variety of other day-to-day business documents,
memos, and reports. HGA's assets include intangible elements as well, such as reputation of the
agency and the confidence of its employees that personal information will be handled properly and
that the wages will be paid on time.


A recent change in the directorship of HGA has brought in a new management team. Among the
new Chief Information Officer's first actions was appointing a Computer Security Program
Manager who immediately initiated a comprehensive risk analysis to assess the soundness of
HGA's computer security program in protecting the agency's assets and its compliance with
federal directives. This analysis drew upon prior risk assessments, threat studies, and applicable
internal control reports.   The Computer Security Program Manager also established a timetable
for periodic reassessments.


Since the wide-area network and mainframe used by      HGA are owned and operated by other
organizations, they were not treated in the risk assessment as HGA's assets.   And although HGA's
personnel, buildings, and facilities are essential assets, the Computer Security Program Manager
considered them to be outside the scope of the risk analysis.


After examining HGA's computer system, the risk assessment team identified specific threats to
HGA's assets, reviewed HGA's and national safeguards against those threats, identified the
vulnerabilities of those policies, and recommended specific actions for mitigating the remaining
risks to HGA's computer security. The following sections provide highlights from the risk
assessment. The assessment addressed many other issues at the programmatic and system levels.
However, this chapter focuses on security issues related to the time and attendance application.
(Other issues are discussed in Chapter 6.)


20.2    HGA's Computer System

HGA relies on the distributed computer systems and networks shown in Figure 20.      1 .   They
consist of a collection of components, some of which are systems in their own right.       Some belong
to HGA, but others are owned and operated by other organizations. This section describes these
components, their role in the overall distributed system architecture, and how they are used by
HGA.

20.2.1 System Architecture


Most of HGA's staff (a mix of clerical, technical, and managerial staff) are provided with personal
computers (PCs) located in their offices. Each PC includes hard-disk and floppy-disk drives.


The PCs are connected to a local area network (LAN) so that users can exchange and share


                                                 242
V.       Example




information.       The central component of the LAN is a LAN server, a more powerful computer that
acts as an intermediary between PCs on the network and provides a large volume of disk storage
for shared information, including shared application programs.          The server provides logical access
controls on potentially sharable information via elementary access control lists. These access
controls can be used to limit user access to various files and programs stored on the server.        Some
programs stored on the server can be retrieved via the LAN and executed on a PC; others can
only be executed on the server.


To initiate a session on the network or execute programs on the server, users at a PC must log
into the server and provide a user identifier and password known to the server. Then they may use
files to which they have access.



One of the applications supported by the server is electronic mail (e-maU), which can be used by
all      PC users. Other programs that run on the server can only be executed by a limited set of PC
users.


Several printers, distributed throughout HGA's building complex, are connected to the LAN.
Users at PCs may direct printouts to whichever printer is most convenient for their use.


Since       HGA must frequently communicate with industry, the LAN also provides a connection to
the Internet via a router.The router is a network interface device that translates between the
protocols and addresses associated with the LAN and the Internet.    The router also performs
network packet filtering, a form of network access control, and has recently been configured to
disallow non-e-mail (e.g., fde transfer, remote log-in) between         LAN and Internet computers.

The LAN server also has connections to several other devices.

             •       A modem pool is provided so that HGA's employees on travel can "dial up" via the
                     public switched (telephone) network and read or send e-mail.     To initiate a dial-up
                     session, a user must successfully log in.   During dial-up sessions, the LAN server
                     provides access only to e-mail facilities; no other functions can be invoked.


     =       •       A special console is provided for the server administrators who configure the
                     server, establish and delete user accounts, and have other special privileges needed
                     for administrative and maintenance functions.    These functions can only be invoked
                     from the administrator console; that is, they cannot be invoked from a PC on the
                     network or from a dial-up session.

             •       A connection to a government agency X.25-based wide-area network (WAN) is
                     provided so that information can be transferred to or from other agency systems.
                     One of the other hosts on the WAN is a large multiagency mainframe system.        This
                     mainframe is used to coUect and process information from a large number of


                                                      244
           20. Assessing and Mitigating the Risks to a Hypothetical Computer System




                agencies while providing a range of access controls.


20.2.2 System Operational Authority/Ownership


The system components contained within the large dashed rectangle shown in Figure 20. 1 are
managed and operated by an organization within HGA known as the Computer Operations Group
(COG). This group includes the PCs, LAN, server, console, printers, modem pool, and router.
The WAN is owned and operated by a large commercial telecommunications company that
provides   WAN services under a government contract. The mainframe         is   owned and operated by a
federal agency that acts as a service provider for   HGA and other agencies connected to the WAN.

20.2.3 System Applications


PCs on HGA's LAN are used for word processing, data manipulation, and other common
applications, including spreadsheet and project management tools. Many of these tasks are
concerned with data that are sensitive with respect to confidentiality or integrity.    Some of these
documents and data also need to be available in a timely manner.


The mainframe also provides storage and retrieval services for other databases belonging to
individual agencies.   For example, several agencies, including HGA, store their personnel
databases on the mainframe; these databases contain dates of service, leave balances, salary and
W-2 information, and so forth.

In addition to their time and attendance application, HGA's PCs and the         LAN server are used to
manipulate other kinds of information that may be sensitive with respect to confidentiality or
integrity, including personnel-related correspondence and draft contracting documents.



20.3    Threats to HGA's Assets

Different assets of   HGA are subject to different kinds of threats. Some threats are considered less
likely than others, and the potential impact of different threats may vary greatly.     The likelihood of
threats is generally difficult to estimate accurately. Both   HGA and the risk assessment's authors
have attempted to the extent possible to base these estimates on historical data, but have also tried
to anticipate new trends stimulated by emerging technologies (e.g., external networks).


20.3.1 Payroll Fraud


As for most large organizations that control financial assets, attempts at fraud and embezzlement
are likely to occur. Historically, attempts at payroll fraud have almost always come from within
HGA or the other agencies that operate systems on which HGA depends. Although HGA has
thwarted many of these attempts, and some have involved relatively small sums of money, it



                                                  245
V.   Example




considers preventing financial fraud to be a critical computer security priority, particularly in light
of the potential financial losses and the risks of damage to its reputation with Congress, the
public, and other federal agencies.


Attempts to defraud HGA have included the following:


        •       Submitting fraudulent time sheets for hours or days not worked, or for pay periods
                following termination or transfer of employment.    The former may take the form of
                overreporting compensatory or overtime hours worked, or underreporting
                vacation or sick leave taken. Alternatively, attempts have been made to modify
                time sheet data after being entered and approved for submission to payroll.


        •       Falsifying or modifying dates or data on which one's "years of service"
                computations are based, thereby becoming eligible for retirement earlier than
                allowed, or increasing one's pension amount.


        •       Creating employee records and time sheets for fictitious personnel, and attempting
                to obtain their paychecks, particularly after arranging for direct deposit.


20.3.2 Payroll Errors


Of greater likelihood, but of perhaps lesser potential impact on HGA, are errors in the entry of
time and attendance data; failure to enter information describing new employees, terminations,
and transfers in a timely manner; accidental corruption or loss of time and attendance data; or
errors in interagency coordination and processing of personnel transfers.


Errors of these kinds can cause financial difficulties for employees and accounting problems for
HGA. If an employee's vacation or sick leave balance became negative erroneously during the
last pay period of the year, the employee's last paycheck would be automatically reduced. An

individual who transfers between HGA and another agency may risk receiving duplicate
paychecks or no paychecks for the pay periods immediately following the transfer. Errors of this
sort that occur near the end of the year can lead to errors in W-2 forms and subsequent difficulties
with the tax collection agencies.


20.3.3 Interruption of Operations


HGA's building facilities and physical plant are several decades old and are frequently under repair
or renovation. As a result, power, air conditioning, and LAN or WAN connectivity for the server
are typically interrupted several times a year for periods of up to one work day. For example, on
several occasions, construction workers have inadvertently severed power or network cables.
Fires, floods, storms, and other natural disasters can also interrupt computer operations, as can

equipment malfunctions.


                                                 246
           20. Assessing and Mitigating the Risks to a Hypothetical Computer System




Another threat of small likelihood, but significant potential impact, is that of a malicious or
disgruntled employee or outsider seeking to disrupt time-critical processing (e.g., payroll) by
deleting necessary inputs or system accounts, misconfiguring access controls, planting computer
viruses, or stealing or sabotaging computers or related equipment.
                                                                 Such interruptions, depending
upon when they occur, can prevent time and attendance data from getting processed and
transferred to the mainframe before the payroll processing deadline.


20.3.4 Disclosure or Brokerage of Information


Other kinds of threats may be stimulated by the growing market for information about an
organization's employees or internal activities. Individuals who have legitimate work-related
reasons for access to the master employee database may attempt to disclose such information to
other employees or contractors or to sell it to private investigators, employment recruiters, the
press, or other organizations.   HGA considers such threats to be moderately likely and of low to
high potential impact, depending on the type of information involved.


20.3.5 Network-Related Threats


Most of the human threats of concern to HGA originate from insiders. Nevertheless, HGA also
recognizes the need to protect its assets from outsiders. Such attacks may serve many different
purposes and pose a broad spectrum of risks, including unauthorized disclosure or modification of
information, unauthorized use of services and assets, or unauthorized denial of services.


As shown in Figure 20.1, HGA's systems are connected to the three external networks: (1) the
Internet, (2) the Interagency   WAN, and (3) the public-switched (telephone) network. Although
these networks are a source of security risks, connectivity with them is essential to HGA's mission
and to the productivity of its employees; connectivity cannot be terminated simply because of
security risks.


In each of the past few years before establishing its current set of network safeguards,    HGA had
detected several attempts by outsiders to penetrate its systems. Most, but not all of these, have
come from the Internet, and those that succeeded did so by learning or guessing user account
passwords. In two cases, the attacker deleted or corrupted significant amounts of data, most of
which were later restored from backup files. In most cases, HGA could detect no ill effects of the
attack, but concluded that the attacker may have browsed through some files.         HGA also
conceded that its systems did not have audit logging capabilities sufficient to track an attacker's
activities. Hence, for most of these attacks, HGA could not accurately gauge the extent of

penetration.                                                     ,




In one case, an attacker made use of a bug in an e-mail utility and succeeded in acquiring System
Administrator privileges on the server   —   a significant breach.   HGA found no evidence that the
attacker attempted to exploit these privileges before being discovered two days later.     When the

                                                    247
V.   Example




attack was detected,      COG immediately contacted the HGA's Incident Handling Team, and was
told that a bug fix had been distributed by the server vendor several months earlier.            To its
embarrassment, COG discovered that it had already received the fix, which it then promptly
installed.   It   now believes that no subsequent attacks of the same nature have succeeded.

Although HGA has no evidence that it has been significantly harmed to date by attacks via
external networks, it believes that these attacks have great potential to inflict damage.          HGA's
management considers itself lucky that such attacks have not harmed HGA's reputation and the
confidence of the citizens its serves.     It   also believes the likelihood of such attacks via external
networks will increase in the future.


20.3.6 Other Threats


HGA's systems also are exposed to several other threats that, for reasons of space, cannot be fully
enumerated here. Examples of threats and HGA's assessment of their probabilities and impacts
include those listed in Table 20. 1


20.4    Current Security Measures

HGA has numerous policies and procedures for protecting its assets against the above threats.
These are articulated in HGA's Computer Security Manual, which implements and synthesizes the
requirements of many federal directives, such as Appendix III to          0MB Circular A- 30, the
                                                                                             1

Computer Security Act of 1987, and the Privacy Act. The manual also includes policies for
automated financial systems, such as those based on 0MB Circulars A- 123 and A- 127, as well as
the Federal Managers' Financial Integrity Act.


Several examples of those policies follow, as they apply generally to the use and administration of
HGA's computer system and specifically to security issues related to time and attendance, payroll,
and continuity of operations.


20.4.1 General Use and Administration of HGA's Computer System


HGA's Computer Operations Group (COG) is responsible for controlling, administering, and
maintaining the computer resources owned and operated by HGA. These functions are depicted
in Figure 20. 1     enclosed in the large, dashed rectangle. Only individuals holding the job title
System Administrator are authorized to establish log-in IDs and passwords on multiuser HGA
systems (e.g., the LAN server). Only HGA's employees and contract personnel may use the
system, and only after receiving written authorization from the department supervisor (or, in the
case of contractors, the contracting officer) to whom these individuals report.


COG issues copies of all relevant security policies and procedures to new users. Before activating

                                                        248
             20. Assessing and Mitigating the Risks to a Hypothetical Computer System




a system account for a new users,        COG requires that they       ( 1 )   attend a security awareness and
training course or complete an interactive computer-aided-instruction training session and (2) sign
an acknowledgment form indicating that they understand their security responsibilities.


Authorized users are assigned a secret log-in ID and password, which they must not share with
anyone else. They are expected to comply with all of HGA's password selection and security
procedures (e.g., periodically changing passwords). Users who fail to do so are subject to a range
of penalties.

make effective use of the automated access control mechanisms available on HGA computers to
reduce the risk of exposure to unauthorized individuals. (Appropriate training and education are
in place to help users do this.)     In general, access to disclosure-sensitive information is to be
granted only to individuals whose jobs require it.

20.4.2 Protection Against Payroll Fraud and Errors: Time and Attendance Application


The time and attendance application plays a major role in protecting against payroll fraud and
errors. Since the time and attendance application is a component of a larger automated payroU
process, many of its functional and security requirements have been derived from both
governmentwide and HGA-specific policies related to payroll and leave. For example, HGA must
protect personal information in accordance with the Privacy Act. Depending on the specific type
of information, it should normally be viewable only by the individual concerned, the individual's
supervisors, and personnel and payroll department employees.      Such information should also be
timely and accurate.


Each week, employees must sign and submit a time sheet that identifies the number of hours they
have worked and the amount of leave they have taken. The Time and Attendance Clerk enters the
data for a given group of employees and runs an application on the LAN server to verify the data's
validity and to ensure that only authorized users with access to the Time and Attendance Clerk's
functions can enter time and attendance data. The application performs these security checks by
using the LAN server's access control and identification and authentication (I&A) mechanisms.
The application compares the data with a limited database of employee information to detect
incorrect employee identifiers, implausible numbers of hours worked, and so forth. After
correcting any detected errors, the clerk runs another application that formats the time and
attendance data into a report, flagging exception/out-of-bound conditions (e.g., negative leave
balances).


Department supervisors are responsible for reviewing the correctness of the time sheets of the
employees under their supervision and indicating their approval by initialing the time sheets.    If

they detect significant irregularities and indications of fraud in such data, they must report their
findings to the Payroll Office before submitting the time sheets for processing. In keeping with
the principle of separation of duty, all data on time sheets and corrections on the sheets that may
affect pay, leave, retirement, or other benefits of an individual must be reviewed for validity by at
least two authorized individuals (other than the affected individual).



Protection Against Unauthorized Execution


Only users with access to Time and Attendance Supervisor ftinctions may approve and submit
time and attendance data   —or subsequent corrections thereof     —
                                                                to the mainframe. Supervisors
may not approve their own time and attendance data.

Only the System Administrator has been granted access to assign a special access control privilege
to server programs.    As a result, the server's operating system is designed to prevent a bogus time
and attendance application created by any other user from communicating with the       WAN and,
hence, with the mainframe.




                                                 250
             20. Assessing and Mitigating the Risks to a Hypothetical Computer System




The time and attendance application is supposed to be configured so that the clerk and supervisor
functions can only be carried out from specific PCs attached to the LAN and only during normal
working hours. Administrators are not authorized to exercise functions of the time and
attendance application apart from those concerned with configuring the accounts, passwords, and
access permissions for clerks and supervisors. Administrators are expressly prohibited by policy
from entering, modifying, or submitting time and attendance data via the time and attendance
application or other mechanisms."^'


Protection against unauthorized execution of the time and attendance application depends on I&A
and access controls. While the time and attendance application is accessible from any PC, unlike
most programs run by PC users, it does not execute directly on the PC's processor. Instead, it
executes on the server, while the PC behaves as a terminal, relaying the user's keystrokes to the
server and displaying text and graphics sent from the server.                The reason for this approach is that
common PC systems do not provide I&A and access controls and, therefore, cannot protect
against unauthorized time and attendance program execution. Any individual who has access to
the PC could run any program stored there.


Another possible approach is for the time and attendance program to perform I&A and access
control on its own by requesting and validating a password before beginning each time and
attendance session. This approach, however, can be defeated easily by a moderately skilled
programming attack, and was judged inadequate by HGA during the application's early design
phase.


Recall that the server is a more powerful computer equipped with a multiuser operating system
that includes password-based          I&A and access controls. Designing the time and attendance
application program so that it executes on the server under the control of the server's operating
system provides a more effective safeguard against unauthorized execution than executing it on
the user's PC.


Protection Against Payroll Errors


The frequency of data entry errors is reduced by having Time and Attendance clerks enter each
time sheet into the time and attendance application twice. If the two copies are identical, both are
considered error free, and the record is accepted for subsequent review and approval by a
supervisor. If the copies are not identical, the discrepancies are displayed, and for each
discrepancy, the clerk determines which copy is correct.                The clerk then incorporates the
corrections into one of the copies, which is then accepted for further processing. If the clerk




   '"
        Technically, Systems Administrators may still have the ability to do so. This highlights the importance of adequate
managerial reviews, auditing, and personnel background checks.




                                                            251
V.   Example




makes the same data-entry error twice, then the two copies will match, and one will be accepted
as correct, even though it is erroneous.   To reduce this risk, the time and attendance application
could be configured to require that the two copies be entered by different clerks.


In addition, each department has one or more Time and Attendance Supervisors who are
authorized to review these reports for accuracy and to approve them by running another server
program that is part of the time and attendance application. The data are then subjected to a
collection of "sanity checks" to detect entries whose values are outside expected ranges. Potential
anomalies are displayed to the supervisor prior to allowing approval; if errors are identified, the
data are returned to a clerk for additional examination and corrections.


When a supervisor approves the time and attendance data, this application logs into the
interagency mainframe via the    WAN and transfers the data to a payroll database on the
mainframe. The mainframe later prints paychecks or, using a pool of modems that can send data
over phone lines, it may transfer the funds electronically into employee-designated bank accounts.
Withheld taxes and contributions are also transferred electronically in this manner.


The Director of Personnel is responsible for ensuring that forms describing significant
payroll-related personnel actions are provided to the Payroll Office at least one week before the
payroll processing date for the first affected pay period. These actions include hiring,
terminations, transfers, leaves of absences and returns from such, and pay raises.


The Manager of the Payroll Office is responsible for establishing and maintaining controls
adequate to ensure that the amounts of pay, leave, and other benefits reported on pay stubs and
recorded in permanent records and those distributed electronically are accurate and consistent
with time and attendance data and with other information provided by the Personnel Department.
In particular, paychecks must never be provided to anyone who is not a bona fide, active-status
employee of HGA. Moreover, the pay of any employee who terminates employment, who
transfers, or who goes on leave without pay must be suspended as of the effective date of such
action; that is, extra paychecks or excess pay must not be dispersed.


Protection Against Accidental Corruption or Loss of Payroll Data


The same mechanisms used to protect against fraudulent modification are used to protect against
accidental corruption of time and attendance data    — namely,   the access-control features of the
server and mainframe operating systems.


COG's nightly backups of the server's disks protect against loss of time and attendance data. To a
limited extent,HGA also relies on mainframe administrative personnel to back up time and
attendance data stored on the mainframe, even though    HGA has no direct control over these
individuals. As additional protection against loss of data at the mainframe, HGA retains copies of
all time and attendance data   on line on the server for at least one year, at which time the data are

                                                  252
          20. Assessing and Mitigating the Risks to a Hypothetical Computer System




archived and kept for three years.   The server's access controls for the on-line files are
automatically set to read-only access by the time and attendance application at the time of
submission to the mainframe. The integrity of time and attendance data will be protected by
digital signatures as they are implemented.



The WAN's communications protocols also protect against loss of data during transmission from
the server to the mainframe (e.g., error checking). In addition, the mainframe payroll application
includes a program that is automatically run 24 hours before paychecks and pay stubs are printed.
This program produces a report identifying agencies from whom time and attendance data for the
current pay period were expected but not received. Payroll department staff are responsible for
reviewing the reports and immediately notifying agencies that need to submit or resubmit time and
attendance data. If time and attendance input or other related information is not available on a
timely basis, pay, leave, and other benefits are temporarily calculated based on information
estimated from prior pay periods.


20.4.3 Protection Against Interruption of Operations


HGA's policies regarding continuity of operations are derived from requirements stated in OMB
Circular A- 130. HGA requires various organizations within it to develop contingency plans, test
them annually, and establish appropriate administrative and operational procedures for supporting
them. The plans must identify the facilities, equipment, suppUes, procedures, and personnel
needed to ensure reasonable continuity of operations under a broad range of adverse
circumstances.


COG Contingency Planning

COG is responsible for developing and maintaining a contingency plan that sets forth the
procedures and facilities to be used when physical plant failures, natural disasters, or major
equipment malfunctions occur sufficient to disrupt the normal use of HGA's PCs, LAN, server,
router, printers, and other associated equipment.


The plan prioritizes applications that rely on these resources, indicating those that should be
suspended if available automated fianctions or capacities are temporarily degraded.     COG
personnel have identified system software and hardware components that are compatible with
those used by two nearby agencies.     HGA has signed an agreement with those agencies, whereby
they have committed to reserving spare computational and storage capacities sufficient to support
HGA's system-based operations for a few days during an emergency.

No communication devices or network interfaces may be connected to HGA's systems without
written approval of the   COG Manager. The COG staff is responsible for installing all known
security-related software patches in a timely manner and for maintaining spare or redundant PCs,
servers, storage devices, and   LAN interfaces to ensure that at least 100 people can simultaneously

                                                  253
V.   Example




perform word processing tasks at all times.


To protect against accidental corruption or loss of data, COG personnel back up the LAN server's
disks onto magnetic tape every night and transport the tapes weekly to a sister agency for storage.
HGA's policies also stipulate that all PC users are responsible for backing up weekly any
significant data stored on their PC's local hard disks.   For the past several years, COG has issued a
yearly memorandum reminding PC users of this responsibility.       COG also strongly encourages
them to store significant data on the LAN server instead of on their PC's hard disk so that such
data will be backed up automatically during COG's LAN server backups.


To prevent more limited computer equipment malfunctions from interrupting routine business
operations,   COG maintains an inventory of approximately ten fully equipped spare PC's, a spare
LAN server, and several spare disk drives for the server. COG also keeps thousands of feet of
LAN cable on hand. If a segment of the LAN cable that runs through the ceilings and walls of
HGA's buildings fails or is accidentally severed, COG technicians will run temporary LAN cabling
along the floors of hallways and offices, typically restoring service within a few hours for as long
as needed until the cable failure is located and repaired.


To protect against PC virus contamination, HGA authorizes only System Administrators
approved by the COG Manager to install licensed, copyrighted PC software packages that appear
on the COG-approved list.    PC software applications are generally installed only on the server.
(These stipulations are part of an   HGA assurance strategy that relies on the quality of the
engineering practices of vendors to provide software that is adequately robust and trustworthy.)
Only the COG Manager is authorized to add packages to the approved list.        COG procedures also
stipulate that every month System Administrators should run virus-detection and other
security-configuration validation utilities on the server and, on a spot-check basis, on a number of
PCs. If they find a virus, they must immediately notify the agency team that handles computer
security incidents.


COG is also responsible for reviewing audit logs generated by the server, identifying audit records
indicative of security violations, and reporting such indications to the Incident-Handling Team.
The COG Manager assigns these duties to specific members of the staff and ensures that they are
implemented as intended.


The COG Manager is responsible for assessing adverse circumstances and for providing
recommendations to HGA's Director. Based on these and other sources of input, the Director
will determine whether the. circumstances are dire enough to merit activating various sets of

procedures called for in the contingency plan.


Division Contingency Planning


HGA's divisions also must develop and maintain their own contingency plans. The plans must

                                                  254
            20. Assessing and Mitigating the Risks to a Hypothetical Computer System




identify critical business functions, the system resources and applications on which they depend,
and the maximum acceptable periods of interruption that these functions can tolerate without
significant reduction in HGA's ability to fulfill its mission.   The head of each division is responsible
for ensuring that the division's contingency plan and associated support activities are adequate.


For each major application used by multiple divisions, a chief of a single division must be
designated as the application owner. The designated official (supported by his or her staff) is
responsible for addressing that application in the contingency plan and for coordinating with other
divisions that use the application.


If a division relies exclusively on computer resources maintained by       COG (e.g., the LAN),    it   need
not duplicate COG's contingency plan, but is responsible for reviewing the adequacy of that plan.
If COG's plan does not adequately address the division's needs, the division must communicate its
concerns to the COG Director. In either situation, the division must make known the criticality of
                    COG. If the division relies on computer resources or services that are not
its applications to the

provided by COG, the division is responsible for (1) developing its own contingency plan or (2)
ensuring that the contingency plans of other organizations (e.g., the      WAN service provider)
provide adequate protection against service disruptions.


20.4.4 Protection Against Disclosure or Brokerage of Information


HGA's protection against information disclosure is based on a need-to-know policy and on
personnel hiring and screening practices. The need-to-know policy states that time and
attendance information should be made accessible only to HGA employees and contractors whose
assigned professional responsibilities require it. Such information must be protected against
access from all other individuals, including other     HGA employees. Appropriate hiring and
screening practices can lessen the risk that an untrustworthy individual will be assigned such
responsibilities.



The need-to-know policy is supported by a collection of physical, procedural, and automated
safeguards, including the following:


        •        Time and attendance paper documents are must be stored securely when not in
                 use, particularly during evenings and on weekends. Approved storage containers
                 include locked file cabinets and desk drawers     —
                                                                to which only the owner has the
                    keys. While storage in a container is preferable, it is also permissible to leave time
                    and attendance documents on top of a desk or other exposed surface in a locked
                    office (with the realization that the guard force has keys to the office). (This is a
                judgment left to local discretion.) Similar rules apply to disclosure-sensitive
                information stored on floppy disks and other removable magnetic media.


        •           Every HGA PC is equipped with a key lock that, when locked, disables the PC.

                                                      255
V.      Example




                         When information is stored on a PC's local hard disk, the user to whom that PC
                         was assigned is expected to ( 1 ) lock the PC at the conclusion of each work day
                         and (2) lock the office in which the PC is located.


               •         The LAN server operating system's access controls provide extensive features for
                         controlling access to files.      These include group-oriented controls that allow teams
                         of users to be assigned to named groups by the System Administrator. Group
                         members are then allowed access to sensitive files not accessible to nonmembers.
                         Each user can be assigned to several groups according to need to know. (The
                         reliable functioning of these controls is assumed, perhaps incorrectly, by HGA.)


               •         All PC users undergo security awareness training when first provided accounts on
                         the   LAN server. Among other things, the training stresses the necessity of
                         protecting passwords.       It   also instructs users to log off the server before going
                         home at night or before leaving the PC unattended for periods exceeding an hour.

20.4.5 Protection Against Netv/ork-Related Tiireats


HGA's current set of external network safeguards has only been in place for a few months. The
basic approach is to tightly restrict the kinds of external network interactions that can occur by
funneling all traffic to and from external networks through two interfaces that filter out
unauthorized kinds of interactions. As indicated in Figure 20. 1 the two interfaces are the
                                                                                   ,



network router and the LAN server. The only kinds of interactions that these interfaces allow are
( 1 )   e-mail and (2) data transfers from the server to the mainframe controlled by a few special
applications (e.g., the time and attendance application).


Figure 20. 1 shows that the network router is the only direct interface between the LAN and the
Internet.          The router is a dedicated special-purpose computer that translates between the
protocols and addresses associated with the LAN and the Internet. Internet protocols, unlike
those used on the WAN, specify that packets of information coming from or going to the Internet
must carry an indicator of the kind of service that is being requested or used to process the
information. This makes it possible for the router to distinguish e-mail packets from other kinds
of packets         —   for example, those associated with a remote log-in request.''*^               The router has been
configured by COG to discard all packets coming from or going to the Internet, except those
associated with e-mail. COG personnel believe that the router effectively eliminates
Internet-based attacks on HGA user accounts because     disallows aU remote log-in sessions, even
                                                                         it


those accompanied by a legitimate password.

                                                                256
             20. Assessing and Mitigating the Risks to a Hypothetical Computer System




The LAN server enforces a similar type of restriction for dial-in access via the public-switched
network. The access controls provided by the server's operating system have been configured so
that during dial-in sessions, only the e-mail utility can be executed.   (HGA policy, enforced by
periodic checks, prohibits installation of modems on PCs, so that access must be through the    LAN
server.) In addition, the server's access controls have been configured so that its   WAN interface
device is accessible only to programs that possess a special access-control privilege. Only the
System Administrator can assign this privilege to server programs, and only a handful of
special-purpose applications, like the time and attendance application, have been assigned this
privilege.



20.4.6 Protection Against Risks from Non-HGA Computer Systems


HGA relies on systems and components that cannot control directly because they are owned by
                                               it


other organizations. HGA has developed a policy to avoid undue risk in such situations. The
policy states that system components controlled and operated by organizations other than HGA
may not be used to process, store, or transmit HGA information without obtaining explicit
permission from the application owner and the COG Manager. Permission to use such system
components may not be granted without written commitment from the controlling organization
that HGA's information will be safeguarded commensurate with its value, as designated by HGA.
This policy is somewhat mitigated by the fact that HGA has developed an issue-specific policy on
the use of the Internet, which allows for its use for e-mail with outside organizations and access to
other resources (but not for transmission of HGA's proprietary data).


20.5    Vulnerabilities Reported by the Risk Assessment Team

The risk assessment team found that many of the risks to which HGA is exposed stem from (1)
the failure of individuals to comply with established policies and procedures or (2) the use of
automated mechanisms whose assurance is questionable because of the ways they have been
developed, tested, implemented, used, or maintained. The team also identified specific
vulnerabilities in HGA's policies and procedures for protecting against payroll fraud and errors,

interruption of operations, disclosure and brokering of confidential information, and unauthorized
access to data by outsiders.


20.5.1 Vulnerabilities Related to Payroll Fraud


Falsified Time Sheets


The primary safeguards against falsified time sheets are review and approval by supervisory
personnel, who are not permitted to approve their own time and attendance data. The risk
assessment has concluded that, while imperfect, these safeguards £ire adequate. The related
requirement that a clerk and a supervisor must cooperate closely in creating time and attendance



                                                    257
V.   Example




data and submitting the data to the mainframe also safeguards against other kinds of Ulicit
manipulation of time and attendance data by clerks or supervisors acting independently.


Unauthorized Access


When a PC user enters a password to the server during I&A, the password is sent to the server by
broadcasting it over the LAN "in the clear." This allows the password to be intercepted easily by
any other PC connected to the LAN. In fact, so-called "password sniffer" programs that capture
passwords in this way are widely available.     Similarly, a malicious program planted on a PC could
also intercept passwords before transmitting them to the server.     An unauthorized individual who
obtained the captured passwords could then run the time and attendance application in place of a
clerk or supervisor. Users might also store passwords in a log-on script file.


Bogus Time and Attendance Applications

The server's access controls are probably adequate for protection against bogus time and
attendance applications that run on the server. However, the server's operating system and access
controls have only been in widespread use for a few years and contain a number of
security-related bugs.   And the server's access controls are ineffective if not properly configured,
and the administration of the server's security features in the past has been notably lax.


Unauthorized Modification of Time and Attendance Data


Protection against unauthorized modification of time and attendance data requires a variety of
safeguards because each system component on which the data are stored or transmitted is a
potential source of vulnerabilities.


First, the time and attendance data are entered on the server by a clerk.    On occasion, the clerk
may begin data entry late in the afternoon, and complete it the following morning, storing it in a
temporary file between the two sessions. One way to avoid unauthorized modification is to store
the data on a diskette and lock it up overnight.    After being entered, the data will be stored in
another temporary file until reviewed and approved by a supervisor. These files, now stored on
the system, must be protected against tampering.      As before, the server's access controls, if
reliable and properly configured, can provide such protection (as can digital signatures, as

discussed later) in conjunction with proper auditing.


Second, when the Supervisor approves a batch of time and attendance data, the time and
attendance application sends the data over the     WAN to the mainframe. The WAN        is   a collection
of communications equipment and special-purpose computers called "switches" that act as relays,
routing information through the network from source to destination.       Each switch is a potential
site at which the time and attendance data    may be fraudulently modified. For example, an HGA
PC user might be able to intercept time and attendance data and modify the data enroute to the

                                                   258
          20. Assessing and Mitigating the Risks to a Hypothetical Computer System




payroll application on the mainframe. Opportunities include tampering with incomplete time and
attendance input files while stored on the server, interception and tampering during   WAN transit,
or tampering on arrival to the mainframe prior to processing by the payroll application.


Third, on arrival at the mainframe, the time and attendance data are held in a temporary file on the
mainframe until the payroll application is run. Consequently, the mainframe's I&A and access
controls must provide a critical element of protection against unauthorized modification of the
data.


According to the risk assessment, the server's access controls, with prior caveats, probably
provide acceptable protection against unauthorized modification of data stored on the server. The
assessment concluded that a WAN-based attack involving collusion between an employee of
HGA and an employee of the WAN service provider, although unlikely, should not be dismissed
                     HGA has only cursory information about the service provider's personnel
entirely, especially since

security practices and no contractual authority over how it operates the   WAN.

The greatest source of vulnerabilities, however, is the mainframe. Although its operating system's
access controls are mature and powerful, it uses password-based I&A. This is Of particular
concern, because it serves a large number of federal agencies via WAN connections. A number of
these agencies are known to have poor security programs. As a result, one such agency's systems
could be penetrated (e.g., from the Internet) and then used in attacks on the mainframe via the
WAN. In fact, time and attendance data awaiting processing on the mainframe would probably
not be as attractive a target to an attacker as other kinds of data or, indeed, disabling the system,
rendering it unavailable. For example, an attacker might be able to modify the employee data base
so that it disbursed paychecks or pensions checks to fictitious employees. Disclosure-sensitive
law enforcement databases might also be attractive targets.


The access control on the mainframe is strong and provides good protection against intruders
breaking into a second application after they have broken into a first. However, previous audits
have shown that the difficulties of system administration may present some opportunities for
intruders to defeat access controls.


20.5.2 Vulnerabilities Related to Payroll Errors


HGA's management has established procedures for ensuring the timely submission and
interagency coordination of paperwork associated with personnel status changes. However, an
unacceptably large number of troublesome payroU errors during the past several years has been
traced to the late submission of personnel paperwork.    The risk assessment documented the
adequacy of HGA's safeguards, but criticized the managers for not providing sufficient incentives
for compliance.




                                                 259
V.   Example




20.5.3 Vulnerabilities Related to Continuity of Operations


COG Contingency Planning

The risk assessment commended HGA for many aspects of COG's contingency plan, but pointed
out that many COG personnel were completely unaware of the responsibilities the plan assigned
to them. The assessment also noted that although HGA's policies require annual testing of
contingency plans, the capability to resume HGA's computer-processing activities at another
cooperating agency has never been verified and may turn out to be illusory.


Division Contingency Planning


The risk assessment reviewed a number of the application-oriented contingency plans developed
by HGA's divisions (including plans related to time and attendance). Most of the plans were
cursory and attempted to delegate nearly all contingency planning responsibility to COG. The
assessment criticized several of these plans for failing to address potential disruptions caused by
lack of access to (1) computer resources not managed by      COG and (2) nonsystem resources, such
as buildings, phones, and other facilities.   In particular, the contingency plan encompassing the
time and attendance application was criticized for not addressing disruptions caused by    WAN and
mainframe outages.


Virus Prevention


The risk assessment found HGA's virus-prevention policy and procedures to be sound, but noted
that there was little evidence that they were being followed. In particular, no COG personnel
interviewed had ever run a virus scanner on a PC on a routine basis, though several had run them
during publicized virus scares. The assessment cited this as a significant risk item.


Accidental Corruption and Loss of Data


The risk assessment concluded that HGA's safeguards against accidental corruption and loss of
time and attendance data were adequate, but that safeguards for some other kinds of data were
not. The assessment included an informal audit of a dozen randomly chosen PCs and PC users in
the agency. It concluded that many PC users store significant data on their PC's hard disks, but
do not back them up. Based on anecdotes, the assessment's authors stated that there appear to
have been many past incidents of loss of information stored on PC hard disks and predicted that
such losses would continue.


20.5.4 Vulnerabilities Related to Information Disclosure/Brokerage


HGA takes a conservative approach toward protecting information about its employees. Since
information brokerage is more likely to be a threat to large collections of data, HGA risk


                                                   260
              20. Assessing and Mitigating the Risks to a Hypothetical Computer System




assessment focused primarily, but not exclusively, on protecting the mainframe.


The risk assessment concluded that significant, avoidable information brokering vulnerabilities
                 —
were present particularly due to HGA's lack of compliance with its own policies and procedures.
Time and attendance documents were typically not stored securely after hours, and few PCs
containing time and attendance information were routinely locked. Worse yet, few were routinely
powered down, and many were left logged into the LAN server overnight. These practices make
it   easy for an   HGA employee wandering the haUs after hours to browse or copy time and
attendance information on another employee's desk, PC hard disk, or LAN server directories.


The risk assessment pointed out that information sent to or retrieved fi"omx the server is subject to
eavesdropping by other PCs on the LAN. The LAN hardware transmits information by
broadcasting it to all connection points on the LAN cable. Moreover, information sent to or
retrieved from the server is transmitted in the clear   —
                                                      that is, without encryption. Given the
widespread availability of LAN "sniffer" programs, LAN eavesdropping is trivial for a prospective
information broker and, hence, is likely to occur.


Last, the assessment noted that HGA's employee master database is stored on the mainframe,
where it might be a target for information brokering by employees of the agency that owns the
mainfi"ame.     It might also be a target for information brokering,   fraudulent modification, or other
illicit   acts by any outsider who penetrates the mainframe via another host on the    WAN.

20.5.5 Network-Related Vulnerabilities


The risk assessment concurred with the general approach taken by HGA, but identified several
vulnerabilities.     It reiterated previous concerns about the lack of assurance associated with the

server's access controls and pointed out that these play a critical role in HGA's approach.      The
assessment noted that the e-mail utility allows a user to include a copy of any otherwise accessible
file in an outgoing mail message.      If an attacker dialed in to the server and succeeded in logging in

as an     HGA employee, the attacker could use the mail utility to export copies of all the files
accessible to that employee. In fact, copies could be mailed to any host on the Internet.


The assessment also noted that the WAN service provider may rely on microwave stations or
satellites as relay points, thereby exposing HGA's information to eavesdropping. Similarly, any

information, including passwords and mail messages, transmitted during a dial-in session is subject
to eavesdropping.

20.6           Recommendations for Mitigating the Identified Vulnerabilities

The discussions in the following subsections were chosen to illustrate a broad sampling'''^ of
handbook topics. Risk management and security program management themes are integral
throughout, with particular emphasis given to the selection of risk-driven safeguards.


20.6.1 Mitigating Payroll Fraud Vulnerabilities


To remove the vulnerabilities related to payroll fraud, the risk assessment team recommended''*^
the use of stronger authentication mechanisms based on smart tokens to generate one-time
passwords that cannot be used by an interloper for subsequent sessions. Such mechanisms would
make it very difficult for outsiders (e.g., from the Internet) who penetrate systems on the WAN to
use them to attack the mainframe. The authors noted, however, that the mainframe serves many
different agencies, and HGA has no authority over the way the mainframe is configured and
operated. Thus, the costs and procedural difficulties of implementing such controls would be
substantial. The assessment team also recommended improving the server's administrative
procedures and the speed with which security-related bug fixes distributed by the vendor are
installed on the server.


After input from           COG security specialists and application owners, HGA's managers accepted
most of the risk assessment team's recommendations. They decided that since the residual risks
from the falsification of time sheets were acceptably low, no changes in procedures were
necessary. However, they judged the risks of payroU fraud due to the interceptability of LAN
server passwords to be unacceptably high, and thus directed                         COG to investigate the costs and
procedures associated with using one-time passwords for Time and Attendance Clerks and
supervisor sessions on the server. Other users performing less sensitive tasks on the                              LAN would
continue to use password-based authentication.


While the immaturity of the LAN server's access controls was judged a significant source of risk,
COG was only able to identify one other PC LAN product that would be significantly better in
this respect.          Unfortunately, this product was considerably less friendly to users and application
developers, and incompatible with other applications used by HGA.                             The negative impact of
changing PC LAN products was judged too high for the potential incremental gain in security
benefits.               HGA decided to accept the risks accompanying use of the current
                  Consequently,
product, but directed COG to improve its monitoring of the server's access control configuration



     '''^
            Some of the controls, such as auditing and access controls, play an important role in many areas. The limited
nature of this example, however, prevents a broader discussion.


            Note that, for the sake of brevity, the process of evaluating the cost-effectiveness of various security controls is not
specifically discussed.




                                                                  262
              20. Assessing and Mitigating the Risks to a Hypothetical Computer System




and its responsiveness to vendor security reports and bug fixes.


HGA concurred that risks of fraud due to unauthorized modification of time and attendance data
at or in transit to the mainframe should not be accepted unless no practical solutions could be

identified.After discussions with the mainframe's owning agency, HGA concluded that the
owning agency was unlikely to adopt the advanced authentication techniques advocated in the risk
assessment. COG, however, proposed an alternative approach that did not require a major
resource commitment on the part of the mainframe owner.


The alternative approach would employ digital signatures based on public key cryptographic
techniques to detect unauthorized modification of time and attendance data. The data would be
digitally signed by the supervisor using a private key prior to transmission to the mainframe.
When the payroll application program was run on the mainframe, it would use the corresponding
public key to validate the correspondence between the time and attendance data and the signature.
Any modification of the data during transmission over the WAN or while in temporary storage at
the mainframe would result in a mismatch between the signature and the data. If the payroll
application detected a mismatch, it would reject the data;   HGA personnel would then be notified
and asked to review, sign, and send the data again.   If the data and signature matched, the payroll

application would process the time and attendance data normally.


HGA's decision to use advanced authentication for time and attendance Clerks and Supervisors
can be combined with digital signatures by using smart tokens. Smart tokens are programmable
devices, so they can be loaded with private keys and instructions for computing digital signatures
without burdening the user.    When supervisors approve a batch of time and attendance data, the
time and attendance application on the server would instruct the supervisor to insert their token in
the token reader/writer device attached to the supervisors' PC. The application would then send a
special "hash" (summary) of the time and attendance data to the token via the PC. The token
would generate a digital signature using its embedded secret key, and then transfer the signature
back to the server, again via the PC. The time and attendance application running on the server
would append the signature to the data before sending the data to the mainframe and, ultimately,
the payroll application.


Although this approach did not address the broader problems posed by the mainframe's I&A
vulnerabilities, it does provide a reliable means of detecting time and attendance data tampering.
In addition, it protects against bogus time and attendance submissions from systems connected to
the   WAN because individuals who lack a time and attendance supervisor's smart token will be
unable to generate valid signatures. (Note, however, that the use of digital signatures does
require increased administration, particularly in the area of key management.) In summary, digital
signatures mitigate risks from a number of different kinds of threats.


HGA's management concluded that digitally signing time and attendance data was a practical,
cost-effective way of mitigating risks, and directed COG to pursue its implementation. (They also

noted that it would be useful as the agency moved to use of digital signatures in other
applications.) This is an example of developing and providing a solution in an environment over
which no single entity has overall authority.


20.6.2 Mitigating Payroll Error Vulnerabilities


After reviewing the risk assessment, HGA's management concluded that the agency's current
safeguards against payroll errors and against accidental corruption and loss of time and attendance
data were adequate. However, the managers also concurred with the risk assessment's
conclusions about the necessity for establishing incentives for complying (and penalties for not
complying) with these safeguards. They thus tasked the Director of Personnel to ensure greater
compliance with paperwork-handling procedures and to provide quarterly compliance audit
reports.   They noted that the digital signature mechanism HGA plans to use for fraud protection
can also provide protection against payroll errors due to accidental corruption.


20.6.3 Mitigating Vulnerabilities Related to the Continuity of Operations


The assessment recommended that COG institute a program of periodic internal training and
awareness sessions for COG personnel having contingency plan responsibilities.The assessment
urged that COG undertake a rehearsal during the next three months in which selected parts of the
plan would be exercised.   The rehearsal should include attempting to initiate some aspect of
processing activities at one of the designated alternative sites. HGA's management agreed that
additional contingency plan training was needed for COG personnel and committed itself to its
first plan rehearsal within three months.



                          HGA divisions owning applications that depend on the WAN
After a short investigation,
concluded that   WAN outages, although inconvenient, would not have a major impact on HGA.
This is because the few time-sensitive applications that required WAN-based communication with
the mainframe were originally designed to work with magnetic tape instead of the   WAN, and
could still operate in that mode; hence courier-delivered magnetic tapes could be used as an
alternative input medium in case of a   WAN outage. The divisions responsible for contingency
planning for these applications agreed to incorporate into their contingency plans both
descriptions of these procedures and other improvements.


With respect to mainframe outages, HGA determined that it could not easily make arrangements
for a suitable alternative site. HGA also obtained and examined a copy of the mainframe facility's
own contingency plan. After detailed study, including review by an outside consultant, HGA
concluded that the plan had major deficiencies and posed significant risks because of HGA's
reliance on it for payroll and other services. This was brought to the attention of the Director of
HGA, who, in a formal memorandum to the head of the mainframe's owning agency, called for (1)
a high-level interagency review of the plan by all agencies that rely on the mainframe, and (2)
corrective action to remedy any deficiencies found.


                                                 264
          20. Assessing and Mitigating the Risks to a Hypothetical Computer System




HGA's management agreed to improve adherence to its virus-prevention procedures.               It agreed

(from the point of view of the entire agency) that information stored on PC hard disks is
frequently lost.   It estimated,   however, that the labor hours lost as a result would amount to less
than a person year   —which HGA management does not consider             to be unacceptable.   After
reviewing options for reducing this risk,     HGA concluded that   it    would be cheaper to accept the
associated loss than to commit significant resources in an attempt to avoid it.       COG volunteered,
however, to set up an automated program on the LAN server that e-maUs backup reminders to all
PC users once each quarter. In addition, COG agreed to provide regular backup services for
about 5 percent of HGA's PCs; these wiU be chosen by HGA's management based on the
information stored on their hard disks.


20.6.4 Mitigating Threats of Information Disclosure/Brokering


HGA concurred with the risk assessment's conclusions about its exposure to
information-brokering risks, and adopted most of the associated recommendations.


The assessment recommended that HGA improve its security awareness training (e.g., via
mandatory refresher courses) and that it institute some form of compliance audits. The training
should be sure to stress the penalties for noncompliance.      It also   suggested installing "screen lock"
software on PCs that automatically lock a PC after a specified period of idle time in which no
keystrokes have been entered; unlocking the screen requires that the user enter a password or
reboot the system.


The assessment recommended that HGA modify its information-handling policies so that
employees would be required to store some kinds of disclosure-sensitive information only on PC
local hard disks (or floppies), but not on the server. This would eliminate or reduce risks of LAN
eavesdropping. It was also recommended that an activity log be installed on the server (and
regularly reviewed). Moreover, it would avoid unnecessary reliance on the server's access-control
features, which are of uncertain assurance. The assessment noted, however, that this strategy
conflicts with the desire to store most information on the server's disks so that it is backed up
routinely by COG personnel. (This could be offset by assigning responsibility for someone other
than the PC owner to make backup copies.) Since the security habits of HGA's PC users have
generally been poor, the assessment also recommended use of hard-disk encryption utilities to
protect disclosure-sensitive information on unattended PCs from browsing by unauthorized
individuals. Also, ways to encrypt information on the server's disks would be studied.


The assessment recommended that HGA conduct a thorough review of the mainframe's
safeguards in these respects, and that it regularly review the mainframe audit log, using a query
package, with particular attention to records that describe user accesses to HGA's employee
master database.




                                                    265
V.   Example




20.6.5 Mitigating Network-Related Threats


The assessment recommended that HGA:

•       require stronger I&A for dial-in access or, alternatively, that a restricted version of the
        mail utility be provided for dial-in, which would prevent a user from including files in
        outgoing mail messages;


•       replace its current modem pool with encrypting modems, and provide each dial-in user
        with such a modem; and


•       work with the mainframe agency to install a similar encryption capability for
        server-to-mainframe communications over the WAN.


As with previous risk assessment recommendations, HGA's management tasked COG to analyze
the costs, benefits, and impacts of addressing the vulnerabilities identified in the risk assessment.
HGA eventually adopted some of the risk assessment's recommendations, while declining others.
In addition, HGA decided that its policy on handling time and attendance information needed to
be clarified, strengthened, and elaborated, with the belief that implementing such a policy would
help reduce risks of Internet and dial- in eavesdropping. Thus,   HGA developed and issued a
revised policy, stating that users are individually responsible for ensuring that they do not transmit
disclosure-sensitive information outside of HGA's facilities via e-mail or other means.    It   also
prohibited them from examining or transmitting e-mail containing such information during dial-in
sessions and developed and promulgated penalties for noncompliance.


20.7    Summary

This chapter has illustrated how many of the concepts described in previous chapters might be
applied in a federal agency.   An integrated example concerning a Hypothetical Government
Agency (HGA) has been discussed and used as the basis for examining a number of these
concepts. HGA's distributed system architecture and its uses were described. The time and
attendance application was considered in some detail.


For context, some national and agency-level policies were referenced. Detailed operational
policies and procedures for computer systems were discussed and related to these high-level
policies.   HGA assets and threats were identified, and a detailed survey of selected safeguards,
vulnerabilities, and risk mitigation actions were presented.   The safeguards included a wide variety
of procedural and automated techniques, and were used to illustrate issues of assurance,
compliance, security program oversight, and inter-agency coordination.


As illustrated, effective computer security requires clear direction from upper management.

          20. Assessing and Mitigating the Risks to a Hypothetical Computer System




Upper management must assign security responsibilities to organizational elements and individuals
and must formulate or elaborate the security policies that become the foundation for the
organization's security program. These policies must be based on an understanding of the
organization's mission priorities and the assets and business operations necessary to fulfill them.
They must also be based on a pragmatic assessment of the threats against these assets and
operations.   A critical element is assessment of threat likelihoods. These are most accurate when
derived from historical data, but must also anticipate trends stimulated by emerging technologies.


A good security program relies on an integrated, cost-effective collection of physical, procedural,
and automated controls. Cost-effectiveness requires targeting these controls at the threats that
pose the highest risks while accepting other residual risks. The difficulty of applying controls
properly and in a consistent manner over time has been the downfall of many security programs.
This chapter has provided numerous examples in which major security vulnerabilities arose from a
lack of assurance or compliance. Hence, periodic compliance audits, examinations of the
effectiveness of controls, and reassessments of threats are essential to the success of any
organization's security program.

National Standard Reference Data Series Provides quantitative data on the physical and chemical
properties of materials, compiled from the world's literature and critically evaluated. Developed under a
worldwide program coordinated by NIST under the authority of the National Standard Data Act (Public
Law 90-396). NOTE: The Journal of Physical and Chemical Reference Data (JPCRD) is published
bimonthly for NIST by the American Chemical Society (ACS) and the American Institute of Physics (AIP).
Subscriptions, reprints, and supplements are available from ACS, 1155 Sixteenth St., NW, Washington, DC
20056.
                              —
Building Science Series Disseminates technical information developed at the Institute on building
materials, components, systems, and whole structures. The series presents research results, test methods, and
performance criteria related to the structural and environmental functions and the durability and safety
characteristics of building elements and systems.

Technical Notes    —     Studies or reports which are complete in themselves but restrictive in their treatment of
a subject. Analogous to monographs but not so comprehensive in scope or definitive in treatment of the
subject area. Often serve as a vehicle for final reports of work performed at NIST under the sponsorship of
other government agencies.
Voluntary Product Standards          —Developed under procedures published by            the Department of Commerce
in Part 10, Title 15,of the Code of Federal Regulations. The standards establish nationally recognized
requirements for products, and provide all concerned interests with a basis for common understanding of
the characteristics of the products. NIST administers this program in support of the efforts of private-sector
standardizing organizations.

Order the following NIST publications         —FIPS and NISTIRs—from the National Technical Information
Service, Springfield, VA 22161.
                                                                                     —
Federal Information Processing Standards Publications (FIPS PUB) Publications in this series
collectively constitute the Federal Information Processing Standards Register. The Register serves as the
official source   of information in the Federal Government regarding standards issued by NIST pursuant to
the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 as amended. Public Law 89-306 (79 Stat.
1   127), and as implemented by Executive Order            1   1717 (38 FR 12315, dated May 1 1, 1973) and Part 6 of
Title 15 CFR (Code of Federal Regulations).
