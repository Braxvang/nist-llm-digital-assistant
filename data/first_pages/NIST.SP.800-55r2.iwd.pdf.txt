 85   Abstract
 86   This document provides guidance on how an organization can use metrics to identifies the
 87   adequacy of an in-place security controls, policies, and procedures. It provides an approach to
 88   help management decide where to invest in additional security protection resources or identify
 89   and evaluate nonproductive controls. It explains the metric development and implementation
 90   process and how it can also be used to adequately justify security control investments. The
 91   results of an effective metric program can provide useful data for directing the allocation of
 92   information security resources and should simplify the preparation of performance-related
 93   reports.

 94   Keywords
 95   information security; metrics; measures; security controls; performance; reports.

 96   Reports on Computer Systems Technology
 97   The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and
 98   Technology (NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical
 99   leadership for the Nation’s measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops tests, test
100   methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance
101   the development and productive use of information technology. ITL’s responsibilities include the
102   development of management, administrative, technical, and physical standards and guidelines for
103   the cost-effective security and privacy of other than national security-related information in
104   federal information systems. The Special Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research,
105   guidelines, and outreach efforts in information system security, and its collaborative activities
106   with industry, government, and academic organizations.

107   Note to Reviewers
108   We seek input on the changes being proposed to SP 800-55. New sections are noted as new
109   additions to SP 800-55. Many are also marked by a “Note to Reviewer” with a request for
110   feedback. These questions are meant to facilitate discussion and should not discourage input on
111   any other topics within this annotated outline. There are three additional questions for reviewer
112   consideration. These questions are:
113       1) CIOs and CISOs: What measurement and metrics guidance would benefit your program?
114       2) How to best communicate information security measurement needs up and down the
115          organizational structure?
116       3) Examples: What kinds of measures and metrics examples or templates could this
117          publication provide that would be helpful in your work?
118   This working draft also has sections with only minor planned changes marked as “intentionally
119   left out of this review cycle” to allow for readers to focus on the more substantial proposed
120   changes. The Initial Public Draft will include the full proposed text for all sections of the

121   document. Feedback is still welcome on the sections not highlighted in this Initial Working
122   Draft.
123   A virtual public forum will be held on December 13, 2022, to introduce the working draft of SP
124   800-55 and highlight the various questions for reviewers within the document through a panel of
125   practitioners across different sectors.

128   Call for Patent Claims
129   This public review includes a call for information on essential patent claims (claims whose use
130   would be required for compliance with the guidance or requirements in this Information
131   Technology Laboratory (ITL) draft publication). Such guidance and/or requirements may be
132   directly stated in this ITL Publication or by reference to another publication. This call also
133   includes disclosure, where known, of the existence of pending U.S. or foreign patent applications
134   relating to this ITL draft publication and of any relevant unexpired U.S. or foreign patents.
135   ITL may require from the patent holder, or a party authorized to make assurances on its behalf,
136   in written or electronic form, either:
137       a) assurance in the form of a general disclaimer to the effect that such party does not hold
138          and does not currently intend holding any essential patent claim(s); or
139       b) assurance that a license to such essential patent claim(s) will be made available to
140          applicants desiring to utilize the license for the purpose of complying with the guidance
141          or requirements in this ITL draft publication either:
142              i.   under reasonable terms and conditions that are demonstrably free of any unfair
143                   discrimination; or
144             ii.   without compensation and under reasonable terms and conditions that are
145                   demonstrably free of any unfair discrimination.
146   Such assurance shall indicate that the patent holder (or third party authorized to make assurances
147   on its behalf) will include in any documents transferring ownership of patents subject to the
148   assurance, provisions sufficient to ensure that the commitments in the assurance are binding on
149   the transferee, and that the transferee will similarly include appropriate provisions in the event of
150   future transfers with the goal of binding each successor-in-interest.
151   The assurance shall also indicate that it is intended to be binding on successors-in-interest
152   regardless of whether such provisions are included in the relevant transfer documents.
153   Such statements should be addressed to: cyber-measures@list.nist.gov, with the subject “NIST
154   SP 800-55r2 call for patent claims”

274   2.1.2. Definition

275                This section only has minor updates from [3.1 Definition] in the current
276                [SP800-55] and is intentionally left out of this review cycle.
277   Summary: Information security measures facilitate decision making and improve performance
278   and accountability through collection, analysis, and reporting relevant performance-related data.
279   The purpose of measure performance is to monitor the status of measured activities and facilitate
280   improvement by applying corrective actions based on observable measurements. Measures
281   should be:
282       •   Possible to obtain at different levels within an organization
283       •   Based on information security performance goals and objectives
284       •   Information security measures monitor the accomplishment of goals and objectives by
285           quantifying the implementation, efficiency, and effectiveness of security controls.
286       •   Data required for calculating measures must be readily obtainable, and the process under
287           consideration needs to be measurable.
288       •   Allow for tracking performance and directing resources.

319                current [SP800-55] and is intentionally left out of this review cycle.
320   Summary: Organizational maturity determines the types of measures an organization can gather
321   successfully. The existence and institutionalization of processes and procedures define this
322   maturity. This section explores types of measures – implementation, effectiveness/efficiency,
323   and business impact – against the measurement of processes, operating procedures, data
324   availability, collection difficulty, collection automation.

340                review cycle.

341   Summary: Effectiveness/Efficiency measures are used to monitor if program-level processes and
342   system- level security controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and meeting the
343   desired outcome. These measures concentrate on the evidence and results of assessments and
344   may require multiple data points quantifying the degree to which information security controls
345   are implemented and the resulting effect(s) on the organization’s information security posture.
346   Effectiveness/efficiency measures address two aspects of security control implementation
347   results: the robustness of the result itself, referred to as effectiveness, and the timeliness of the
348   result, referred to as efficiency.

351                This section only has minor updates from [3.3.3 Impact Measures] in the
352                current [SP800-55] and is intentionally left out of this review cycle.

353   Summary: Impact measures articulate the impact of information security on an organization’s
354   mission. These measures are inherently organization-specific and combine information about the
355   results of security controls implementation with information about resources. Resource
356   information across an organization is tied directly to information security activity and events that
357   must be tracked to assess impact measures.

362                this review cycle.

363   Summary: Organizations embarking on information security performance measurement should
364   be aware of several considerations for helping their program succeed. These include specific
365   organizational structures and processes. Successful information security performance
366   measurement also requires understanding budget, personnel, and time resources.

371                this review cycle.

372   Summary: The development of information security metrics and program implementation
373   requires the involvement of appropriate stakeholders across various organizational elements that
374   interact with information security. Each stakeholder should provide inputs to the measures

380                current [SP800-55] and is intentionally left out of this review cycle.

381   Summary: Any information security measurement program must be manageable for the
382   implementing organization. As resources are limited organizations should prioritize
383   measurement requirements to ensure that a limited number of measures are gathered. As the
384   program matures and target levels of measurement are reached, obsolete measures should be
385   phased out and new ones that measure completion and effectiveness of more current items
386   should be used.

387   Any additional input on this section is welcome.

391                review cycle.

392   Summary: To ensure the quality and validity of data, data collection methods and data
393   repositories used for measures data should be standardized. Although substantial amounts of data
394   may be collected, not all data will be useful for an information security measurement program
395   and any given point in time. Data collection should be as nonintrusive as possible. The
396   operational and vulnerability information contained in information security data repositories
397   needs to be protected appropriately due to the sensitive nature of the data.

424   Summary: Efficient data management is facilitated by automating measurement data collection.
425   Automating measurement data collection standardizes data collection and reporting and helps
426   institutionalize measurement activity by integrating it into business processes. In addition,
427   automated data collection minimizes opportunities for human error, leading to greater accuracy
428   of available data.

453                Program] in the current [SP800-55] and is intentionally left out of this
454                review cycle.

455   Summary: Information security measurement can be implemented on an enterprise-wide level to
456   monitor an organization’s information security activities. Enterprise-level measures can be
457   derived by aggregating multiple system-level measures or developed by using the entire
458   enterprise as the scope. These aggregated and individual information security measurements are
459   then used to inform decisions made on an enterprise level.

461       Measures Development Process

462                This section only has minor updates from [5. Measures Development
463                Process] in the current [SP800-55] and is intentionally left out of this
464                review cycle.

465   Summary: Overview of considerations when selecting appropriate measures for an organization
466   to pursue. This illustrates an iterative process with two major activities:

467       •    Identify and define the current information security measurement program
468       •    Develop and select specific measures to gauge the implementation,
469            effectiveness/efficiency, and impact of the organization’s security controls.

470   This development process is a way to think about measures and identify measures tailored to
471   organizational needs, not as a sequential guide. The information security measure development
472   process includes seven phases:

473       1.   Stakeholders and interests
474       2.   Goals and objectives
475       3.   Information security policies, guidelines, and procedures
476       4.   Information security program implementation
477       5.   Level of implementation
478       6.   Program results
479       7.   Business/mission impact

487   Summary: Phase 1 is identifying relevant stakeholders. Stakeholder interests will differ
488   depending on their roles and position within the organization. Each stakeholder may require an
489   additional set of customized measures that give insight into their area of responsibility.

495   Summary: Phase 2 is identifying and documenting information security program goals and
496   objectives that would guide security control implementation. Information security program goals
497   can also be derived from enterprise-level goals and objectives in support of the overall
498   organization’s mission.

501                This section is a new addition to [SP800-55] and will explore how goals
502                and objectives may be determined by goals created outside of the
503                information security program, including:

504       •   Governance structures
505       •   Laws and regulations
506       •   Industry guidance
507       •   Various requirements from outside the organizational structure, such as:
508              o Insurance
509              o Auditors
510              o Accreditation bodies
511              o Compliance reviews

517                and is intentionally left out of this review cycle.

518   Summary: Phase 3 focuses on reviewing organization-specific security practices that define a
519   baseline for information security practices. These policies, guidelines, and procedures should be
520   reviewed during the measures development process and periodically afterward.

526   Summary: Phase 4 consists of reviewing any existing measures or data repositories that could be
527   used to derive measures. The retirement of existing measures and development of new measures
528   will continue as the information security measures program evolves.

538                This section only has minor updates from [5.5.1 Measures Development
539                Approach] in the current [SP800-55] and is intentionally left out of this
540                review cycle.

541   Summary: The scope of the measurement effort informs if the development of information
542   security measures should focus on gauging the security performance of a specific security
543   control, a group of security controls, or a security program.

544   Any additional input on this section is welcome.

545   3.5.2. Measures Prioritization and Selection

546                This section has significant updates from [5.5.2 Measures Prioritization
547                and Selection] in the current [SP800-55].

548   There is a huge number of possible measures for an organization to monitor. Measures
549   prioritization ensures that the set selected for initial implementation has the following qualities:

550       •   Facilitates improvement of high priority security control implementation as selected
551           using a risk-based approach
552       •   Uses data from existing sources and data repositories
553       •   Measures existing and established processes
554               o Inconsistent processes will not provide meaningful data about information
555                   security performance, but measurements may still be used to establish a baseline
556                   for continuous monitoring purposes

557   At this point in the process, a weighing scale may be used to assign values to each measure.
558   Organizations should use a weighing scale that fits their needs while ensuring consistency across
559   the process. The process of developing a weighing scale may utilize the following techniques:
560       •   Event Probability
561              o Setting baselines
562              o Leverage in-house knowledge and data about existing systems.
563              o Organizational assessments, audits, interviews, surveys, and studies are all
564                  options.
565              o Convert qualitative metrics to quantitative metrics.
566              o Examine external data and knowledge.
567              o Use raw data to augment existing measurements or to achieve targeted
568                  knowledge/metrics.
569       •   Event Probability Models
570              o Decomposition theorems for probability density
571              o Bayesian methods for probability analysis
572              o Binomial distribution, Poisson distribution and Monte Carlo for performance
573                  metrics and propagating uncertainty

577       •   Consequences
578              o Establish a consequence model by looking at potential events and their outcomes.
579              o Outliers and unexampled events may come up over time. An organization can
580                 prepare for these issues using horizon scanning, stress tests, and system resilience.
581       •   Consequence Modeling
582              o Expected shortfall
583              o Value at risk – statistical analysis of historical market trends
584              o If a consequence model has already been determined as part of a risk management
585                 strategy, the organization should leverage that research.

591                out of this review cycle.

592   Performance targets establish a benchmark by which success is measured. Implementation
593   measures targets are set for 100 percent completion of assigned tasks. However,
594   effectiveness/efficiency and impact measures will require qualitative and subjective reasoning to
595   determine appropriate and acceptable performance levels. Performance targets and risk tolerance
596   should be determined by upper-level management or even at the board level. These targets and
597   benchmarks require periodic reexamination to ensure appropriate target levels.

708                measures and determining the information security program’s
709                effectiveness.

710   Measures data is considered fully automated when all data is gathered by automated data sources
711   without human involvement or intervention. Automation can facilitate continuous monitoring
712   processes of both:

713       o Measurement data collection
714       o Measurement data reporting

715   Detailed information on building a continuous monitoring program can be found in [SP800-
716   137A].

717   Data may also need to be collected manually in instances where automation of data collection is
718   not a practical option.

719       o Explores semi-automated and non-automated processes that need humans to facilitate
720         collection or reporting.
721       o Manual data collection and reporting may also include developing questionnaires,
722         conducting interviews, and administering surveys with the organization’s staff.

728   Summary: Phase 3 consists of developing a plan to serve as the roadmap for closing the
729   implementation gaps identified in Phase 2. This may include:

730       o Determining the range of corrective actions
731       o Prioritizing actions based on overall risk mitigation goals
732       o Selecting the most appropriate corrective actions

733   Any additional input on this section is welcome.

734           Develop a Business Case and Obtain Resources

735                This section only has minor updates from [6.4 Development Business
736                Case and Obtain Resources] in the current [SP800-55] and is
737                intentionally left out of this review cycle.

738   Summary: Phase 4 and 5 addresses the budgeting cycle for acquiring resources needed to
739   implement the corrective actions identified in Phase 3. A business case analysis should feature
740   the results from the previous phases of the information security measurement process. The level
741   of effort for building a business case should correspond with the size and scope of the funding
742   requests. When drafting the business case, it is vital to remember only the organization can
743   establish appetite and tolerance for risk.

744   Any additional input on this section is welcome.

745           Apply Corrective Actions

746                This section only has minor updates from [6.5 Apply Corrective Actions]
747                in the current [SP800-55] and is intentionally left out of this review
748                cycle.

749   Summary: Phase 6 involves implementing corrective actions in the information security program
750   or the technical, managerial, or operational areas of security controls. From here the cycle goes
751   back to Phase 2, where data is collected and analyzed. This iterative process allows for the
752   monitoring of progress in the measurement program and ensures corrective actions are
753   influencing information security control implementation in an intended way. Frequent
754   performance measurement will flag actions that are not implemented as planned or not having
755   the desired effects. This enables quick course correction with an organization to avoid problems
756   that could be uncovered in audits, C&A efforts, or to related activities.
