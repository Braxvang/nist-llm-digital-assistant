      Risk Management Framework for
Information Systems and Organizations
                   A System Life Cycle Approach for Security and Privacy




This publication contains comprehensive updates to the                              JOINT TASK FORCE
Risk Management Framework. The updates include an
alignment with the constructs in the NIST Cybersecurity
Framework; the integration of privacy risk management
processes; an alignment with system life cycle security
engineering processes; and the incorporation of supply
chain risk management processes. Organizations can
use the frameworks and processes in a complementary
manner within the RMF to effectively manage security
and privacy risks to organizational operations and
assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.    This publication is available free of charge from:
Revision 2 includes a set of organization-wide RMF tasks           https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-37r2
that are designed to prepare information system owners
to conduct system-level risk management activities. The
intent is to increase the effectiveness, efficiency, and
cost-effectiveness of the RMF by establishing a closer
connection to the organization’s missions and business
functions and improving the communications among
senior leaders, managers, and operational personnel.

                                                                                              to be mitigated prior to authorization. Decisions on the most appropriate course of action for responding
                                                                                              to risk may include some form of prioritization. Some risks may be of greater concern to organizations
                                                                                              than other risks. In that case, more resources may need to be directed at addressing higher-priority risks
                                                                                              versus lower-priority risks. Prioritizing risk response does not necessarily mean that the lower-priority
                                                                                              risks are ignored. Rather, it could mean that fewer resources are directed at addressing the lower-priority
                                                                                              risks, or that the lower-priority risks are addressed later. A key part of the risk-based decision process is
                                                                                              the recognition that regardless of the risk response, there remains a degree of residual risk. Organizations
