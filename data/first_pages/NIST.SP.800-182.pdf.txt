      The Computer Security Division (CSD), a division of the Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute
of Standards and Technology (NIST) is responsible for developing cybersecurity standards, guidelines, tests, and metrics for the
protection of non-national security federal information systems. CSD’s standards, guidelines, tools and references are developed
in an open, transparent, traceable and collaborative manner that enlists broad expertise from around the world. While developed
for federal agency use, these resources are voluntarily adopted by other organizations because they are effective and accepted
globally.
    The need for cybersecurity standards, best practices, tools and references that also address interoperability, usability
and privacy continue to be critical for the Nation. CSD aligns its resources to enable greater development and application of

                                                                                    STE    to M S | current
                                                                                              address C P S and future computer
and information security challenges. Our foundational research and applied cybersecurity programs continue to advance in
many areas, including cryptography, automation, roots of trust, identity and access management, advanced security testing and
measurement, Internet of Things (IoT), cyber-physical systems, and public safety networks.
    Trust is crucial to the broad adoption of our standards and guidelines, including our cryptographic standards and guidelines.
To ensure that our cryptography resources have been developed according the highest standard of inclusiveness, transparency
and security, NIST conducted an internal and external formal review of our cryptographic standards development efforts in
2014. We documented and solicited public comment on the principles and rigorous processes we use to engage stakeholders
and experts in industry, academia, and government to develop and revise these standards. The final report is now published and
serves as a basis for all CSD’s cryptographic development efforts.
     Increasing the trustworthiness and resilience of the IT infrastructure is a significant undertaking that requires a substantial
investment in the architectural design and development of our systems and networks. A disciplined and structured set of
systems security engineering processes that starts with and builds on well-established international standards provides an
important starting point. Draft Special Publication 800-160, Systems Security Engineering: An Integrated Approach to Building
Trustworthy Resilient Systems, which was issued in May 2014, helps organizations to develop a more defensible and survivable
information technology infrastructure. This resource, coupled with other NIST standards and guidelines, contributes to systems
that are more resilient in the face of cyber attacks and other threats.
    Strong partnerships with diverse stakeholders are vital to the success of our technical programs. In February 2014, NIST
issued the Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity as directed in Executive Order 13636. The Framework,
created through collaboration between industry and government, consists of standards, guidelines, and practices to promote
the protection of the critical infrastructure. Its approach helps owners and operators of the critical infrastructure to manage
cybersecurity-related risk.
    Active engagement with diverse stakeholders continues to be critical to our success. In the federal space, this interaction
is most prominent in our strengthened collaborations with the Department of Defense, the Intelligence Community, and
the Committee on National Security Systems to establish a common foundation for information security across the Federal
Government. Our cybersecurity awareness, training, and education programs also exemplify the importance of engagements
with academic institutions, federal agencies, small and medium businesses and others to increase awareness and enhance the
overall cybersecurity posture of the Nation. CSD’s work with Health and Human Services, Department of Transportation, Federal
Communications Commission and others are all examples of an active and strong engagement, applying security to multiple
government mission areas.
    For many years, CSD, in collaboration with our global partners across industry, academia, standards bodies, and
government, has made great contributions to help secure the nation’s critical information and infrastructure. We look forward to
strengthening these relationships as we lead the development and practical application of scalable and sustainable information
security standards and practices.

GROUP (STVMG)

MISSION STATEMENT:
Advance information security testing, measurement
science, and conformance.

OVERVIEW:
     Federal agencies, industry, and the public rely on
cryptography for the protection of the information and
communications used in electronic commerce, the critical
infrastructure, and other application areas. The STVMG
supports the testing and validation of the underlying
cryptographic modules and cryptographic algorithms
based upon established standards. These cryptographic
modules and algorithms enable products and systems to
provide security services, such as confidentiality, integrity
protection, and authentication. Although cryptography
provides security, poor designs or weak algorithms can
render a product insecure and place highly sensitive
information at risk. When protecting sensitive data, federal
agencies require assurance that cryptographic products
meet established security requirements and use only tested
and validated cryptographic modules.
     STVMG’s testing-focused activities include validating
cryptographic algorithm implementations, cryptographic
modules, and Security Content Automation Protocol
(SCAP)-enabled products; developing test suites and test
methods; providing implementation guidance and technical
support to industry forums; and conducting education,
training, and outreach programs.
    STVMG’s validation programs work together with
independent cryptographic and security testing laboratories
accredited by the NIST National Voluntary Laboratory
Accreditation Program (NVLAP). Based on the independent
laboratory test report and test evidence, the Validation
Program validates an implementation under test. NIST
publishes lists of awarded validations through public
websites.

    Small business owners face a broad range of informa-
tion security issues. A computer failure or system breach
could jeopardize the company’s reputation and may result
in significant damage and recovery cost, or going out
of business. The small business owner who recognizes
the threat of computer crime and takes steps to deter
inappropriate activities is less likely to become a victim.
     The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) reports
that over 27 million U.S. companies - more than 99 percent of
all U.S. businesses - are SMBs of 500 employees or fewer (see
http://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/allprofiles12.pdf).
While the threats to individual SMBs may not be significantly
different from those facing larger organizations, an SMB
frequently has fewer resources available to protect systems,
detect attacks, or respond to security issues. A vulnerability
common to a large percentage of SMBs could pose a threat
to the nation’s information infrastructure and economic
base.
     To help address information security risk, these busi-
nesses require assistance with the identification of security
mechanisms and with practical, cost-effective training.
Training helps SMB’s use their limited resources most
effectively to address relevant and serious threats. In
response to this need, NIST, the SBA, and the Federal Bureau
of Investigation (FBI) InfraGard program co-sponsor a series
of cybersecurity training workshops for small businesses.
These workshops provide an overview of cybersecurity

    Over the past 30 years, NIST has been at the forefront
of recommending best practices for authentication.
Recommendations have included the usage of passwords in
enterprises, biometrics, and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
solutions. In FY 2015, CSD researched the classification of
general authentication features. This investigation was
prompted by the general call to move away from passwords
towards the growing number of alternative authentication
methods (e.g. biometrics, smart cards, etc.). In the early part
of this investigation, it became clear that an ontology of
authentication was needed.
    A draft taxonomy (see Figure 19) was developed
to better describe current and emerging authentication
mechanisms. This taxonomy covers a wide assortment                     Figure 20: Suitability Framework for Authentication

            The group is recognized for its exceptional leadership and outstanding technical achievement in
            developing an innovative framework to improve the cybersecurity of our nation’s critical infrastructure.
            In Executive Order 13636, the President directed NIST to create a Cybersecurity Framework to manage
            and reduce cybersecurity risk across the nation’s critical infrastructure sectors. The team convened a
            highly diverse community to achieve consensus on a framework of standards, guidelines, and practices
            to identify, assess, and manage cybersecurity risk.

      The group is recognized for outstanding technical accomplishments in the development of the first
      efficient tool for generating high-strength software testing plans, resulting in cost savings and more
      reliable products. The team has developed software tools that use a novel combinatorial testing meth-
      odology. This methodology enables software developers to generate the smallest number of test cases
      needed to identify the most critical and elusive software bugs, those caused by interactions among input
      parameters. The team has made their tool, Automated Combinatorial Testing of Software (ACTS), widely
      available, and it is now used by major software companies and many government agencies.

    Conformance testing is the method that is used to
    determine if a product, process or system (known
    as an implementation under test) satisfies the
    requirements specified in the base standard. The goal
    of conformance testing is to capture enough of the
    requirements of the base standard and test them
