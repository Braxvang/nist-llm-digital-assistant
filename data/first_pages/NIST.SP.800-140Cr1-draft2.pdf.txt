57   Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) of 2014, 44 U.S.C. § 3551 et seq., Public Law
58   (P.L.) 113-283. NIST is responsible for developing information security standards and guidelines, including
59   minimum requirements for federal information systems, but such standards and guidelines shall not apply
60   to national security systems without the express approval of appropriate federal officials exercising policy
61   authority over such systems. This guideline is consistent with the requirements of the Office of Management
62   and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130.

63   Nothing in this publication should be taken to contradict the standards and guidelines made mandatory and
64   binding on federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory authority. Nor should these
65   guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the Secretary of Commerce,
66   Director of the OMB, or any other federal official. This publication may be used by nongovernmental
67   organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright in the United States. Attribution would,

 93                          Reports on Computer Systems Technology

 94   The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and
 95   Technology (NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical
 96   leadership for the Nation’s measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops tests, test
 97   methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance
 98   the development and productive use of information technology. ITL’s responsibilities include the
 99   development of management, administrative, technical, and physical standards and guidelines for
100   the cost-effective security and privacy of other than national security-related information in
101   federal information systems. The Special Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research,
102   guidelines, and outreach efforts in information system security, and its collaborative activities
103   with industry, government, and academic organizations.

104                                               Abstract

105   The approved security functions listed in this publication replace the ones listed in ISO/IEC
106   19790 Annex C and ISO/IEC 24759 6.15, within the context of the Cryptographic Module
107   Validation Program (CMVP). As a validation authority, the CMVP may supersede Annex C in
108   its entirety.

109                                              Keywords

110   Cryptographic Module Validation Program; CMVP; FIPS 140 testing; FIPS 140; ISO/IEC
111   19790; ISO/IEC 24759; testing requirement; vendor evidence; vendor documentation; security
112   policy.

113                                               Audience

114   This document is intended for use by vendors, testing labs, and the CMVP to address issues that
115   arise in cryptographic module testing.

116                                       Supplemental Content

117   Special Publication 800-140C, available at https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-
118   140c/final, is the governing document until this revision is published as final. The updated final
119   may have minor changes, depending on comments received.

120                                           Note to Readers

121   Two changes were made to this document from the first draft of Revision 1 – both editorial. The
122   first was to section 6.2 (Approved security functions) where the security function subsections
123   were renamed, modified, and recategorized. The second was to include the following two
124   standards from SP 800-140D: SP 800-90A, SP 800-90B.

179   5.1     General

180   Section 6 of this document replaces the approved security functions of ISO/IEC 19790 Annex C
181   and ISO/IEC 24759 paragraph 6.15.

182   5.2     Modifications

183   Modifications will follow a similar format to that used in ISO/IEC 24759. For additions to test
184   requirements, new Test Evidence (TEs) or Vendor Evidence (VEs) will be listed by increasing
185   the “sequence_number.” Modifications can include a combination of additions using underline
186   and deletions using strikethrough. If no changes are required, the paragraph will indicate “No
187   change.”

188   6       CMVP-approved security function requirements

189   6.1     Purpose

190   This document identifies CMVP-approved security functions. It supersedes security functions
191   identified in ISO/IEC 19790 and ISO/IEC 24759.

192   6.2     Approved security functions

193   The categories include transitions, symmetric key encryption and decryption, digital signatures,
194   hashing and message authentication.
