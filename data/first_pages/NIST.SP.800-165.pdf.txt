                                               Welcome Letter

 With the continued proliferation of information, the explosion of devices connecting to the expanding
communication infrastructure and the evolving threat environment, the need for cybersecurity standards and
best practices that address interoperability, usability and privacy continues to be critical for the Nation. The
Computer Security Division (CSD), a component of the Information Technology Laboratory at the National Institute
of Standards and Technology (NIST) is responsible for developing standards, guidelines, tests, and metrics for the
protection of non-national security federal information and communication infrastructure. These standards,
guidelines, tests, and metrics are also important resources for the private sector.

 In 2012, CSD aligned its resources to enable greater development and application of practical, innovative
security technologies and methodologies, and to enhance our ability to address current and future computer and
information security challenges in support of critical national and international priorities.

 CSD extended its research and development agenda for high-quality, cost-effective security and privacy
mechanisms to foster improved information security across the federal government and the global information
security community. In 2012, NIST concluded the five-year SHA-3 Cryptographic Hash Algorithm Competition with
the selection of KECCAK for standardization and worldwide adoption. The selection of this cryptographic hash
algorithm, an indispensable component for the information and communication systems that support commerce
in the modern era, confirmed NIST’s well-respected and trusted technical authority in this field.

 A strong partnership with industry is vital to the success of our technical programs. In 2012, CSD engaged
the international standards community on emerging technical standards to advance continuous monitoring
capabilities and to further interoperability with commercially available tools. We also devised new security
testing methodologies for smart phone software app functionality. Our research in hardware-enabled security
continued with the development of guidelines on mechanisms that measure and report the security state of BIOS.
Our research also continued to expand into the cybersecurity aspects of cyber-physical and embedded systems,
and the mechanisms for enabling and protecting public safety communications.

 Our ability to interact with the broad federal community continues to be critical to our success. This interaction
helps to ensure that our research is consistent with national objectives related to or impacted by information
security. This interaction is most prominent in our strengthened collaborations with the Department of Defense,
the Intelligence Community, and the Committee on National Security Systems to establish a common foundation
for information security across the federal government. The release of Special Publication 800-30, Guide for
Conducting Risk Assessments, developed by the Joint Task Force Transformation Initiative Interagency Working
Group, is not only leading to more consistent ways to assess risks, but is also enabling more effective risk
management and facilitating greater sharing of information across organizational boundaries.

 For many years, the Computer Security Division (CSD), in collaboration with our global partners from government,
industry, and academia, has made great contributions to help secure the nation’s critical information and
infrastructure. We look forward to furthering these relationships in 2013 as we lead in
examining the diverse cybersecurity aspects of a broad set of areas, including supply
chain risk management; security analytics; cloud, mobile, and privacy-enhancing
technologies; hardware-enabled security; and cyber-physical and embedded systems.

     Overview:
                                                                (301) 975-8077
     Federal agencies, industry, and the public rely on
    cryptography for the protection of information and
    communications used in electronic commerce, critical
    infrastructure, and other application areas. At the
    core of all products offering cryptographic services
    is the cryptographic module. Cryptographic modules,
    which contain cryptographic algorithms, are used in
    products and systems to provide security services
    such as confidentiality, integrity, and authentication.
    Although cryptography is used to provide security,
    weaknesses such as poor design or weak algorithms can
    render a product insecure and place highly sensitive
    information at risk. When protecting their sensitive
    data, federal government agencies require a minimum
    level of assurance that cryptographic products meet
    their security requirements. Also, federal agencies are
    required to use only tested and validated cryptographic
    modules. Adequate testing and validation of the
    cryptographic module and its underlying cryptographic
    algorithms against established standards is essential to
    provide security assurance.

     The group’s testing-focused activities include
    validating cryptographic algorithm implementations,
    cryptographic modules, and Security Content
    Automation Protocol (SCAP)-compliant products;
    developing test suites and test methods; providing
    implementation guidance and technical support to
    industry forums; and conducting education, training,
    and outreach programs.

     All of the Security Testing, Validation, and
    Measurement Group’s validation programs work
    together with independent Cryptographic and Security
    Testing laboratories that are accredited by the NIST
    National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program
    (NVLAP). Based on the independent laboratory test

 Î Universal Credential Revocation
 Through NIST’s identity-related project and hosting
the IDTrust Symposium, credential revocation has
emerged as one of the key gaps in progressing secure
authentication online. In federated environments,
credential revocation has traditionally been managed
by the credential issuer. In an effort to improve
credential revocation mechanisms across federations
and effectively mitigate credential misuse, NIST
researchers are exploring the broader scope of
credential revocation, where all parties contribute
to and participate in credential revocation. In this
model, service providers give feedback on a credential
reliability score based on detected credential misuse.
The credential holder and Identity Provider, on the
other hand, receive feedback notifications and are
able to immediately suspend or revoke the credential
should the score reach an unacceptable level. Lastly,
other federation services can consult scores and status
to determine the suitability of a presented credential
with an associated reliability score.

 In FY2012, NIST scientists published an initial
draft NISTIR 7817 titled A Credential Reliability
and Revocation Model that describes and classifies
the different types of identity providers serving
federations. For each classification, the document
identifies perceived improvements or gaps when the
credentials are used in authentication services and
recommends countermeasures to eliminate some of
the identified gaps. With the countermeasures as the
basis, the document suggests a Universal Credential
Reliability and Revocation Services (URRS) model
that strives to improve authentication services for
federations where all parties contribute to and
participate in credential revocation and where the
service can be tailored to the type of (classification
of) identity providers it accommodates.

  After the public comment period, NISTIR 7817 was
further revised to accommodate the comments and
final approval is anticipated in FY2013.
