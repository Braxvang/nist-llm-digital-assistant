                                           Executive Summary

Organizations frequently must evaluate and select a variety of information technology (IT) security
services in order to maintain and improve their overall IT security program and enterprise architecture.
IT security services, which range from security policy development to intrusion detection support, may be
offered by an IT group internal to an organization, or by a growing group of vendors. Organizations can
benefit when choices among services and service providers stimulate competition and bring innovation to
the marketplace. However, it is difficult and challenging to determine service provider capabilities,
measure service reliability and navigate the many complexities involved in security service agreements.
Individuals who are responsible for selecting, implementing, and managing IT security services for an
organization must carefully evaluate their options before selecting resources that will be entrusted to meet
their particular IT security program requirements.

The factors to be considered when selecting, implementing, and managing IT security services include:
the type of service arrangement; service provider qualifications, operational requirements and capabilities,
experience, and viability; trustworthiness of service provider employees; and the service provider’s
capability to deliver adequate protection for the organization systems, applications, and information.
These considerations will apply (to varying degrees) to every service depending on the size, type,
complexity, cost, and criticality of the services being considered and the specific needs of the
organization implementing or contracting for the services.

The Guide to Information Technology Security Services, Special Publication 800-35, provides assistance
with the selection, implementation, and management of IT security services by guiding organizations
through the various phases of the IT security services life cycle. This life cycle provides a framework that
enables the IT security decision makers to organize their IT security efforts—from initiation to closeout.
The systematic management of the IT security services process is critically important. Failure to consider
the many issues involved and to manage the organizational risks can seriously impact the organization.
IT security decision makers must think about the costs involved and the underlying security requirements,
as well as the potential impact of their decisions on the organizational mission, operations, strategic
functions, personnel, and service provider arrangements.

The six phases of the IT security life cycle are:

 Phase 1: Initiation—the organization determines if it should investigate whether implementing an
  IT security service might improve the effectiveness of the organization’s IT security program.
 Phase 2: Assessment—the organization determines the security posture of the current environment
  using metrics and identifies the requirements and viable solutions.
 Phase 3: Solution—decision makers evaluate potential solutions, develop the business case and
  specify the attributes of an acceptable service arrangement solution from the set of available options.
 Phase 4: Implementation—the organization selects and engages the service provider, develops a
  service arrangement, and implements the solution.
 Phase 5: Operations—the organization ensures operational success by consistently monitoring
  service provider and organizational security performance against identified requirements, periodically
  evaluating changes in risks and threats to the organization and ensuring the organizational security
  solution is adjusted as necessary to maintain an acceptable security posture.
 Phase 6: Closeout—the organization ensures a smooth transition as the service ends or is
  discontinued.

This guide describes a life cycle that provides a context to assist organizations with managing the myriad
issues surrounding IT security services. However, the guide does not prescribe or recommend any specific
IT security service, IT security service arrangement, IT security service agreement, or IT security service
provider. Each organization must perform its own analysis of its needs and assess, select, implement, and
oversee the IT security service to best address its needs.

The Guide should be used in conjunction with other NIST Special Publications (SP) that focus on
procurement of IT systems, including NIST SP 800-64, Security Considerations in the Information
System Development Life Cycle, and NIST SP 800-36: Guide to Selecting Information Technology
Security Products. NIST SP 800-55, Security Metrics Guide for Information Technology Systems will
help organizations understand the importance of using metrics and developing a metrics program.

Other NIST special publications may be helpful in providing information on specific services and
technologies. These include:


 SP 800-30: Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems
 SP 800-32: Introduction to Public Key Technology and the Federal PKI Infrastructure
 SP 800-33: Underlying Technical Models for Information Technology Security
 SP 800-34: Contingency Planning for Information Technology Systems
 SP 800-41: An Introduction to Firewalls and Firewall Policy
 SP 800-42: Guideline on Network Security Testing
 SP 800-48: Wireless Network Security: 802.11, Bluetooth, and Handheld Devices
 SP 800-50: Building an Information Technology Security Awareness and Training Program
 SP 800-53: Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems


NIST recommends that organizations planning to acquire IT security services should:

 Develop careful, objective business cases. The need for an IT security service should be supported by
  the business needs of the organization. A business case containing an analysis of the proposed
  solution, cost estimate, benefits analysis, project risk analysis, and an evaluation of other considered
  alternatives should provide sufficient documentation to describe and support these needs.
 Develop strong, specific service agreements that define the expectations of performance for each
  required security control, describe measurable outcomes, and identify remedies and response
  requirements for any identified instances of non-compliance.
 Use metrics throughout the IT security life cycle. Metrics will provide the objective data to evaluate
  the baseline level of service in the assessment phase and assess service provider performance in the
  operations phase. Wherever possible, metrics should be selected to indicate progress toward the
  achievement or maintenance of a security condition that meets an underlying organizational need.
 Develop processes and procedures that can effectively track the myriad service agreements and the
  metrics that will be applied throughout the lifecycle of the many different and disparate IT security
  services within an organization

 Ensure that an appropriate transition (bedding in) period is in place between an existing service
  provider or capability and the new service provider
 Maintain the technical expertise necessary to understand and manage the security service being
  provided and to protect the data critical to an organization’s mission
 Pay careful attention to six issue areas: strategy/mission, budget/funding, technology/architecture,
  organization, personnel, and policy/process.

1.    Introduction

1.1   Authority

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed this document in furtherance of its
statutory responsibilities under the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002,
Public Law 107-347.

NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements, for
providing adequate information security for all agency operations and assets, but such standards and
guidelines shall not apply to national security systems. This guideline is consistent with the requirements
of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Section 8b(3), Securing Agency
Information Systems, as analyzed in A-130, Appendix IV: Analysis of Key Sections. Supplemental
information is provided A-130, Appendix III.

This guideline has been prepared for use by federal agencies. It may be used by nongovernmental
organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright though attribution is desired.

Nothing in this document should be taken to contradict standards and guidelines made mandatory and
binding on federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory authority. Nor should these
guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the Secretary of Commerce,
Director of the OMB, or any other federal official.

1.2   Purpose

Organizations frequently must evaluate, select, and employ a variety of IT security services in order to
maintain and improve their overall IT security programs. IT security services (e.g., security policy
development, intrusion detection support, etc.) may be offered by an IT group internal to an organization,
or by a growing group of vendors. Individuals who are responsible for selecting, implementing, and
managing IT security services for an organization must carefully review the necessary processes and
procedures, weigh a host of available options, and select resources that can be entrusted to optimally meet
IT security program requirements.

Factors to be considered when selecting, implementing, and managing IT security services include: the
type of service arrangement; service provider qualifications, requirements, experience, and viability;
trustworthiness of service provider employees; and protection for organization systems, applications, and
data. These considerations may apply (in varying degrees) depending on the size, type, complexity, cost,
and criticality of the services being considered.

The purpose of this guide is to provide assistance with selecting, implementing, and managing IT security
services by guiding the organization through the various phases of the IT security services life cycle. The
IT security services life cycle provides a framework that enables the IT security decision makers to
organize their IT security efforts—from initiation to closeout. The systematic management of the IT
security services process is critically important. Failure to consider and manage the many complex issues
involved can seriously impact the organization. IT security decision makers must think about the costs
and security requirements, as well as organizational mission and strategic functions, personnel and service
provider arrangements.

This guide discusses each phase of the IT security services life cycle to provide a starting point for
evaluating and selecting sound security practices. The discussion is directed toward a wide variety of
organizations with diverse IT security requirements. The guide discusses general topics such as the


                                                    1-1
                                                                                  NIST Special Publication 800-35



importance of developing agreements that define the service levels for the service providers; however,
this guide does not prescribe the service or service level that best fits the organization’s needs. The
specific needs of each organization should always be considered when applying the processes and
concepts that are presented in this guide. Finally, in this publication, NIST provides information and
advice for decision makers and other relevant parties on the security and policy issues for obtaining IT
security services.

1.3   Limitations

Section 5 of this document discusses a sampling of possible IT security services but does not represent an
exhaustive list. In addition to clearly identified IT security services, organizations may also wish to
acquire a service, which contains a significant security component such as systems administration. These
types of services are not addressed in this guide; however, the information that is included in this guide
can be extended and adapted to cover other related services.

This guide does not advocate a position for or against the development of external arrangements (such as
outsourcing) for IT security services. The reader should refer to OMB Circular A-76, Performance of
Commercial Activities, to establish the foundation for the decision whether activities should be performed
under contract with a commercial activity or performed in-house using Government facilities and
personnel.

1.4   Intended Audience

This guide is meant for organizations that provide IT security services regardless of whether the service is
provided from within the organization or procured from an outside provider. The goal is to help IT
security decision makers and managers implement and manage the most appropriate IT security services,
service levels, and service arrangements to best meet the organization’s mission and needs.

1.5   Document Organization

The remainder of this document is organized as follows:

Chapter 2 discusses the roles and responsibilities of the various people involved with the selecting,
implementing, and managing of the IT security services life cycle.

Chapter 3 provides an introduction to IT security services, including an overview of the security services
life cycle and of selected IT security services. This chapter discusses the framework of a security services
life cycle, an overview of issues to address throughout the life cycle, an overview of the various service
arrangements that IT security decision makers could consider, and a look at tools that will be useful to the
IT security decision maker in the security services life cycle.

Chapter 4 provides a more in-depth discussion of the issues related to obtaining IT security services. In
the context of the security services life cycle, this chapter discusses how the security service begins, what
is captured in assessing the current environment and the needs for any new service, what a service
agreement should include, and how a service agreement should end or be discontinued.

Chapter 5 provides a more detailed look at a few specific IT security services, serving as an example of
the application of the previous information.

In addition to these chapters, three appendixes are attached:




                                                     1-2

2.    Roles and Responsibilities

The list of participants for selecting, implementing, and managing a given service will depend on the type
and scope of the service, the service arrangement, and type/size of organization. A large federal agency
that is seeking to partner with an external organization for many of its IT security functions will have
different requirements and therefore a more extensive list of participants than a small business seeking a
limited-scope IT security training program for its employees. The following roles are generic to many
different services. The actual list of participants may be less than or greater than the list provided below.
For instance, if an internal group within an organization provides the security service, the contracting
officer and Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) may not have a role.

2.1   Chief Information Officer

The CIO is responsible for the organization’s IT planning, budgeting, investment, performance and
acquisition. As such, the CIO oversees senior organization personnel in obtaining efficient and effective
IT security services.

2.2   Contracting Officer

The Contracting Officer has the authority to enter into, administer, and/or terminate contracts and make
related determinations and findings.

2.3   Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative

The Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) is a qualified employee appointed by the
Contracting Officer to act as its technical representative in managing the technical aspects of a particular
contract.

2.4   IT Investment Board (or equivalent)

The IT Investment Board, or its equivalent, is responsible for managing the capital planning and
investment control process defined by the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 (Section 5).

2.5   IT Security Program Manager

The IT Security Program Manager is responsible for developing or applying enterprise standards for IT
security. This individual plays a leading role in introducing an appropriate, structured methodology to
help identify, evaluate, and minimize IT security risks to the organization. IT security program managers
coordinate and perform system risk analyses, analyze risk mitigation alternatives, and build the business
case for the acquisition of appropriate security solutions that help ensure mission accomplishment in the
face of real-world threats. They also support senior management in ensuring that security management
activities are conducted as required to meet the organization’s needs.

2.6   IT System Security Officer

The IT System Security Officer is responsible for ensuring the security of an information system
throughout its life cycle.

2.7   Program Manager (Owner Of Data)/Acquisition Initiator

This Program Manager represents programmatic interests during the IT security services life cycle.
Program Managers play an essential role in security because they have been involved in strategic
planning initiatives of the IT security service and are intimately aware of functional service requirements.

2.8   Privacy Officer

The Privacy Officer ensures that the service and service arrangement meet existing privacy policies
regarding protection, dissemination (information sharing and exchange) and information disclosure.

2.9   Other Participants

The list of roles in a service acquisition can grow with the complexity involved in acquiring and
managing IT systems. It is vital that all members of the acquisition team work together to ensure that a
successful acquisition is achieved. Since the system certifier and accreditor will be making critical
decisions near the end of the procurement process, it is helpful to include them earlier in the acquisition
so that critical issues can be addressed early. System users may assist in the acquisition by helping the
program manager to determine the need, refine the requirements, and inspect and accept the delivered
system. Participants may also include personnel who represent information technology, configuration
management, design/engineering, and facilities groups.

3.      IT Security Services

This chapter provides an overview of IT security services, service arrangements, service issues, and
service management tools. These overviews serve as an introduction to the IT security services life cycle
discussed in Chapter 4. This life cycle is independent of an organization’s decision to use internal
resources or an external service provider to perform the service. Ultimately, the organization remains
responsible for and affected by any security breach regardless of who performs the security service.

3.1     Overview of IT Security Services

Security services fall into one of three categories (Table 3-1).


                                      Table 3-1. IT Security Categories

     Management Services     Techniques and concerns normally addressed by management in the
                             organization’s computer security program. They focus on managing the computer
                             security program and the risk within the organization.
     Operational Services    Services focused on controls implemented and executed by people (as opposed to
                             systems). They often require technical or specialized expertise and rely on
                             management activities and technical controls.
     Technical Services      Technical services focused on security controls a computer system executes.
                             These services are dependent on the proper function of the system for
                             effectiveness.


The security services life cycle applies to any security service regardless of the category into which it falls
and could even apply to an entire IT security category. As managers determine which IT security services
need to be implemented, assessed, or discontinued, they should consider the impact on other IT security
services.

Chapter 5 discusses in greater detail the types of IT security services. NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-

A broad range of possible service arrangements exists. An organization may select its internal employees
and teams to provide the service required, or it may choose to fully export the service to an external
service provider. This external service provider could be any organization because this term does not
intend to refer to only an external commercial service provider. For example, an organization may choose
to employ an external group from a subsidiary organization, a business unit, or a commercial service
provider.

3.3   Overview Of IT Security Services Management Tools

Because of the potential harm that can result from poor security, IT security managers and decision
makers need to use effective management tools to increase the likelihood of success. Two important tools
are metrics and service agreements.

Overview of Metrics

Metrics are a management tool that facilitates decision-making and accountability through practical and
relevant data collection, data analysis, and performance data reporting. The importance of a metrics
program is discussed in NIST SP 800-55, Security Metrics Guide for Information Technology Systems. A
full and complete discussion of computer security metrics is beyond the scope of this document; however,
IT security service managers should understand what metrics are and when they should be used.

For example, a metric for a management service, such as a training and awareness program, might be the
percentage of new employees who receive IT security training within their first 30 days on the job.
Gathering this data repeatedly, over time, will allow managers to assess how well the current training
service provider performs its task today, to set targets for the service provider in the future, and then to
assess how well it met the desired target. The metrics process is discussed in the next chapter.

Overview of Service Agreements

A service agreement serves as the agreement between the service provider and the organization requesting
the service. As service arrangements become more complex and employ commercial service providers,
the formality of the agreement should increase. A fully externalized service arrangement with a
commercial entity, for example, will require a formal contract so that managers can hold service providers
accountable for their actions. A fully internal service arrangement may require a less formal agreement,
perhaps an agreed-on reporting process or an MOA. Regardless of the arrangement, all parties should be
aware of their roles and responsibilities. Section 4.4.1 discusses the importance of service agreements.

3.4   Overview of IT Security Services Issues

Implementing a security service and service arrangement can be complex. Each security service has its
own costs and risks associated with it, as does each service arrangement. Making a decision based on one
issue can have major implications for the organization in other areas. The decision makers will have to
balance near-term cost/value with potential long-term risks associated with new vulnerabilities, attrition,
potential loss of employee productivity/morale and internal functional skills, and other impacts. The
degree of completeness of the list of factors and issues considered will vary by organization; however, the
factors and issues can be grouped into six categories as identified in Table 3-2.

                                Table 3-2: IT Security Service Issue Categories

      Strategic/ Mission   When thinking about the implications of any decision, decision makers must ask
                           themselves what is best for the organization from a strategic point of view and what
                           best helps the organization meet its mission. Applied appropriately, security services
                           should result in enhanced mission effectiveness, not reduced mission capability.


      Budgetary/           When considering cost, the focus should be on value and full life-cycle costs. (see
      Funding              Section 4.2.1.2)


      Technical/           IT services, even if a management service, has technical implications. Throughout the
      Architectural        life cycle, IT security managers must consider impacts to technical issues and the
                           organization’s enterprise architecture.


      Organizational       These issues are related to the intangible elements of an organization, such as damage
                           to an organizations image and reputation, change in focus on core competencies, and
                           resiliency of the organization. In many cases, long accepted internal controls and
                           business practices that have developed over time due to natural business unit divisions
                           or regulatory requirements may have to be reconsidered when an IT security service
                           provider is engaged.


      Personnel            These issues are related to the organization’s contractors and employees. Managers
                           must remain aware of the impact of their decision on their employees. Depending on
                           the service arrangement implemented, major ramifications could exist for current
                           employees; understanding these potential implications is an essential element of
                           making a good trade-off between internal and external services. Dealing with them
                           early will ensure the employees remain an important resource for the organization.


      Policy/Process       Effective security starts with strong policy, and implications to policies and process
                           must be considered to ensure that good decisions are being made and that appropriate
                           transitions and implementations occur.



These issues, tools, and arrangements will be discussed repeatedly in this guide because of their
importance to providing IT security services.

3.5    General Considerations for IT Security Services

Listed below are some general questions that decision makers should answer to identify the service
provider that best meets the organization’s needs. These questions have been grouped into the various
issue categories described in Section 3.4.

These questions are intended as a guide and each organization will need to decide which questions are
relevant to its specific needs. The questions are not an exhaustive list and organizations may need to
develop additional questions. In some instances, the organization and not the service provider may best
answer the question.

                                2.    How does “the service provider’s” security policies (e.g. contingency planning) differ from that of the
                                      organization? If the organization’s policy meets a higher standard, will “the service provider’s” have trouble
                                      meeting this higher standard? If lower, will “the service provider” abide by the stricter policies of the
                                      organization?
                                3.    How does “the service provider” address the comingling of its data with that of another organization? Are
                                      processes in place to ensure that an organization’s data is protected?

3.6   Organizational Conflict of Interest

An organizational conflict of interest (OCI) may exist when a party to an agreement has a past, present or
future interest related to the work performed (or to be performed), which may diminish its capacity to
provide impartial, technically sound, objective service or results in an unfair competitive advantage. Of
course, it is best to avoid organizational conflicts before they arise. The Federal Acquisition Regulation
(FAR) (subpart 9.5) describes two underlying principles why avoiding an OCI is important:

 Preventing the existence of conflicting roles that might bias a [service provider’s] judgment
 Preventing unfair competitive advantage
According to the FAR, an unfair competitive advantage exists where a [service provider] possesses
proprietary information that was obtained from a Government official without proper authorization or
source selection information that is relevant to the contract but is not available to all competitors, and
such information would assist that [service provider] in obtaining the contract.

Although the FAR applies to Federal contracts, any organization should be aware that an OCI could occur
in any phase of the IT security services lifecycle and may provide an unfair competitive advantage.

 There are several methods that an organization can take to avoid, neutralize, or minimize the effect of
  an OCI. They can include: modify or eliminate the offending parts of the agreement, statement of
  work, contract, etc.
 Prohibit bidding on a subsequent procurement in which the service provider plays a key role in
  development of the requirement
 Prohibit using proprietary or privileged information which the service provider has access to
 Segment the work within the service provider to prevent involvement in performance of the work or
  being in a position to influence the work
 Require the service provider to avoid conduct that may result in an OCI-such as when called on to
  inspect its own work. The service provider must disclose its relationship and disqualify itself from
  performing the work
 Make privileged documents available to all parties. (neutralizing the OCI)
If an organization determines that the OCI exists but cannot be avoided and the organization wishes to
proceed, the head of the organization may determine to proceed and waive the OCI.

Identifying the existence of OCIs, mitigating effect of the OCI to an acceptable level, and/or waiving the
OCI is important when managing the IT security service life cycle but it can involve complex legal and
regulatory issues and should not be considered without the close counsel of an organization’s legal
department.

4.    IT Security Services Life Cycle

The IT security services life cycle provides IT security decision makers and managers with a six-phase
process by which they can select, implement, and manage IT security services. This chapter details the
various life-cycle phases and the issues and decisions within each phase. As Figure 4-1 illustrates, the
security services life cycle has both a linear and iterative component. It proceeds linearly from initiation
to implementation to closeout, but the assessment, solution, and operations phases must continually occur
for an IT security service to succeed.




                                 Figure 4-1. IT Security Services Life Cycle

The six phases are described as follows:

 Phase 1: Initiation—the need to initiate the services life cycle is recognized. Section 4.1 discusses
  potential triggers for this phase.
 Phase 2: Assessment—before decision makers can implement a service and select a service
  provider, an accurate portrait of the current environment must be developed. Section 4.2 discusses
  Phase 2 and the importance of creating and gathering appropriate metrics.
 Phase 3: Solution—decision makers choose the appropriate solution from the viable options
  identified during the assessment phase. Section 4.3 discusses the business cases and implementation
  plans.
 Phase 4: Implementation—the service and service provider are implemented during the
  implementation phase. Section 4.4 guides decision makers through service agreement development
  and service implementation.

 Phase 5: Operations—the service is operational, the service provider is fully installed, and constant
  assessment of the service level and performance is made. Section 4.5 discusses the importance of
  metrics in monitoring service level and performance.
 Phase 6: Closeout—the environment changes, the need for the service diminishes, or performance
  deficiencies are noted necessitating a replacement or termination of the IT security service. Section
  4.6 discusses the closeout and retirement of a service and/or service provider using the exit strategies
  developed in Phase 3.
4.1   Phase 1: Initiation

Figure 4-2 illustrates Phase 1, Initiation, of the IT security services life cycle. This phase has a single
step: an event sufficient to warrant assessing the current environment and identifying viable service
solutions. The specific trigger that will meet this definition will vary by organization. The trigger will
fall into one of the six issue areas listed in Section 3.4: strategy/mission, budgetary/funding,
technical/architectural, organizational, personnel, and policy/process. Table 4-1 shows sample trigger
events from each issue area.




                                         Figure 4-2. Initiation Phase

Business, IT, and IT security managers initiate the service life cycle. The decision to obtain a security
service should be to obtain the most appropriate security services at the most appropriate level in the most

appropriate service arrangement so as to support the business function. The next phase of the life cycle,
Assessment, is where it is determined whether the most appropriate service is one performed internally or
externally.

As one IT security services life cycle is initiated, it is likely another life cycle will be ending. To ensure a
smooth transition, managers should be aware of possible interactions and effects between the service that
is ending and the one that is beginning.

4.2   Phase 2: Assessment

Phase 2, Assessment, shown in Figure 4-3, follows the Initiation Phase. The steps in this phase include
baselining the existing environment, analyzing opportunities and barriers, and identifying options and
risks. To establish a baseline understanding of the existing environment, the decision makers will need to
use metrics and the principle of total cost of ownership (TCO) to ensure the most accurate data will be
used for decision-making purposes. This data will also set performance targets and cost estimates for
service agreements in later phases.

                                       Figure 4-3. Assessment Phase

Bearing in mind the metrics and full cost of a service, the decision makers begin to consider opportunities
and barriers. The IT security service issues mentioned in Section 3.4 provide a framework for analyzing
opportunities and barriers, as well as external factors, such as the marketplace and the customers. Finally,
the existing environment and the opportunities and barriers will provide managers with options and risks.
From these options, managers will choose a solution in Phase 3.

4.2.1   Baseline Existing Environment

Once managers have initiated the IT security services life cycle, they must establish a baseline
understanding of the current environment. This baseline will demonstrate to managers how well the
current arrangement meets the security requirement and at what cost. Managers will need these two
measurements to compare the benefits of various service arrangements or the proposals of various service
providers.

The scope of this effort will depend on the nature of the security control or the specific mix of controls.
All related areas of the control or the mix of controls should be included; for example, if an organization
is evaluating its firewall services, it should evaluate its firewall policies and other policies, the
effectiveness of the firewall architecture, and other issues specific to the study.

Data for constructing the baselines should be collected in an objective, impartial, and comprehensive
manner. Stakeholders in the current environment will often be required to provide data or assist with


                                                    4-4

gathering data by which the service levels and sourcing solutions will be selected. As current
stakeholders, they have an interest in the status quo, and their data-gathering techniques or reporting
methods may reflect this intentionally or unintentionally. Formal tools such as metrics and TCO will help
minimize any inadvertent biases in the data collection efforts. Additionally, a review of existing past
metrics and data will be helpful in removing any bias when baselining the current environment.

4.2.1.1 Metrics Creation, Gathering, and Analysis

Metrics provide decision makers with objective, quantifiable data. The importance of metrics starts in
this phase and continues throughout the life cycle.

Metrics creation starts with defining the “what” to measure: the metrics should map to the organization’s
overall functional and security goals and relate to the desired outcomes that the service will provide.
Metrics for any service should include data related to the following:

 Implementation Level—implementation-level metrics quantify the degree of completion of required
  and agreed-on activities and within agreed-on timeframes.
 Service Level—these metrics quantify the timeliness of service delivery (i.e., average time to restore
  operations or number of hours to reconfigure a firewall).
 Effectiveness—effectiveness metrics are outcome factors that describe how well the services were
  delivered and their efficacy (i.e., customer service ratings, security intrusion and blockage levels, and
  the number of systems affected by computer viruses).
 Business Impact—business impact metrics quantify the effect on business parameters such as
  financial and operational resources (i.e., dollars lost from virus attacks, work time lost from server
  outages).
Additional considerations for the development of metrics include:

 Consider only those metrics that are practical to collect
 Base metrics only on obtainable and quantifiable events
 Consider all IT security service aspects from technical functionality to problem resolution procedures
  to appropriateness of personnel
 Base metrics on business operation objectives
 Provide sufficient insight into assessing the level of IT security services provided/offered and allow
  for a relevant comparison between service options
 Gather metrics to assess the causes, not only results
 Gather metrics to track trends.
NIST SP 800-55, Security Metrics Guide for Information Technology Systems, provides more detail about
the characteristics of useful metrics, as well as the importance of having a mature (or maturing) metrics
program. The importance of a repeatable, consistent metrics approach to IT security will become
apparent in the IT security services life cycle as the organization sets targets, writes service agreements,
and monitors service provider performance in Phases 3, 4 and 5, respectively.

4.2.1.2 Total Cost of Ownership

In conjunction with a metrics program, the IT security services decision makers need to identify the full
cost of the service. Metrics may be a part of this effort because they can help determine the dollar cost of
various actions (e.g., cost of downtime, costs of a virus attack). The principle of full cost is often referred
to as TCO. TCO includes not only implementation and operational costs but also related costs (e.g.,
overhead, salaries, benefits, technology upgrades, and software support, and maintenance). This
information will allow decision makers to compare the costs of other service arrangements with the
existing environment during the business case development in the solution phase. When the full cost is
identified, the decision makers will be able to accurately relate the value of one service option over
another.

4.2.2   Analyze Opportunities and Barriers

Once the organization understands the current environment from a performance and cost perspective, it
can begin to analyze opportunities and barriers. Analyzing opportunities and barriers allows the
organization to identify functions and areas that can change, those that cannot, and reasons for each. IT
security stakeholders should participate in the process and approve analysis results. Properly performed,
an analysis should include the following:

Strategic/Mission             •   Identify how critical the service/function is to the business.

Budgetary/Funding             •   Articulate a rational, executable fiscal program, in accordance with all
                                  applicable regulations and legislation to secure approval and funding by budget
                                  authorities

Technical/Architectural       •   Determine and understand the importance of maintaining an organization’s
                                  technical competencies

Organizational                •   Determine which service arrangements would be appropriate for the
                                  organization’s work environment and values.
                              •   Allow management to incorporate intangible benefits to all stakeholders (e.g.,
                                  improved employee morale, organizational image) into the business case that
                                  will be developed.

Personnel                     •   Allow all stakeholders to develop and translate overarching performance goals
                                  and specific needs into specific service level requirements, such as Request for
                                  Proposal (RFP)/SOW/Service Level Agreement (SLA) requirements.

Policy/Process                •   Begin to address integration/transition efforts for the desired future service
                                  arrangement strategy.

4.2.3   Identify Options and Risks

In this last step of the assessment phase, decision makers should begin to identify options and risks. The
baseline showed the current environment, and the opportunities and barriers step began to describe the
desired target. In this step, the “how-to” becomes clearer.

The “how-to” step will determine the service arrangement. As discussed in Chapter 3, organizations may
fulfill a security service requirement using various security service arrangements—from using only
internal teams and staff to fully outsourcing for the security service. At this life-cycle phase, many
organizations will still need to consider many options and various service arrangements. For each of
these, the organization needs to identify the benefits and risks.

Finally, the evidence may suggest the current arrangement and service level are effective and/or
appropriate. It is most important to focus on business function, customers, and effective security. The
choices made should best support these three focus points. Improving business and IT processes will
likely be more effective and less risky than changing the service arrangement; organizations should not
seek to change the current environment unless the assessment identifies improvement areas that can be
met only by implementing a change in service, service arrangement, or service provider.

                                          Figure 4-4. Solution Phase

Choosing a service arrangement and service level solution is only one part of this phase. Before
specifying the solution, decision makers will need to develop a detailed business case for each possibility
to be considered.

The business case will provide managers with the cost, benefit, and organizational risk perspective of
each alternative. Comparing the costs, benefits and organizational risks will allow managers to identify a
preferred solution. The implementation plan will provide managers with the means for identifying the
service provider and implementing the service.

4.3.1      Develop the Business Case

During the assessment phase, the decision makers identified the current environment. To identify the
preferred desired future state in this solution phase, a business case needs to be developed. The business
case should provide the information necessary to identify the best solution among the alternatives. Each
organization will likely have a unique methodology for developing a business case, however there are five
components common to most business cases:

     Alternative Analysis 2 —the organization should look at all of the available options. The organization
      will finalize the options deemed viable enough to develop formal cost estimates, benefits analysis,
      and organizational risk analysis.
     Cost Estimate—the organization needs to develop TCO estimates for each alternative. Estimates of
      each alternative and the current environment must be consistent, have similar cost elements, and be
      based on the same assumptions.
     Benefits Analysis—the organization needs to formally identify the benefits of each alternative.
      These should be quantitative (i.e., cost savings, cost avoidance etc.), whenever possible. For
      example, if the organization estimates a new service implementation will lower security incident rates
      by 50% and each incident costs x dollars (based on metrics gathered during the assessment phase), the
      organization can identify the likely cost avoidance. It will also be important to look at qualitative
      benefits such as impact to mission, customers, etc.
     Project Risk Analysis—along with the benefits of each alternative, project risks must be identified.
      OMB has identified eight standard risk categories 3 : organizational and change management risk,
      business risk, data/information risk, technology risk, strategic risk, security risk, privacy risk, project
      resources risk. These risks might include cost overruns, schedule slippage, vendor uncertainties,
      privacy concerns, etc. The analysis of risks should evaluate all alternatives against the same risk
      factors and determine the probability of occurrence and the impact if it occurred. Then, the
      organization should determine the risk-adjusted cost of each alternative.
     Evaluation of Alternatives—finally, the organization should rank each alternative based on cost,
      benefit and risk. From this analysis, the organization should be able to identify the preferred
      alternative.
4.3.2      Develop the Service Arrangement

Developing the service arrangement could be a relatively short step as the hard work of data collection,
analysis, and comparison of options has already been completed. Although the business case may not
make the decision-making easy or obvious, it should provide the necessary data for decision makers to
weigh, consider, and select the service arrangement that best suits the organization’s needs. There will
likely be some discussion and disagreement among the decision makers, but ultimately the selection must
be a consensus. A service arrangement can succeed only if all business and IT security managers
sufficiently buy-in to the implementing solution.

       This step is most likely completed during the assessment phase.

4.3.3    Develop the Implementation Plan

At this time, the parties should determine the budget and scope of the service arrangement and begin to
develop the implementation plan. The implementation plan provides a roadmap for the organization on
moving from the current environment to the desired future environment. The implementation plan should
address the following:

 Project Management Roles and Responsibilities—the implementation plan should identify the
  roles and responsibilities of individuals with project management roles and responsibilities for both
  the implementation and operations phases.
 Budget and Scope—IT security managers should identify the budgets and scope of the service
  arrangement. This effort will be important for identifying, soliciting, and assessing service providers
  in the next phase.
 Implementation Process—the program managers should begin to articulate their vision for
  implementing the IT security service. For example, if the program managers want to start with a test
  group or pilot program and/or establish a transition period for the service, the process for
  accomplishing this effort should be detailed here.
 Risk Mitigation Plans—IT security program managers should specify their plans for mitigating each
  risk identified throughout the assessment and solution phases.
 Exit Strategies—exit strategies will need to be developed to ensure the organization exits a service
  arrangement without disrupting other operations within the organization. The exit strategy should
  provide action plans for normal, planned exits, such as service agreement expiration; unexpected
  terminations, such as service provider bankruptcy; and potentially tension-filled exits, such as poor
  service provider performance.
 Transition Management—transition management plans should document the organization’s efforts
  to manage the transition from the current to the desired future environment. Managers should
  develop plans for addressing displaced employees, handling resistance to change, shifting the
  organizational focus, and communicating clearly with employees about the changes. In both the
  transition from one service arrangement to another, there will be transition costs, perhaps significant
  costs. These costs should be figured into the life-cycle costs and alternatives analysis. These costs
  should be considered when transition plans are developed.
4.4     Phase 4: Implementation

Selecting the service arrangement and service provider may actually be the easy part of the IT security
life cycle. Creating metrics and gathering data may require considerable work, especially if a metrics
program is not already in place. Although the multitude of service arrangements may seem
overwhelming, the objective data and methodical analysis will likely make clear the best path.
Implementing those decisions requires preparation and care. Managers should develop explicit service
agreements and ensure careful execution of the implementation plan. Careful planning and execution will
increase the chance of success, but as the service moves to the operations phase, the leadership should
manage expectations. No service arrangement will fix a problem overnight and no service provider can
be expected to debut perfectly. Figure 4-5 illustrates Phase 4, Implementation, of the IT security services
life cycle.

4.4.1   Identify Service Provider and Develop Service Agreement

During the solution phase, the security decision makers select the service arrangement. In this phase, they
need to identify the service provider. How they do this will vary by organization, service arrangement,
and type of service agreement.

                                       more responsibility on the service provider, the organization
                                       is able to assess a much broader and deeper set of solutions,

 Establish Service Provider Service Level Targets—having identified and captured the relevant data
  in the baseline phase, and developed the direction of the desired future environment, the IT security
  managers should determine the performance targets they want the service provider to meet. These
  service levels will be further negotiated with the service provider and formally documented in the
  service agreement.
 Elicit Service Provider Proposals—the organization may identify potential service providers in
  numerous ways. If the service area has few providers or exists in a new market, the organization may
  solicit all of the service providers in the field for quotes and their service offering. The organization
  may also announce an RFP and direct interested parties to provide cost proposals. Regardless of the
  method, the organization should try to consider as many service providers as possible to encourage
  competition. The organization may want to ask service providers to answer some of the questions
  from section 3.5 of this guide.
 Assess the Proposals and Service Providers—the organization should evaluate the proposals, cost
  quotes, and/or management plans of the various service providers, and consider each provider
  carefully. Although the cost of the proposal may well be a leading factor, managers need to balance
  cost with value, reputation of the service provider, past performance of the service provider, and
  ability of the service provider to support the mission of the acquiring organization. The organization
  also needs to ensure that the methodologies, service levels, and costs are in-line with its expectations
  and that they are feasible. A proposal that far exceeds the competitors in cost and service level, for
  example, may warrant further investigation and skepticism.
 Select Service Provider—once the service providers are evaluated, the decision makers should select
  the service provider that most closely aligns with their needs, goals, and targets.
 Develop the Service Agreement—Further negotiation of price and service level may be necessary;
  however, once these are set, a service agreement should be developed. Depending on the service
  arrangement, this process may be more or less formal. Internal service arrangements, for example,
  may consist of an agreed-on process or reporting requirement or a MOA. External service
  arrangements should be documented with formal contracts. Regardless of the type of document used
  as a service agreement, the content of the agreement should be the same for both internal and external
  service providers.
Agreements, regardless of type, should specify the following:

 Explicit definitions of both the organization’s roles and responsibilities and the service provider’s
  roles and responsibilities (including level of clearance or background investigation needed for staff)
 Description of the service environment, including locations, facility security requirements, and
  policies, procedures, and standards; and, agreements and licenses
 Defined service levels and service level costs. The service level section of the service agreement may
  stipulate various service levels for different types of customers or price levels and it may stipulate
  different service levels for various periods of performance, e.g., year 1 may demand a higher service
  level than year 2 of the contract.
 Defined process regarding how the managers will assess the service provider’s compliance with the
  service level and due date targets, rules, and other terms of the agreement
 Specific remedies (e.g., financial, legal) for noncompliance or harm caused by the service provider
 Period of performance and/or deliverable due dates

 Service provider’s interface to organization’s management
 Organization’s responsibilities with respect to making information and resources available to service
  provider
 Procedures and protections for commingling organization and service provider data
 Explicit rules for handling sensitive data.
Too often, service arrangements fail because one or more of these were not considered. Organizations
should clearly state what they need, and service providers should clearly understand what is expected of
them.

4.4.2    Finalize and Execute the Implementation Plan

Now that the service provider and service levels have been finalized, the organization can complete the
implementation plan and begin to execute the plan. Some details may have changed during the service
agreement negotiation, and managers should be aware of how the plan should be changed.

4.4.3    Manage Expectations

As the new service, service arrangement, and/or service provider is implemented, all parties should
manage expectations. There may be some conflict as each party adapts to the new security and
organizational environment and learns to operate within it. Lines of communication lines should be kept
open to ensure close monitoring and cooperation between the managers and service providers.

A few important guidelines are:

 Address problems openly, whether the conflict is internal to the organization or between internal
  groups and external service providers.
 Allow the service provider to perform its job while still ensuring accountability.
 Maintain the security services life cycle.
4.5     Phase 5: Operations

The operations phase begins once the service provider and service have been fully implemented. During
this phase, the organization, its security, and the security service provider are monitored to ensure the
service arrangement best meets the firm’s needs. This assessment will continue until a trigger occurs to
initiate closeout of this life cycle and start of a new life cycle. Open communications should be continued,
so that the organization and the service provider can address the problems that arise.

Throughout the operations phase, the organization’s project managers should ensure that the service
provider meets its stated service levels and complies with internal security procedures and policies.
Often, for example, organizations do not ensure external service providers handle sensitive (whether
personal, private, or mission sensitive) material as internal service providers do; if internal service
providers needed personnel clearances, it is very likely the external service provider would also need a
personnel clearance. Figure 4-6 illustrates Phase 5, Operations, of the IT security services life cycle.

                                       Figure 4-6. Operations Phase

4.5.1   Monitor Service Provider Performance

The operational phase is similar to the assessment phase. The data collected during the assessment phase
should be used to capture the performance level of this new service provider. During the operations
phase, the desired future arrangement becomes the current arrangement.

The targets set forth in the service agreement should be compared with the metrics gathered. Although
metrics will provide service-level targets, the organization may also want to use end user evaluations or
customer satisfaction level surveys to evaluate performance. The IT security managers will have to work
with other operational managers (such as customer service managers) to ensure that the service provider
is meeting service targets. The IT security managers also need to ensure service providers are complying
with IT security policy and processes, as well as applicable laws and regulations. IT security managers
must ensure during the operations phase that the service provider does not compromise private,
confidential, personal, or mission-sensitive data. Compliance reports will help with this effort. The
service agreement should have included clauses that specify penalties and/or remedies for noncompliance
and management should employ these when the service provider does not perform as the contract dictates.

4.5.2   Monitor and Measure Organization Performance

While the service provider should meet the targets set forth in the service agreements, the IT security
managers must look beyond the service and service provider to the entire IT security function and



                                                   4-14

organization. The IT security function should have a mix of several IT services at various levels
(management, operational, and technical) and a service arrangement has technical, policy, cultural,
personnel, and other impacts. Therefore, managers should ensure that the service arrangement has not
negatively affected other areas while performing the service.

4.5.3    Evaluate and Evolve

The service will evolve as it matures. The monitoring and measures of the service provider and
organization will allow IT security stakeholders to evaluate the organization’s performance and seek ways
to improve, even when meeting the targets. The world of IT security services is ever changing and
security arrangements and agreements also need to change.

4.6     Phase 6: Closeout

As mentioned during the initiation phase, life cycles may overlap. As one IT security service, service
arrangement, or agreement ends, another may begin. Depending on the reason for ending a service, a
difficult management situation could exist. Exiting service providers may not always have the best
interests of the organization in mind and may not make it easy for those replacing them. Therefore, IT
security managers need to be sure to select the appropriate exit strategy and implement it well.

Figure 4-7 illustrates Phase 6, Closeout, of the IT security services life cycle.




                                         Figure 4-7. Closeout Phase

4.6.1   Select Appropriate Exit Strategy

As mentioned during the development of the exit strategy, an organization should have several exit
strategies prepared and ready for implementation (section 4.3.3). Often, an organization will be able to
plan in advance for the exit: the service provider and the organization have an agreed-on contract that
expires in 6 months, for example. However, this will not always be the case. The service arrangement
may not succeed as managers hoped, the service provider may not meet the targets, a new technology
may debut, or the service provider may even have suddenly filed for bankruptcy. Managers need to be
aware of these various scenarios and be ready to implement an exit strategy swiftly.

4.6.2   Implement Appropriate Exit Strategy

Once the circumstances become such that the service, service arrangement, or service provider need to be
retired and the appropriate exit strategy is selected, the project managers need to implement the
appropriate exit strategy. The exit strategy will best assure a careful ending and provide lessons-learned
for desired future IT security service implementations.

5.     Types of Services

An effective IT security program should encompass multiple layers of protection. An organization should
evaluate the value and criticality of its information systems and determine the security controls that are
appropriate to the level of risk. A security program, whether at the organizational or individual system
level, should include an appropriate mixture of security controls: management, operational, and
          4
technical. Reliance on technical resources alone will be insufficient without complementary
management or operational controls.

This section presents examples of management, operational, and technical services that are discussed in
this document. Table 5-1 lists these IT security services that will be discussed. Each security service is
defined and the nature of the service provision explained. Then, issues and considerations unique to
specific security services are provided.

An exhaustive list of every security service available is not provided. Security service providers may
package elements of many of these services into a unique service offering with a unique name. Advances
in technology will create new security services. In many cases, the issues and considerations provided for

5.1     Management Security Services

5.1.1    IT Security Program Development

An IT security program is a set of security controls, which can be grouped under the terms management,
operational, and technical. Federal law and regulations, such as the Federal Information Security
Management Act (FISMA) of 2002, OMB Circular A-130, Security of Federal Automated Information
Resources, and other government-wide policies, standards, and procedures issued by the OMB, NIST, and
other agencies establish the policies, standards, and procedures for federal organizations.

Because policy is typically written at a broad level, organizations must also develop standards, guidelines,
and procedures that provide employees with a clear approach to implementing policy. Standards and
guidelines specify technologies and methodologies that will be used to secure systems; procedures are
detailed steps to be followed to accomplish particular security-related tasks. Standards, guidelines, and
procedures may be distributed throughout an organization via handbooks, regulations, or manuals.
Together, these documents will ensure that employees are aware of their role in IT security and comply
with the IT security program.

IT Security Program Services

Service providers can assist organization decision makers in developing and maintaining an organization-
wide security program, helping to ensure effective implementation of the program, evaluate the
performance of major organization components, and provide appropriate security training of organization
employees with significant security responsibilities. The service providers can also perform independent
evaluations and audits of an organization IT security program.

A comprehensive IT security program service can consist of many elements that will depend on the
specific needs of the organization and the relative maturity of its IT security program. The elements of an
IT security program service may include the following:

 Assess the risk to operations and assets under the organization’s control
 Determine the level of security appropriate to protect the organization’s operations and assets
 Develop and maintain a current security plan for each system supporting the operations and assets
  under organizational control
 Develop security incident handling procedures
 Develop processes for sharing information regarding common vulnerabilities, including a description
  of procedures for external reporting
 Develop a set of effective security controls and techniques
 Develop capital planning and investment control processes that ensure appropriate integration of
  security controls into IT investments
 Develop a set of IT security metrics that enable an organization to effectively assess the adequacy of
  in-place security controls, policies, and procedures and to adequately justify security control
  investments

     Analyze the extent of integration of an organization’s IT Security Program with its Critical
      Infrastructure Protection or CIP responsibilities.
5.1.2      IT Security Policy

In the context of this guide, IT security policy is defined as the “documentation of IT security decisions.”
IT Security Policy is fully discussed in NIST SP 800-12, An Introduction to Computer Security: The
NIST Handbook. NIST SP 800-12 categorizes IT Security Policy into three basic types:

     Program Policy—high-level policy used to create an organization's IT security program, define its’
      scope within the organization, assign implementation responsibilities, establish strategic direction,
      and assign resources for implementation.
     Issue-Specific Policies—address specific issues of concern to the organization, such as contingency
      planning, the use of a particular methodology for systems risk management, and implementation of
      new regulations or law. These policies are likely to require more frequent revision as changes in
      technology and related factors take place.
     System-Specific Policies—address individual systems, such as establishing an access control list or
      in training users as to what system actions are permitted. These policies may vary from system to
      system within the same organization. In addition, policy may refer to entirely different matters, such
      as the specific managerial decisions setting an organization's electronic mail (e-mail) policy or fax
      security policy.
IT Security Policy Services

Service providers can assist organizations in analyzing existing and developing new security policies,
standards, guidelines, and procedures. The authority for approving policy is inherently a core function of
an organization and therefore final approval of policies should be performed by the organization. Given
this constraint, organizations should limit service providers, either internal or external, to assistance and
support. A comprehensive IT security policy service can consist of many elements that will depend on the
specific needs of the organization and the relative maturity of its IT security program.

IT security policy elements may include the following:

     High-level analysis of an organization’s operational environment
     Emerging Technologies
     Governance processes 5
     Procedures
     Determination of compliance to applicable guidance and regulations
     Gap analysis for the organization or program that assesses the differences between the current policy
      and the desired future policy
     Development of a unified set of security program policies and detailed issue- and system-specific
      policies
5
       Governance is about how strategy and policy decisions are made, distributed, and enforced. Governance represents the top-
       level of management; it defines the operating envelope for the agency or program, which is carried out by the various
       managers of the IT security program. Governance is composed of people (i.e., roles), organizational structures, processes,
       and decision support tools, many of which should be defined in policy (not necessarily the IT Security Policy).


                                                                5-3

 Development of short-, medium-, and long-term implementation plans identifying tasks, resources,
  priority, and ownership
 Development of IT security metrics.
5.1.3   Risk Management

Risk management is comprehensively discussed in NIST SP 800-30, Risk Management Guide for
Information Technology Systems. NIST SP 800-30 notes that the primary goal of risk management is to
“balance the operational and economic costs of protective measures and achieve gains in mission
capability by protecting IT systems and data.”

Risk Management Services

Service providers offer various combinations of service packages for supporting risk management
activities. The service provider may develop risk management guidance for supporting an organization’s
risk management program. The service provider may manage the risk management program as a whole
but the organization should always retain the responsibility for the program. The service provider may
also perform a risk assessment and/or develop a risk mitigation plan. If the organization already has a
mature and operational risk management program, the service provider may audit the program for
effectiveness.

5.1.4   IT Security Architecture

Security architecture refers to the strategic planning and development of an IT infrastructure that supports
the mission and the security objectives. It is a process that is developed during the security design phase
after a security requirements analysis has been conducted to support it.

IT Security Architecture Services

If the organization asks a service provider to design a new security architecture, the service provider must
have access to the technology and security baseline of the organization’s current architecture. The service
provider can conduct baselining if it has not already been done by the organization. Baselining services
include identifying its business needs, functional requirements, security requirements, and risk
assessments, as well as the security controls in place. A service provider can identify security controls
and identify and assess technologies that will enforce the organization’s security policies. A service
provider can develop a methodology for selecting the security solutions that best serve the organization’s
needs and design a technical architecture. Finally, the service provider should document the security
architecture.

5.1.5   Certification and Accreditation

Accreditation is the formal declaration by an authorizing official that a system is approved to operate at
an acceptable level of risk and in a particular environment using a prescribed set of technical, managerial,
and operational safeguards to an acceptable level of risk. Accreditation is usually supported by a technical
security evaluation, a risk assessment, a contingency plan, and signed rules of behavior. Certification is
the technical security evaluation of an IT system made in support of the accreditation process, to establish
the extent to which a particular design and implementation meets a set of specified security requirements.

NIST SP 800-37 (draft), Federal Guidelines for the Security Certification and Accreditation of
Information Technology Systems establishes standard processes, activities and general tasks, and
management approaches designed to certify and accredit an information system.

Certification and Accreditation Services

The complexity and rigor of specific certification activities will vary depending on the system criticality,
information sensitivity, system exposure, and level of concern. C&A service providers can manage or
conduct a complete certification or prepare and assess individual documents in the final certification
package that is ultimately presented to the accreditor for approval.

C&A service activities can include any of the following:

     Developing a security test and evaluation (ST&E) plan and test procedures
     Conducting an ST&E
     Analyzing and reporting test results
     Developing and/or conducting a vulnerability assessment
     Developing a final vulnerability assessment report
     Technical support to the certifier or accreditor.
5.1.6      IT Security Product Evaluation

Two prominent security testing and evaluation programs are now in place to assess the security features
and assurances of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) products: National Information Assurance
Partnership 6 (NIAP) Common Criteria 7 (CC) Evaluation and Validation Scheme (CCEVS) and NIST
Cryptographic Module Validation Program 8 (CMVP). In both programs, a government body validates the
results of the testing and evaluation processes conducted by private sector laboratories to ensure that the
security standards are being applied correctly and consistently. When products cannot be found on
existing validated product lists, it may be possible that other parties have evaluated a particular product.
In many cases, it is not cost effective to conduct comprehensive security evaluations for the one-time use
of an IT security product unless that product will be used extensively throughout an organization and
therefore, products on the validated product list should be considered as an alternative. Additional
information regarding security assurance can be obtained from NIST SP 800-23, Guidelines to Federal
Organizations on Security Assurance and Acquisition/Use of Tested/Evaluated Products.

IT Security Product Evaluation Services

The NIAP CCEVS employs a network of private sector, accredited testing laboratories to independently
evaluate commercial security products in a variety of key technology areas against a set of security
requirements and specifications from the international standard, International Organization for
Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) 15408, Common Criteria for IT
Security Evaluation. The CMVP, also using independent, accredited, private-sector laboratories, focuses
on security conformance testing of cryptographic modules against FIPS 140-2, Security Requirements for
Cryptographic Modules, and related federal cryptographic algorithm standards.

5.2     Operational Security Services

5.2.1     Contingency Planning

The modern networked computing environment brings significant challenges to the development of
contingency plans. Networked computing has changed the scope and focus of what has traditionally been
a local issue. Contingency planning is designed to reduce the consequences of any loss of data or
infrastructure. Contingency planning enables organization personnel to restore critical IT functions and
connectivity rapidly, effectively, and safely. The contingency plan defines the procedures, resources,
tasking, and information required for performing recovery actions in response to a broad range of events.
A well-executed and tested contingency plan also gives confidence that critical resources will be available
when needed and facilitates an organization’s continuity of operations in an emergency situation. The
plan is a living document that must be updated regularly to reflect changes to the system’s configuration
and operations. Additional information on contingency planning is provided in NIST SP 800-34,
Contingency Planning Guide for Information Technology Systems. This guide discusses various
contingency plans that will help sustain and recover critical IT services following an emergency.

The contingency plan should address, at a minimum, the following five main components: supporting
information, notification/ activation, recovery, reconstitution, and supporting appendixes.

 Supporting Information—provides an introduction and concept of operations for the plan
 Notification / Activation—items such as notification procedures, damage assessment, and plan
  activation
 Recovery—items such as a sequence of recovery activities, and recovery procedures
 Reconstitution—items such as the sequence of recovery activities, testing of systems, and
  termination of operations
 Plan Appendixes—items such contact information, equipment lists, service agreements, and any
  other related contingency plans.
Contingency Planning Services

Service providers offer their services for various phases of the contingency planning life cycle. In
considering whether to contract out contingency planning services, the organization could conduct a cost-
benefit analysis for each breakdown of the service offering (e.g., develop, update and test, and execute the
contingency plan).

 Develop—service providers can develop the organization’s contingency plan. This service requires
  gathering information from many functional areas. The vendor’s first step should be to perform a
  business impact assessment (BIA) to determine the system’s internal and external dependencies,
  allowable outage times, and recovery priorities. The BIA provides a basis for developing the specific
  recovery strategy and procedures that comprise the heart of the contingency plan.
 Update and Test—updating the plan as needed is critical to its success because the contingency plan
  is a living document. It is very common to retain the same service provider that developed the plan to
  update and test it. Updates to the plan should be made when changes in personnel, procedures, assets,
  or other resources are incorporated into the system.
      Service providers may also ensure that the plan is tested before circumstances require its use. The
      test may be a walk-through or a simulated drill, or a full operational exercise that encompasses all

                                                                                  NIST Special Publication 800-35



    aspects of the plan. Results of the testing exercise would be documented in the contingency plan and
    discussed with management. The results will determine the effectiveness of the contingency
    procedures and present any flaws. Staff must be trained in their contingency-related duties so that
    when an unexpected event interrupts operations, recovery will be easier and people will know what to
    expect.

 Execute—the responsibility for the execution phase of contingency planning lies with the
  organization, but service providers may support certain aspects of the execution phase. For example,
  an organization may outsource data recovery because service providers can provide hot or mobile
  sites for system and data recovery. They may provide periodic training to organization personnel on
  the plan and their roles in the plan.
5.2.2   Incident Handling

An IT security incident is an adverse event in a computer system or network caused by the failure of a
security mechanism or an attempted or threatened breach of these mechanisms. An incident-handling
capability can provide the ability to react quickly and efficiently to disruptions in normal processing.
Effective incident handling can be achieved by developing and instituting effective processes and
procedures for the six phases of incident response: preparation, identification, containment, eradication,
recovery, and follow-up. The incident handling process should be consistent and compatible with any
forensic services that the organization may require to ensure that critical evidence is handled properly.

Incident-Handling Services

Incident-handling capability should be available 24 hours per day, 7 days a week. A service provider may
be able to provide one or a combination of the services listed below.

Incident-handling services may include the following:

 Developing the incident handling program
 Developing and maintaining system configuration profiles
 Providing forensics capabilities
 Testing and updating incident handling procedures
 Managing and executing the incident handling procedures
Incident-handling procedural services may include the following:

 Isolation of affected systems and platforms
 Triage
 Report assessment (interpret log files, prioritize, and analyze)
 Identification/Verification (determine nature and scope of incident)
   Categorization (determine sensitivity of compromised information, system, and incident)
 Internal and external coordination (notify and coordinate with appropriate internal and external
  parties on a need-to-know basis)
 Resolution


                                                    5-7

     Technical assistance (provide detailed analysis of event, such as how it occurred and what failed to
      work properly)
     Eradication (eliminate incident causes and effects)
     Recovery (return systems to normal operations)
     Preventative support
     Operations, maintenance, and monitoring of IDS (incident response tied directly to IDS)
     Training
     Post-incident consulting
     Third-party analysis, validation of eradication and recovery, corrective and mitigation actions, and
      reporting.
5.2.3      Testing

Testing the security posture of information systems and networks is a critical component of securing a
                                                                                                 9
system. A complete and exhaustive discussion of testing is beyond the scope of this document. Testing
is the only way to validate that the security measures and procedures are working as intended. Testing
can also assist in identifying previously unknown weaknesses or vulnerabilities. All test activities,
whether manual or automatic, require human involvement and thus could be provided as a service.

The results of testing can be used in the following ways:

     As a reference point for any corrective action
     As a benchmarking tool to enable the organization to track its progress
     To assess implementation of system security requirements
     For cost-benefit analysis
     As an input into the larger life-cycle activities, such as risk assessments, functional requirements
      analysis, C&A, and performance improvement efforts.
Categories of testing can include the following:

                          Network mapping                                Log review
                          Vulnerability scanning                         Integrity checkers
                          Penetration testing                            Virus detection
                          ST&E                                           War dialing.
                          Password cracking

       Readers should refer to the NIST Special Publication 800-42, Guideline on Network Security Testing, for more information
       about each category and type of security testing.


                                                               5-8
                                                                                  NIST Special Publication 800-35



Testing Services

Because of its highly specialized and technical nature, testing is one security activity that is frequently
considered for external service providers. However, because it is a highly invasive measure, it is
important that service providers be capable and trusted by the organization. Testing can be conducted as
a separate activity or as part of the risk management program, under risk assessment. The service
provider will need clear and unambiguous direction from management (a written “rules of engagement”),
a set of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, and clearly defined scope for testing as well as input on what is
required for planning and assessment, requirements analysis, test execution, and analysis results and
documentation.

5.2.4   Training

Training is one of the most critical components in maintaining the security posture of operational
systems. Securing any organization’s IT systems cannot be achieved without skilled, knowledgeable, and
trained personnel at all levels. Security training and education must be considered an ongoing effort that
is an integral part of conducting business. With constantly evolving technology, education—especially in
the security arena—must keep pace with the perpetual changes and advances. Managers must understand
the current status of their security programs and controls to make informed judgments and investments to
appropriately mitigate risks to an acceptable level. All users of IT systems must be aware of their
responsibilities for protecting information and IT resources.

The IT Security Learning Continuum from NIST SP 800-16, Information Technology Security Training
Requirements, and shown in Figure 5-1, represents instructional guidance for IT security awareness,
training, and education programs. The model is created from requirements of several federal regulations,
including OMB Circular A-130.

                     Figure 5-1. Information Technology Security Learning Continuum

The model illustrates a three-dimensional array that integrates the following:

 Three types of training—awareness, training, and education,
 Six functional security roles—manage, acquire, design and develop, implement and operate, review
  and evaluate and use
 Three levels of training—beginning, intermediate, and advanced.
The NIST SP 800-50, Building an Information Technology Security Awareness and Training Program,
provides detailed guidance on designing, developing, implementing, and maintaining an awareness and
training program within an organization's IT security program. This guide builds upon NIST SP 800-16
by describing four steps in designing and implementing an IT security training and awareness program.

 Designing an Awareness and Training Program
 Developing Awareness and Training Material
 Program Implementation
 Post-Implementation
Training Services

IT security training service providers may offer a wide range of services to support the "total" security
awareness and training program. They can design, develop, implement, and maintain a program for the
organization, but also assist with specific elements of the organization training and awareness program.
The service provider can provide the following services:

 Program level support
 Course level support
 Training support services.
5.3     Technical Security Services

5.3.1    Firewalls

A firewall is a device that has a network protection application installed to safeguard the network from
intentional or unintentional intrusion. A firewall sits at the junction point or gateway between the two
networks, usually a private network and a public network such as the Internet. The term “firewall” is
derived from the process in which, by segmenting a network into different physical subnetworks, the
firewalls limit damage that could spread from one subnet to another, acting in the same manner as fire
doors or firewalls in automobiles.

Firewall Services

Service providers can perform any or all of the following firewall functions:

 Design a firewall solution that incorporates single and/or multiple firewalls
 Install and integrate a firewall(s) into new and existing networks
 Monitor firewall services to ensure availability and integration with other technical controls, such as
  incident response or intrusion detection systems (IDS)
 Manage the organization’s firewalls, including periodically upgrading them.
The organization can select specific service providers with a trusted family of products that belongs to
them or general service providers who specialize in offering a wide variety of security services while
using products and components from outside vendors.

5.3.2    Intrusion Detection

Intrusion is any set of actions that attempts to compromise the integrity, confidentiality, or availability of
a resource. Intrusion detection is a passive security activity that sits on the network or on selected hosts.
Devices that are part of the IDS are used to detect intrusion and provide information to a central



                                                     5-11
                                                                                             NIST Special Publication 800-35



management console. This information is reviewed by security staff to determine if a valid security
breach has taken place. An IDS performs a variety of functions:

  Monitor user and system activity
  Audit system configuration and vulnerabilities
  Assess integrity of critical system and data files
  Recognize activity patterns reflecting known attacks
  Perform statistical analyses for abnormal activity patterns
  Provide operating system audit trail management, with recognition of user activity reflecting policy
   violations
  Provide customized reports.
This ongoing monitoring and assessment is a necessary part of an overall security architecture. IDSs
generally improve the integrity of other parts of the information security infrastructure by identifying
specific indications of a possible attack and causing a reexamination of defenses. They can often trace
user activity from the point of entry into the network to point of exit. IDSs can recognize specific types
of attacks and alert appropriate staff (if configured to do so).

Intrusion Detection Services

To be effective, intrusion detection requires a robust knowledge base of attack signatures against which
the IDS can tally its findings. Threats and vulnerabilities are not static in nature and are continuously
changing and evolving. The attack signatures database should be updated frequently for the IDS to be
able to detect the most recent threats. Service providers may have greater leverage to accomplish this at
less cost because several customers can share the overhead of maintaining the database for a single IDS
product. IDSs require a high level of expertise to operate and manage. If the nature of the intrusion is
such that the IDS or the service provider is incapable of resolving the matter or the contract does not
require the service provider to resolve the problem, the service provider can contact the organization,
which in turn escalates the case for resolution.

5.3.3    Public Key Infrastructure

Modern security architectures protect and distribute information that is needed in a widely distributed
environment, where the users, resources, and stakeholders may all be in different places at different
      10
times. PKI is an approach (consisting of products, services, facilities, policies, procedures, agreements,
and people) that addresses these security needs and makes use of the scalable and distributed
characteristics of PKI. PKI allows organizations to conduct business electronically with the confidence
that:

  The person or process identified as sending the transaction is actually the originator (nonrepudiation)
  The person or process receiving the transaction is the intended recipient (identification and
   authentication)
  Data integrity has not been compromised (integrity).

10
     This section on PKI is drawn extensively from NIST SP 800-32, Introduction to Public Key Technology and the Federal
     PKI and NIST SP 800-25, Federal Agency Use of Public Key Technology for Digital Signatures and Authentication.


                                                           5-12
                                                                                              NIST Special Publication 800-35



In addition to the three services mentioned above, a PKI can also provide two additional services: key
recovery and privilege/authorization.

  Key Recovery—organizations must be able to recover data that the employee has encrypted, which
                                                                                  11
   can only be done by recovering the encryption key when the key is unavailable.
  Privilege/Authorization—certificates can be used to vouch for a user’s identity and also specify
   privileges the user has been granted.
Functional elements of a public key infrastructure include certification authorities (CA), registration
authorities (RA), repositories, and archives. The nature of PKI is that it is a very technical security
control. Several detailed NIST publications exist that further describe PKI:

  NIST SP 800-32, Introduction to Public Key Technology and the Federal PKI
  NIST SP 800-25, Federal Agency Use of Public Key Technology for Digital Signatures and
   Authentication
PKI Services

Designing, developing, deploying, and maintaining a PKI is a complex technical challenge that is
                                    12
compounded by a number of factors:

  Interoperability
  Scalability
  High costs (deploying a PKI and enabling software applications)
  Complex policy development
  Training challenges for a technology that can be complex and difficult to understand.
PKI services can be packaged in numerous ways. The entire PKI process can be performed by a service
provider, a security provider can manage the PKI in house, or PKI elements may be performed by a
provider (hybrid). The following list provides examples of PKI elements 13 that could be performed by a
service provider:




11
      Reasons for key recovery are varied and may include an employee forgetting a password to unlock an encrypted file, the
      death of an employee who has encrypted some information, or someone attempting to hide criminal activity from law
      enforcement officials.

Appendix C—SERVICE AGREEMENT OUTLINE

A service agreement can take many different forms depending upon the type and scope of the service, the
service arrangement, and type of organization. The sample service agreement outline provided in this
appendix is intended solely as a guide; the specific format, clauses, and terms will be unique to each
organization. IT security managers should develop their service agreements only after negotiations with
the service provider and, most importantly, in consultation with their organization’s legal and contractual
experts.

1. Introduction–introduces the purpose, participants, and service.

    1.1. Purpose
    1.2. Participants
    1.3. General Service Description

2. Service Environment–describes the environment in which the organization will perform the service,
   from physical location, to hardware/software being used, to the policy and procedures the service
   provider will need to follow.

    2.1. Equipment
    2.2. Facilities
    2.3. Entities and Locations
    2.4. Policies, Procedures and Standards
    2.5. Agreements and Licenses

3. Roles and Responsibilities–describes the roles and responsibilities of all major participants. The
   service provider responsibilities need to articulate not just the service tasks, but also the
   documentation of their services, reporting their actions, and support functions (e.g., if the new service
   will likely initiate trouble calls, the service agreement should articulate who and how these calls will
   be handled).

    3.1. Service Provider Responsibilities
        3.1.1. Service Tasks
        3.1.2. Documentation
        3.1.3. Service Support
        3.1.4. Reporting Requirements

    3.2. Client Organization Responsibilities

4. Service Level–identifies the metric, the service level, and methodology for assessing the service level.
   For further guidance on developing metrics, NIST Special Publication 800-55, Security Metrics
   Guide for Information Technology Systems, provides guidance on developing and gathering metrics,
   as well as sample IT security metrics. Organizations may choose to articulate the service level in a
   range: from unacceptable to minimum to interim to target, or they may choose to set varying service
   levels for various user groups or schedule times. If so, each service level will need to be articulated.

Appendix D—SAMPLE ACQUISITION LANGUAGE

D.1      Introduction
                                      14
This Appendix presents language that is appropriate for inclusion into information technology (IT)
security service Statements of Work (SOW) or other forms of service provider agreements and covers
some of the services presented in this document. Although the language is not a substitute for good IT
security management, organization staff and government service providers can use this appendix as a
basis for a common understanding of each described activity. The sample language can foster easier
access to more consistent, high-quality IT security services. The descriptions apply to contracting for
services or obtaining them from within the organization. It is worth reiterating that close consultation and
guidance with your acquisition officials and legal counsel is always prudent as they are the experts in
what is often a complicated and arcane area of expertise.

D.2      Sample Acquisition Language

The language presented here is a sample and is not intended as “boiler plate.” Each organization should
analyze its specific needs and determine its functional, resource, schedule requirements, and constraints.
The language may be used, with appropriate tailoring, by various organizational levels (e.g., department,
agency, bureau, region, branch, and field office). Additional acquisition language can be found in NIST
Special Publication (SP) 800-64, Security Considerations in the Information System Development Life
Cycle.

The document uses the greater-than lesser-than symbols <> to indicate information the organization will
complete. To help fill this area with appropriate information, a generic term or explanation is used (e.g.,
organization name). Instructions to those tailoring or refining the language are presented as notes,
indicated as [NOTE].

Those tailoring the language in this appendix may find other NIST publications valuable. Those
performing these tasks can also benefit from other NIST Special Publications.

Many but not all of the services discussed in this guide are presented in this appendix. In many cases, the
language provided in this appendix can be tailored to fit other security services. The deliverables
mentioned within the language are samples and need to be tailored to meet an organization’s specific
needs.

In addition to acquisition language for services discussed in this guide, acquisition language is provided
for services to evaluate IT security products and general IT security services contract management.

     This section is drawn from NISTIR 4749, Sample Statements of Work for Federal Computer Security Services: For use In
     House or Contracting Out, December 1991. The language in Appendix C was first developed as SOW language. It should
     be modified if it will be used in internal MOAs.

18
   Industry certifications do not guarantee that IT security personnel are qualified or technically suitable. Blanket requirements for
     all personnel to acquire a particular certification can be expensive and needlessly limit the available choices without
     increasing the value to the organization. Certifications can be used along with other means to develop an understanding of
     IT security skill levels. General security certifications are useful for positions such as security program manager or systems
     administrator but may have less value for certain other specialized skill positions such as a protocol or cryptographic
     engineer. In those areas, specialized certifications can have value. General and specialized certifications alone are not
     necessarily guarantees of competency or effectiveness and additional evidence will, in general, be needed.

Appendix E—FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS


1. For whom is the guide intended?
   The Guide to Information Technology Security Services is intended for any IT security stakeholder
   who is responsible for initiating, managing, performing, or terminating an IT security service.
   Additionally, business managers will find utility in that the document provides a framework that an
   organization can assess the performance of a current service and service provider and establish
   whether alternatives will provide a greater return on investment.

2. Why was this guide written?
   The guide was written to provide IT security stakeholders with a life-cycle framework for initiating,
   managing, performing, and terminating IT security services. Organizations are increasingly trying to
   maximize the return on their investment in security and other IT investments. As organizations seek
   to find appropriate service providers as well as effective security services, a framework was needed to
   initiate, manage, perform, and terminate IT security services.

3. What are IT security services?

    IT security services can be categorized in a number of ways. In this document they are categorized as
    either management, operational or technical services. Management IT security services are services
    that focus on managing the IT security program and risk within the organization, such as security
    policy development or risk management. Operational security services focus on security controls
    implemented and executed by people (as opposed to systems), such as network testing or training and
    awareness. Finally, technical services are services focused on security controls executed by an IT
    system, such as firewalls and intrusion detection. This document provides a sampling of possible IT
    security services.

4. What is the IT security service life cycle?

    The IT security service life cycle is a six-phased approach to initiating, managing, performing, and
    terminating IT security services. The six phases are:

     Initiation
     Assessment
     Solution
     Implementation
     Operations
     Closeout
5. Who has a role in the IT security service life cycle?

    The list of participants who will select, assessment, implement and manage an IT security service will
    depend on the type and scope of the service, service arrangement, and type of organization. Key
    players can include the Chief Information Officer (CIO), contracting officer, contracting officer’s
    technical representative, IT investment board, IT security program manager, IT system security
    officer, program manager/procurement initiator, and privacy officer, among others.

                                                                                 NIST Special Publication 800-35




6. What is an IT security arrangement?

   An IT security arrangement is the result of the identification of an IT security service requirement and
   a decision on the way in which the organization will perform this service requirement. There are any
   number of service arrangements from which IT security managers may choose. An organization may
   select its internal employees and teams to provide the service required, it may choose to fully use an
   external service provider, or it may choose something in between with both external and internal
   employees performing an IT security service role.

7. Does the IT security services guide recommend “outsourcing” IT security services?

   No. The guide does not prescribe a specific service, service level, service mix, service arrangement,
   service agreement or service provider. Rather, it provides a methodology for assessing, analyzing and
   selecting IT security services appropriate for each organization. There are too many issues and too
   many variables for any document to prescribe what is best for a given organization. IT security
   managers and other senior officials should assess the risks and benefits of each alternative and select
   the most appropriate alternative for the organization.

8. What are some of the tools managers might use to manage IT security services?

   The guide discusses several tools managers might use to manage IT security services including the IT
   security services life cycle framework, metrics, and service agreements.

9. What are metrics?

   Metrics are a management tool that facilitates decision-making and accountability through practical,
   relevant data collection, data analysis, and performance data reporting. An example of a metric for a
   management service, a training and awareness program, might be the number of new employees who
   receive IT security training within their first 30 days on the job. Gathering this metric repeatedly,
   over time, will allow managers to assess how well the current training service provider performs its
   task today, to set targets for the service provider in the future, and then to assess how well it met the
   desired target.

10. What issues/factors affect IT security service decisions?

   There are innumerable factors that affect IT security service decisions and will vary by service,
   service arrangement and type of organization. Generally speaking, the factors and issues can be
   grouped into the following categories:

    Strategic/Mission–related to the organization’s mission and business function.
    Budgetary/Funding–related to cost, funding, and value of IT security
    Technical/Architectural–related to the technical and architectural environment of the organization
    Organizational/Cultural–related to the intangibles of the organization such as image, reputation,
     and resiliency
    Personnel–related to the organization’s contractors and employees
    Policy/Process–related to the organization’s business and IT security policies and procedures.

                                                                                 NIST Special Publication 800-35




11. How does an organization know which phase of the life cycle its service(s) are in?

   The IT security services life cycle is an iterative process in which the IT security services are
   continually assessed and evaluated. If an organization has not yet implemented IT security services,
   but needs them, it will be at the initiation phase. All others are likely to be in the operations phase
   and will be assessing service provider and organizational performance.

12. What triggers the life cycle?

   Any number of things can trigger the life cycle, from top-level management choosing to assess the
   current IT security functions to a new IT security service requirement. The trigger will likely fall into
   one of the issue categories mentioned in question 10 (see section 4.1 for specific sample triggers from
   each category), but all triggers have one characteristic in common: it will be an event sufficient to
   warrant assessing the current IT security environment and identifying viable service solutions.

13. How does an organization know if its current service(s) are adequate?

   The second phase of the IT security service life cycle is the assessment phase. During this phase, the
   IT security managers will assess the existing IT security environment through the use of metrics and
   the principle of total cost of ownership (TCO). Together they will allow managers to assess the
   current service level and cost. However, whether this service level and cost is acceptable is beyond
   the scope of the document. IT security managers will need to determine this for themselves based on
   their unique IT security and business requirements.

14. How does an organization choose an IT security solution?

   An organization chooses an IT security solution based on their assessment of the current environment
   and business case development of the viable alternatives as compared to their current service.
   Although the business case may not make the decision-making easy or obvious, it should provide the
   necessary data for the decision maker to weigh, consider, and select the service arrangement that best
   suits the organization’s needs. There will likely be some discussion and disagreement among the
   decision makers, but ultimately the selection must be a consensus. A service can succeed only if all
   business and IT security managers sufficiently buy-in to the implementing solution.

15. How does an organization choose a service provider?

   How an organization chooses the service provider may vary depending on the service, service
   arrangement, and type of organization. If the service arrangement is an internal one, there may be
   only one internal group who can provide the service. If the service is in a new field or requires highly
   specialized experience, there may only be a few service providers to choose. Large government
   agencies may release a formal RFP. Regardless, the organization should identify the service provider
   evaluation criteria, solicit proposals, and assess potential providers against the criteria.

                                                                                NIST Special Publication 800-35




16. What should a service agreement include?

   Service agreements should, as a minimum, specify the following:

    Explicit definitions of both the organization’s roles and responsibilities and the service provider’s
     roles and responsibilities.
    Period of performance and/or deliverable due dates
    Defined service levels and service level costs.
    Defined process regarding how the managers will assess the service provider’s compliance with
     the service level and due date targets, rules, and other terms of the agreement
    Specific remedies (e.g., financial, legal) for noncompliance or harm caused by the service
     provider.
    Explicit rules for handling sensitive data


17. How does an organization monitor service performance?

   An organization will need to monitor service provider performance and organizational performance
   during the operational phase of the IT security service life cycle. The frequency and method for
   gathering these metrics should be specified in the service agreement between the IT security provider
   and the client organization. It is likely that the metrics gathered in phase two (assessing the current
   environment) will be the same metrics gathered during operations, for the future service arrangement
   will then be the current environment.

18. When does the IT security services life cycle end?

   Just as there are innumerable IT security service life cycle triggers, there are many reasons why the IT
   security service may end, including service provider insolvency, contract closeout, changing
   requirements, poor service provider performance, or new technology requirements. The common
   characteristic among all potential service closeouts would be an event significant enough to require
   implementation of a different security solution.
