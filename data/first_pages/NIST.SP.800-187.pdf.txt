This publication has been developed by NIST in accordance with its statutory responsibilities under the
Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) of 2014, 44 U.S.C. § 3551 et seq., Public Law
(P.L.) 113-283. NIST is responsible for developing information security standards and guidelines, including
minimum requirements for federal information systems, but such standards and guidelines shall not apply
to national security systems without the express approval of appropriate federal officials exercising policy
authority over such systems. This guideline is consistent with the requirements of the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130.

Nothing in this publication should be taken to contradict the standards and guidelines made mandatory and
binding on federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory authority. Nor should these
guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the Secretary of Commerce,
Director of the OMB, or any other federal official. This publication may be used by nongovernmental
organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright in the United States. Attribution would,
however, be appreciated by NIST.

There may be references in this publication to other publications currently under development by NIST in accordance
with its assigned statutory responsibilities. The information in this publication, including concepts and methodologies,
may be used by federal agencies even before the completion of such companion publications. Thus, until each
publication is completed, current requirements, guidelines, and procedures, where they exist, remain operative. For
planning and transition purposes, federal agencies may wish to closely follow the development of these new
publications by NIST.
