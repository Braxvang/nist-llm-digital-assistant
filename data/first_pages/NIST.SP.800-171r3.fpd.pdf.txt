NIST SP 800-171r3 fpd (Final Public Draft)               Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information
November 2023

Abstract
The protection of Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) resident in nonfederal systems and
organizations is of paramount importance to federal agencies and can directly impact the ability
of the Federal Government to successfully conduct its essential missions and functions. This
publication provides federal agencies with recommended security requirements for protecting the
confidentiality of CUI when the information is resident in nonfederal systems and organizations.
The requirements apply to components of nonfederal systems that process, store, or transmit CUI
or that provide protection for such components. The security requirements are intended for use
by federal agencies in contractual vehicles or other agreements established between those
agencies and nonfederal organizations.

Keywords
Controlled Unclassified Information; Executive Order 13556; FIPS Publication 199; FIPS
Publication 200; FISMA; NIST Special Publication 800-53; nonfederal organizations; nonfederal
systems; organization-defined parameter; security assessment; security control; security
requirement.

Reports on Computer Systems Technology
The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical
leadership for the Nation’s measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops tests, test
methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance
the development and productive use of information technology. ITL’s responsibilities include the
development of management, administrative, technical, and physical standards and guidelines for
the cost-effective security and privacy of other than national security-related information in
federal information systems. The Special Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research,
guidelines, and outreach efforts in information system security, and its collaborative activities
with industry, government, and academic organizations.

November 2023

Audience
This publication serves a diverse group of individuals and organizations in the public and private
sectors, including:
    •   Federal agencies responsible for managing and protecting CUI
    •   Nonfederal organizations responsible for protecting CUI
    •   Individuals with system development life cycle responsibilities (e.g., program managers,
        mission/business owners, information owners/stewards, system designers and developers,
        system/security engineers, systems integrators)
    •   Individuals with acquisition or procurement responsibilities (e.g., contracting officers)
    •   Individuals with system, security, or risk management and oversight responsibilities (e.g.,
        authorizing officials, chief information officers, chief information security officers,
        system owners, information security managers)
    •   Individuals with security assessment and monitoring responsibilities (e.g., auditors,
        system evaluators, assessors, analysts, independent verifiers and validators)

The above roles and responsibilities can be viewed from two perspectives:
    •   Federal perspective: The entity establishing and conveying the security requirements in
        contractual vehicles or other types of agreements
    •   Nonfederal perspective: The entity responding to and complying with the security
        requirements set forth in contracts or agreements

Note to Reviewers
This update to NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-171, Revision 3 includes the changes made to
the initial public draft (ipd) in response to the public comments received. Many trade-offs have
been made to ensure that the technical and non-technical requirements have been stated clearly
and concisely while also recognizing the specific needs of federal and nonfederal organizations.
The following significant changes have been made to the initial public draft of NIST SP 800-
171, Revision 3:
    •   Eliminated the NFO control tailoring category
    •   Introduced a new control tailoring category for controls that are addressed by other
        related controls (ORC)
    •   Eliminated selected organization-defined parameters (ODPs) where the ODP
        specification did not significantly impact the security requirement
    •   Clarified the responsibility for assigning ODP values
    •   Combined security requirements (or parts of requirements) with other requirements for
        consistency and ease of use
    •   Added security requirements due to control categorization changes
    •   Sequenced the content in the discussion sections to align with the individual parts of the
        requirements
    •   Modified the tailoring categories of selected controls and control items (subparts of
        controls)
    •   Added leading zeros to security requirement numbers to achieve greater consistency with
        SP 800-171A numbering formats and to support automated tool usage

Information regarding the transition of security requirements from NIST SP 800-171, Revision 2
to Revision 3 can be found on the publication details web page.

Reviewers are encouraged to comment on all or parts of draft NIST SP 800-171, Revision 3.
NIST requests that comments be submitted to 800-171comments@list.nist.gov by 11:59 p.m.
Eastern Standard Time (EST) on January 12, 2024. Commenters are encouraged to use the
comment template provided with the document announcement.

Comments received in response to this request will be posted on the Protecting CUI project site
after the due date. Submitters’ names and affiliations (when provided) will be included, while
contact information will be removed.

Call for Patent Claims
This public review includes a call for information on essential patent claims (claims whose use
would be required for compliance with the guidance or requirements in this Information
Technology Laboratory (ITL) draft publication). Such guidance and/or requirements may be
directly stated in this ITL Publication or by reference to another publication. This call also
includes disclosure, where known, of the existence of pending U.S. or foreign patent applications
relating to this ITL draft publication and of any relevant unexpired U.S. or foreign patents.

ITL may require from the patent holder, or a party authorized to make assurances on its behalf,
in written or electronic form, either:
    a) assurance in the form of a general disclaimer to the effect that such party does not hold
       and does not currently intend holding any essential patent claim(s); or
    b) assurance that a license to such essential patent claim(s) will be made available to
       applicants desiring to utilize the license for the purpose of complying with the guidance
       or requirements in this ITL draft publication either:
           i.    under reasonable terms and conditions that are demonstrably free of any unfair
                 discrimination; or
          ii.    without compensation and under reasonable terms and conditions that are
                 demonstrably free of any unfair discrimination.

Such assurance shall indicate that the patent holder (or third party authorized to make assurances
on its behalf) will include in any documents transferring ownership of patents subject to the
assurance, provisions sufficient to ensure that the commitments in the assurance are binding on
the transferee, and that the transferee will similarly include appropriate provisions in the event of
future transfers with the goal of binding each successor-in-interest.

The assurance shall also indicate that it is intended to be binding on successors-in-interest
regardless of whether such provisions are included in the relevant transfer documents.

Such statements should be addressed to: 800-171comments@list.nist.gov

     November 2023


 1       Introduction
 2   Executive Order (EO) 13556 [1] established a governmentwide program to standardize the way
 3   the executive branch handles Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). 1 EO 13556 required
 4   that the CUI program emphasize openness, transparency, and uniformity of governmentwide
 5   practices and that the program implementation take place in a manner consistent with Office of
 6   Management and Budget (OMB) policies and National Institute of Standards and Technology
 7   (NIST) standards and guidelines. As the CUI program Executive Agent, the National Archives
 8   and Records Administration (NARA) provides information, guidance, policy, and requirements
 9   on handling CUI [4]. This includes approved CUI categories and descriptions, the basis for
10   safeguarding and dissemination controls, and procedures for the use of CUI. 2 The CUI federal
11   regulation [5] provides guidance to federal agencies on the designation, safeguarding, marking,
12   dissemination, decontrolling, and disposition of CUI; establishes self-inspection and oversight
13   requirements; and delineates other facets of the program.

14   The CUI regulation requires federal agencies that use federal information systems 3 to process,
15   store, or transmit CUI to comply with NIST standards and guidelines. The responsibility of
16   federal agencies to protect CUI does not change when such information is shared with nonfederal
17   organizations. 4 Therefore, a similar level of protection is needed when CUI is processed, stored,
18   or transmitted by nonfederal organizations using nonfederal systems. 5 To maintain a consistent
19   level of protection, the security requirements for safeguarding CUI in nonfederal systems and
20   organizations must comply with FIPS 199 [6] and FIPS 200 [7]. The requirements are derived
21   from the controls in NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53 [8].

22          Purpose and Applicability
23   The purpose of this publication is to provide federal agencies with recommended security
24   requirements 6 for protecting the confidentiality of CUI 7 when such information is resident in
25   nonfederal systems and organizations and where there are no specific safeguarding requirements
26   prescribed by the authorizing law, regulation, or governmentwide policy for the CUI category
27   listed in the CUI registry [4]. The requirements do not apply to nonfederal organizations that are
28   collecting or maintaining information on behalf of a federal agency or using or operating a
29   system on behalf of an agency. 8
30
     1
       CUI is any information that a law, regulation, or governmentwide policy requires to have safeguarding or disseminating controls, excluding
     information that is classified under EO 13526 [2], or any predecessor or successor order, or the Atomic Energy Act [3] as amended.
     2
       Procedures for the use of CUI include marking, safeguarding, transporting, disseminating, reusing, and disposing of the information.
     3
       A federal information system is a system that is used or operated by an executive agency, by a contractor of an executive agency, or by another
     organization on behalf of an executive agency. The term system is used in this publication to represent people, processes, and technologies
     involved in the processing, storage, or transmission of CUI. Systems can include operational technology (OT), information technology (IT),
     Internet of Things (IoT) devices, Industrial IoT (IIoT) devices, specialized systems, cyber-physical systems, embedded systems, and sensors.
     4
       A nonfederal organization is any entity that owns, operates, or maintains a nonfederal system.
     5
       A nonfederal system is any system that does not meet the criteria for a federal information system.
     6
       The term security requirement refers to the protection needs for a system or organization. Security requirements may be derived from laws,
     Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, mission and business needs, or risk assessments.
     7
       In accordance with EO 13526 [2] and 32 CFR 2002 [5], the scope of CUI protection is primarily focused on confidentiality. However, the
     security objectives of confidentiality and integrity are closely related since many of the underlying security mechanisms support both objectives.
     Therefore, the security requirements in this publication address the protection of CUI from unauthorized disclosure and modification.
     8
       Nonfederal organizations that collect or maintain information on behalf of a federal agency or that use or operate a system on behalf of an
     agency must comply with the requirements in FISMA [9].



                                                                              1
     NIST SP 800-171r3 fpd (Final Public Draft)                                          Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information
     November 2023

31   The security requirements in this publication are only applicable to components of nonfederal
32   systems that process, store, or transmit CUI or that provide protection for such components. 9 The
33   requirements are intended for use by federal agencies in contractual vehicles or other agreements
34   that are established between those agencies and nonfederal organizations.

35   Appropriately scoping requirements is an important factor in determining protection-related
36   investment decisions and managing security risks for nonfederal organizations. If nonfederal
37   organizations designate specific system components for the processing, storage, or transmission
38   of CUI, those organizations may limit the scope of the security requirements by isolating the
39   designated system components in a separate CUI security domain. Isolation can be achieved by
40   applying architectural and design concepts (e.g., implementing subnetworks with firewalls or
41   other boundary protection devices and using information flow control mechanisms). Security
42   domains may employ physical separation, logical separation, or a combination of both. This
43   approach can provide adequate security for CUI and avoid increasing the organization’s security
44   posture beyond what it requires for protecting its missions, operations, and assets.

45            Organization of This Publication
46   The remainder of this special publication is organized as follows:
47        •    Section 2 describes the assumptions and methodology used to develop the security
48             requirements for protecting the confidentiality of CUI, the format of the requirements,
49             and the tailoring criteria applied to the NIST standards and guidelines to obtain the
50             requirements.
51        •    Section 3 lists the security requirements for protecting the confidentiality of CUI in
52             nonfederal systems and organizations.

60        The Fundamentals
61   This section describes the basic assumptions and methodology used to develop the requirements
62   to protect the confidentiality of CUI in nonfederal systems and organizations. It also includes the
63   tailoring 10 criteria applied to the controls in NIST SP 800-53 [8].

64            Basic Assumptions
65   The security requirements in this publication are based on the following assumptions:
66        •     Federal information designated as CUI has the same value, whether such information
67              resides in a federal or a nonfederal system or organization.
68        •     Statutory and regulatory requirements for the protection of CUI are consistent in federal
69              and nonfederal systems and organizations.
70        •     Safeguards implemented to protect CUI are consistent in federal and nonfederal systems
71              and organizations.
72        •     The confidentiality impact value for CUI is no less than moderate. 11
73        •     Nonfederal organizations can directly implement a variety of potential security solutions
74              or use external service providers to satisfy security requirements.

75            Security Requirement Development Methodology
76   Starting with the NIST SP 800-53 controls in the NIST SP 800-53B [12] moderate baseline, the
77   controls are tailored to eliminate selected controls or parts of controls that are:
78        •     Primarily the responsibility of the Federal Government;
79        •     Not directly related to protecting the confidentiality of CUI;
80        •     Adequately addressed by other related controls; 12 or
81        •     Not applicable.

82   The NIST SP 800-171 security requirements represent a subset of the controls that are necessary
83   to protect the confidentiality of CUI. The security requirements are organized into 17 families, as
84   illustrated in Table 1. Each family contains the requirements related to the general security topic
85   of the family. Certain families from NIST SP 800-53 are not included due to the aforementioned
86   tailoring criteria. 13

     10
        Tailoring is the process by which control baselines are modified to achieve certain organizational goals and objectives [13].
     11
        FIPS 199 [6] defines three confidentiality impact values: low, moderate, and high. In accordance with 32 CFR 2002 [5], CUI is categorized at
     no less than the moderate confidentiality impact value. However, when federal law, regulation, or governmentwide policy establishing the control
     of CUI specifies controls that differ from those of the moderate confidentiality baseline, then the applicable law, regulation, or governmentwide
     policy is followed.
     12
        “Adequately addressed by other related controls” means that the protection capability offered by the control is provided by another control in
     the same or different control family. Using this tailoring option helps to eliminate potential redundancy in requirements without affecting the
     protection of CUI in nonfederal systems and organizations.
     13
        The PII Processing and Transparency (PT) family is not included because PII is a category of CUI, and therefore, no additional requirements
     are specified for confidentiality protection. The Program Management (PM) family is not included because it is not associated with any security
     control baseline.

89    Organization-defined parameters (ODPs) are included for some requirements. These ODPs
90    provide flexibility through the use of assignment and selection operations to allow federal
91    agencies and nonfederal organizations to specify values for the designated parameters in the
92    requirements. 14 Assignment and selection operations provide the capability to customize the
93    security requirements based on specific protection needs. The determination of organization-
94    defined parameter values can be guided and informed by laws, Executive Orders, directives,
95    regulations, policies, standards, guidance, or mission and business needs. Once specified, the
96    values for the organization-defined parameters become part of the requirement.

 97   A discussion section is included with each requirement. It is derived from the control discussion
 98   sections in NIST SP 800-53 and provides additional information to facilitate the implementation
 99   and assessment of the requirements. The discussion section is informative, not normative. It is
100   not intended to extend the scope of a requirement or to influence the solutions that organizations
101   may use to satisfy a requirement. The use of examples is notional, not exhaustive and not
102   reflective of potential options available to organizations. A references section provides the
103   source controls from NIST SP 800-53 and a list of NIST Special Publications with additional
104   information on the topic described in the security requirement. 15

105   The structure and content of a typical security requirement is provided in the example below:

106   3.13.11 Cryptographic Protection
107                  REQUIREMENT: 03.13.11
108                  Implement the following types of cryptography when used to protect the confidentiality of CUI:
109                  [Assignment: organization-defined types of cryptography].

110                  DISCUSSION
111                  Cryptography is implemented in accordance with applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies,
112                  regulations, standards, and guidelines.

      14
         NIST does not establish or assign values for ODPs. If ODP values for selected security requirements are not formally established or assigned
      by a federal agency or a consortium of federal agencies, nonfederal organizations assign those values to complete the requirements.

                                    ORGANIZATION-DEFINED PARAMETERS
       Organization-defined parameters are an important part of a security requirement specification.
       ODPs provide the flexibility and specificity needed by organizations to clearly define their CUI
       security requirements, given the diverse nature of their missions, business functions, technologies,
       operational environments, and risk tolerance. ODPs also support consistent security assessments
       in determining whether specified security requirements have been satisfied.

116
117   The term organization is used in many security requirements. The meaning of the term is context
118   dependent. For example, in a security requirement with an ODP, an organization can refer to
119   either the federal agency or the nonfederal organization establishing the parameter values for the
120   requirement.

121   Appendix C describes the security control tailoring criteria used to develop the CUI security
122   requirements and the results of the tailoring process. The appendix provides a list of controls
123   from NIST SP 800-53 that support the requirements and the controls that have been eliminated
124   from the moderate baseline in accordance with the tailoring criteria.

125      The Requirements
126   This section describes 17 families of security requirements for protecting the confidentiality of
127   CUI in nonfederal systems and organizations. When used in the context of the requirements in
128   Section 3, the term system is narrowed to only include nonfederal systems or system components
129   that process, store, or transmit CUI or that provide protection for such systems or components.
130   Not all security requirements mention CUI explicitly. However, the requirements are included
131   because they directly affect the protection of CUI during processing, while in storage, and when
132   in transmission between different locations.

133   Some systems, including specialized systems (e.g., industrial/process control systems, medical
134   devices, computer numerical control machines), may have limitations on the application of
135   certain security requirements. To accommodate such issues, the system security plan — as
136   reflected in requirement 03.15.02 — is used to describe any enduring exceptions to the security
137   requirements. Individual, isolated, or temporary deficiencies are managed though organizational
138   plans of action and milestones, as reflected in requirement 03.12.02.

139        Access Control

140   3.1.1. Account Management
141           REQUIREMENT: 03.01.01
142           a. Define the types of system accounts allowed and prohibited.
143           b. Create, enable, modify, disable, and remove system accounts in accordance with
144              organizational policy, procedures, prerequisites, and criteria.
145           c.   Specify authorized users of the system, group and role membership, and access
146                authorizations (i.e., privileges).
147           d. Authorize access to the system based on a valid access authorization and intended system

160           DISCUSSION
161           This requirement focuses on account management for systems and applications. The definition
162           and enforcement of access authorizations other than those determined by account type (e.g.,
163           privileged access, non-privileged access) are addressed in requirement 03.01.02. System account
164           types include individual, group, temporary, system, guest, anonymous, emergency, developer,
165           and service. Users who require administrative privileges on system accounts receive additional
166           scrutiny by organizational personnel responsible for approving such accounts and privileged
167           access. Types of accounts that organizations may prohibit due to increased risk include group,
168           emergency, guest, anonymous, and temporary.
169           Organizations may choose to define access privileges or other attributes by account, type of
170           account, or a combination of both. Other attributes required for authorizing access include
171           restrictions on time-of-day, day-of-week, and point-of-origin. In defining other account attributes,
172           organizations consider system requirements (e.g., system upgrades, scheduled maintenance) and
173           mission and business requirements (e.g., time zone differences, remote access to facilitate travel
174           requirements).
175           Users who pose a significant security risk include individuals for whom reliable evidence
176           indicates either the intention to use authorized access to the system to cause harm or that
177           adversaries will cause harm through them. Close coordination among human resource managers,
178           mission/business owners, system administrators, and legal staff is essential when disabling
179           system accounts for high-risk individuals. Time periods for the notification of organizational
180           personnel or roles may vary.

188           Enforce approved authorizations for logical access to CUI and system resources.

189           DISCUSSION
190           Access control policies control access between active entities or subjects (i.e., users or system
191           processes acting on behalf of users) and passive entities or objects (i.e., devices, files, records,
192           domains) in organizational systems. Types of system access include remote access and access to
193           systems that communicate through external networks, such as the internet. Access enforcement
194           mechanisms can also be employed at the application and service levels to provide increased
195           protection for CUI. This recognizes that the system can host many applications and services in
196           support of mission and business functions.

202   3.1.3. Information Flow Enforcement
203           REQUIREMENT: 03.01.03
204           Enforce approved authorizations for controlling the flow of CUI within the system and between
205           connected systems.

206           DISCUSSION
207           Information flow control regulates where CUI can transit within a system and between systems
208           (versus who can access the information) and without explicit regard to subsequent accesses to that
209           information. Flow control restrictions include keeping CUI from being transmitted in the clear to
210           the internet, blocking outside traffic that claims to be from within the organization, restricting
211           requests to the internet that are not from the internal web proxy server, and limiting information
212           transfers between organizations based on data structures and content.
213           Organizations commonly use information flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms to
214           control the flow of CUI between designated sources and destinations (e.g., networks, individuals,
215           and devices) within systems and between interconnected systems. Flow control is based on
216           characteristics of the information or the information path. Enforcement occurs in boundary
217           protection devices (e.g., encrypted tunnels, routers, gateways, and firewalls) that use rule sets or
218           establish configuration settings that restrict system services, provide a packet-filtering capability
219           based on header information, or provide a message-filtering capability based on message content
220           (e.g., implementing key word searches or using document characteristics). Organizations also
221           consider the trustworthiness of filtering and inspection mechanisms (i.e., hardware, firmware, and
222           software components) that are critical to information flow enforcement.
223           Transferring information between systems that represent different security domains with different
224           security policies introduces the risk that such transfers violate one or more domain security
225           policies. In such situations, information owners or stewards provide guidance at designated policy
226           enforcement points between interconnected systems. Organizations consider mandating specific
227           architectural solutions when required to enforce specific security policies. Enforcement includes
228           prohibiting information transfers between interconnected systems (i.e., allowing information
229           access only), employing hardware mechanisms to enforce one-way information flows, and
230           implementing trustworthy regrading mechanisms to reassign security attributes and security
231           labels.

235   3.1.4. Separation of Duties
236           REQUIREMENT: 03.01.04
237           a. Identify the duties of individuals requiring separation.
238           b. Define system access authorizations to support separation of duties.

239           DISCUSSION
240           Separation of duties addresses the potential for abuse of authorized privileges and reduces the risk
241           of malevolent activity without collusion. Separation of duties includes dividing mission functions
242           and support functions among different individuals or roles, conducting system support functions

243           with different individuals or roles (e.g., quality assurance, configuration management, system
244           management, assessments, programming, and network security), and ensuring that personnel who
245           administer access control functions do not also administer audit functions. Because separation of
246           duty violations can span systems and application domains, organizations consider the entirety of
247           their systems and system components when developing policies on separation of duties. This
248           requirement is enforced by 03.01.02.

252   3.1.5. Least Privilege
253           REQUIREMENT: 03.01.05
254           a. Allow only authorized system access for users (or processes acting on behalf of users) that is
255              necessary to accomplish assigned organizational tasks.
256           b. Authorize access to [Assignment: organization-defined security functions and security-
257              relevant information].
258           c.   Review the privileges assigned to roles or classes of users periodically to validate the need
259                for such privileges.
260           d. Reassign or remove privileges, as necessary.

261           DISCUSSION
262           Organizations employ the principle of least privilege for specific duties and authorized access for
263           users and system processes. Least privilege is applied to the development, implementation, and
264           operation of the system. Organizations consider creating additional processes, roles, and system
265           accounts to achieve least privilege. Security functions include establishing system accounts and
266           assigning privileges, installing software, configuring access authorizations, configuring settings
267           for events to be audited, establishing vulnerability scanning parameters, and establishing intrusion
268           detection parameters. Security-relevant information includes threat and vulnerability information,
269           filtering rules for routers or firewalls, configuration parameters for security services, security
270           architecture, cryptographic key management information, and access control lists.

276           a. Restrict privileged accounts on the system to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or
277              roles].

279              accessing nonsecurity functions or nonsecurity information.

280           DISCUSSION
281           Privileged accounts are typically described as system administrator accounts. Restricting
282           privileged accounts to specific personnel or roles prevents nonprivileged users from accessing
283           security functions or security-relevant information. Requiring the use of non-privileged accounts
284           when accessing nonsecurity functions or nonsecurity information limits exposure when operating
285           from within privileged accounts. Including roles addresses situations in which organizations
286           implement access control policies, such as role-based access control, and where a change of role
287           provides the same degree of assurance in the change of access authorizations for the user and the
288           processes acting on behalf of the user as would be provided by a change between a privileged and
289           non-privileged account.

293   3.1.7. Least Privilege – Privileged Functions
294           REQUIREMENT: 03.01.07
295           a. Prevent non-privileged users from executing privileged functions.
296           b. Log the execution of privileged functions.

297           DISCUSSION
298           Privileged functions include establishing system accounts, performing system integrity checks,
299           conducting patching operations, or administering cryptographic key management activities. Non-
300           privileged users do not possess the appropriate authorizations to execute privileged functions.
301           Circumventing intrusion detection and prevention mechanisms or malicious code protection
302           mechanisms are examples of privileged functions that require protection from non-privileged
303           users. This requirement represents a condition to be achieved by the definition of authorized
304           privileges in 03.01.01 and the enforcement of those privileges in 03.01.02.
305           The misuse of privileged functions – whether intentionally or unintentionally by authorized users
306           or by unauthorized external entities that have compromised system accounts – is a serious and
307           ongoing concern that can have significant adverse impacts on organizations. Logging the use of
308           privileged functions is one way to detect such misuse and mitigate the risks from insider threats
309           and advanced persistent threats.

317           DISCUSSION
318           Due to the potential for denial of service, automatic system lockouts are, in most cases, temporary
319           and automatically release after a predetermined period established by the organization (i.e., using
320           a delay algorithm). Organizations may employ different delay algorithms for different system
321           components based on the capabilities of the respective components. Responses to unsuccessful
322           system logon attempts may be implemented at the system and application levels.

326   3.1.9. System Use Notification

328           Display a system use notification message with privacy and security notices consistent with
329           applicable CUI rules before granting access to the system.

330           DISCUSSION
331           System use notifications can be implemented using warning or banner messages. The messages
332           are displayed before individuals log in to the system. System use notifications are used for access
333           via logon interfaces with human users and are not required when human interfaces do not exist.
334           Organizations consider whether a secondary use notification is needed to access applications or
335           other system resources after the initial network logon. Posters or other printed materials may be
336           used in lieu of an automated system message. This requirement is related to 03.15.03.

341           REQUIREMENT: 03.01.10
342             a. Prevent access to the system by [Selection (one or more): initiating a device lock after
343                [Assignment: organization-defined time period] of inactivity; requiring the user to initiate a
344                device lock before leaving the system unattended].
345             b. Retain the device lock until the user reestablishes access using established identification
346                and authentication procedures.
347             c.   Conceal, via the device lock, information previously visible on the display with a publicly
348                  viewable image.

349             DISCUSSION
350             Device locks are temporary actions taken to prevent access to the system when users depart
351             from the immediate vicinity of the system but do not want to log out because of the temporary
352             nature of their absences. Device locks can be implemented at the operating system level or
353             application level. User-initiated device locking is behavior- or policy-based and requires users
354             to take physical action to initiate the device lock. Device locks are not an acceptable substitute
355             for logging out of the system, such as when organizations require users to log out at the end of

362   3.1.11. Session Termination
363             REQUIREMENT: 03.01.11
364             Terminate a user session automatically after [Assignment: organization-defined conditions or
365             trigger events requiring session disconnect].

366             DISCUSSION
367             This requirement addresses the termination of user-initiated logical sessions in contrast to the
368             termination of network connections that are associated with communications sessions (i.e.,
369             disconnecting from the network) in 03.13.09. A logical session is initiated whenever a user (or
370             processes acting on behalf of a user) accesses a system. Logical sessions can be terminated (and
371             thus terminate user access) without terminating network sessions. Session termination ends all
372             system processes associated with a user’s logical session except those processes that are created
373             by the user (i.e., session owner) to continue after the session is terminated. Conditions or trigger
374             events that require automatic session termination can include organization-defined periods of
375             user inactivity, time-of-day restrictions on system use, and targeted responses to certain types of
376             incidents.

380   3.1.12. Remote Access

382             a. Establish usage restrictions, configuration requirements, and connection requirements for
383                each type of allowable remote system access.
384             b. Authorize each type of remote system access prior to establishing such connections.
385             c.   Route remote access to the system through authorized and managed access control points.
386             d. Authorize remote execution of privileged commands and remote access to security-relevant
387                information.

388             DISCUSSION
389             Remote access to the system represents a significant potential vulnerability that can be exploited
390             by adversaries. Monitoring and controlling remote access methods allows organizations to
391             detect attacks and ensure compliance with remote access policies. This occurs by auditing the
392             connection activities of remote users on the systems. Routing remote access through managed

394             to unauthorized access to the system, which could result in the unauthorized disclosure of CUI.

395             Restricting the execution of privileged commands and access to security-relevant information
396             via remote access reduces the exposure of the organization and its susceptibility to threats by
397             adversaries. A privileged command is a human-initiated command executed on a system that
398             involves the control, monitoring, or administration of the system, including security functions
399             and security-relevant information. Security-relevant information is information that can
400             potentially impact the operation of security functions or the provision of security services in a
401             manner that could result in failure to enforce the system security policy or maintain isolation of
402             code and data. Privileged commands give individuals the ability to execute sensitive, security-
403             critical, or security-relevant system functions. Controlling access from remote locations helps to
404             ensure that unauthorized individuals are unable to execute such commands with the potential to
405             do serious or catastrophic damage to the system.

417             REQUIREMENT: 03.01.16
418             a. Establish usage restrictions, configuration requirements, and connection requirements for
419                each type of wireless access to the system.
420             b. Authorize each type of wireless access to the system prior to establishing such
421                connections.
422             c.   Disable, when not intended for use, wireless networking capabilities prior to issuance and
423                  deployment.

424             DISCUSSION
425             Establishing usage restrictions, configuration requirements, and connection requirements for
426             wireless access to the system provides criteria to support access authorization decisions. These
427             restrictions and requirements reduce susceptibility to unauthorized system access through
428             wireless technologies. Wireless networks use authentication protocols that provide credential
429             protection and mutual authentication. Organizations authenticate individuals and devices to
430             protect wireless access to the system. Special attention is given to the variety of devices with
431             potential wireless access to the system, including small form factor mobile devices (e.g., smart
432             phones, smart watches). Wireless networking capabilities that are embedded within system

433             components represent a significant potential vulnerability that can be exploited by adversaries.
434             Disabling wireless capabilities when not needed for essential missions or business functions can
435             help reduce susceptibility to threats by adversaries involving wireless technologies.

442             REQUIREMENT: 03.01.18
443             a. Establish usage restrictions, configuration requirements, and connection requirements for
444                mobile devices.
445             b. Authorize the connection of mobile devices to the system.
446             c.   Implement full-device or container-based encryption to protect the confidentiality of CUI on
447                  mobile devices.

448             DISCUSSION
449             A mobile device is a computing device that has a small form factor such that it can easily be
450             carried by a single individual; is designed to operate without a physical connection; possesses
451             local, non-removable, or removable data storage; and includes a self-contained power source.
452             Mobile device functionality may also include voice communication capabilities, on-board
453             sensors that allow the device to capture information, and/or built-in features for synchronizing
454             local data with remote locations. Examples include smart phones, smart watches, and tablets.
455             Mobile devices are typically associated with a single individual. The processing, storage, and
456             transmission capability of mobile devices may be comparable to or a subset of notebook or
457             desktop systems, depending on the nature and intended purpose of the device. The protection
458             and control of mobile devices is behavior- or policy-based and requires users to take physical
459             action to protect and control such devices when outside of controlled areas. Controlled areas are
460             spaces for which the organization provides physical or procedural controls to meet the
461             requirements established for protecting CUI.
462             Due to the large variety of mobile devices with different characteristics and capabilities,
463             organizational restrictions may vary for the different classes or types of such devices. Usage
464             restrictions, configuration requirements, and connection requirements for mobile devices
465             include configuration management, device identification and authentication, implementing
466             mandatory protective software, scanning devices for malicious code, updating virus protection
467             software, scanning for critical software updates and patches, conducting primary operating
468             system (and possibly other resident software) integrity checks, and disabling unnecessary
469             hardware. Organizations can employ full-device encryption or container-based encryption to
470             protect the confidentiality of CUI on mobile devices. Container-based encryption provides a
471             fine-grained approach to the encryption of data and information, including encrypting selected
472             data structures (e.g., files, records, or fields).

478   3.1.20. Use of External Systems
479             REQUIREMENT: 03.01.20
480             a. Prohibit the use of external systems unless the systems are specifically authorized.
481             b. Establish the following terms, conditions, and security requirements to be satisfied on
482                external systems prior to allowing use of or access to those systems by authorized
483                individuals: [Assignment: organization-defined terms, conditions, and requirements].
484             c.   Permit authorized individuals to use an external system to access the organizational system
485                  or to process, store, or transmit CUI only after:
486                  1. Verification of the implementation of security requirements on the external system as
487                     specified in the organization’s security plans; and
488                  2. Retention of approved system connection or processing agreements with the
489                     organizational entity hosting the external system.
490             d. Restrict the use of organization-controlled portable storage devices by authorized
491                individuals on external systems.

492             DISCUSSION
493             External systems are systems that are used by but are not part of the organization. External
494             systems include personally owned systems, system components, or devices; privately owned
495             computing and communication devices in commercial or public facilities; systems owned or
496             controlled by nonfederal organizations; and systems managed by contractors. Organizations
497             have the option to prohibit the use of any type of external system or specified types of external
498             systems, (e.g., prohibit the use of external systems that are not organizationally owned). Terms
499             and conditions are consistent with the trust relationships established with the entities that own,
500             operate, or maintain external systems and include descriptions of shared responsibilities.
501             Authorized individuals include organizational personnel, contractors, or other individuals with
502             authorized access to the organizational system and over whom organizations have the authority
503             to impose specific rules of behavior regarding system access. Restrictions that organizations
504             impose on authorized individuals need not be uniform, as the restrictions may vary depending
505             on the trust relationships between organizations. Organizations need assurance that the external
506             systems satisfy the necessary security requirements so as not to compromise, damage, or harm
507             the system. This requirement is related to 03.16.03.

526         Awareness and Training

527   3.2.1. Literacy Training and Awareness
528           REQUIREMENT: 03.02.01
529           a. Provide security literacy training to system users:
530               1. As part of initial training for new users and periodically thereafter;
531               2. When required by system changes or following [Assignment: organization-defined
532                  events]; and
533               3. On recognizing and reporting indicators of insider threat, social engineering, and social
534                  mining.
535           b. Update security literacy training content periodically and following [Assignment: organization-
536              defined events].

537           DISCUSSION
538           Organizations provide basic and advanced levels of security literacy training to system users
539           (including managers, senior executives, system administrators, and contractors) and measures to
540           test the knowledge level of users. Organizations determine the content of literacy training based
541           on specific organizational requirements, the systems to which personnel have authorized access,
542           and work environments (e.g., telework). The content includes an understanding of the need for
543           security and the actions required of users to maintain security and to respond to incidents. The
544           content also addresses the need for operations security and the handling of CUI.
545           Security awareness techniques include displaying posters, offering supplies inscribed with
546           security reminders, displaying logon screen messages, generating email advisories or notices
547           from organizational officials, and conducting awareness events using podcasts, videos, and

548           webinars. Security literacy training is conducted at a frequency consistent with applicable laws,
549           directives, regulations, and policies. Updating literacy training content on a regular basis ensures
550           that the content remains relevant. Events that may precipitate an update to literacy training
551           content include assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in
552           applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines.
553           Potential indicators and possible precursors of insider threats include behaviors such as
554           inordinate, long-term job dissatisfaction; attempts to gain access to information that is not
555           required for job performance; unexplained access to financial resources; bullying or sexual
556           harassment of fellow employees; workplace violence; and other serious violations of the policies,
557           procedures, rules, directives, or practices of organizations. Organizations may consider tailoring
558           insider threat awareness topics to the role (e.g., training for managers may be focused on specific
559           changes in the behavior of team members, while training for employees may be focused on more
560           general observations).
561           Social engineering is an attempt to deceive an individual into revealing information or taking an
562           action that can be used to breach, compromise, or otherwise adversely impact a system. Social
563           engineering includes phishing, pretexting, impersonation, baiting, quid pro quo, threadjacking,
564           social media exploitation, and tailgating. Social mining is an attempt to gather information about
565           the organization that may be used to support future attacks. Security literacy training includes
566           how to communicate employee and management concerns regarding potential indicators of
567           insider threat and potential and actual instances of social engineering and data mining through
568           appropriate organizational channels in accordance with established policies and procedures.

580              defined events].

581           DISCUSSION
582           Organizations determine the content and frequency of security training based on the assigned
583           duties, roles, and responsibilities of individuals and the security requirements of the systems to
584           which personnel have authorized access. In addition, organizations provide system developers,
585           enterprise architects, security architects, software developers, systems integrators,
586           acquisition/procurement officials, system and network administrators, personnel conducting
587           configuration management and auditing activities, personnel performing independent verification
588           and validation, security assessors, and personnel with access to system-level software with
589           security-related technical training specifically tailored for their assigned duties.

600         Audit and Accountability

601   3.3.1. Event Logging
602           REQUIREMENT: 03.03.01
603           a. Specify the following event types selected for logging within the system: [Assignment:
604              organization-defined event types].
605           b. Review and update the event types selected for logging periodically.

606           DISCUSSION
607           An event is any observable occurrence in a system, including unlawful or unauthorized system
608           activity. Organizations identify event types for which a logging functionality is needed. This
609           includes events that are relevant to the security of systems and the environments in which those
610           systems operate to meet specific and ongoing auditing needs. Event types can include password
611           changes, the execution of privileged functions, failed logons or accesses related to systems,
612           administrative privilege usage, or third-party credential usage. In determining event types that
613           require logging, organizations consider the system monitoring and auditing that are appropriate
614           for each of the security requirements. When defining event types, organizations consider the
615           logging necessary to cover related events, such as the steps in distributed, transaction-based
616           processes (e.g., processes that are distributed across multiple organizations) and actions that occur
617           in service-oriented or cloud-based architectures. Monitoring and auditing requirements can be
618           balanced with other system needs. For example, organizations may determine that systems must
619           have the capability to log every file access, both successful and unsuccessful, but not activate that
620           capability except for specific circumstances due to the potential burden on system performance.
621           The event types that are logged by organizations may change over time. Periodically reviewing
622           and updating the set of logged event types is necessary to ensure that the current set remains
623           necessary and sufficient.

635               6. Identity of individuals, subjects, objects, or entities associated with the event.
636           b. Provide additional information for audit records, as needed.

637           DISCUSSION
638           Audit record content that may be necessary to support the auditing function includes time stamps,
639           source and destination addresses, user or process identifiers, event descriptions, file names, and
640           the access control or flow control rules that are invoked. Event outcomes can include indicators of
641           event success or failure and event-specific results (e.g., the security state of the system after the
642           event occurred). Detailed information that organizations may consider in audit records includes a
643           full text recording of privileged commands or the individual identities of group account users.

647   3.3.3. Audit Record Generation
648           REQUIREMENT: 03.03.03
649           a. Generate audit records for the selected event types and audit record content specified in
650              03.03.01 and 03.03.02.
651           b. Retain audit records for a time period consistent with records retention policy.

652           DISCUSSION
653           Audit records can be generated at various levels of abstraction, including at the packet level as
654           information traverses the network. Selecting the appropriate level of abstraction is a critical
655           aspect of an audit logging capability and can facilitate the identification of root causes to
656           problems. The ability to add information generated in audit records is dependent on system
657           functionality to configure the audit record content. Organizations may consider additional
658           information in audit records, including the access control or flow control rules invoked and the
659           individual identities of group account users. Organizations may also consider limiting additional
660           audit record information to only information that is explicitly needed for audit requirements.

664   3.3.4. Response to Audit Logging Process Failures
665           REQUIREMENT: 03.03.04
666           a. Alert organizational personnel or roles within [Assignment: organization-defined time period]
667              in the event of an audit logging process failure.
668           b. Take the following additional actions: [Assignment: organization-defined additional actions].

669           DISCUSSION
670           Audit logging process failures include software and hardware errors, failures in audit log
671           capturing mechanisms, and reaching or exceeding audit log storage capacity. Response actions
672           include overwriting the oldest audit records, shutting down the system, and stopping the
673           generation of audit records. Organizations may choose to define additional actions for audit
674           logging process failures based on the type of failure, the location of the failure, the severity of the
675           failure, or a combination of such factors. When the audit logging process failure is related to
676           storage, the response is carried out for the audit log storage repository (i.e., the distinct system
677           component where the audit logs are stored), the system on which the audit logs reside, the total
678           audit log storage capacity of the organization (i.e., all audit log storage repositories combined), or
679           all three. Organizations may decide to take no additional actions after alerting designated roles or
680           personnel.

684   3.3.5. Audit Record Review, Analysis, and Reporting
685           REQUIREMENT: 03.03.05
686           a. Review and analyze system audit records periodically for indications and potential impact of
687              inappropriate or unusual activity.
688           b. Report findings to organizational personnel or roles.
689           c.   Analyze and correlate audit records across different repositories to gain organization-wide
690                situational awareness.

691           DISCUSSION
692           Audit record review, analysis, and reporting cover information security logging performed by
693           organizations and can include logging that results from the monitoring of account usage, remote
694           access, wireless connectivity, configuration settings, the use of maintenance tools and nonlocal
695           maintenance, system component inventory, mobile device connection, equipment delivery and
696           removal, physical access, temperature and humidity, communications at system interfaces, and
697           the use of mobile code. Findings can be reported to organizational entities, such as the incident
698           response team, help desk, and security or privacy offices. If organizations are prohibited from
699           reviewing and analyzing audit records or unable to conduct such activities, the review or analysis
700           may be carried out by other organizations granted such authority. The scope, frequency, and/or
701           depth of the audit record review, analysis, and reporting may be adjusted to meet organizational
702           needs based on new information received. Correlating audit record review, analysis, and reporting
703           processes helps to ensure that they collectively create a more complete view of events. The
704           requirement to assess a given system is agnostic as to whether this correlation is applied at the
705           system level or at the organization level across all systems.

709   3.3.6. Audit Record Reduction and Report Generation
710           REQUIREMENT: 03.03.06
711           a. Implement an audit record reduction and report generation capability that supports audit
712              record review, analysis, reporting requirements, and after-the-fact investigations of incidents.
713           b. Preserve the original content and time ordering of audit records.

714           DISCUSSION
715           Audit records are generated in 03.03.03. Audit record reduction and report generation occur after
716           audit record generation. Audit record reduction is a process that manipulates collected audit
717           information and organizes it in a summary format that is more meaningful to analysts. Audit
718           record reduction and report generation capabilities do not always come from the same system or
719           organizational entities that conduct auditing activities. An audit record reduction capability can
720           include, for example, modern data mining techniques with advanced data filters to identify
721           anomalous behavior in audit records. The report generation capability provided by the system can
722           help generate customizable reports. The time ordering of audit records can be a significant issue if
723           the granularity of the time stamp in the record is insufficient.

727   3.3.7. Time Stamps
728           REQUIREMENT: 03.03.07
729           a. Use internal system clocks to generate time stamps for audit records.
730           b. Record time stamps for audit records that meet [Assignment: organization-defined granularity
731              of time measurement] and that:
732               1. Use Coordinated Universal Time (UTC);
733               2. Have a fixed local time offset from UTC; or
734               3. Include the local time offset as part of the time stamp.

735           DISCUSSION
736           Time stamps generated by the system include the date and time. Time is commonly expressed in
737           Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) – a modern continuation of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) –
738           or local time with an offset from UTC. The granularity of time measurements refers to the degree
739           of synchronization between system clocks and reference clocks (e.g., clocks synchronizing within
740           hundreds or tens of milliseconds). Organizations may define different time granularities for
741           system components. Time service can be critical to other security capabilities, such as access
742           control, and identification and authentication, depending on the nature of the mechanisms used to
743           support those capabilities.

747   3.3.8. Protection of Audit Information
748           REQUIREMENT: 03.03.08
749           a. Protect audit information and audit logging tools from unauthorized access, modification, and
750              deletion.
751           b. Authorize access to management of audit logging functionality to only a subset of privileged
752              users or roles.

753           DISCUSSION
754           Audit information includes the information needed to successfully audit system activity, such as
755           audit records, audit log settings, audit reports, and personally identifiable information. Audit
756           logging tools are programs and devices used to conduct audit and logging activities. The
757           protection of audit information focuses on technical protection and limits the ability to access and
758           execute audit logging tools to authorized individuals. The physical protection of audit information
759           is addressed by media and physical protection requirements.
760           Individuals or roles with privileged access to a system and who are also the subject of an audit by
761           that system may affect the reliability of the audit information by inhibiting audit activities or
762           modifying audit records. Requiring privileged access to be further defined between audit-related
763           privileges and other privileges limits the number of users or roles with audit-related privileges.

775              components are installed or modified.

776           DISCUSSION
777           Baseline configurations for the system and system components include aspects of connectivity,
778           operation, and communications. Baseline configurations are documented, formally reviewed, and
779           agreed-upon specifications for the system or configuration items within the system. Baseline

780           configurations serve as a basis for future builds, releases, or changes to the system and include
781           information about system components, operational procedures, network topology, and the
782           placement of components in the system architecture. Maintaining baseline configurations requires
783           creating new baselines as the system changes over time. Baseline configurations of the system
784           reflect the current enterprise architecture.

791              reflect the most restrictive mode consistent with operational requirements: [Assignment:
792              organization-defined configuration settings].
793           b. Identify, document, and approve any deviations from established configuration settings.

794           DISCUSSION
795           Configuration settings are the set of parameters that can be changed in hardware, software, or
796           firmware components of the system and that affect the security posture or functionality of the
797           system. Security-related configuration settings can be defined for computing systems (e.g.,
798           servers, workstations), input and output devices (e.g., scanners, copiers, printers), network
799           components (e.g., firewalls, routers, gateways, voice and data switches, wireless access points,
800           network appliances, sensors), operating systems, middleware, and applications.
801           Security parameters are those parameters that impact the security state of the system, including
802           the parameters required to satisfy other security requirements. Security parameters include
803           registry settings; account, file, and directory permission settings (i.e., privileges); and settings for
804           functions, ports, protocols, and remote connections. Organizations establish organization-wide
805           configuration settings and subsequently derive specific configuration settings for the system. The
806           established settings become part of the system’s configuration baseline.
807           Common secure configurations (also referred to as security configuration checklists, lockdown
808           and hardening guides, security reference guides, and security technical implementation guides)
809           provide recognized, standardized, and established benchmarks that stipulate secure configuration
810           settings for specific information technology platforms/products and instructions for configuring
811           those system components to meet operational requirements. Common secure configurations can
812           be developed by a variety of organizations, including information technology product developers,
813           manufacturers, vendors, consortia, academia, industry, federal agencies, and other organizations
814           in the public and private sectors.

824           d. Monitor and review activities associated with configuration-controlled changes to the system.

825           DISCUSSION
826           Configuration change control refers to tracking, reviewing, approving or disapproving, and
827           logging changes to the system. Specifically, it involves the systematic proposal, justification,
828           implementation, testing, review, and disposition of changes to the system, including system
829           upgrades and modifications. Configuration change control includes changes to baseline
830           configurations for system components (e.g., operating systems, applications, firewalls, routers,
831           mobile devices) and configuration items of the system, changes to configuration settings,
832           unscheduled and unauthorized changes, and changes to remediate vulnerabilities.

841           reviewing security plans, policies, and procedures to understand security requirements; reviewing
842           system design documentation and operational procedures to understand how system changes
843           might affect the security state of the system; reviewing the impacts of changes on supply chain

867           a. Configure the system to provide only mission-essential capabilities.
868           b. Prohibit or restrict use of the following functions, ports, protocols, connections, and services:
869              [Assignment: organization-defined functions, ports, protocols, connections, and services].
870           c.   Review the system periodically to identify unnecessary or nonsecure functions, ports,
871                protocols, connections, and services.
872           d. Disable or remove functions, ports, protocols, connections, and services that are
873              unnecessary or nonsecure.

874           DISCUSSION
875           Systems can provide a variety of functions and services. Some functions and services that are
876           routinely provided by default may not be necessary to support essential organizational missions,
877           functions, or operations. It may be convenient to provide multiple services from single system
878           components. However, doing so increases risk over limiting the services provided by any one
879           component. Where feasible, organizations limit functionality to a single function per component.
880           Organizations review the functions and services provided by the system or system components to
881           determine which functions and services are candidates for elimination. Organizations disable
882           unused or unnecessary physical and logical ports and protocols to prevent the unauthorized
883           connection of devices, transfer of information, and tunneling. Organizations can employ network
884           scanning tools, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and endpoint protection systems (e.g.,
885           firewalls and host-based intrusion detection systems) to identify and prevent the use of prohibited
886           functions, ports, protocols, system connections, and services. Bluetooth, File Transfer Protocol,
887           and peer-to-peer networking are examples of the types of protocols that organizations consider
888           eliminating, restricting, or disabling.

896           a. Identify software programs authorized to execute on the system.
897           b. Implement a deny-all, allow-by-exception policy for the execution of software programs on the
898              system.
899           c.     Review and update the list of authorized software programs periodically.

900           DISCUSSION
901           If provided with the necessary privileges, users can install software in organizational systems. To
902           maintain control over the software installed, organizations identify permitted and prohibited
903           actions regarding software installation. Permitted software installations include updates and
904           security patches to existing software and downloading new applications from organization-
905           approved “app stores.” Prohibited software installations include software with unknown or
906           suspect pedigrees or software that organizations consider potentially malicious. The policies
907           selected for governing user-installed software are organization-developed or provided by some
908           external entity. Policy enforcement methods can include procedural methods and automated
909           methods.
910           Authorized software programs can be limited to specific versions or from a specific source. To
911           facilitate a comprehensive authorized software process and increase the strength of protection
912           against attacks that bypass application-level authorized software, software programs may be
913           decomposed into and monitored at different levels of detail. These levels include applications,
914           application programming interfaces, application modules, scripts, system processes, system
915           services, kernel functions, registries, drivers, and dynamic link libraries. Organizations consider
916           verifying the integrity of authorized software programs using digital signatures, cryptographic
917           checksums, or hash functions. The verification of authorized software can occur either prior to
918           execution or at system startup.

924   3.4.10. System Component Inventory
925             REQUIREMENT: 03.04.10
926             a. Develop and document an inventory of system components.
927             b. Review and update the system component inventory periodically.
928             c.    Update the system component inventory as part of installations, removals, and system
929                   updates.

930             DISCUSSION
931             System components are discrete, identifiable assets (i.e., hardware, software, and firmware
932             elements) that compose a system. Organizations may implement centralized system component
933             inventories that include components from all systems. In such situations, organizations ensure
934             that the inventories include system-specific information required for component accountability.
935             The information necessary for effective accountability of system components includes the

938             network addresses for all implemented protocols (e.g., IPv4, IPv6). Inventory specifications
939             include component type, physical location, date of receipt, manufacturer, cost, model, serial
940             number, and supplier information.

946             a. Identify and document the location of CUI and the system components on which the
947                information is processed and stored.
948             b. Identify and document the users who have access to the system and system components
949                where CUI is processed and stored.

952             DISCUSSION
953             Information location addresses the need to understand the specific system components where
954             CUI is being processed and stored and the users who have access to CUI so that appropriate
955             protection mechanisms can be provided, including information flow controls, access controls,
956             and information management.

960   3.4.12. System and Component Configuration for High-Risk Areas
961             REQUIREMENT: 03.04.12
962             a. Issue systems or system components with the following configurations to individuals
963                traveling to high-risk locations: [Assignment: organization-defined system configurations].
964             b. Apply the following security requirements to the system or system components when the
965                individuals return from travel: [Assignment: organization-defined security requirements].

966             DISCUSSION
967             When it is known that a system or a specific system component will be in a high-risk area,
968             additional security requirements may be needed to counter the increased threat. Organizations
969             can implement protective measures on systems or system components used by individuals
970             departing on and returning from travel. Actions include determining the locations that are of
971             concern, defining the required configurations for the components, ensuring that the components
972             are configured as intended before travel is initiated, and taking additional actions after travel is
973             completed. For example, systems going into high-risk areas can be configured with sanitized
974             hard drives, limited applications, and more stringent configuration settings. Actions applied to

 980         Identification and Authentication

 981   3.5.1. User Identification, Authentication, and Re-Authentication
 982           REQUIREMENT: 03.05.01
 983           a. Uniquely identify and authenticate system users and associate that unique identification with
 984              processes acting on behalf of those users.
 985           b. Re-authenticate users when [Assignment: organization-defined circumstances or situations
 986              requiring re-authentication].

 987           DISCUSSION
 988           System users include individuals (or system processes acting on behalf of individuals) who are
 989           authorized to access a system. Typically, individual identifiers are the usernames associated with
 990           the system accounts assigned to those individuals. Since system processes execute on behalf of
 991           groups and roles, organizations may require the unique identification of individuals in group
 992           accounts or accountability of individual activity. The unique identification and authentication of
 993           users applies to all system accesses. Organizations employ passwords, physical authenticators,
 994           biometrics, or some combination thereof to authenticate user identities. Organizations may re-
 995           authenticate individuals in certain situations, including when roles, authenticators, or credentials
 996           change; when the execution of privileged functions occurs; after a fixed time period; or
 997           periodically.

1004           DISCUSSION
1005           Devices that require unique device-to-device identification and authentication are defined by
1006           type, device, or a combination of type and device. Organization-defined device types include
1007           devices that are not owned by the organization. Systems use shared known information (e.g.,
1008           Media Access Control [MAC], Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol [TCP/IP]
1009           addresses) for device identification or organizational authentication solutions (e.g., Institute of
1010           Electrical and Electronics Engineers [IEEE] 802.1x and Extensible Authentication Protocol
1011           [EAP], RADIUS server with EAP-Transport Layer Security [TLS] authentication, Kerberos) to

1018           REQUIREMENT: 03.05.03
1019           Implement multi-factor authentication for access to system accounts.

1020           DISCUSSION
1021           Multi-factor authentication requires the use of two or more different factors to achieve
1022           authentication. The authentication factors are defined as follows: something you know (e.g., a
1023           personal identification number [PIN]), something you have (e.g., a physical authenticator, such as
1024           a cryptographic private key), or something you are (e.g., a biometric). Multi-factor authentication
1025           solutions that feature physical authenticators include hardware authenticators that provide time-
1026           based or challenge-response outputs and smart cards. In addition to authenticating users at the
1027           system level, organizations may also employ authentication mechanisms at the application level
1028           to provide increased information security.

1035           DISCUSSION
1036           Authentication processes resist replay attacks if it is impractical to successfully authenticate by
1037           recording or replaying previous authentication messages. Replay-resistant techniques include
1038           protocols that use nonces or challenges, such as time synchronous or challenge-response one-time
1039           authenticators.

1049           d. Uniquely identify the status of each individual with an identifying characteristic.

1050           DISCUSSION
1051           Identifiers are provided for users, processes acting on behalf of users, and devices. Prohibiting the
1052           reuse of identifiers prevents the assignment of previously used individual, group, role, service, or
1053           device identifiers to different individuals, groups, roles, services, or devices. Characteristics that
1054           identify the status of individuals include contractors, foreign nationals, and non-organizational
1055           users. Identifying the status of individuals by these characteristics provides useful information
1056           about the people with whom organizational personnel are communicating. For example, is useful
1057           for an employee to know that one of the individuals on an email message is a contractor.

1064           a. Maintain a list of commonly-used, expected, or compromised passwords and update the list
1065              periodically and when organizational passwords are suspected to have been compromised.

1071           f.   Enforce the following composition and complexity rules for passwords: [Assignment:
1072                organization-defined composition and complexity rules].

1073           DISCUSSION
1074           Password-based authentication applies to passwords used in single-factor or multi-factor
1075           authentication. Long passwords or passphrases are preferable to shorter passwords. Enforced
1076           composition rules provide marginal security benefits while decreasing usability. However,
1077           organizations may choose to establish certain rules for password generation (e.g., minimum
1078           character length) under certain circumstances and can enforce this requirement. For example,
1079           account recovery can occur when a password is forgotten. Cryptographically protected passwords
1080           include salted one-way cryptographic hashes of passwords. The list of commonly used,
1081           compromised, or expected passwords includes passwords obtained from previous breach
1082           corpuses, dictionary words, and repetitive or sequential characters. The list includes context-
1083           specific words, such as the name of the service, username, and derivatives thereof. Changing
1084           temporary passwords to permanent passwords immediately after system logon ensures that the
1085           necessary strength of the authentication mechanism is implemented at the earliest opportunity and

1086           reduces the susceptibility to authenticator compromises. Long passwords and passphrases can be

1097             REQUIREMENT: 03.05.11
1098             Obscure feedback of authentication information during the authentication process.

1099             DISCUSSION
1100             The feedback from systems does not provide information that would allow unauthorized
1101             individuals to compromise authentication mechanisms. For example, for desktop or notebook
1102             computers with relatively large monitors, the threat may be significant (often referred to as
1103             shoulder surfing). For mobile devices with small displays, this threat may be less significant and
1104             is balanced against the increased likelihood of input errors due to small keyboards. Therefore,
1105             the means for obscuring the authenticator feedback is selected accordingly. Obscuring feedback
1106             includes displaying asterisks when users type passwords into input devices or displaying
1107             feedback for a limited time before fully obscuring it.

1121             f.    Protect authenticator content from unauthorized disclosure and modification.

1122             DISCUSSION
1123             Authenticators include passwords, cryptographic devices, biometrics, certificates, one-time
1124             password devices, and ID badges. The initial authenticator content is the actual content of the
1125             authenticator (e.g., the initial password). In contrast, requirements for authenticator content
1126             contain specific characteristics. Authenticator management is supported by organization-defined
1127             settings and restrictions for various authenticator characteristics (e.g., password complexity and
1128             composition rules, validation time window for time synchronous one-time tokens, and the
1129             number of allowed rejections during the verification stage of biometric authentication).
1130             The requirement to protect individual authenticators may be implemented by 03.15.03 for
1131             authenticators in the possession of individuals and by 03.01.01, 03.01.02, 03.01.05, and
1132             03.13.08 for authenticators stored in organizational systems. This includes passwords stored in
1133             hashed or encrypted formats or files that contain encrypted or hashed passwords accessible with
1134             administrator privileges. Actions can be taken to protect authenticators, including maintaining
1135             possession of authenticators, not sharing authenticators with others, and immediately reporting
1136             lost, stolen, or compromised authenticators. Developers may deliver system components with
1137             factory default authentication credentials to allow for initial installation and configuration.
1138             Default authentication credentials are often well-known, easily discoverable, and present a
1139             significant risk. Authenticator management includes issuing and revoking authenticators for
1140             temporary access when no longer needed. The use of long passwords or passphrases may
1141             obviate the need to periodically change authenticators.

1148           a. Develop an incident response plan that provides the organization with a roadmap for
1149              implementing its incident response capability.
1150           b. Implement an incident-handling capability for incidents that is consistent with the incident
1151              response plan and includes preparation, detection and analysis, containment, eradication,
1152              and recovery.
1153           c.     Update the incident response plan to address system and organizational changes or
1154                  problems encountered during plan implementation, execution, or testing.

1155           DISCUSSION
1156           It is important that organizations develop and implement a coordinated approach to incident
1157           response. Organizational mission and business functions determine the structure of incident
1158           response capabilities. Incident-related information can be obtained from a variety of sources,
1159           including audit monitoring, network monitoring, physical access monitoring, user and

1169           a. Track and document system security incidents.
1170           b. Report suspected incidents to the organizational incident response capability within
1171              [Assignment: organization-defined time period].
1172           c.   Report incident information to [Assignment: organization-defined authorities].
1173           d. Provide an incident response support resource that offers advice and assistance to users of
1174              the system for the handling and reporting of incidents.

1175           DISCUSSION
1176           Documenting incidents includes maintaining records about each incident, the status of the
1177           incident, and other pertinent information necessary for forensics as well as evaluating incident
1178           details, trends, and handling. Incident information can be obtained from many sources, including
1179           network monitoring, incident reports, incident response teams, user complaints, supply chain
1180           partners, audit monitoring, physical access monitoring, and user and administrator reports. 3.6.1
1181           provides information on the types of incidents that are appropriate for monitoring. The types of
1182           incidents reported, the content and timeliness of the reports, and the reporting authorities reflect
1183           applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines.
1184           Incident information informs risk assessments, the effectiveness of security assessments, the
1185           security requirements for acquisitions, and the selection criteria for technology products. Incident
1186           response support resources provided by organizations include help desks, assistance groups,
1187           automated ticketing systems to open and track incident response tickets, and access to forensic
1188           services or consumer redress services, when required.

1192   3.6.3. Incident Response Testing
1193           REQUIREMENT: 03.06.03
1194           Test the effectiveness of the incident response capability periodically.

1195           DISCUSSION
1196           Organizations test incident response capabilities to determine their effectiveness and identify
1197           potential weaknesses or deficiencies. Incident response testing includes the use of checklists,
1198           walk-through or tabletop exercises, and simulations. Incident response testing can include a

1205   3.6.4. Incident Response Training
1206           REQUIREMENT: 03.06.04
1207           a. Provide incident response training to system users consistent with assigned roles and
1208              responsibilities:
1209               1. Within [Assignment: organization-defined time period] of assuming an incident response
1210                  role or responsibility or acquiring system access;
1211               2. When required by system changes; and
1212               3. Periodically thereafter.
1213           b. Review and update incident response training content periodically and following [Assignment:
1214              organization-defined events].

1215           DISCUSSION
1216           Incident response training is associated with the assigned roles and responsibilities of
1217           organizational personnel to ensure that the appropriate content and level of detail are included in
1218           such training. For example, users may only need to know whom to call or how to recognize an
1219           incident; system administrators may require additional training on how to handle incidents; and
1220           incident responders may receive specific training on forensics, data collection techniques,
1221           reporting, system recovery, and system restoration. Incident response training includes user
1222           training in identifying and reporting suspicious activities from external and internal sources.
1223           Incident response training for users may be provided as part of 03.02.02. Events that may
1224           precipitate an update to incident response training content include incident response plan testing,
1225           response to an actual incident, audit or assessment findings, or changes in applicable laws,
1226           Executive Orders, policies, directives, regulations, standards, and guidelines.

1238           REQUIREMENT: 03.07.04
1239           a. Approve, control, and monitor the use of system maintenance tools.
1240           b. Inspect the maintenance tools for improper or unauthorized modifications.
1241           c.   Check media containing diagnostic and test programs for malicious code before the media
1242                are used in the system.
1243           d. Prevent the removal of system maintenance equipment containing CUI by:
1244                1. Verifying that there is no CUI on the equipment;
1245                2. Sanitizing or destroying the equipment; or
1246                3. Retaining the equipment within the facility.

1247           DISCUSSION
1248           Approving, controlling, monitoring, and reviewing maintenance tools address security-related
1249           issues associated with the tools that are used for diagnostic and repair actions on the system.
1250           Maintenance tools can include hardware and software diagnostic and test equipment as well as
1251           packet sniffers. The tools may be pre-installed, brought in with maintenance personnel on media,
1252           cloud-based, or downloaded from a website. Diagnostic and test programs are potential vehicles
1253           for transporting malicious code into the system, either intentionally or unintentionally. Examples
1254           of media inspection include checking the cryptographic hash or digital signatures of diagnostic
1255           and test programs and/or media. If organizations inspect media that contain diagnostic and test
1256           programs and determine that the media also contains malicious code, the incident is handled
1257           consistent with incident handling policies and procedures. A periodic review of maintenance tools
1258           can result in the withdrawal of approval for outdated, unsupported, irrelevant, or no-longer-used
1259           tools. Maintenance tools do not address the hardware and software components that support
1260           maintenance and are considered a part of the system (including software implementing utilities
1261           such as “ping,” “ls,” “ipconfig,” or hardware and software that implement the monitoring port of
1262           an Ethernet switch).

1272           DISCUSSION
1273           Nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic activities are conducted by individuals who communicate
1274           through an external or internal network. Local maintenance and diagnostic activities are carried
1275           out by individuals who are physically present at the system location and not communicating
1276           across a network connection. Authentication techniques used to establish nonlocal maintenance
1277           and diagnostic sessions reflect the requirements in 03.05.01.

1284           b. Maintain a list of authorized maintenance organizations or personnel.
1285           c.   Verify that non-escorted personnel who perform maintenance on the system possess the
1286                required access authorizations.
1287           d. Designate organizational personnel with required access authorizations and technical
1288              competence to supervise the maintenance activities of personnel who do not possess the
1289              required access authorizations.

1290           DISCUSSION
1291           Maintenance personnel refers to individuals who perform hardware or software maintenance on
1292           the system, while 03.10.01 addresses physical access for individuals whose maintenance duties
1293           place them within the physical protection perimeter of the system. The technical competence of
1294           supervising individuals relates to the maintenance performed on the system, while having
1295           required access authorizations refers to maintenance on and near the system. Individuals who
1296           have not been previously identified as authorized maintenance personnel (e.g., manufacturers,
1297           consultants, systems integrators, and vendors) may require privileged access to the system, such
1298           as when they are required to conduct maintenance with little or no notice. Organizations may
1299           choose to issue temporary credentials to these individuals based on their risk assessments.
1300           Temporary credentials may be for one-time use or for very limited time periods.

1309           DISCUSSION
1310           System media includes digital and non-digital media. Digital media includes diskettes, flash
1311           drives, magnetic tapes, external or removable solid state or magnetic drives, compact discs, and
1312           digital versatile discs. Non-digital media includes paper and microfilm. Physically controlling
1313           stored media includes conducting inventories, establishing procedures to allow individuals to
1314           check out and return media to libraries, and maintaining accountability for stored media. Secure
1315           storage includes a locked drawer, desk, or cabinet or a controlled media library. Controlled areas
1316           provide physical and procedural controls to meet the requirements established for protecting
1317           information and systems. Sanitization techniques (e.g., cryptographically erasing, destroying,
1318           clearing, and purging) prevent the disclosure of CUI to unauthorized individuals. The sanitization
1319           process removes CUI from media such that the information cannot be retrieved or reconstructed.

1336           Sanitize system media containing CUI prior to disposal, release out of organizational control, or
1337           release for reuse.

1338           DISCUSSION
1339           Media sanitization applies to digital and non-digital media subject to disposal or reuse, whether or
1340           not the media is considered removable. Examples include digital media in scanners, copiers,
1341           printers, notebook computers, workstations, mobile devices, network components, and non-digital
1342           media. The sanitization process removes CUI from media such that the information cannot be
1343           retrieved or reconstructed. Sanitization techniques (e.g., cryptographically erasing, clearing,
1344           purging, and destroying) prevent the disclosure of CUI to unauthorized individuals when such
1345           media is reused or released for disposal. NARA policies control the sanitization process for media
1346           containing CUI and may require destruction when other methods cannot be applied to the media.

1368              areas.

1369           DISCUSSION
1370           System media includes digital and non-digital media. Digital media includes flash drives,
1371           diskettes, magnetic tapes, external or removable solid state or magnetic drives, compact discs,
1372           and digital versatile discs. Non-digital media includes microfilm and paper. Controlled areas are
1373           spaces for which organizations provide physical or procedural measures to meet the requirements
1374           established for protecting information and systems. Media protection during transport can include
1375           cryptography and/or locked containers. Cryptographic mechanisms can provide confidentiality
1376           protections, depending on the mechanisms implemented. Activities associated with media
1377           transport include releasing media for transport, ensuring that media enters the appropriate
1378           transport processes, and the actual transport. Authorized transport and courier personnel may
1379           include individuals external to the organization. Maintaining accountability of media during
1380           transport includes restricting transport activities to authorized personnel and tracking or obtaining
1381           records of transport activities as the media moves through the transportation system to prevent
1382           and detect loss, destruction, or tampering. This requirement is related to 03.13.11.

1388   3.8.7. Media Use
1389           REQUIREMENT: 03.08.07
1390           a. Restrict or prohibit the use of [Assignment: organization-defined types of system media].
1391           b. Prohibit the use of removable system media without an identifiable owner.

1392           DISCUSSION
1393           In contrast to requirement 03.08.01, which restricts user access to media, this requirement
1394           restricts the use of certain types of media, such as restricting or prohibiting the use of external
1395           hard drives, flash drives, or smart displays. This requirement also includes any potential
1396           restrictions on the use of removable system media in external systems. Organizations can use
1397           technical and non-technical measures (e.g., policies, procedures, and rules of behavior) to control
1398           the use of system media. For example, organizations may control the use of portable storage
1399           devices by using physical cages on workstations to prohibit access to external ports or disabling
1400           or removing the ability to insert, read, or write to devices.
1401           Organizations may limit the use of portable storage devices to only approved devices, including
1402           devices provided by the organization, devices provided by other approved organizations, and
1403           devices that are not personally owned. Organizations may also control the use of portable storage
1404           devices based on the type of device — prohibiting the use of writeable, portable devices — and
1405           implement this restriction by disabling or removing the capability to write to such devices. Limits
1406           on the use of organization-controlled system media in external systems include restrictions on
1407           how the media may be used and under what conditions. Requiring identifiable owners (e.g.,
1408           individuals, organizations, or projects) for removable system media reduces the risk of using such
1409           technologies by allowing organizations to assign responsibility and accountability for addressing
1410           known vulnerabilities in the media (e.g., insertion of malicious code).

1417           REQUIREMENT: 03.08.09
1418           Implement cryptographic mechanisms to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of CUI at backup
1419           storage locations.

1420           DISCUSSION
1421           Backup storage locations may include system-level information and user-level information.
1422           System-level information includes system state information, operating system software,

1423           application software, and licenses. User-level information includes information other than
1424           system-level information. Hardware-enabled security technologies (e.g., hardware security
1425           modules [HSM]) can be used to enhance cryptographic protection for backup information. HSM
1426           devices safeguard and manage cryptographic keys and provide cryptographic processing.
1427           Cryptographic operations (e.g., encryption, decryption, and signature generation/verification) are
1428           typically hosted on the HSM device, and many implementations provide hardware-accelerated
1429           mechanisms for cryptographic operations. This requirement is related to 03.13.11.

1434   3.9.1. Personnel Screening
1435           REQUIREMENT: 03.09.01
1436           a. Screen individuals prior to authorizing access to the system.
1437           b. Rescreen individuals in accordance with [Assignment: organization-defined conditions
1438              requiring rescreening].

1439           DISCUSSION
1440           Personnel security screening activities involve the assessment of an individual’s conduct,
1441           integrity, judgment, loyalty, reliability, and stability (i.e., the individual’s trustworthiness) prior to
1442           authorizing access to the system or when elevating system access. The screening and rescreening
1443           activities reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, and
1444           criteria established for the level of access required for the assigned position.

1450           a. When individual employment is terminated:
1451               1. Disable system access within [Assignment: organization-defined time period];
1452               2. Terminate or revoke authenticators and credentials associated with the individual; and
1453               3. Retrieve security-related system property.
1454           b. When individuals are reassigned or transferred to other positions in the organization:
1455               1. Review and confirm the ongoing operational need for current logical and physical access
1456                  authorizations to the system and facility;
1457               2. Initiate [Assignment: organization-defined transfer or reassignment actions] within
1458                  [Assignment: organization-defined time period following the transfer or reassignment
1459                  action]; and



                                                              40

1460                  3. Modify access authorization to correspond with any changes in operational need.

1461           DISCUSSION
1462           Security-related system property includes hardware authentication tokens, system administration
1463           technical manuals, keys, identification cards, and building passes. Exit interviews ensure that
1464           terminated individuals understand the security constraints imposed by being former employees
1465           and that accountability is achieved for the organizational property. Security topics at exit
1466           interviews include reminding individuals of potential limitations on future employment and
1467           nondisclosure agreements. Exit interviews may not always be possible for some individuals,
1468           including in cases related to the unavailability of supervisors, illnesses, or job abandonment.
1469           The timely execution of termination actions is essential for individuals who have been terminated
1470           for cause. Organizations may consider disabling the accounts of individuals who are being
1471           terminated prior to the individuals being notified. This requirement applies to the reassignment or
1472           transfer of individuals when the personnel action is permanent or of such extended duration as to
1473           require protection. Protections that may be required for transfers or reassignments to other
1474           positions within organizations include returning old and issuing new identification cards, keys,
1475           and building passes; changing system access authorizations (i.e., privileges); closing system
1476           accounts and establishing new accounts; and providing access to official records to which
1477           individuals had access at previous work locations in previous system accounts.

1482   3.10.1. Physical Access Authorizations
1483             REQUIREMENT: 03.10.01
1484             a. Develop, approve, and maintain a list of individuals with authorized access to the physical
1485                location where the system resides.
1486             b. Issue authorization credentials for physical access.

1488             d. Remove individuals from the physical access list when access is no longer required.

1489             DISCUSSION
1490             A facility can include one or more physical locations containing systems or system components
1491             that process, store, or transmit CUI. Physical access authorizations apply to employees and
1492             visitors. Individuals with permanent physical access authorization credentials are not considered
1493             visitors. Authorization credentials include identification badges, identification cards, and smart
1494             cards. Organizations determine the strength of the authorization credentials consistent with
1495             applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines.
1496             Physical access authorizations may not be necessary to access certain areas within facilities that
1497             are designated as publicly accessible.

1503             a. Monitor physical access to the location where the system resides to detect and respond to
1504                physical security incidents.
1505             b. Review physical access logs periodically.

1506             DISCUSSION
1507             A facility can include one or more physical locations containing systems or system components
1508             that process, store, or transmit CUI. Physical access monitoring includes publicly accessible
1509             areas within organizational facilities. Examples of physical access monitoring include the
1510             employment of guards, video surveillance equipment (i.e., cameras), and sensor devices.
1511             Reviewing physical access logs can help identify suspicious activity, anomalous events, or
1512             potential threats. The reviews can be supported by audit logging controls if the access logs are
1513             part of an automated system. Incident response capabilities include investigations of physical
1514             security incidents and responses to those incidents. Incidents include security violations or
1515             suspicious physical access activities, such as access outside of normal work hours, repeated
1516             access to areas not normally accessed, access for unusual lengths of time, and out-of-sequence
1517             access.

1532             DISCUSSION
1533             Alternate work sites include the private residences of employees or other facilities designated
1534             by the organization. Alternate work sites can provide readily available alternate locations during
1535             contingency operations. Organizations can define different security requirements for specific
1536             alternate work sites or types of sites, depending on the work-related activities conducted at the
1537             sites. Assessing the effectiveness of the requirements and providing a means to communicate
1538             incidents at alternate work sites supports the contingency planning activities of organizations.

1545                  1. Verifying individual physical access authorizations before granting access; and
1546                  2. Controlling ingress and egress with physical access control systems/devices or guards.
1547             b. Maintain physical access audit logs for entry or exit points.
1548             c.   Escort visitors and control visitor activity [Assignment: organization-defined circumstances
1549                  requiring visitor escorts and control of visitor activity].
1550             d. Secure keys, combinations, and other physical access devices.

1551             DISCUSSION
1552             This requirement addresses physical locations containing systems or system components that
1553             process, store, or transmit CUI. Organizations determine the types of guards needed, including
1554             professional security staff or administrative staff. Physical access devices include keys, locks,
1555             combinations, biometric readers, and card readers. Physical access control systems comply with
1556             applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines.
1557             Organizations have flexibility in the types of audit logs employed. Audit logs can be procedural,
1558             automated, or some combination thereof. Physical access points can include exterior access
1559             points, interior access points to systems that require supplemental access controls, or both.
1560             Physical access control applies to employees and visitors. Individuals with permanent physical
1561             access authorizations are not considered visitors.

1571             DISCUSSION
1572             Safeguarding measures applied to system distribution and transmission lines prevent accidental
1573             damage, disruption, and physical tampering. Such measures may also be necessary to prevent
1574             eavesdropping or the modification of unencrypted transmissions. Safeguarding measures used
1575             to control physical access to system distribution and transmission lines include disconnected or
1576             locked spare jacks, locked wiring closets, protecting cabling with conduit or cable trays, and
1577             wiretapping sensors. Controlling physical access to output devices includes placing output
1578             devices in locked rooms or other secured areas with keypad or card reader access controls and
1579             allowing access to authorized individuals only, placing output devices in locations that can be
1580             monitored by personnel, installing monitor or screen filters, and using headphones. Examples of
1581             output devices include monitors, printers, scanners, audio devices, facsimile machines, and
1582             copiers.

1586           Risk Assessment

1587   3.11.1. Risk Assessment
1588             REQUIREMENT: 03.11.01
1589             a. Assess the risk (including supply chain risk) of unauthorized disclosure resulting from the
1590                processing, storage, or transmission of CUI.
1591             b. Update risk assessments periodically.

1592             DISCUSSION
1593             Establishing the system boundary is a prerequisite to assessing the risk of unauthorized
1594             disclosure of CUI. Risk assessments consider threats, vulnerabilities, likelihood, and adverse
1595             impacts to organizational operations and assets based on the operation and use of the system
1596             and the unauthorized disclosure of CUI. Risk assessments also consider risks from external
1597             parties (e.g., service providers, contractors operating systems on behalf of the organization,
1598             individuals accessing systems, outsourcing entities). Risk assessments can be conducted at the
1599             organization level, the mission or business process level, or the system level and at any phase in
1600             the system development life cycle. Risk assessments include supply chain-related risks
1601             associated with suppliers or contractors and the system, system component, or system service
1602             that they provide.

1611             c.   Update system vulnerabilities to be scanned periodically and when new vulnerabilities are
1612                  identified and reported.

1613             DISCUSSION
1614             Organizations determine the required vulnerability scanning for system components and ensure
1615             that potential sources of vulnerabilities (e.g., networked printers, scanners, and copiers) are not
1616             overlooked. Vulnerability analyses for custom software may require additional approaches, such
1617             as static analysis, dynamic analysis, or binary analysis. Organizations can use these approaches
1618             in source code reviews and tools (e.g., static analysis tools, web-based application scanners,
1619             binary analyzers). Vulnerability scanning includes scanning for patch levels; scanning for
1620             functions, ports, protocols, and services that should not be accessible to users or devices; and
1621             scanning for improperly configured or incorrectly operating flow control mechanisms.
1622             To facilitate interoperability, organizations consider using products that are Security Content
1623             Automated Protocol (SCAP)-validated and that employ the Extensible Configuration Checklist
1624             Description Format (XCCDF). Organizations also consider using scanning tools that express
1625             vulnerabilities in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming convention and
1626             that employ the Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL). Sources for vulnerability
1627             information also include the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) listing, the National
1628             Vulnerability Database (NVD), and the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS).

1635           Security Assessment and Monitoring

1636   3.12.1. Security Assessment
1637             REQUIREMENT: 03.12.01
1638             Assess the security requirements for the system and its environment of operation periodically to
1639             determine if the requirements have been satisfied.

1640             DISCUSSION
1641             By assessing the security requirements, organizations determine whether the necessary
1642             safeguards and countermeasures are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and
1643             producing the desired outcome. Security assessments identify weaknesses and deficiencies in
1644             the system and provide the essential information needed to make risk-based decisions. Security
1645             assessment reports document assessment results in sufficient detail as deemed necessary by the
1646             organization to determine the accuracy and completeness of the reports. Security assessment
1647             results are provided to the individuals or roles appropriate for the types of assessments being
1648             conducted.

1652   3.12.2. Plan of Action and Milestones
1653             REQUIREMENT: 03.12.02
1654             a. Develop a plan of action and milestones for the system:
1655                 1. To document the planned remediation actions to correct weaknesses or deficiencies
1656                    noted during security assessments; and
1657                 2. To reduce or eliminate known system vulnerabilities.
1658             b. Update the existing plan of action and milestones periodically based on the findings from
1659                security assessments, independent audits or reviews, and continuous monitoring activities.

1660             DISCUSSION
1661             Plans of action and milestones (POAMs) are important documents in organizational security
1662             programs. Organizations use POAMs to describe how unsatisfied security requirements will be
1663             met and how planned mitigations will be implemented. Organizations can document system
1664             security plans and POAMs as separate or combined documents and in any format. Federal
1665             agencies may consider system security plans and POAMs as inputs to risk-based decisions on
1666             whether to process, store, or transmit CUI on a system hosted by a nonfederal organization.

1670   3.12.3. Continuous Monitoring
1671             REQUIREMENT: 03.12.03
1672             Develop and implement a system-level continuous monitoring strategy that includes ongoing
1673             monitoring and security assessments.

1674             DISCUSSION
1675             Continuous monitoring at the system level facilitates ongoing awareness of the system security
1676             posture to support risk management decisions. The terms continuous and ongoing imply that
1677             organizations assess and monitor their systems at a frequency that is sufficient to support risk-
1678             based decisions. Different types of security requirements may require different monitoring
1679             frequencies.

1687             REQUIREMENT: 03.12.05
1688             a. Approve and manage the exchange of CUI between the system and other systems using
1689                [Selection (one or more): interconnection security agreements; information exchange
1690                security agreements; memoranda of understanding or agreement; service level
1691                agreements; user agreements; nondisclosure agreements].
1692             b. Document, as part of the exchange agreements, interface characteristics, security
1693                requirements, and responsibilities for each system.
1694             c.   Review and update the exchange agreements periodically.

1695             DISCUSSION
1696             The types of agreements selected are based on factors such as the relationship between the
1697             organizations exchanging information (e.g., government to government, government to
1698             business, business to business, government or business to service provider, government or
1699             business to individual) and the level of access to the organizational system by users of the other
1700             system. Types of agreements can include interconnection security agreements, information
1701             exchange security agreements, memoranda of understanding or agreement, service-level
1702             agreements, or other types of agreements. Organizations may incorporate agreement
1703             information into formal contracts, especially for information exchanges established between
1704             federal agencies and nonfederal organizations (e.g., service providers, contractors, system
1705             developers, and system integrators). Examples of the types of information contained in
1706             exchange agreements include the interface characteristics, security requirements, controls, and
1707             responsibilities for each system.

1714             a. Monitor and control communications at the external managed interfaces to the system and
1715                at key internal managed interfaces within the system.
1716             b. Implement subnetworks for publicly accessible system components that are physically or

1720             DISCUSSION
1721             Managed interfaces include gateways, routers, firewalls, network-based malicious code
1722             analysis, virtualization systems, and encrypted tunnels implemented within a security
1723             architecture. Subnetworks that are either physically or logically separated from internal
1724             networks are referred to as demilitarized zones or DMZs. Restricting or prohibiting interfaces
1725             within organizational systems includes restricting external web traffic to designated web servers
1726             within managed interfaces, prohibiting external traffic that appears to be spoofing internal
1727             addresses, and prohibiting internal traffic that appears to be spoofing external addresses.

1736   3.13.4. Information in Shared System Resources
1737             REQUIREMENT: 03.13.04
1738             Prevent unauthorized and unintended information transfer via shared system resources.

1739             DISCUSSION
1740             Preventing unauthorized and unintended information transfer via shared system resources stops
1741             information produced by the actions of prior users or roles (or actions of processes acting on
1742             behalf of prior users or roles) from being available to current users or roles (or current processes
1743             acting on behalf of current users or roles) that obtain access to shared system resources after
1744             those resources have been released back to the system. Information in shared system resources
1745             also applies to encrypted representations of information. In other contexts, the control of
1746             information in shared system resources is referred to as object reuse and residual information
1747             protection. Information in shared system resources does not address information remanence,
1748             which refers to the residual representation of data that has been nominally deleted, covert
1749             channels (including storage and timing channels) in which shared system resources are
1750             manipulated to violate information flow restrictions, or components within systems for which
1751             there are only single users or roles.

1757   3.13.6. Network Communications – Deny by Default – Allow by Exception
1758             REQUIREMENT: 03.13.06
1759             Deny network communications traffic by default and allow network communications traffic by
1760             exception.

1761             DISCUSSION
1762             This requirement applies to inbound and outbound network communications traffic at the
1763             system boundary and at identified points within the system. A deny-all, allow-by-exception
1764             network communications traffic policy ensures that only essential and approved connections are
1765             allowed.

1771   3.13.8. Transmission and Storage Confidentiality
1772             REQUIREMENT: 03.13.08
1773             Implement cryptographic mechanisms to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of CUI during
1774             transmission and while in storage.

1775             DISCUSSION
1776             This requirement applies to internal and external networks and any system components that can
1777             transmit CUI, including servers, notebook computers, desktop computers, mobile devices,
1778             printers, copiers, scanners, facsimile machines, and radios. Unprotected communication paths
1779             are susceptible to interception and modification. Encryption protects CUI from unauthorized
1780             disclosure during transmission and while in storage. Cryptographic mechanisms that protect the
1781             confidentiality of CUI during transmission include TLS and IPsec. Information in storage (i.e.,
1782             information at rest) refers to the state of CUI when it is not in process or in transit and resides
1783             on internal or external storage devices, storage area network devices, and databases. Protecting
1784             CUI in storage does not focus on the type of storage device or the frequency of access to that
1785             device but rather on the state of the information. This requirement relates to 03.13.11.

1848              a. Define acceptable mobile code and mobile code technologies.
1849              b. Authorize, monitor, and control the use of mobile code.

1850              DISCUSSION
1851              Mobile code includes software programs or parts of programs obtained from remote systems,
1852              transmitted across a network, and executed on a local system without explicit installation or
1853              execution by the recipient. Decisions regarding the use of mobile code within the system are
1854              based on the potential for the code to cause damage to the system if used maliciously. Mobile
1855              code technologies include Java applets, JavaScript, HTML5, VBScript, and WebGL. Usage
1856              restrictions and implementation guidelines apply to the selection and use of mobile code
1857              installed on servers and mobile code downloaded and executed on individual workstations and
1858              devices, including notebook computers, smart phones, and smart devices. Mobile code policy
1859              and procedures address the actions taken to prevent the development, acquisition, and use of
1860              unacceptable mobile code within the system, including requiring mobile code to be digitally
1861              signed by a trusted source.

1868              REQUIREMENT: 03.13.15
1869              Protect the authenticity of communications sessions.

1870              DISCUSSION
1871              Protecting session authenticity addresses communications protection at the session level, not
1872              at the packet level. Such protection establishes grounds for confidence at both ends of the
1873              communications sessions in the ongoing identities of other parties and the validity of the
1874              transmitted information. Authenticity protection includes protecting against “adversary-in-the-
1875              middle” attacks, session hijacking, and the insertion of false information into sessions.

1883             REQUIREMENT: 03.14.01
1884             a. Identify, report, and correct system flaws.
1885             b. Install security-relevant software and firmware updates within [Assignment: organization-
1886                defined time period] of the release of the updates.

1887             DISCUSSION
1888             Organizations identify systems that are affected by announced software and firmware flaws,
1889             including potential vulnerabilities that result from those flaws, and report this information to
1890             designated personnel with information security responsibilities. Security-relevant updates
1891             include patches, service packs, hot fixes, and anti-virus signatures. Organizations address the
1892             flaws discovered during security assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response
1893             activities, and system error handling. Organizations can take advantage of available resources,
1894             such as the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) or Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
1895             (CVE) databases, in remediating the flaws discovered in organizational systems. Organization-
1896             defined time periods for updating security-relevant software and firmware may vary based on a
1897             variety of factors, including the criticality of the update (i.e., severity of the vulnerability related
1898             to the discovered flaw). Some types of flaw remediation may require more testing than other
1899             types of remediation.

1903   3.14.2. Malicious Code Protection
1904             REQUIREMENT: 03.14.02
1905             a. Implement malicious code protection mechanisms at designated locations within the system
1906                to detect and eradicate malicious code.
1907             b. Update malicious code protection mechanisms as new releases are available in accordance
1908                with configuration management policy and procedures.
1909             c.   Configure malicious code protection mechanisms to:
1910                  1. Perform scans of the system [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and real-
1911                     time scans of files from external sources at endpoints or network entry and exit points
1912                     as the files are downloaded, opened, or executed; and
1913                  2. Block malicious code, quarantine malicious code, or take other actions in response to
1914                     malicious code detection.

1915             DISCUSSION
1916             Malicious code insertions occur through the exploitation of system vulnerabilities. Periodic
1917             scans of the system and real-time scans of files from external sources as files are downloaded,
1918             opened, or executed can detect malicious code. Malicious code can be inserted into the system
1919             in many ways, including by email, the Internet, and portable storage devices. Malicious code
1920             includes viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and spyware. Malicious code can be encoded in various
1921             formats, contained in compressed or hidden files, or hidden in files using techniques such as
1922             steganography. In addition to the above technologies, pervasive configuration management,
1923             comprehensive software integrity controls, and anti-exploitation software may be effective in
1924             preventing the execution of unauthorized code. Malicious code may be present in commercial
1925             off-the-shelf software and custom-built software and could include logic bombs, backdoors, and
1926             other types of attacks that could affect organizational mission and business functions.
1927             If malicious code cannot be detected by detection methods or technologies, organizations can
1928             rely on secure coding practices, configuration management and control, trusted procurement
1929             processes, and monitoring practices to help ensure that the software only performs intended
1930             functions. Organizations may determine that different actions are warranted in response to the
1931             detection of malicious code. For example, organizations can define actions to be taken in
1932             response to malicious code detection during scans, the detection of malicious downloads, or the
1933             detection of maliciousness when attempting to open or execute files.

       November 2023

1944             DISCUSSION
1945             There are many publicly available sources of system security alerts and advisories. For
1946             example, the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security
1947             Agency (CISA), the National Security Agency (NSA), and the Federal Bureau of Investigation
1948             (FBI) generate security alerts and advisories to maintain situational awareness across the
1949             Federal Government and in nonfederal organizations. Software vendors, subscription services,
1950             and industry Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) may also provide security
1951             alerts and advisories. Compliance with security directives is essential due to the critical nature
1952             of many of these directives and the potential immediate adverse effects on organizational
1953             operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation should the directives not
1954             be implemented in a timely manner.

1963             REQUIREMENT: 03.14.06
1964             a. Monitor the system to detect:
1965                  1. Attacks and indicators of potential attacks; and
1966                  2. Unauthorized connections.
1967             b. Identify unauthorized use of the system.
1968             c.   Monitor inbound and outbound communications traffic to detect unusual or unauthorized
1969                  activities or conditions.

1970             DISCUSSION
1971             System monitoring involves external and internal monitoring. External monitoring includes the
1972             observation of events that occur at the system boundary. Internal monitoring includes the
1973             observation of events that occur within the system. Organizations can monitor the system, for
1974             example, by observing audit record activities in real time or by observing other system aspects,
1975             such as access patterns, characteristics of access, and other actions. The monitoring objectives
1976             may guide determination of the events.
1977             A system monitoring capability is achieved through a variety of tools and techniques (e.g., audit
1978             record monitoring software, intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems,
1979             malicious code protection software, scanning tools, network monitoring software). Strategic
1980             locations for monitoring devices include selected perimeter locations and near server farms that
1981             support critical applications with such devices being employed at managed system interfaces.

       November 2023

1982             The granularity of monitoring the information collected is based on organizational monitoring
1983             objectives and the capability of the system to support such objectives.
1984             Systems connections can be network, remote, or local. A network connection is any connection
1985             with a device that communicates through a network (e.g., local area network, the internet). A
1986             remote connection is any connection with a device that communicates through an external
1987             network (e.g., the internet). Network, remote, and local connections can be either wired or
1988             wireless.
1989             Unusual or unauthorized activities or conditions related to inbound and outbound
1990             communications traffic include internal traffic that indicates the presence of malicious code in
1991             the system or propagating among system components, the unauthorized export of information,
1992             or signaling to external systems. Evidence of malicious code is used to identify a potentially
1993             compromised system. System monitoring requirements, including the need for types of system
1994             monitoring, may be referenced in other requirements.

2003             Manage and retain CUI within the system and CUI output from the system in accordance with
2004             applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, guidelines, and
2005             operational requirements.

2006             DISCUSSION
2007             Federal agencies consider data retention requirements for nonfederal organizations. Retaining
2008             CUI on nonfederal systems after contracts or agreements have concluded increases the attack
2009             surface for those systems and the risk of the information being compromised. NARA provides
2010             federal policy and guidance on records retention and schedules.

2021             This requirement addresses policies and procedures for the protection of CUI. Policies and
2022             procedures contribute to security assurance and should address each family of the CUI security
2023             requirements. Policies can be included as part of the generalized organizational security policy
2024             or be represented by separate policies that address each family of requirements. Procedures
2025             describe how policies are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the
2026             object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security plans or in one or
2027             more separate documents.

2032   3.15.2. System Security Plan
2033             REQUIREMENT: 03.15.02
2034             a. Develop a system security plan that:
2035                  1. Defines the constituent system components;
2036                  2. Describes the system operating environment;
2037                  3. Describes specific threats to the system that are of concern to the organization;
2038                  4. Provides an overview of the security requirements for the system;
2039                  5. Identifies connections to other systems;
2040                  6. Identifies individuals that fulfill system roles and responsibilities; and
2041                  7. Includes other relevant information necessary for the protection of CUI.
2042             b. Review and update the system security plan periodically.
2043             c.   Protect the system security plan from unauthorized disclosure.

2044             DISCUSSION
2045             System security plans provide key characteristics of the system that is processing, storing, and
2046             transmitting CUI and how the system and information are protected. System security plans
2047             contain sufficient information to enable a design and implementation that is unambiguously
2048             compliant with the intent of the plans and the subsequent determinations of risk if the plan is
2049             implemented as intended. System security plans can be a collection of documents, including
2050             documents that already exist. Effective system security plans make use of references to policies,
2051             procedures, and additional documents (e.g., design specifications) where detailed information
2052             can be obtained. This reduces the documentation requirements associated with security
2053             programs and maintains security information in other established management or operational
2054             areas related to enterprise architecture, the system development life cycle, systems engineering,
2055             and acquisition.

2061             a. Establish and provide to individuals requiring access to the system, rules that describe their
2062                responsibilities and expected behavior for handling CUI and system usage.
2063             b. Receive a documented acknowledgement from individuals indicating that they have read,
2064                understand, and agree to abide by the rules of behavior before authorizing access to CUI
2065                and the system.
2066             c.   Review and update the rules of behavior periodically.

2067             DISCUSSION
2068             Rules of behavior represent a type of access agreement for system users. Organizations consider
2069             rules of behavior for the handling of CUI based on individual user roles and responsibilities and
2070             differentiate between rules that apply to privileged users and rules that apply to general users.

2079             security requirements].

2080             DISCUSSION
2081             Security requirements include security functional and security assurance requirements. Security
2082             functional requirements are typically derived from mission or business requirements as well as
2083             requirements stated in laws, regulations, policies, and standards. The derived requirements can
2084             include security capabilities, functions, and mechanisms. Assurance requirements can include
2085             development processes, procedures, methodologies, and the evidence from development and
2086             assessment activities that provide grounds for confidence that the required functionality is
2087             implemented and possesses the required strength of mechanism. Strength of mechanism
2088             requirements associated with such capabilities, functions, and mechanisms include degree of
2089             correctness, completeness, resistance to tampering or bypass, and resistance to direct attack.
2090             This requirement is related to 03.16.03 and 03.17.02.

2094   3.16.2. Unsupported System Components
2095             REQUIREMENT: 03.16.02
2096             a. Replace system components when support for the components is no longer available from
2097                the developer, vendor, or manufacturer.
2098             b. Provide options for risk mitigation or alternative sources for continued support for
2099                unsupported components if components cannot be replaced.

2100             DISCUSSION
2101             Support for system components includes software patches, firmware updates, replacement parts,
2102             and maintenance contracts. An example of unsupported components includes when vendors no
2103             longer provide critical software patches or product updates, which can result in opportunities for
2104             adversaries to exploit weaknesses or deficiencies in the installed components. Exceptions to
2105             replacing unsupported system components include systems that provide critical mission or
2106             business capabilities when newer technologies are unavailable or when the systems are so
2107             isolated that installing replacement components is not an option.
2108             Alternative sources for support address the need to provide continued support for system
2109             components that are no longer supported by the original manufacturers, developers, or vendors
2110             when such components remain essential to organizational mission and business functions. If
2111             necessary, organizations can establish in-house support by developing customized patches for
2112             critical software components or obtain the services of external providers who provide ongoing
2113             support for the designated unsupported components through contractual relationships. Such
2114             contractual relationships can include open-source software value-added vendors. The increased
2115             risk of using unsupported system components can be mitigated, for example, by prohibiting the
2116             connection of such components to public or uncontrolled networks or implementing other forms
2117             of isolation.

2121   3.16.3. External System Services
2122             REQUIREMENT: 03.16.03
2123             a. Require the providers of external system services used for the processing, storage, or
2124                transmission of CUI, to comply with the following security requirements: [Assignment:
2125                organization-defined security requirements].
2126             b. Define and document user roles and responsibilities with regard to external system services
2127                including shared responsibilities with external providers.
2128             c.   Implement processes, methods, and techniques to monitor security requirement compliance
2129                  by external service providers on an ongoing basis.

2130             DISCUSSION
2131             External system services are provided by external service providers. Organizations establish
2132             relationships with external service providers in a variety of ways, including through business
2133             partnerships, contracts, interagency agreements, lines of business arrangements, licensing
2134             agreements, joint ventures, and supply chain exchanges. The responsibility for managing risks
2135             from the use of external system services remains with the organization charged with protecting


                                                            58

2136             CUI. Service-level agreements define the expectations of performance, describe measurable
2137             outcomes, and identify remedies, mitigations, and response requirements for instances of
2138             noncompliance. Information from external service providers regarding the specific functions,
2139             ports, protocols, and services used in the provision of such services can be useful when there is
2140             a need to understand the trade-offs involved in restricting certain functions and services or
2141             blocking certain ports and protocols. This requirement is related to 03.01.20.

2145           Supply Chain Risk Management

2146   3.17.1. Supply Chain Risk Management Plan
2147             REQUIREMENT: 03.17.01
2148             a. Develop a plan for managing supply chain risks associated with the research, development,
2149                design, manufacturing, acquisition, delivery, integration, operations, maintenance, and
2150                disposal of the system, system components, or system services.
2151             b. Review and update the supply chain risk management plan periodically.
2152             c.   Protect the supply chain risk management plan from unauthorized disclosure.

2153             DISCUSSION
2154             Dependence on the products, systems, and services from external providers and the nature of the
2155             relationships with those providers present an increasing level of risk to an organization. Threat
2156             actions that may increase security risks include unauthorized production; the insertion or use of
2157             counterfeits; tampering; theft; the insertion of malicious software, firmware, and hardware; and
2158             poor manufacturing and development practices in the supply chain. Supply chain risks can be
2159             endemic or systemic within a system, component, or service. Managing supply chain risks is a
2160             complex, multifaceted undertaking that requires a coordinated effort across an organization to
2161             build trust relationships and communicate with internal and external stakeholders.
2162             Supply chain risk management (SCRM) activities include identifying and assessing risks,
2163             determining appropriate risk response actions, developing SCRM plans to document response
2164             actions, and monitoring performance against the plans. The system-level SCRM plan is
2165             implementation-specific and provides policy implementation, requirements, constraints, and
2166             implications. It can either be stand-alone or incorporated into system security plans. The SCRM
2167             plan addresses the management, implementation, and monitoring of SCRM controls and the
2168             development or sustainment of systems across the system development life cycle to support
2169             mission and business functions. Because supply chains can differ significantly across and within
2170             organizations, SCRM plans are tailored to individual program, organizational, and operational
2171             contexts.

2175   3.17.2. Acquisition Strategies, Tools, and Methods
2176             REQUIREMENT: 03.17.02
2177             Develop and implement acquisition strategies, contract tools, and procurement methods to
2178             identify, protect against, and mitigate supply chain risks.

2179             DISCUSSION
2180             The acquisition process provides an important vehicle for protecting the supply chain. There are
2181             many useful tools and techniques available, including obscuring the end use of a system or
2182             system component, using blind or filtered buys, requiring tamper-evident packaging, or using
2183             trusted or controlled distribution. The results from a supply chain risk assessment can inform
2184             the strategies, tools, and methods that are most applicable to the situation. Tools and techniques
2185             may provide protections against unauthorized production, theft, tampering, the insertion of
2186             counterfeits, the insertion of malicious software or backdoors, and poor development practices
2187             throughout the system life cycle.
2188             Organizations also consider providing incentives for suppliers to implement controls, promote
2189             transparency in their processes and security practices, provide contract language that addresses
2190             the prohibition of tainted or counterfeit components, and restrict purchases from untrustworthy
2191             suppliers. Organizations consider providing training, education, and awareness programs for
2192             personnel regarding supply chain risk, available mitigation strategies, and when the programs
2193             should be employed. Methods for reviewing and protecting development plans, documentation,
2194             and evidence are commensurate with the security requirements of the organization. Contracts
2195             may specify documentation protection requirements.

2199   3.17.3. Supply Chain Requirements and Processes
2200             REQUIREMENT: 03.17.03
2201             a. Establish a process for identifying and addressing weaknesses or deficiencies in the supply
2202                chain elements and processes.
2203             b. Enforce the following security requirements to protect against supply chain risks to the
2204                system, system components, or system services and to limit the harm or consequences
2205                from supply chain-related events: [Assignment: organization-defined security requirements].

2206             DISCUSSION
2207             Supply chain elements include organizations, entities, or tools that are employed for the
2208             research, development, design, manufacturing, acquisition, delivery, integration, operations and
2209             maintenance, and disposal of systems and system components. Supply chain processes include
2210             hardware, software, firmware, and systems development processes; shipping and handling
2211             procedures; personnel and physical security programs; configuration management tools,
2212             techniques, and measures to maintain provenance; or other programs, processes, or procedures
2213             associated with the development, acquisition, maintenance, and disposal of systems and system
2214             components. Supply chain elements and processes may be provided by organizations, system
2215             integrators, or external providers. Weaknesses or deficiencies in supply chain elements or

2828   function of: (i) the adverse impact, or magnitude of harm, that would arise if the circumstance or event occurs; and
2829   (ii) the likelihood of occurrence. [13]

2830   risk assessment
2831   The process of identifying risks to organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, reputation),
2832   organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation, resulting from the operation of a system. [55]

2833   sanitization
2834   Actions taken to render data written on media unrecoverable by ordinary and — for some forms of sanitization —
2835   extraordinary means.
2836   A process to remove information from media such that data recovery is not possible, including the removal of all
2837   classified labels, markings, and activity logs.

2838   security
2839   A condition that results from the establishment and maintenance of protective measures that enable an organization
2840   to perform its mission or critical functions despite risks posed by threats to its use of systems. Protective measures
2841   may involve a combination of deterrence, avoidance, prevention, detection, recovery, and correction that should
2842   form part of the organization’s risk management approach. [78]

2843   security assessment
2844   See security control assessment.

2845   security control
2846   The safeguards or countermeasures prescribed for an information system or an organization to protect the
2847   confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system and its information. [13]

2848   security control assessment
2849   The testing or evaluation of security controls to determine the extent to which the controls are implemented
2850   correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security
2851   requirements for an information system or organization. [13]

2852   security domain
2853   A domain that implements a security policy and is administered by a single authority. Adapted from [78]

2854   security functions
2855   The hardware, software, or firmware of the system responsible for enforcing the system security policy and
2856   supporting the isolation of code and data on which the protection is based.

2857   security requirement
2858   A requirement levied on a system or an organization that is derived from applicable laws, Executive Orders,
2859   directives, regulations, policies, standards, procedures, or mission/business needs to ensure the confidentiality,
2860   integrity, and availability of information that is being processed, stored, or transmitted. Adapted from [7] and [8].

2861   split tunneling
2862   The process of allowing a remote user or device to establish a non-remote connection with a system and
2863   simultaneously communicate via some other connection to a resource in an external network. This method of
2864   network access enables a user to access remote devices (e.g., a networked printer) at the same time as accessing
2865   uncontrolled networks.

2866   system
2867   See information system.

2868   system component
2869   A discrete identifiable information technology asset that represents a building block of a system and may include
2870   hardware, software, and firmware. [41]

2871   system security plan
2872   A document that describes how an organization meets or plans to meet the security requirements for a system. In
2873   particular, the system security plan describes the system boundary, the environment in which the system operates,
2874   how the security requirements are implemented, and the relationships with or connections to other systems.

2883   Appendix C. Tailoring Criteria
2884   This appendix describes the security control tailoring criteria used to develop the CUI security
2885   requirements. Table 2 lists the available tailoring options and the shorthand tailoring symbols.
2886   Table 3 through Table 22 specify the tailoring actions applied to the controls in the NIST SP
2887   800-53 moderate baseline [12] to obtain the security requirements in Section 3. The controls and
2888   control enhancements are hyperlinked to the NIST Cybersecurity and Privacy Reference Tool,
2889   which provides online access to the specific control language and supplemental materials in
2890   NIST SP 800-53.

         The security controls in NIST SP 800-53 provide a comprehensive set of security capabilities needed to protect organizational systems that
       taken together, support the concept of defense-in-depth. As such, some of the security controls may address similar or overlapping security topics
       that are covered by other related controls. These controls have been designated as ORC in the tailoring criteria.

2932   Appendix D. Change Log
2933   This publication incorporates the following changes from the original edition (February 2020;
2934   updated January 28, 2021):
2935       •   Streamlined introductory information in Section 1 and Section 2 to improve clarity and
2936           understanding
2937       •   Modified the security requirements and families in Section 3 to reflect the security
2938           controls in the NIST SP 800-53B [12] moderate baseline and the tailoring actions in
2939           Appendix C
2940       •   Eliminated the distinction between basic and derived security requirements
2941       •   Increased the specificity of security requirements to remove ambiguity, improve the
2942           effectiveness of implementation, and clarify the scope of assessments
2943       •   Introduced organization-defined parameters (ODPs) in selected security requirements to
2944           increase flexibility and help organizations better manage risk
2945       •   Grouped security requirements, where possible, to improve understanding and the
2946           efficiency of implementations and assessments
2947       •   Removed outdated and redundant security requirements
2948       •   Added new security requirements
2949       •   Added titles to security requirements
2950       •   Restructured and streamlined the discussion sections for security requirements
2951       •   Introduced new tailoring categories: Other Related Controls (ORC) and Not Applicable
2952           (N/A)
2953       •   Recategorized selected controls in the NIST SP 800-53B moderate baseline (using the
2954           tailoring criteria in Appendix C)
2955       •   Revised the security requirements for consistency with the security control language in
2956           NIST SP 800-53
2957       •   Revised the structure of the References, Acronyms, and Glossary sections for greater
2958           clarity and ease of use
2959       •   Revised the tailoring tables in Appendix C for consistency with the changes to the
2960           security requirements
