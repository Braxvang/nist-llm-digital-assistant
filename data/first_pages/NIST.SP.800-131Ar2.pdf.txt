This publication has been developed by NIST in accordance with its statutory responsibilities under the
Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) of 2014, 44 U.S.C. § 3551 et seq., Public
Law (P.L.) 113-283. NIST is responsible for developing information security standards and guidelines,
including minimum requirements for federal information systems, but such standards and guidelines
shall not apply to national security systems without the express approval of appropriate federal officials
exercising policy authority over such systems. This guideline is consistent with the requirements of the
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130.

Nothing in this publication should be taken to contradict the standards and guidelines made mandatory
and binding on federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory authority. Nor should
these guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the Secretary of
Commerce, Director of the OMB, or any other federal official. This publication may be used by
nongovernmental organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright in the United States.
Attribution would, however, be appreciated by NIST.

  Certain commercial entities, equipment, or materials may be identified in this document in order to
  describe an experimental procedure or concept adequately. Such identification is not intended to imply
  recommendation or endorsement by NIST, nor is it intended to imply that the entities, materials, or
  equipment are necessarily the best available for the purpose.
  There may be references in this publication to other publications currently under development by NIST
  in accordance with its assigned statutory responsibilities. The information in this publication, including
  concepts and methodologies, may be used by federal agencies even before the completion of such
  companion publications. Thus, until each publication is completed, current requirements, guidelines, and
  procedures, where they exist, remain operative. For planning and transition purposes, federal agencies
  may wish to closely follow the development of these new publications by NIST.
