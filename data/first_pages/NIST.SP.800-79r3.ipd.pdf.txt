      NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                 Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
      December 2023                                                        and Derived PIV Credential Issuers



 90   Abstract
 91   The document provides appropriate and useful guidelines for assessing the reliability of issuers
 92   of PIV Cards and derived PIV credentials. These issuers store personal information and issue
 93   credentials based on OMB policies and the standards published in response to HSPD-12. The
 94   reliability of an issuer is of utmost importance when an organization (e.g., a federal agency) is
 95   required to trust identity credentials that were created and issued by another organization. This
 96   trust relies on having the necessary level of assurance that the reliability of the issuing
 97   organization has been established through a formal authorization process.

 98   Keywords
 99   assessment; authorization; compliance; derived PIV credentials; HSPD-12; issuer controls;
100   personal identity verification; PIV Card.

      NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                 Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
      December 2023                                                        and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

113   Note to Reviewers
114   NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd, Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card and Derived PIV
115   Credential Issuers, expands the set of issuer controls to include new and updated requirements
116   from FIPS 201-3, its supporting updated publications (e.g., SP 800-157r1, SP 800-76r2, etc.) and
117   newly-issued OMB Memoranda aimed at achieving compliance with federal requirements with
118   regard to identity proofing and the issuance of a common and reliable form of a primary and
119   derived identity credential.
120   NIST is specifically interested in comments on and recommendations for the following topics:
121       1. Are the new and updated controls for identity proofing and the issuance and maintenance
122          of PIV Cards and derived PIV credentials clear and practical to implement?
123       2. Is it easy to determine where the updated controls need to be implemented (i.e., at the
124          enterprise level, issuing facility level, or both)?
125       3. Are the new controls for derived PIV credentials sufficient to provide comparable
126          assurance for PIV Cards?
127   NIST requests that all comments be submitted by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Standard Time (EST) on
128   January 29, 2024. Please submit comments to piv_comments@nist.gov. NIST will review all
129   comments and make them available on the NIST Computer Security Resource Center (CSRC)
130   website. Commenters are encouraged to use the comment template provided on the NIST CSRC
131   website.

135   Call for Patent Claims
136   This public review includes a call for information on essential patent claims (claims whose use
137   would be required for compliance with the guidance or requirements in this Information
138   Technology Laboratory (ITL) draft publication). Such guidance and/or requirements may be
139   directly stated in this ITL Publication or by reference to another publication. This call also
140   includes disclosure, where known, of the existence of pending U.S. or foreign patent applications
141   relating to this ITL draft publication and of any relevant unexpired U.S. or foreign patents.
142   ITL may require from the patent holder, or a party authorized to make assurances on its behalf,
143   in written or electronic form, either:
144   assurance in the form of a general disclaimer to the effect that such party does not hold and does
145   not currently intend holding any essential patent claim(s); or
146   assurance that a license to such essential patent claim(s) will be made available to applicants
147   desiring to utilize the license for the purpose of complying with the guidance or requirements in
148   this ITL draft publication either:
149   under reasonable terms and conditions that are demonstrably free of any unfair discrimination; or
150   without compensation and under reasonable terms and conditions that are demonstrably free of
151   any unfair discrimination.
152   Such assurance shall indicate that the patent holder (or third party authorized to make assurances
153   on its behalf) will include in any documents transferring ownership of patents subject to the
154   assurance, provisions sufficient to ensure that the commitments in the assurance are binding on
155   the transferee, and that the transferee will similarly include appropriate provisions in the event of
156   future transfers with the goal of binding each successor-in-interest.
157   The assurance shall also indicate that it is intended to be binding on successors-in-interest
158   regardless of whether such provisions are included in the relevant transfer documents.
159   Such statements should be addressed to: piv_comments@nist.gov.

276   Executive Summary
277   Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 [HSPD-12] established a policy for the creation,
278   issuance, and use of personal identification credentials to identify federal employees and
279   contractors securely and reliably. In response, NIST developed and published FIPS 201,
280   Personal Identity Verification (PIV) of Federal Employees and Contractors [FIPS201], as well
281   as several NIST Special Publications (SPs) to provide additional specifications and supporting
282   information. Together, these documents provide a foundation for standardizing the processes
283   related to the adoption and use of government-wide personal identification credentials as a
284   means to verify the identities of credential holders. The implementation of PIV specifications
285   involves the collection, protection, and dissemination of personal information, which itself
286   requires privacy protection.
287   In light of the requirements for both improved security and the protection of personal privacy,
288   [HSPD-12] established four control objectives, one of which includes the call for forms of
289   identification that are “issued by providers whose reliability has been established by an official
290   accreditation process.” In response, Appendix A.1 of [FIPS201] specifies that NIST “…develop
291   a new accreditation methodology that is objective, efficient, and will result in consistent and
292   repeatable accreditation decisions…” This led to the development of SP 800-79, Guidelines for
293   the Accreditation of Personal Identity Verification Card Issuers. 1
294   This update to SP 800-79 reflects the third revision of [FIPS201], which was published in 2022.
295   It provides appropriate and useful guidelines for assessing the reliability of PIV Card issuers and
296   derived PIV credential issuers, which is of utmost importance when an organization (e.g., a
297   federal agency) is required to trust identity credentials that were created and issued by another
298   organization (i.e., another federal agency). This trust only exists if the relying organization has
299   the necessary level of assurance that the credential is established via a formal and reliable
300   authorization process.
301   This SP provides an assessment and authorization methodology for verifying that issuers are
302   adhering to the standards and implementation directives developed under [HSPD-12]. The salient
303   features of the methodology are:
304        •     Controls derived from specific requirements in [FIPS201] and relevant documents for a
305              PIV Card issuer (PCI) and a derived PIV credential issuer (DPCI)
306        •     Procedures for verifying and monitoring adherence to the requirements through an
307              assessment of the implementation of the controls (i.e., control assessment)
308        •     Guidance for evaluating the result of an assessment in order to arrive at the authorization
309              decision
310   Authorizing an issuer based on the assessment and authorization methodology in this document
311   establishes the reliability of the issuer. Authorization is the basis for establishing trust in an
312   issuer and requires that the assessment be thorough and comprehensive. Careful planning,
313   preparation, and the commitment of time, energy, and resources are required. These guidelines
314   are designed to assist the organization in creating the needed roles, assigning responsibilities,
      1
        SP 800-37-2, Risk Management Framework for Information Systems and Organizations: A System Life Cycle Approach for Security and Privacy
      [SP800-37], has deprecated the use of the term “accreditation” in favor of the term “authorization.” This is reflected in the title of the present
      revision.



                                                                              1

315   developing an acceptable operations plan, drawing the issuer’s authorization boundary,
316   evaluating the findings of all control assessments, and making a proper authorization decision.
317   Since organizations may vary significantly in how they choose to structure their operations, these
318   guidelines have been developed to support organizational flexibility and minimize the effort
319   needed to assess, authorize, and monitor the reliability of issuers. The authorization methodology
320   also generates assessment findings and resulting authorization decisions that are consistent and
321   repeatable. These characteristics provide assurance to an organization’s management that an
322   issuer who has been authorized based on these guidelines can be trusted as a provider of secure
323   and reliable identification credentials, as required by [HSPD-12].
324   This document shall be used by both small and large organizations (i.e., federal departments and
325   agencies) and can be applied whether their issuance processes are:
326       •   Centrally located,
327       •   Geographically dispersed, or
328       •   Outsourced in varying degrees to other organizations or service providers.

      NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                   Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
      December 2023                                                          and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

329       Introduction
330   Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 [HSPD-12], Policy for a Common Identification
331   Standard for Federal Employees and Contractors, was issued on August 27, 2004, to enhance
332   security, increase Federal Government efficiency, reduce identity fraud, and protect personal
333   privacy. This Directive established a federal policy to create and use secure and reliable forms of
334   identification for federal employees and contractors. It further defined secure and reliable forms
335   of identification as those that:
336       •   Are issued based on sound criteria for verifying an individual’s identity;
337       •   Are strongly resistant to identity fraud, tampering, counterfeiting, and terrorist
338           exploitation;
339       •   Can be rapidly authenticated electronically; and
340       •   Are only issued by providers whose reliability has been established by an official
341           accreditation process.
342   NIST developed and published Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 201, Personal
343   Identity Verification (PIV) of Federal Employees and Contractors [FIPS201], and several
344   Special Publications that provide additional specifications in response to [HSPD-12]. These
345   documents provide the foundation for personal identification, verification, and access control
346   systems across the Federal Government.
347   To standardize the operations of PIV Card issuers, NIST developed a set of attributes to assess
348   reliability and published the first version of SP 800-79 in July of 2005. Lessons learned through
349   various implementation approaches, experience in credential management and PIV Card
350   issuance, and the introduction of mobile device-integrated PIV credentials (i.e., derived PIV
351   credentials) motivated NIST to update the set of issuer controls and associated methodology to
352   ensure that they were objective and efficient and would result in consistent and repeatable
353   authorization decisions. With advancements in technology and the need for flexibility, [FIPS201]
354   expanded the set of derived credentials beyond those that are PKI-based and broadened their use
355   to other types of devices in addition to mobile devices. The technical details for the expanded set
356   of derived PIV credentials is specified in SP 800-157r1, Guidelines for Derived Personal Identity
357   Verification (PIV) Credentials [SP800-157]. This revision of SP 800-79 (i.e., SP 800-79r3)
358   reflects the updates to [FIPS201], [SP800-157], and other supporting publications.
359   This document uses the common term “issuer” to refer to issuers of both PIV Cards and derived
360   PIV credentials unless it is necessary to differentiate them. An issuer is considered to be owned,
361   managed, or outsourced (in part or as a whole) by an organization that is a federal department or
362   agency. Ensuring the reliability of an issuer is of critical importance to establishing secure and
363   reliable forms of identification and protecting the privacy of millions of government employees
364   and contractors. Controlling access to physical and logical resources through the use of standard
365   credentials provides assurance that certain predefined levels of security can be achieved. All
366   relying-party organizations must also have confidence in the credentials that it issues to its own
367   employees and contractors as well as those issued by other organizations. This confidence can
368   only be established if the issuer’s functions in those other organizations are assessed and
369   authorized. Thus, authorization of the issuer plays a key role in meeting the objectives of
370   [HSPD-12].

      NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                  Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
      December 2023                                                         and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

371   NIST has considerable experience in developing assessment and authorization methodologies,
372   most significantly with the widely accepted approach to authorization in SP 800-37r2 [SP800-
373   37] and its family of related documents. While [SP800-37] focuses on the authorization of the
374   security of information systems rather than the authorization of the reliability of an issuer, it
375   offers a practical foundation for the authorization programs envisioned by [HSPD-12]. This
376   document utilizes the various aspects of [SP800-37] and applies them to authorizing the
377   reliability of an issuer. The authorization of an issuer by a federal organization requires prior
378   assessment of the security of all information systems used by that issuer in accordance with
379   [SP800-37]. Since PIV Cards and derived PIV credentials are typically issued through the use of
380   information systems, an assessment of their security (through the methodology in [SP800-37]) is
381   critical for determining the ability to comply with [FIPS201] requirements.
382   One difference between the authorization of the security of information systems and the
383   authorization of the reliability of an issuer is that an organization has considerable flexibility in
384   how they prepare for an [SP800-37] authorization (particularly in implementing security
385   controls) but have little room for variation when it comes to the authorization of an issuer. Much
386   of the flexibility in [SP800-37] comes from the necessity of acceptable variations in security
387   controls since individual information systems within varied environments may have significantly
388   different security requirements. Conversely, the desire for standardization in [HSPD-12] has led
389   to the development of a stable set of requirements. There may be some flexibility in how a
390   requirement is met, but a majority of requirements must be satisfied in a uniform manner in order
391   for an issuer to be deemed reliable. Allowing too much latitude in how a requirement is met
392   undermines its reliability.
393   Although organizations may feel constrained by the uniformity required by [FIPS201],
394   standardization greatly contributes to achieving the objectives of [HSPD-12] across issuer
395   implementations. For all federal organizations to accept the PIV Cards and derived PIV
396   credentials of other federal organizations, one set of rules (i.e., [FIPS201]) must be followed by
397   all PIV system participants. This document provides a way to determine whether the participants
398   are following these rules. Assessment methods that are consistent, reliable, and repeatable
399   provide a basis for determining the reliability and capability of issuers of PIV Cards and derived
400   PIV credentials, which herein is defined as consistent adherence to the PIV standards. In
401   particular, if an issuer meets the requirements of [FIPS201] and relevant documents as verified
402   through applicable assessment procedures and maintains consistency in their operations with
403   respect to meeting these criteria, they can be considered reliable, as is required by [HSPD-12].
404   The objectives of this document are to:
405       •   Outline the requirements for PIV Card issuers and derived PIV credentials issuers,
406           including the rationale for the requirements and the assessment procedures for
407           determining the satisfaction of those requirements through a combination of policies,
408           procedures, and operations
409       •   Describe an authorization methodology that provides a framework for organizing the
410           requirements and assessment procedures stated above and meeting all of the control
411           objectives stated in [HSPD-12]
412       •   Emphasize the role of risk associated with an authorization decision based on assessment
413           outcomes that consider the organization’s mission

414           Applicability, Intended Audience, and Usage
415   This document is applicable to and SHALL be used by all federal organizations. It may also be
416   used by any other organization (e.g., state or local government, educational institution, non-profit
417   group) that wishes to align with [FIPS201] and associated PIV credentials.
418   All federal organizations are required to adopt [HSPD-12] and implement [FIPS201]. They must
419   use the methodology and issuer controls outlined in this document to assess the adequacy of their
420   implementations as well as the reliability of the directly controlled and subcontracted services
421   involved in creating and issuing the mandatory PIV Cards and the optional derived PIV
422   credentials (if implemented).
423   This document is consistent and compatible with the control objectives in [HSPD-12],
424   [FIPS201], [SP800-157], and [SP800-37]. It includes the roles, requirements, definitions,
425   specifications, and procedures needed to assess the reliability of an issuing organization. If an
426   issuer fails to meet the prescribed assessment criteria, they must immediately halt operations.
427   Once an issuer is authorized to operate using these guidelines, trust can be established in the
428   issued PIV credentials throughout their life cycles.

429           Requirements, Notations, and Conventions
430   This standard uses the following typographical conventions in text:
431       •   Specific terms in CAPITALS represent normative requirements. When these same terms
432           are not in CAPITALS, the term does not represent a normative requirement.
433                o The terms “SHALL” and “SHALL NOT” indicate requirements to be followed
434                  strictly in order to conform to the publication and from which no deviation is
435                  permitted.
436                o The terms “SHOULD” and “SHOULD NOT” indicate that among several
437                  possibilities, one is recommended as particularly suitable without mentioning or
438                  excluding others, that a certain course of action is preferred but not necessarily
439                  required, or that (in the negative form) a certain possibility or course of action is
440                  discouraged but not prohibited.
441                o The terms “MAY” and “NEED NOT” indicate a course of action that is
442                  permissible within the limits of the publication.
443                o The terms “CAN” and “CANNOT” indicate a material, physical, or causal
444                  possibility or capability or — in the negative — the absence of that possibility or
445                  capability.

      December 2023                                                                                     and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

477        Preparation for Assessment and Authorization
478   This section presents the fundamentals of an authorization of an issuer, including (i) definitions
479   for an issuer and issuing facility, (ii) outsourcing issuer services or functions, (iii) the differences
480   between an assessment and authorization, (iv) the authorization boundaries of an issuer, (v) roles
481   and responsibilities, (vi) the relationship between authorization under [SP800-37] and this
482   revision of SP 800-79, (vii) preparing for the assessment, (viii) the types of authorization
483   decisions, (xi) the use of risk in authorization decisions, and (x) the contents of the authorization
484   package.

485              Organization
486   An organization in the context of this document is a federal department or agency that is
487   responsible for issuing PIV Cards and, optionally, derived PIV credentials to their employees
488   and contractors in accordance with [HSPD-12] and [FIPS201] requirements. An organization
489   SHALL be responsible for maintaining the enterprise identity management system (IDMS) and
490   associated PIV identity accounts for its employees and contractors. The organization SHALL
491   also be responsible for authorizing an issuer (Sec. 2.2) via an authorization to operate (ATO)
492   (Sec. 2.10) prior to issuing PIV credentials.
493   An organization is responsible for completely describing its PIV credential issuance functions in
494   an operations plan. This comprehensive document incorporates all of the information about the
495   organization that is needed for any independent party to review and assess the capability and
496   reliability of its issuance functions, as implemented by the issuers. An operations plan includes a
497   description of the issuer’s structure, its facilities, any external service providers, roles and
498   responsibilities, the policies and procedures that govern its operations, and a description of how
499   the requirements of [FIPS201] are being met. A template for an operations plan is provided in
500   Appendix D.

501              Issuer
502   At the highest level, an issuer is considered to be owned by an organization (e.g., federal agency)
503   or a private entity outsourced by the organization to provide PIV credential services. An issuer
504   SHALL provide a full set of functions required to produce, issue, and maintain PIV Cards or
505   derived PIV credentials for the organization. An issuer is considered operational if the
506   organization has relevant roles and responsibilities defined and appointed; suitable policies and
507   compliant procedures have been implemented for all relevant PIV processes, 2 including
508   sponsorship, identity proofing/registration (to include supervised remote identity proofing, if
509   implemented), adjudication, card/token production, activation/issuance, and maintenance; and
510   information system components that are utilized to perform the above-mentioned functions (i.e.,
511   processes) have been assessed and shown to meet all technical and operational requirements
512   prescribed in [FIPS201] and related documents.
513   In order to comply with [HSPD-12], an organization SHALL first establish an issuer to issue PIV
514   Cards or derived PIV credentials that conforms to and satisfies the requirements of [FIPS201]

      2
       Some of the processes may not apply to issuers of derived PIV credentials. For example, identity proofing is not required for the issuance of
      derived PIV credentials since it is a post-enrollment binding process based on the issued PIV Card and identity record previously created.



                                                                              7
      NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                   Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
      December 2023                                                          and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

515   and related documents. The issuer SHALL then be authorized (i.e., using the guidelines specified
516   in this document). An organization has certain flexibility in implementing its issuance functions,
517   such as outsourcing some of the required processes or establishing multiple units to fulfill these
518   processes. Regardless of its structure, the organization is responsible for the management and
519   oversight of its issuers and SHALL maintain full responsibility as required in [HSPD-12]. Given
520   that the issuer is responsible for issuing PIV credentials on behalf of an organization, the issuer is
521   sometimes referred to as a Credential Service Provider (CSP).

522           Issuing Facilities
523   An issuing facility is a physical site or location — including all equipment, staff, and
524   documentation — that is responsible for carrying out one or more of the following PIV
525   functions: (i) identity proofing/registration, (ii) card/token production, (iii) activation/issuance,
526   and (iv) maintenance, including reissuance. An issuing facility operates under the auspices of a
527   PIV Card or derived PIV credential issuer and implements the policies and procedures prescribed
528   by the issuer for those functions sanctioned for the facility (e.g., an identity proofing/registration
529   facility).
530   Based on certain characteristics (e.g., size, geographic locations, etc.), an issuer can have its
531   services and functions provided centrally, distributed across multiple locations, or performed
532   remotely. For example, in the case of PIV Card issuance, a geographically dispersed organization
533   may decide to set up issuing facilities to have identity proofing/registration and
534   activation/issuance functions performed in different parts of the country so that applicants can
535   minimize travel. In this example, the different issuing facilities fall under the purview (i.e.,
536   policy and management) of a single issuer that encompasses all of the functions necessary to
537   issue PIV Cards for the organization.

538           Outsourcing Issuing Facilities
539   An organization MAY outsource the issuance of PIV Cards or derived PIV credentials in part or
540   in full. As the complexity and cost of new technologies increase, the organization may decide
541   that the most efficient and cost-effective solution for implementing [HSPD-12] is to seek the
542   services of an external service provider. An external service provider MAY be a federal agency,
543   a private entity, or some other organization that offers the services or functions necessary to issue
544   PIV Cards or derived PIV credentials. Regardless of the outsourcing arrangement, the
545   organization is responsible for ensuring that all PIV credential issuance functions are being
546   performed according to the approved processes for issuing an authorization to operate to an
547   issuer (Sec. 2.10).
548   Figure 1 provides an illustration of the functions that can be outsourced. Only the organization
549   can decide which of its employees and contractors are required to apply for a PIV Card and,
550   optionally, a derived PIV credential (i.e., via sponsorship, wherein a responsible official of the
551   organization provides the biographic and organizational affiliation of the applicant) and under
552   what conditions the application will be approved (e.g., via adjudication, or the kind of
553   background information that will form the basis for authorization to issue the PIV Card).
554   Therefore, these two functions SHALL NOT be outsourced.

557   An organization that outsources services must make sure that all privacy-related requirements are
558   being met both internally and by every external service provider used as part of the PIV
559   credential issuance function.
560   If an organization is considering using PIV or derived PIV services set up by another
561   organization’s issuer, the operations plan and associated documents — including the
562   authorization decision and evidence that the issuer is complying with [FIPS201] requirements —
563   SHALL be reviewed by the designated authorizing official (DAO) of the organization requesting
564   these services. Similarly, if an issuer is selectively using the services of an external service
565   provider for one or more of its processes, the provider’s capability to meet [FIPS201]
566   requirements for those processes SHALL be reviewed as well. In both cases, the information
567   gathered as part of this review activity SHALL be included in the issuer’s assessment leading to
568   authorization. Outsourced functions SHALL be assessed prior to the authorization of an issuer.

569                Assessment and Authorization
570   [HSPD-12] requires identification credentials to be “issued only by providers whose reliability
571   has been established by an official accreditation process.” This document contains guidelines for
572   satisfying the requirements for an official authorization and provides a methodology that can be
573   utilized to formally authorize an issuer. This methodology consists of two major sets of
574   activities: assessment and authorization. While assessment and authorization are closely related,
575   they are two distinct activities.
576   Assessment occurs before authorization and is the process of gathering evidence regarding an
577   issuer’s satisfaction of the requirements of [FIPS201], including all functions performed (i)
578   locally, (ii) at a supervised remote identity proofing (SRIP) station (if used), or (iii) at issuing
579   facilities. Assessment activities include interviews with the issuer, the issuing facility’s
580   personnel, and the SRIP live operators; a review of documentation; an observation of processes;
581   and an execution of tests to determine the overall reliability of the issuer. The result of the
582   assessment is a report that serves as the basis for an authorization decision. The report is also the
583   basis for developing corrective actions for removing or mitigating discovered deficiencies.
584   Authorization is the decision to permit the operation of the issuer once it has been established
585   that the requirements of [FIPS201] have been met and the risks regarding security and privacy
586   are acceptable. The individual making the authorization decision SHALL be knowledgeable of
      3
          The term “token” refers to a derived PIV credential in physical form, as detailed in [SP800-157].



                                                                                9
      NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                                Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
      December 2023                                                                                       and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

587   [HSPD-12] and aware of the potential risks to the organization’s operations, assets, and
588   personnel (e.g., applicants, operation staff).
589   The assessment (Sec. 5.2) and the authorization (Sec. 5.3) are both carried out by the
590   organization that “owns” (i.e., manages, controls, or contracts) the issuance of PIV Cards and/or
591   derived PIV credentials. 4 In order to make an informed, risk-based authorization decision, the
592   assessment process SHOULD seek to answer the following questions:
593           •    Has the issuer implemented the requirements of [FIPS201] and, optionally, [SP800-157]
594                (in the case of derived PIV credential issuance) in a manner consistent with the standard?
595           •    Do personnel understand the responsibilities of their roles and/or positions and reliably
596                perform all required activities as described in the issuer’s documentation?
597           •    Are the services and functions at the issuer, its facilities, and/or SRIP stations (e.g.,
598                identity proofing/registration, card/token production, activation/issuance) carried out in a
599                consistent, reliable, and repeatable manner?
600           •    Have deficiencies identified during the assessment been documented? Have current and
601                potential impacts on security and privacy been highlighted? Have the recommendations
602                and timelines for correction or mediation been included in the assessment report?

603                Authorization Boundary of the Issuer
604   The organization’s first step is to identify the appropriate authorization boundary of the issuer.
605   The authorization boundary defines the specific operations that are to be the target of the
606   assessment and authorization. A PIV Card issuer (PCI) comprises the complete set of functions
607   required for the issuance and maintenance of PIV Cards, while a derived PIV credential issuer
608   (DPCI) comprises the complete set of functions required for the issuance and maintenance of
609   derived PIV credentials. In determining the authorization boundary, the organization SHALL
610   consider whether all of the necessary functions required for the issuance and maintenance of PIV
611   Card or derived PIV credentials are included within the scope. The organization SHALL also
612   consider whether these functions are being performed identically in all issuing facilities, are
613   using identical information technology components, and are under the same direct management
614   control. For example, an organization may have two sub-organizations, each of which has
615   distinct processes and management structures. The organization MAY decide to establish two
616   separate issuers, each with its own authorization boundary. In this example, two separate
617   assessments would be undertaken, and each assessment would result in an independent
618   authorization decision.
619   In drawing an authorization boundary, an organization MAY only want to include a subset of its
620   issuing facilities. For example, if an issuer has several facilities, some of which are ready for
621   operation and some that are still in the development stage, the organization MAY choose to
622   define the authorization boundary to include only those issuing facilities that are ready to be
623   assessed. If the authorization is successful, the organization would authorize the issuer along
624   with its subset of issuing facilities to operate and begin issuing PIV Cards. The remaining issuing

          The trust in PIV Cards and derived PIV credentials stems from the guidelines in Task 6 of Sec. 5.3.



                                                                               10
      NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                                 Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
      December 2023                                                                                        and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

625   facilities can continue with implementation and be included in the authorization boundary at a
626   later date.
627   In the case of outsourcing PIV or derived PIV services that are not under direct management
628   control of the organization nor physically located within its facilities, the organization SHALL
629   include the functions provided by any external service providers within the authorization
630   boundary to ensure that they are included within the scope of issuer authorization. This assures
631   that no matter how and where the functions are performed, the organization maintains complete
632   accountability for the reliability of its PIV program. From an issuer point of view, this translates
633   to applying the necessary due diligence process with respect to the assessment of controls to
634   ensure that outsourced functions are conducted in an acceptable and compliant manner.
635   Care should be used in defining the authorization boundary for the issuer. A boundary that is
636   unnecessarily expansive (i.e., includes many dissimilar processes and business functions) makes
637   the assessment and authorization processes extremely complex. Establishing a boundary and its
638   subsequent authorization are organization-level activities that SHOULD include the participation
639   of all key personnel. An organization SHOULD strive to define the authorization boundary of its
640   issuers such that it strikes a balance between the costs and benefits of assessment and
641   authorization.
642   While the above considerations SHOULD be useful to an organization in determining the
643   boundary for purposes of authorization, they SHOULD NOT limit their flexibility in establishing
644   a practical boundary that promotes an effective [HSPD-12]-compliant implementation. The
645   scope of an authorization is an issuer whose boundaries are formed by included issuing facilities,
646   not individual issuing facilities.

647                Issuer Roles and Responsibilities
648   PIV Card and derived PIV credential issuance roles and their processes should be selected based
649   on the organization’s structure, its mission, and operating environment. The organization
650   SHALL make sure that a separation of roles has been established and that the processes follow
651   the requirements of [FIPS201].
652   This subsection identifies the roles and responsibilities of key personnel involved in the setup,
653   day-to-day operations, assessment, and authorization of an issuer. 5 Recognizing that
654   organizations have widely varying missions and structures, there may be some differences in
655   naming conventions for authorization-related roles and in how the associated responsibilities are
656   allocated among personnel (e.g., one individual MAY perform multiple roles in certain
657   circumstances).

658   2.7.1. Senior Authorizing Official (SAO)
659   The senior authorizing official (SAO) of an organization is responsible for all operations. The
660   SAO has budgetary control, provides oversight, develops policy, and has authority over all
661   functions and services related to the issuance of PIV Cards and derived PIV credentials for the
662   organization.


      5
          Organizations may define other significant roles (e.g., PIV system liaisons, operations managers) to support the authorization process.



                                                                                11

663   2.7.2. Designated Authorizing Official (DAO)
664   The designated authorizing official (DAO) has the authority within an organization to review the
665   assessment results of the organization’s established issuers and related issuing facilities and to
666   provide an authorization decision as required by [HSPD-12]. Through authorization, the DAO
667   accepts responsibility for the operation of the issuers at an acceptable level of risk and attests that
668   the organization is issuing PIV Cards and, optionally, derived PIV credentials in accordance with
669   the requirements of [FIPS201] such that issued PIV credentials have the commensurate level of
670   identity assurance. The SAO may also fulfill the role of the DAO. The DAO SHALL NOT
671   assume the role of the EIMO.

672   2.7.3. Enterprise Identity Management Official (EIMO)
673   The organization’s enterprise identity management official (EIMO) is responsible for
674   implementing the policies of the organization and ensuring that all identity-proofing, card/token
675   production, issuance, and maintenance processes are being performed reliably, consistently,
676   securely, and in compliance with [FIPS201] and, optionally, [SP800-157] (in the case of derived
677   PIV credentials) by the issuer. The EIMO is responsible for the organization’s identity
678   management system and the enrolled PIV identity accounts. The EIMO ensures that the PIV
679   identity account remains current at all times and that all issued PIV credentials are represented
680   within this PIV identity account for the cardholder.
681   Furthermore, the organization’s EIMO implements and manages the operations plan; ensures that
682   all issuing facility roles are filled with capable, trustworthy, knowledgeable, and trained staff;
683   ensures that all services, equipment, and processes meet [FIPS201] requirements; monitors and
684   coordinates activities with issuing facility managers; provides guidance to the issuing facilities
685   and SRIP operators as needed; and supports the authorization process.

686   2.7.4. Issuing Facility Manager
687   An issuing facility manager manages the day-to-day operations of an issuing facility, remote
688   SIRP center, or SIRP station. The issuing facility manager is responsible for implementing all
689   operating procedures for those functions that have been designated for that facility by the issuer.
690   The manager ensures that all PIV processes adhere to the requirements of [FIPS201] and that all
691   PIV and derived PIV services performed at the issuing facility are carried out in a consistent and
692   reliable manner in accordance with the organization’s policies and procedures and the direction
693   of the organization’s EIMO. In some cases (e.g., small organizations), the EIMO MAY fulfill the
694   role of the issuing facility manager.

695   2.7.5. Operator
696   An operator is responsible for executing all operating procedures for all functions, whether in-
697   person or remotely observed (e.g., identity proofing, registration, issuance of the PIV Card or
698   post-enrollment binding of a derived PIV credential, etc.) All operators SHALL receive
699   comprehensive training to perform their assigned responsibilities, detect fraudulent identity
700   source documents, and properly capture biometrics when needed. Multiple operators CAN be
701   assigned to an issuing facility, depending on the size of that facility. The issuer is responsible for

702   ensuring that all identity proofing, registration, card/token production, issuance, post-enrollment
703   binding, and reissuance processes are carried out and adhere to the principle of separation of
704   duties wherever necessary to comply with [HSPD-12] and [FIPS201].

705   2.7.6. Assessor
706   The assessor is responsible for performing a comprehensive, third-party assessment of an issuer.
707   The assessor (usually supported by an assessment team) verifies that the issuer’s PIV processes
708   comply with the control objectives of [FIPS201]. The EIMO reviews the assessment findings and
709   prepares recommended corrective actions to reduce or eliminate any discrepancies or
710   shortcomings prior to submission to the DAO for an authorization decision. The assessor is also
711   responsible for providing recommendations for reducing or eliminating deficiencies and security
712   weaknesses and describing the potential impacts if those deficiencies are not corrected. An
713   assessor SHALL NOT be assigned the DAO’s role and vice versa.
714   To preserve the impartial and unbiased nature of the assessment, the assessor SHALL be a third-
715   party that is independent of the offices and personnel that are directly responsible for the day-to-
716   day operation of the issuer. The assessor SHALL also be independent of those individuals
717   responsible for correcting the deficiencies and discrepancies identified during the assessment
718   phase. The independence of the assessor is important for maintaining the credibility of the
719   assessment results and ensuring that the DAO receives objective information in order to make an
720   informed authorization decision.

721   2.7.7. Applicant Representative (AR)
722   The applicant representative (AR) is an optional role that MAY be established and used at the
723   discretion of the organization. The AR represents the interests of current or prospective
724   employees and contractors who are applicants for a PIV Card or derived PIV credential. ARs are
725   responsible for assisting an applicant who is denied a PIV credential because of missing or
726   incorrect information and for ensuring that all applicants obtain useful information and assistance
727   when needed. This role is typically assigned to someone in the organization’s personnel or

729   2.7.8. Privacy Official (PO)
730   The responsibilities of the privacy official (PO) are defined in [FIPS201]. The person filling this
731   role SHALL not assume any other operational role within the organization. The PO issues policy
732   guidelines with respect to the collection and handling of personally identifiable information from
733   applicants to ensure that the issuer complies with all relevant directives of the privacy laws. The
734   PO’s role MAY be filled by an organization’s existing official for privacy (e.g., Senior Agency
735   Official for Privacy or Chief Privacy Officer).

736   2.7.9. Role Assignment Policies
737   Although organizational roles are independent and SHOULD be filled by different people if
738   feasible, there may be a need (e.g., because of availability or economy) to have one person fill
739   more than one role. Except for the roles of the assessor and PO and the separation of duty

      December 2023                                                              and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

740   provision under Sec. 2.7.2, one person MAY perform more than one role if needed. If an
741   organization has established multiple issuers, an individual MAY be assigned the same role in
742   several or all of them. For example, an issuing facility manager MAY be responsible for a
743   number of issuing facilities. Of the roles described, the SAO, DAO, EIMO, AR, assessor, and
744   PO SHALL be employees of the organization that owns the PCI or DPCI (e.g., federal
745   employees.)

750   The SAO has the primary authority and responsibility for the organization. The EIMO and the
751   DAO report to the SAO. An issuing facility manager is responsible for managing operations at
752   each issuing facility and reports to the EIMO. The dotted lines leading to the PO and the assessor
753   indicate their independence from the day-to-day operations of the issuer. Depending on the
754   structure of the PCI or DPCI, operators MAY work at the issuing facilities under the supervision
755   and guidance of the issuing facility manager or MAY report directly to the EIMO.

756           Relationship Between SP 800-79 and SP 800-37
757   While authorization is the major topic of both SP 800-79 and [SP800-37], the goals of
758   authorization are different in each. Authorization compliant with [SP800-37], as mandated by
759   Appendix III of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, focuses on
760   authorizing the processing of information systems based on an assessment of security at the
761   information system level. An authorization decision granted under [SP800-37] signifies that an
762   organization official accepts responsibility for the security (i.e., the confidentiality, integrity, and


                                                           14
      NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                   Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
      December 2023                                                          and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

763   availability of the information) of the information system. Authorization in SP 800-79 and as
764   mandated by [HSPD-12] is concerned with the assessment of the “reliability” of an issuer to
765   perform its functions in accordance with [FIPS201]. The authorization of an issuer’s reliability
766   under SP 800-79 indicates that an organization official asserts that the issuer meets and has the
767   ability to operate within the control objectives outlined in [HSPD-12] for “secure and reliable
768   forms of identification” within an acceptable level of risk. However, in both cases, the
769   organization official (i.e., the authorizing official [AO] in [SP800-37] and the DAO in SP 800-
770   79) is fully accountable for any adverse impacts to the organization if a breach in security,
771   privacy, or policy occurs.
772   SP 800-79 focuses on the authorization of an organization’s capability and reliability but
773   depends on adequate security for all of the supporting information systems that have been
774   authorized under [SP800-37]. Therefore, before the DAO authorizes the issuer and its facilities,
775   all relevant PCI or DPCI information systems used must be authorized. In many cases,
776   authorization under [SP800-37] will be granted by an organization official other than the official
777   responsible for authorizing the issuer. The former is an organization official tasked with deciding
778   whether to authorize the operation of an information system based on its security posture. The
779   latter SHALL be someone specifically designated to authorize the operation of an issuer after it
780   has been assessed and determined to be compliant with [FIPS201] control objectives.

781           Preparing for the Assessment of an Issuer
782   To facilitate an assessment of an issuer in a timely, efficient, and thorough manner, it is essential
783   that the staff of the issuer and members of the assessment team understand their specific roles
784   and responsibilities and participate as needed. The issuer, its operation staff, and the team
785   responsible for performing the assessment must cooperate and collaborate to ensure the success
786   of the assessment. Specific responsibilities of the assessment team are listed below.

787   2.9.1. Issuer Duties
788   Before the assessment can begin, an assessor SHALL be designated. The assessor conducts the
789   assessment and oversees the assessment team. The assessment team MAY be made up of
790   employees from the organization or personnel from a public or private-sector entity contracted to
791   provide assessment services. Members of the assessment team should have capabilities to
792   perform the activities specified in this document. Assessment team members SHOULD work
793   together to prepare for, conduct, and document the findings of the assessment within the
794   authorization boundary. Each team SHALL be made up of individuals who collectively have the
795   knowledge, skills, training, and abilities to conduct, evaluate, and document assessments,
796   including those performed on the information systems being used by the issuer.
797   Once an assessment team is in place, the EIMO and other relevant personnel SHOULD begin the
798   preparation for the assessment. Thorough preparations by both the issuer and the assessment
799   team are important aspects of conducting an effective assessment. The issuer sets the stage for
800   the assessment by identifying all appropriate personnel and making them available during the
801   assessment. A fundamental requirement for authorization is for the assessment team to interview
802   all issuer personnel. Personnel, operators, and officials SHALL be notified of the pending




                                                       15
      NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                 Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
      December 2023                                                        and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

803   assessment, SHOULD understand their roles in the process, and SHALL be made available in
804   accordance with the planned assessment schedule.
805   The EIMO SHALL ensure that all relevant documentation has been completed and organized
806   before the assessment begins. This documentation includes policies, procedures, organizational
807   structure, information system architecture, product and vendor details, and specifics regarding
808   the implementation of all of the requirements in [FIPS201] and related publications. If the issuer
809   has outsourced functions to an external service provider, all necessary documentation SHALL be
810   obtained from the provider regarding the outsourced operations. The EIMO SHALL review any
811   documentation to make certain that it is complete, current, and approved before providing it to
812   the assessment team.
813   Another significant activity during the assessment involves the assessment team observing the
814   actual processes performed by the issuer staff. In order for the assessment team to confirm that
815   processes are implemented in accordance with the operations plan, the issuer organization
816   SHALL ensure that assessment team members have access to facilities and are able to observe
817   PIV processes in real time. This could include scheduling activities to observe identity proofing,
818   adjudication, card/token production, activation/issuance, and maintenance processes.
819   Appendix C includes an issuer readiness review checklist to aid the issuer’s planning and
820   preparation for the assessment. Satisfying the list of items before the assessment commences will
821   facilitate efficient utilization of the assessment team’s time and contribute toward the overall
822   effectiveness of the assessment activity.

823   2.9.2. Assessment Team Duties
824   The independence of the assessment team is important for assessing the credibility of the
825   assessment results. In order to ensure that the results of the assessment are impartial and
826   unbiased, the members of the assessment team SHALL NOT be involved in the development,
827   day-to-day maintenance, or operations of the issuer or in the removal, correction, or remediation
828   of deficiencies.
829   The assessment team may obtain information during an assessment that the organization may not
830   want to publicly disclose. The assessment team is obligated to store and protect the
831   confidentiality of all security assessment-related records and information, including limiting
832   access to individuals who need to know the information. When using, storing, and transmitting
833   information related to the assessment, the assessment team shall follow any established
834   guidelines as agreed upon under the rules of engagement in addition to all relevant laws,
835   regulations, and standards regarding the need, protection, and privacy of information.

836           Authorization Decision
837   An authorization decision is a judgment made by the DAO to authorize the operation of an issuer
838   and its facilities. The DAO reviews the results of the assessment, considers the impacts of any
839   identified deficiencies on the organization, and decides whether to authorize the operation of the
840   issuer and its facilities. In doing so, the DAO agrees to accept the security and privacy risks (if
841   any) of issuing and maintaining PIV Cards or derived PIV credentials.

      NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                                Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
      December 2023                                                                                       and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

842   During the authorization decision process, the DAO evaluates the assessment findings for the
843   issuer and each issuing facility within the authorization boundary. If the issuer has outsourced
844   some of its services or functions, the DAO SHALL review all relevant assessments and
845   authorizations that have been granted to the external service provider and include them as part of
846   the overall evaluation of risk to the organization.
847   An authorization decision by a DAO SHALL always be granted for a specific issuer before the
848   commencement of operations, and there can only be one authorization decision for each issuer.
849   In issuing this decision, the DAO SHALL indicate the authorization boundary to which the
850   authorization applies. A DAO grants an authorization to an issuer and then specifies which
851   facilities (along with any exceptions or restrictions) are permitted to operate under that
852   authorization. This allows the issuer and any of its authorized issuing facilities to begin
853   operations while remaining facilities focus on addressing the deficiencies identified during the
854   assessment. At a later date, these facilities can be reassessed. After reviewing the new findings,
855   the DAO can reissue the authorization for the issuer and expand the authorization boundary by
856   including the newly assessed facilities.
857   The major input to the authorization decision is the assessment report. To ensure that the
858   assessment report is properly interpreted and the justification for the authorization decision
859   properly communicated, the DAO SHOULD meet with the assessor, the EIMO, and the issuing
860   facility managers prior to issuing an authorization decision to discuss the assessment findings
861   and the terms and conditions of the authorization.
862   There are three authorization alternatives that can be rendered by the DAO:
863           1. Authorization to operate,
864           2. Interim authorization to operate, or
865           3. Denial of authorization to operate.

866   2.10.1.                 Authorization to Operate (ATO)
867   An authorization to operate (ATO) may be issued 6 if — after reviewing the results of the
868   assessment phase — the DAO deems that the operations of the issuer and its facilities conform to
869   the control objectives of [FIPS201] to an acceptable degree and will continue to do so reliably
870   during the authorization validity period. The issuer and its issuing facilities are authorized to
871   perform services in compliance with all relevant policies, in conformance with all relevant
872   standards, and in accordance with the documented operations plan. The DAO SHALL indicate
873   exactly which issuing facilities are included in the ATO authorization decision. An ATO can
874   only be granted to an issuer if there are no limitations or restrictions imposed on any of its
875   issuing facilities that are included in the authorization boundary. The ATO is transmitted to the
876   EIMO.
877   After receiving an ATO that conforms to SP 800-79, reauthorization SHALL be performed (i)
878   within three years; (ii) when there is a significant change in personnel or operating procedures,
879   including the improvement or degradation of operations; or (iii) when additional issuing facilities
880   are being added to the issuer. There may also be cases in which one or more issuing facilities
881   cease operation. If this situation results in a PIV Card or derived PIV credential issuance-related
      6
          The issuer ATO can be affected by the underlying system authorization status (see Sec. 2.10.4).



                                                                               17
      NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                                Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
      December 2023                                                                                       and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

882   function identified in the operations plan becoming unavailable, then the DAO SHALL issue a
883   denial of authorization to operate (DATO) (Sec. 2.10.3). However, if the issuer can continue to
884   provide all of the services in the operations plan, then the authorization decision letter SHALL be
885   modified to exclude those issuing facilities that have ceased operations, thus revising the
886   authorization boundary. The required reauthorization activities are at the discretion of the DAO
887   and based on the extent and type of change.

888   2.10.2.                 Interim Authorization to Operate (IATO)
889   An interim authorization is an authorization to operate under specific terms and conditions. An
890   interim authorization to operate (IATO) SHOULD be issued 7 if — after reviewing the results of
891   the assessment phase — the DAO deems the discrepancies to be significant, but there is an
892   overarching necessity to allow the issuer to operate. An IATO is rendered to an issuer when the
893   identified deficiencies are significant but can be addressed and remediated in a timely manner.
894   The deficiencies SHALL be documented so that they can be addressed during the planning of
895   corrective actions. The DAO SHALL indicate exactly which facilities are included in the IATO
896   authorization decision during this interim period, along with any limitations or restrictions. The
897   maximum duration of an IATO is three months, and a maximum of two consecutive IATOs
898   MAY be granted. Failure to correct deficiencies before the expiration of the second IATO
899   SHALL result in an issuance of a DATO for the issuer. The authorization boundary SHOULD be
900   revised to exclude issuing facilities that exhibit significant deficiencies in performing their
901   functions. The IATO is transmitted to the EIMO.
902   An issuer SHALL NOT be considered to be authorized during the period of an IATO. When the
903   deficiencies have been corrected, the IATO SHOULD be replaced with an ATO. Significant
904   changes in the status of an issuer (e.g., addition of new issuing facilities) that occur during the
905   IATO period SHALL be reported immediately to the DAO.

906   2.10.3.                 Denial of Authorization to Operate (DATO)
907   A denial of authorization to operate (DATO) SHALL be transmitted to the EIMO if — after
908   reviewing the results of the assessment phase — the DAO deems operation of the issuer to be
909   unacceptable. Failure to receive an ATO indicates that there are major deficiencies in reliably
910   meeting the requirements of [FIPS201] and its related documents. The issuer is not authorized
911   and SHALL NOT be allowed to operate. If issuance services are currently in operation, all
912   functions SHALL be halted, including all operations at any issuing facility. If an issuer was
913   previously authorized and had issued PIV Cards or derived PIV credentials under an ATO, the
914   EIMO and issuing facility managers SHOULD consider whether a revocation of PIV Cards and
915   derived PIV credentials is necessary. The DAO and the assessor SHOULD work with the EIMO
916   and issuing facility managers to ensure that proactive measures are taken to correct the
917   deficiencies.




      7
          The issuer IATO can be affected by the underlying system authorization status (see Sec. 2.10.4).

918   2.10.4.                  Authorization Impact of Information Systems Under SP 800-37
919   An issuer SHALL NOT be authorized to operate if one or more of its critical information
920   systems is deemed insecure and it is therefore issued a DATO according to [SP800-37]. If an
921   IATO has been issued for an information system, the DAO MAY NOT issue greater than an
922   IATO for the issuer. Once the [SP800-37] IATO is replaced with an [SP800-37] ATO, the DAO
923   can issue an SP 800-79 ATO. If the [SP800-37] ATO expires for one or more information
924   systems during the course of operation of an issuer, the EIMO SHALL assess the criticality of
925   the system for operations and present the analysis to the DAO. The DAO can then exercise the
926   following options:
927           •    Specify a short time during which the information systems of the issuer must be
928                reauthorized under then without changing the ATO status,
929           •    Downgrade the current SP 800-79 ATO to an IATO, or
930           •    If circumstances warrant, issue an SP 800-79 DATO and halt all issuer operations.

931                Use of Risk in the Authorization Decision
932   Authorization is the official management decision by the DAO to permit the operation of an
933   issuer based on an assessment of its reliability and an acceptance of the risk inherent in that
934   decision. By granting an authorization to operate, the DAO accepts responsibility for the
935   reliability of the issuer and is fully accountable for any adverse impacts to the organization or
936   any other organization from the use of issued PIV Cards or derived PIV credentials.
937   The assessment of an issuer enables the DAO to determine its reliability and whether to accept
938   the risk to the organization in granting an ATO. As the requirements in [FIPS201] and related
939   documents form the basis of the authorization and are ultimately derived from the policy
940   objectives of [HSPD-12], those not reliably met by the issuer and its issuing facilities represent
941   the potential for adverse impact.
942   The PIV Card is used to establish assurance of an identity, and as such, it must be trusted as a
943   basis for granting access to the logical and physical resources of the organization. Similarly, the
944   derived PIV credential alternative form factors greatly improve the usability of electronic
945   authentication to remote IT resources while maintaining identity assurance through post-
946   enrollment binding. The incorrect or inconsistent implementation of an [HSPD-12] program
947   exposes an organization to an unacceptable level of risk since any problem with an issued PIV
948   Card or derived PIV credential that undermines this assurance could allow unauthorized access
949   to sensitive organizational resources and expose an organization to harm. Furthermore, the
950   collection, processing, and dissemination of personal information is required to issue these
951   credentials and increases the threat of this information being used for malicious purposes 8 if not
952   secured. It is the DAO’s responsibility to weigh the risks of these and other security and privacy
953   impacts when making the authorization decision. Furthermore, as [HSPD-12] is a government-
954   wide mandate based on a standard of interoperability that allows organizations to accept other
955   organizations’ credentials, authorization decisions within a single organization directly impact
956   other organizations. For example, an interoperable credential issued by an authorized federal
957   organization becomes the source of trust for another organization to grant access to physical and
      8
          The collection of personally identifiable information (PII) is minimized for derived PIV credentials because of the derivation process.



                                                                                19

958   logical resources based on verification of that identity. The DAO’s signature on the authorization
959   letter thus signifies their acceptance of responsibility (i.e., accountability) for the operations of
960   the issuer for their organization as well as other organizations in the federated circle of trust.

961           Authorization Submission Package and Supporting Documentation
962   The authorization submission package documents the results of the assessment phase and
963   provides the DAO with the essential information needed to make a credible, risk-based decision
964   on whether to authorize operation of the issuer. Unless specifically designated otherwise by the
965   DAO, the EIMO SHALL be responsible for the assembly, compilation, and presentation of the
966   authorization submission package. The authorization submission package contains the following
967   documents:
968       •   Operations plan, including standard operating procedures (SOPs) and attachments for all
969           issuing facilities
970       •   [SP800-37] authorization letters
971       •   Assessment report
972       •   Corrective actions plan (CAP), if required
973   The operations plan contains the policies, procedures, and processes for all of the major PIV
974   functional areas. It gives the assessor and DAO a complete picture of the structure, management,
975   and operations of an issuer, including issuing facilities. Appendix D provides templates of what
976   to include in the operations plan. One of the most significant pieces of information contained in
977   the operations plan is the list of issuer controls, which enables the assessor to quickly ascertain
978   how they are implemented and by whom.
979   If certain functions described in the operations plan are outsourced, the operations plan
980   SHOULD reference or point to the external service provider’s operations plan and related
981   documentation, such as support agreements and any contracts. In this manner, the assessor has
982   access to information about the external service provider’s operations without requiring the
983   issuer to duplicate documentation. Upon receiving and reviewing the authorization package and
984   in consultation with the assessor, the DAO decides whether to authorize the operations of the
985   issuer. The authorization decision letter transmits the authorization decision from the DAO to the
986   EIMO and contains the following information:
987       •   Authorization decision
988       •   Supporting rationale for the decision

 993   The authorization decision letter (see Appendix F for examples) informs the EIMO that the
 994   issuer is (i) authorized to operate, (ii) authorized to operate on an interim basis, or (iii) not
 995   authorized to operate. The supporting rationale includes the justification for the DAO’s decision.
 996   The terms and conditions for the authorization provide a description of any limitations or
 997   restrictions placed on the operation of the issuer, including which issuing facilities are included
 998   in the decision. The authorization decision letter SHALL be attached to the authorization
 999   submission package, which becomes the authorization decision package.
1000   The DAO sends the authorization decision package to the EIMO and retains a copy of it. The
1001   EIMO carefully reviews the terms and conditions of authorization before initiating the necessary
1002   steps for issuer operations. Both parties mark the authorization decision package appropriately
1003   for storage under the organization’s record retention policy.

1004           Taxonomy of Issuer Controls

1005                Introducing Issuer Controls
1006   The assessment of a PCI or DPCI is broader than an assessment of the security of an information
1007   system under [SP800-37]. The requirements specified in [FIPS201] cover all major aspects of an
1008   issuer, including organizational preparedness, security management, data protection,
1009   infrastructure, and issuance processes. In this document, each broad area is defined as an issuer
1010   authorization topic (IAT). IATs are used to summarize the assessment results for reporting and
1011   to structure the report for senior organization management to provide an analysis of the strengths
1012   and weaknesses of an issuer and its level of compliance.
1013   IATs include the following:
1014           •    Organizational preparedness relates to the capability, knowledge, and understanding of
1015                senior management regarding the formation and operation of the issuer. Under this area,
1016                roles and responsibilities are clearly identified, and policies and procedures are defined,
1017                documented, implemented, and enforced.
1018           •    Security management and data protection involves implementing and operating
1019                appropriate security management procedures, operational controls, and technical
1020                protection measures to ensure that privacy requirements are satisfied, the rights of
1021                individuals are assured, and personal data is protected.
1022           •    Infrastructure elements represent the activities required to procure, deploy, and
1023                maintain the information system components used for the issuance of PIV Cards and
1024                derived PIV credentials. These information system components (e.g., PKI, card or token
1025                personalization, printers, tokens, etc.) must meet the technical specifications defined in
1026                [FIPS201] and related documents and must be authorized under [SP800-37] for FISMA
1027                compliance.
1028           •    Processes are classes of functions that collectively span the entire life cycle, 9 such as
1029                sponsorship, identity proofing/registration, adjudication, card/token production,
1030                activation/issuance, and maintenance of the PIV Card and derived PIV credential.
1031   Each IAT is subdivided into one or more authorization focus areas. A focus area is a set of
1032   closely related requirements that need to be met by an issuer. Under each focus area, there is a
1033   procedure or technical product (termed an “issuer control”) that is used to satisfy a particular
1034   requirement. However, the manner in which the requirements are satisfied and how the
1035   specifications are implemented and managed may vary from organization to organization. For
1036   example, each PCI is required to identity-proof their applicants. This process can be
1037   implemented in one of several ways, depending on the structure, size, and geographical
1038   distribution of the organization’s headquarters and remote locations. The process could be
1039   conducted at a central location or distributed in regional centers across the country. It could be
1040   operated directly by the organization or by an external service provider. However, irrespective of
1041   the implementation approach, this identity proofing/registration activity needs to be reliably and
1042   accurately performed.


       9
           Some of the processes may not apply to derived PIV credential issuers.



                                                                                22
       NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                        Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
       December 2023                                                               and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

1043   Issuers need to implement the PIV requirements derived from [FIPS201] and its supporting
1044   publications, Office of Personnel Management (OPM) requirements related to background
1045   investigations, and applicable OMB Memoranda. The capability of an issuer is determined
1046   through the verification of these requirements using appropriate assessments. However,
1047   authorization is generally based on both the demonstration of capability and the presence of
1048   certain organizational characteristics that will provide a high degree of confidence to the assessor
1049   that the demonstrated capabilities will be carried out in a dependable and sustainable manner.
1050   This dependability measure, or reliability (as it is generally called), has to be established by
1051   adequately assessing that an issuer has the desired organizational characteristics, including
1052   adequate issuing facilities, appropriate equipment, trained personnel, adequate resources,
1053   trustworthy management, and properly vetted operations staff. Hence, the assessment and
1054   authorization methodology includes a set of issuer controls, the verification of which establishes
1055   the reliability of the issuer. This set of controls is grouped under the IAT’s authorization focus
1056   area called “Facility and Personnel Readiness.” These reliability-relevant issuer controls are
1057   formulated based on commonly accepted security readiness measures that have evolved in
1058   response to lessons learned in security incidents (e.g., insider attacks) and risks (e.g., physical
1059   security lapses). In addition to the controls provided herein, an organization may develop
1060   additional mission-specific controls that will contribute toward the overall reliability of the issuer
1061   to meet the organization’s mission needs.
1062   Table 1 lists the four IATs with associated authorization focus areas under each topic.

1064   Appendices G.1 and G.2 contain required issuer controls grouped by IAT and the associated
1065   authorization focus area for PCIs and DPCIs, respectively. Each issuer control represents how
1066   one or more requirements from [FIPS201] and its related documents can be satisfied. Issuer
1067   controls are sequentially numbered using the two-character identifier assigned to the
1068   authorization focus area under which they are listed. Identifiers for issuer controls that are
1069   applicable to both PCIs and DPCIs are aligned for ease of reference. In addition, controls for
1070   DPCIs are marked with “derived credential (DC)” for quick identification. For example, DO-1
1071   applies to a PCI, and DO(DC)-1 applies to a DPCI. Both of these issuer controls are targeted at
1072   assessing the same requirement.
1073   Table 2 shows the “Preparation and Maintenance of Documentation” authorization focus area
1074   under the “Organizational Preparedness” IAT.

1076   Unlike for a PIV Card issuer, not all issuer controls are applicable to a derived PIV credential
1077   issuer. Certain issuer controls are applicable to only Authentication Assurance Level 2 (AAL2)
1078   or AAL3 derived PIV credentials and must therefore be implemented by the issuer only if they
1079   are issuing a derived PIV credential at that level of authentication assurance. This is represented
1080   via the “applicability” column in the tables in Appendix G.2. Table 3 shows the “Maintenance
1081   Process” authorization focus area under the “Processes” IAT. The “applicability” column
1082   identifies whether the issuer control needs to be met by a PKI-based AAL2 or AAL3 derived
1083   PIV credential issuer or a non-PKI-based AAL2 or AAL3 derived PIV credential issuer. If the
1084   “applicability” column states “DPCI,” then the issuer control is applicable to all derived
1085   credential issuers, regardless of what type of derived PIV credential is issued by the issuer.

                            authentication certificate is revoked upon termination,
                            even if the token is collected and either zeroized or
                            destroyed.

1087   All issuer controls apply, regardless of an individual system’s FIPS 199, Standards for Security

1089   Furthermore, nothing precludes an issuer from implementing additional controls to ensure a
1090   higher level of confidence in mitigating risks associated with issuing PIV Cards or derived PIV
1091   credentials.

1092           Implementing Issuer Controls
1093   Each issuer control SHALL be properly implemented, managed, and monitored in order for the
1094   issuer to be authorized. Depending on how an organization decides to implement its [HSPD-12]
1095   program, certain functions might be outsourced to external service providers. However, it is still
1096   the responsibility of the organization’s management to ensure that the issuer controls are being
1097   implemented, enforced, and maintained by the issuer, its service providers (if any), and all
1098   issuing facilities that are within scope of the authorization boundary.




                                                                      24

1099   3.2.1. Issuer Controls Implemented at the Organizational or Facility Level
1100   The nature of each issuer control dictates where it is implemented. Controls are generally
1101   considered organizational level controls if they apply to the entire organization, regardless of the
1102   structure of the issuer and its issuing facilities, or are common to or impact multiple PIV
1103   processes. The development of the operations plan is an example of an issuer control
1104   implemented at the organizational level. Generally, controls that are specific to a process are
1105   implemented at the issuing facility where that process or function is carried out. For example, the
1106   control that states, “The issuer advises applicants that the PIN on the PIV Card should not be
1107   easily guessable or otherwise individually identifiable in nature,” is implemented at an
1108   activation/issuance facility.
1109   Derived PIV credentials MAY be issued remotely. In such cases, the issuer MAY NOT need to
1110   use an issuing facility, and issuing facility-specific controls may not be applicable. Regardless of
1111   the system and process architecture on how PIV Cards and derived PIV credentials are issued, it
1112   is the responsibility of the issuer organization to ensure that all applicable controls are
1113   implemented.

       December 2023                                                          and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

1115       Issuer Controls Assessment and the Authorization Decision Process
1116   An assessment is a set of activities performed by the assessor to gain assurance that the
1117   applicable issuer controls for a PCI or DPCI have been implemented properly and meet their
1118   required function or purpose. Understanding the overall effectiveness of the issuer controls
1119   implemented by the issuer and its facilities is essential for determining the risk to the
1120   organization’s overall mission and forms the basis for the authorization decision by the DAO.
1121   An assessor SHALL (i) compile evidence that the issuer controls are implemented correctly,
1122   operating as intended, and producing the desired results and (ii) present this evidence in a
1123   manner such that the DAO can make a credible, risk-based decision about the operation of the
1124   issuer.
1125   The focus of an assessment is the issuer controls, each of which is designed to satisfy one or
1126   more specific requirements from [FIPS201] and related documents. The objective for the
1127   assessor is to use the assessment procedures associated with each issuer control (described in
1128   Appendix G) to measure conformance to the requirements. The assessment procedures are
1129   designed to facilitate the gathering of evidence that issuer controls are implemented correctly,
1130   operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome.
1131   In preparation for an assessment, the assessor performs the following two preparatory steps:
1132       1. Determine the authorization boundary to understand the target of the assessment. The
1133          authorization boundary dictates which issuing facilities and outsourced services are to be
1134          included in the assessment.
1135       2. Review the operations plan to determine which issuer controls are implemented at the
1136          organizational level and facility level. This analysis should provide the assessor with an
1137          understanding of where different responsibilities lie within the issuer organization and
1138          how to address them during the assessment.
1139   If PIV functions have been outsourced, the issuer is responsible for ensuring that the external
1140   service provider has implemented the control. During the assessment, it is the responsibility of
1141   the EIMO to collect any service provider’s documentation and make it available to the assessor.
1142   It is recommended that organizations include appropriate language in contractual agreements
1143   with external service providers to ensure that the relevant documentation and necessary evidence
1144   is furnished by the provider in a timely manner for a successful authorization. If results from a
1145   previous assessment of the service provider (provided that the current assessment is part of
1146   reauthorization after substantial changes) can be referenced, the assessor may elect to incorporate
1147   these results (not exceeding one year) or redo part or all of the assessment. Reusing the results of
1148   the previous assessment is entirely at the discretion of the assessor.
1149   Issuer controls implemented at the organizational level generally need to be assessed only once
1150   since they span the entire issuer and its issuing facilities. In other words, these controls MAY
1151   NOT need to be reassessed when the authorization boundary changes (e.g., due to the addition of
1152   facilities). Examples of organizational-level controls include the set of controls under the
1153   authorization focus areas Preparation and Maintenance of Documentation (DO) and Assignment
1154   of Roles and Responsibilities (RR).
1155   There are certain controls that need to be reviewed at the issuing facility level even if they are
1156   put in place at the organizational level. An example of such a control artifact is

       December 2023                                                                                    and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

1157   “contingency/disaster recovery plan for information systems.” Though the development of the
1158   contingency/disaster recovery plan is an organizational-level control, it must be reviewed when
1159   new information systems in the existing facilities or new facilities are added to ensure that the
1160   new systems are brought within the scope of the plan.
1161   Unlike organizational-level issuer controls, facility-level issuer controls need to be assessed
1162   individually at each facility. A facility is often designated based on the type of PIV process it
1163   performs (exceptions are the sponsorship process and adjudication process). For example, if
1164   there are multiple facilities for identity proofing/registration (e.g., multiple registration centers),
1165   assessment of the issuer controls under the identity proofing/registration focus area should take
1166   place in each of the registration centers. However, if all facilities are operating using uniform
1167   operational procedures and underlying information systems, assessments may be performed at
1168   facilities that are selected randomly or through some other established criteria (e.g., geographical
1169   region or service provider).
1170   Prior assessments MAY be used as a starting point for the assessment of an issuer. While past
1171   assessments provide insight into the implementation and operation of an issuer, a number of
1172   factors affect the validity of past assessments. These include updates in policies and procedures,
1173   changes in systems and technology, and turnover among employees and contractors. Any
1174   significant changes in one or more of these factors SHOULD trigger a new assessment. The
1175   assessor SHALL validate whether the issuer is currently operating as expected using the given
1176   assessment procedures, including specially tailored or augmented procedures. It is only through a
1177   current valid assessment of issuer controls that the assessor and the EIMO will have confidence
1178   in the reliability of the issuer and its issuing facilities.
1179   The use of automated security controls, if reliably implemented and maintained in information
1180   systems, results in a high assurance of the protection of information and other organizational
1181   assets. Human involvement results in more variability in how issuer controls are implemented
1182   and operated since security and reliability depend on many factors, including an individual’s
1183   training, knowledge, motivation, experience, and management. Relying on humans rather than
1184   automated security mechanisms for data protection makes it critical that trust and reliability
1185   assessments of management, operators, and maintenance personnel are current and up to date.
1186   Many assessment procedures rely on interactions among the assessor, issuer management, and
1187   facilities staff. Interviews with all involved personnel and observations of all PIV processes are
1188   required. On-site visits, real-time observations, and reviews of processes are essential. The
1189   assessor SHOULD NOT rely solely on documentation to determine whether a given issuer
1190   control has been implemented.

1191                Assessment Methods
1192   In order to assess the capability and reliability of an issuer, one or more assessment procedures
1193   associated with each issuer control have to be completed. An assessment procedure is carried out
1194   using one or more of the following assessment methods: 10
1195           •    Review — An evaluation of documentation that describes plans, policies, and procedures
1196                in order to verify that they are adequate, understood by management and operations


       10
            The assessment methods associated with an assessment procedure are given in parenthesis in Appendices G.1 and G.2.

1197            personnel, and are in accordance with applicable policies, regulations, standards,
1198            technical guidelines, and organizational guidance
1199       •    Interview — A directed conversation with one or more issuer personnel in which both
1200            preestablished and follow-on questions are asked, responses documented, discussion
1201            encouraged, and conclusions reached
1202       •    Observe — A real-time viewing of PIV processes in operation, including all of the
1203            information system components of the issuer involved in the creation, issuance,
1204            maintenance, and termination of PIV Cards or derived PIV credentials
1205       •    Test — An evaluation of a component against a set of relevant PIV specifications using
1206            applicable test methods and metrics (as given in the associated assessment procedures in
1207            Appendices G.1 and G.2.)
1208   These methods are intended to provide the assessor with sufficient, precise, accurate, and
1209   relevant evidence regarding an IAT topic and its focus areas. One or more assessment methods
1210   may be required to determine whether the issuer has satisfactorily met the objective outlined for
1211   that assessment procedure. Assessment results are used by the assessor to determine the overall
1212   effectiveness of the issuer control.
1213   Table 4 shows the “Preparation and Maintenance of Documentation” authorization focus area
1214   under the “Organizational Preparedness” IAT. The “applicability” column identifies whether the
1215   issuer control needs to be met by a PKI-based AAL2 or AAL3 derived PIV credential issuer or a
1216   non-PKI AAL2 or AAL3 derived PIV credential issuer. If the “applicability” column states
1217   “DPCI,” then the issuer control is applicable to all derived PIV credential issuers, regardless of
1218   what type of derived PIV credential is issued by the issuer.

1220   Some organizations may need to customize some of the issuer controls to meet their specific
1221   characteristics and mission needs. In such cases, the associated assessment procedures may also
1222   have to be customized or augmented to ensure proper implementation of the controls.

1223            Issuer Assessment Report
1224   The assessment report contains the results of the assessment in a format that facilitates reviewing
1225   by the DAO. The DAO SHALL evaluate the information in the assessment report in order to
1226   make a sound, credible decision regarding the residual risk of authorizing the operations of the
1227   issuer.
1228   Appendix E provides an assessment report template organized by authorization focus. For each
1229   issuer control, it SHALL document which entity is responsible for the implementation of that
1230   control (e.g., the organization or an external service provider) and whether the issuer control is at
1231   the organizational or facility level.
         Activation/Issuance Process

         Issuer Control Identifier — AI-7

         Control Description — Before the PIV Card is provided to the applicant, the operator performs a one-to-one comparison of the
         applicant against the biometric data records available on the PIV Card or in the PIV enrollment record. If the biometric verification
         decision is negative, or if no biometric data records are available, the cardholder provides two identity source documents (as
         specified in [FIPS201], Sec. 2.7), which are inspected and compared by the operator with the photograph printed on the PIV Card.

                      Observe: Activation/Issuance Process

         Assessment Result — Partially Satisfied

         Assessment Findings — There is operational evidence that a one-to-one comparison of the applicant against the biometric data
         records available on the PIV Card or in the PIV enrollment record is carried out before the card is released to the applicant.

         Assessment Deficiency and Potential Impact — The requirement to carry out this task is not documented clearly enough in the
         operations plan. Although personnel are knowledgeable about this requirement and the task was observed to be performed
         correctly during card issuance, the lack of documentation could be a problem if there is turnover in staff. Alternate processes when
         a biometric match is unsuccessful are not in place.

         Recommendation — Update the issuance process description within the operations plan to include a clear description of this task in
         the process, and develop alternate processes for issuance when the biometric match is not successful.

1233   The assessment result for each issuer control SHALL be one of the following:
1234       •   Satisfied
1235       •   Partially Satisfied
1236       •   Not Satisfied
1237       •   Not Applicable
1238   After carrying out an assessment procedure, the assessor records their conclusion in one of two
1239   ways: MET or NOT MET. Using the list of conclusions pertaining to the assessment procedures
1240   associated with an issuer control, the assessment result (i.e., one of the four outcomes listed
1241   above) is arrived at as follows:
1242       •   If the conclusion from all assessment procedures is MET, then the assessment result for
1243           the issuer control is “Satisfied.”
1244       •   If some of the conclusions are NOT MET, then the assessment result for the issuer
1245           control is marked as either “Partially Satisfied” or “Not Satisfied,” depending on whether
1246           any of the underlying tasks in the assessment procedures are critical (i.e., they represent
1247           the only way to meet the issuer control’s objective). Figure 4 shows an example of an
1248           assessment that resulted in “Partially Satisfied.” In this instance, there is an awareness of
1249           a task requirement and the task itself is being carried out, but the reference to the task is
1250           missing in the document.
1251   When drawing a conclusion after an assessment procedure, the assessor must consider the
1252   potential subjective and objective aspects of the assessment methods used (e.g., interviews,
1253   document reviews, observations, and tests) for that assessment procedure. Deficiencies that result
1254   in “Partially Satisfied” or “Not Satisfied” must be reported by the assessor. The assessor must
1255   also outline the potential adverse impacts if the issuer control is deployed with the identified
1256   deficiencies.
1257   The assessment report template provides the means for recording the assessment result for each
1258   issuer control. The assessment results for all issuer controls are aggregated to generate the
1259   assessment result for an issuer authorization focus area. The set of issuer authorization focus area
1260   results are aggregated to generate issuer authorization topic results. Finally, the group of issuer
1261   authorization topic results is used to generate the overall issuer assessment report and an
1262   accompanying executive summary (intended for senior management).

1263       Assessment and Authorization Life Cycle
1264   The authorization of a PCI or DPCI consists of four phases: (i) Initiation, (ii) Assessment, (iii)
1265   Authorization, and (iv) Monitoring. Each phase consists of tasks and subtasks to be carried out
1266   by the responsible officials (e.g., the DAO, assessor, EIMO, and issuing facility managers).
1267   Figure 5 provides a view of the authorization phases, including the tasks associated with each
1268   phase. A table of authorization phases, tasks, subtasks, and the official responsible for each is

1271

1272           Initiation Phase
1273   The initiation phase consists of three tasks: (i) preparation, (ii) resource identification, and (iii)
1274   operations plan analysis and acceptance. The primary purpose of this phase is to ensure that the
1275   issuer is prepared for the assessment, including having all resources and documentation in place.
1276   The other purpose of this phase is to include the DAO early in the process to ensure the success
1277   of the assessment and authorization.
1278           Task 1: Preparation
1279           The objectives of this task are to prepare for authorization by reviewing the operations
1280           plan and confirm that the plan is consistent with [FIPS201] and the template provided in
1281           Appendix D.
1282                    Subtask 1.1: Confirm that the operations of the issuer are fully described and
1283                    documented in their operations plan.

1284                    Responsibility: EIMO
1285                    Guidance: The operations plan includes, at a minimum, the sections defined in the
1286                    operations plan template in Appendices D.1 or D.2, depending on whether the
1287                    issuer is issuing PIV Cards or derived PIV credentials. An issuer of both PIV
1288                    Cards and derived PIV credentials could develop a single operations plan that
1289                    addresses both without repeating common elements. It is the EIMO’s
1290                    responsibility to ensure that the operations plan incorporates a complete and
1291                    accurate description of the issuer’s operations. If a process or function is provided
1292                    by an external service provider, their operating procedures need to be documented
1293                    and incorporated by reference in the issuer’s operations plan. In such cases, the
1294                    operations plan could point readers to additional documentation and information.
1295                    Subtask 1.2: Confirm that the processes performed are conducted in accordance
1296                    with the policies and procedures specified in the issuer’s operations plan and are
1297                    documented in standard operating procedures.
1298                    Responsibility: EIMO, Issuing Facility Manager
1299                    Guidance: Even though an issuer follows the requirements of [FIPS201], its
1300                    processes need to be consistent within the operations plan and documented in
1301                    standard operating procedures.
1302           Task 2: Resource Identification
1303           The objectives of the resource identification task are to (i) identify and document the
1304           resources required for assisting with the assessment, (ii) identify the scope of the
1305           assessment and authorization boundary, and (iii) prepare a plan of assessment activities
1306           that indicate the proposed schedule and key milestones.
1307                    Subtask 2.1: Identify the SAO, DAO, PO, issuing facility managers, assessor, and
1308                    other key personnel at the facility level who are performing functions, such as
1309                    identity proofing/registration, card/token production, and activation/issuance (of
1310                    the PIV Card or derived PIV credential). Maintenance personnel also need to be
1311                    contacted to provide requested assessment information to the assessor.
1312                    Responsibility: EIMO
1313                    Guidance: Notify these individuals of the upcoming assessment, and inform them
1314                    of the need for their participation during the process.
1315                    Subtask 2.2: Determine the authorization boundary for the issuer.
1316                    Responsibility: EIMO, DAO
1317                    Guidance: The authorization boundary determines the target of the assessment. In
1318                    preparation for the issuer assessment, the EIMO and DAO need to identify which
1319                    issuing facilities and external service providers are to be included. This ensures
1320                    that the functions performed and processes managed by the external service
1321                    provider are considered during the authorization process. An organization could
1322                    consider including only those issuing facilities that are ready to operate within the
1323                    scope of the issuer assessment; other facilities can be assessed at a later date.

       NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                     Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
       December 2023                                                            and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

1324                    Subtask 2.3: Determine the resources and the time needed for the assessment of
1325                    the issuer, and prepare a plan to execute the assessment.
1326                    Responsibility: EIMO, Assessor, DAO
1327                    Guidance: The level of effort required for an assessment depends on numerous
1328                    factors, such as (i) the size of the issuer, (ii) the location and number of its
1329                    facilities, (iii) the level of outsourcing utilized by the issuer, and (iv) the number
1330                    of cards and/or derived PIV credentials being issued. By examining factors that
1331                    could influence the complexity of the assessment, the organization can make an
1332                    informed judgment about the size of the assessment team, the resources needed to
1333                    support the assessment, and the time frame for completing it.
1334           Task 3: Operations Plan Analysis and Acceptance
1335           The objectives of the operations plan analysis and acceptance task are to (i) determine
1336           whether the requirements of [FIPS201] have been implemented, (ii) evaluate the
1337           operations plan and revise as needed, and (iii) obtain acceptance of the plan by the DAO
1338           prior to assessing the issuer controls.
1339                    Subtask 3.1: Review the list of required issuer controls documented in the
1340                    organization’s issuer operations plan, and confirm that they have been
1341                    implemented properly.
1342                    Responsibility: DAO, EIMO
1343                    Guidance: Since the issuer controls serve as the basis for the assessment, review
1344                    the operations plan and supporting documentation to identify the controls that
1345                    need to be implemented before investing time in assessment activities, such as
1346                    interviews or testing. The operations plan documents each issuer control (whether
1347                    it is specific to the organization or facility), the owner of the issuer control, and
1348                    how the control is implemented.
1349                    Subtask 3.2: Analyze the operations plan to determine whether there are
1350                    deficiencies in satisfying all of the policies, procedures, and other requirements in
1351                    [FIPS201] that could result in a DATO being issued. After discussing the
1352                    discovered deficiencies in the documentation and operations plan with the EIMO,
1353                    the organization may still want to continue with the assessment if it has
1354                    determined that it can address all deficiencies within the time period of the current
1355                    assessment. In this situation, the DAO either authorizes continuation of the
1356                    assessment or terminates the assessment effort, depending on the evaluation of the
1357                    issuer’s ability to address the deficiencies.
1358                    Responsibility: DAO, EIMO
1359                    Guidance: The operations plan adequately addresses the policies, procedures, and
1360                    processes of the issuer so that after an initial review, deficiencies that could lead
1361                    to an eventual DATO can be identified and remediated as soon as possible.
1362                    Subtask 3.3: Verify that the operations plan is acceptable.
1363                    Responsibility: DAO




                                                          33
       NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                    Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
       December 2023                                                           and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

1364                    Guidance: If the operations plan is deemed acceptable, the DAO authorizes the
1365                    authorization processes to advance to the next phase. Acceptance of the
1366                    operations plan signifies that the resources required to initiate and complete the
1367                    authorization activities can be deployed.

1368           Assessment Phase
1369   The assessment phase consists of two tasks: (i) issuer control assessment and (ii) assessment
1370   documentation. The purpose of this phase is to determine the extent to which the requirements of
1371   [FIPS201] are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired
1372   outcomes. This phase also specifies the actions to be taken to correct all identified deficiencies.
1373   An analysis of the impacts of identified deficiencies that cannot be corrected or mitigated
1374   efficiently on the reliable operation of the issuer is conducted and documented. The successful
1375   completion of this phase provides the DAO with the information needed to make an appropriate
1376   authorization decision.
1377           Task 4: Issuer Control Assessment
1378           The objectives of this task are to (i) initiate and assess the applicable issuer controls and
1379           (ii) document the results of the assessment. The assessor first verifies the acceptability of
1380           all documentation, including the operations plan and previous assessments, along with all
1381           relevant federal laws, regulations, standards, and directives. Issuer control assessment
1382           then commences. The assessor also schedules interviews and real-time observations of
1383           issuance processes and initiates all needed testing of the PIV Card, derived PIV
1384           credential, and relevant information system components. Once the assessor has gathered
1385           the results of the assessment procedures, they prepare descriptions of all discovered
1386           deficiencies along with recommendations for addressing and remediating those
1387           deficiencies.
1388                    Subtask 4.1: Review the suggested and selected assessment methods for each
1389                    issuer control in preparation for the assessment.
1390                    Responsibility: Assessor
1391                    Guidance: The scope of the assessment is established based on the authorization
1392                    boundary. The assessor reviews the selected assessment procedures (based on the
1393                    scope of the assessment) in order to plan and coordinate activities for the
1394                    assessment. For example, if a particular issuer control requires the observation of
1395                    a particular process, the assessor needs to schedule the activity in a timely fashion
1396                    after coordinating with the issuing facility management. The assessor, as directed
1397                    by the DAO, may supplement the assessment methods and procedures
1398                    recommended in these guidelines. Assessment methods and procedures may be
1399                    created or tailored for a particular issuer.
1400                    Subtask 4.2: Assemble all documentation and the supporting materials necessary
1401                    for the assessment of the issuer. If these documents include previous assessments,
1402                    review the findings, and determine whether they are applicable to the current
1403                    assessment.
1404                    Responsibility: EIMO, Assessor

       NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                    Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
       December 2023                                                           and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

1405                    Guidance: The EIMO assists the assessor in gathering all relevant documents and
1406                    supporting materials from the organization that are required during the assessment
1407                    of the issuer. The operations plan is central to this effort. The issuer’s operations
1408                    are completely described in the operations plan. The operations plan also includes
1409                    or points to the supporting materials. In this case, the EIMO needs to gather the
1410                    supporting material for the assessor. Examples of other documentation include (i)
1411                    letters of appointment; (ii) privacy-related documentation; (iii) information forms
1412                    utilized by the issuer; (iv) documentation from each outsourced service provider,
1413                    including control implementation specifics, support and service-level agreements,
1414                    and contracts; (v) standard operating procedures for the issuing facilities within
1415                    the authorization boundary; and (vi) signed authorization letters under [SP800-37]
1416                    for all information systems.
1417                    The assessor is strongly encouraged to review the results of any previous
1418                    assessments, including the one on which the current ATO is based. The assessor
1419                    might satisfy some of the issuer control assessment requirements by reviewing
1420                    and referencing previous assessment reports. Although previous assessments
1421                    cannot be used as a substitute for the current assessment, they provide insight on
1422                    problems that could have existed in the past.
1423                    Subtask 4.3: Assess the required issuer controls using the prescribed assessment
1424                    procedures found in Appendices G.1 and G.2 based on the scope of the issuance
1425                    functions.
1426                    Responsibility: Assessor
1427                    Guidance: The assessor performs the assessment procedures selected for each
1428                    issuer control to determine whether they have been implemented correctly, are
1429                    operating as intended, and producing the desired outcomes. The assessor uses the
1430                    assessment methods specified in Sec. 4.1. The documentation collected in the
1431                    previous task is reviewed, and any deficiencies are identified. Interviews can be
1432                    used as an opportunity to clarify issues encountered during a review of the
1433                    issuer’s documentation and to determine the expertise of the personnel performing
1434                    key PIV functions. Processes need to be observed to ensure that PIV components
1435                    have been configured and are operating in a PIV-compliant manner.
1436                    As part of an assessment, all applicable issuer controls need to be assessed. If PIV
1437                    or derived PIV services have been outsourced to an external provider, the assessor
1438                    verifies that the issuer controls that apply to those services are assessed, and the
1439                    reliability of the service provider is found to be satisfactory. If an issuer and its
1440                    facilities have already been assessed and are operating under a current ATO and
1441                    the purpose of the assessment is to add a facility to the authorization letter, the
1442                    assessor can reuse the results of a previous assessment for the organization-level
1443                    issuer controls and assess a random sample of the new issuing facilities.
1444                    Subtask 4.4: Prepare the assessment report.
1445                    Responsibility: Assessor
1446                    Guidance: The assessment report contains (i) the results of the assessment, (ii)
1447                    recommendations for correcting deficiencies, and (iii) the residual risk to the


                                                         35
       NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                   Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
       December 2023                                                          and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

1448                    organization if those deficiencies are not corrected or mitigated. The assessment
1449                    report is the assessor’s statement of the results of analyzing and evaluating the
1450                    issuer’s implementation of controls. The sample assessment report in Appendix E
1451                    provides a template for documenting the results after assessing the issuer controls.
1452           Task 5: Assessment Documentation
1453           This task consists of the assessor submitting the assessment report to the EIMO, who then
1454           adds the issuer’s operations plan (revised, if necessary) and the CAP to generate an
1455           authorization submission package for the DAO. If the assessment report contains
1456           deficiencies, the EIMO might choose to address some deficiencies based on the
1457           assessor’s recommendations and revise the operations plan (if needed) before submitting
1458           the package for authorization.
1459                    Subtask 5.1: Provide the EIMO with the assessment report.
1460                    Responsibility: Assessor
1461                    Guidance: The EIMO relies on the expertise, experience, and judgment of the
1462                    assessor to (i) provide recommendations on how to correct deficiencies in the
1463                    planned or performed operations and (ii) understand the potential impacts of those
1464                    deficiencies. The EIMO can choose to act on selected recommendations of the
1465                    assessor before the authorization package is finalized. Any actions taken by the
1466                    EIMO prior to the final authorization decision need to be coordinated with the
1467                    DAO to optimize the utilization of resources across the organization. The assessor
1468                    reviews any changes made in response to the corrective actions and revises the
1469                    assessment report, as appropriate.
1470                    Subtask 5.2: Revise the operations plan (if necessary), and implement its new
1471                    provisions.
1472                    Responsibility: EIMO
1473                    Guidance: The revised operations plan includes all of the changes made in
1474                    response to the assessor’s recommendations for corrective actions.
1475                    Subtask 5.3: Prepare the CAP.
1476                    Responsibility: EIMO
1477                    Guidance: The CAP is one of the three primary documents in the authorization
1478                    submission package and describes actions that need to be taken by the EIMO to
1479                    correct the deficiencies identified in Task 4, Issuer Control Assessment. The CAP
1480                    identifies (i) the tasks to be accomplished, (ii) the resources required to
1481                    accomplish the tasks, (iii) scheduled completion dates for the tasks, and (iv) the
1482                    person responsible for completing each of the tasks.
1483                    Subtask 5.4: Assemble the authorization submission package, and submit it to the
1484                    DAO.
1485                    Responsibility: EIMO
1486                    Guidance: The EIMO is responsible for the assembly and compilation of the

       NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                    Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
       December 2023                                                           and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

1488                    (i) the final assessment report, (ii) the CAP, (iii) the revised operations plan, and
1489                    (iv) the [SP800-37] authorization letters for all information systems used by the
1490                    issuer. The EIMO may wish to consult other key organization participants (e.g.,
1491                    the assessor, PO) prior to submitting the authorization submission package to the
1492                    DAO. The authorization submission package can be submitted in either paper or
1493                    electronic form. The contents of the authorization submission package need to be
1494                    protected in accordance with organization policy.

1495           Authorization Phase
1496   The authorization phase consists of two tasks: (i) making an appropriate authorization decision
1497   and (ii) completing the authorization documentation. Upon completion of this phase, the EIMO
1498   will have one of the following: (i) an authorization to operate the issuer’s services, as defined in
1499   its operations plan; (ii) an interim authorization to operate under specific terms and conditions; or
1500   (iii) a denial of authorization to operate.
1501           Task 6: Authorization Decision
1502           The authorization decision task determines whether the assessment phase has been
1503           satisfactorily completed so that a recommendation on the operation of the issuer can be
1504           made with assurance. The DAO works with the assessor to review the contents of the
1505           assessment submission package, the identified and uncorrected or uncorrectable
1506           deficiencies, the potential impacts of using the issuer’s services, and the CAP to
1507           determine the final risk to the organization and the acceptability of that risk in light of the
1508           organization’s mission.
1509                    Subtask 6.1: Review the authorization decision package to see if it is complete and
1510                    if all applicable issuer controls are fully assessed using the designated assessment
1511                    procedures.
1512                    Responsibility: DAO
1513                    Guidance: Coverage for all issuer controls and proper adherence to assessment
1514                    procedures and appropriate assessment methods help create confidence in
1515                    assessment findings and is the main objective of the assessment review. Part of
1516                    the assessment review also includes understanding the impacts of the identified
1517                    deficiencies on the organization’s operations, assets, and individuals.
1518                    Subtask 6.2: Determine whether the risk to the organization’s operations, assets,
1519                    or potentially affected individuals is acceptable.
1520                    Responsibility: DAO
1521                    Guidance: After the completion of the assessment review, the DAO has a clear
1522                    understanding of the impacts of deficiencies. This helps the DAO judge which
1523                    deficiencies are of greatest concern to the organization and which can be tolerated
1524                    without creating unreasonable organization-level risk. The CAP is also considered
1525                    when determining the risk to the organization in terms of when and how the
1526                    EIMO intends to address the known deficiencies. The DAO may consult the
1527                    EIMO, assessor, or other organization officials before completing the final risk
1528                    evaluation. This risk evaluation then determines the degree of acceptability of

       NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                    Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
       December 2023                                                           and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

1529                    issuer operations. The logic for using the latter as the basis for an authorization
1530                    decision is described in Sec. 2.10.
1531                    Subtask 6.3: Share the authorization package with an independent party for
1532                    review, and arrive at an authorization decision.
1533                    Responsibility: DAO
1534                    Guidance: Before providing the final authorization decision, the DAO may seek
1535                    an independent review of the risks involved in the issuer operations. If the DAO
1536                    finds it necessary, the DAO shares the results of the assessment and the perceived
1537                    risks with another issuer (e.g., another agency that issues PIV Cards or derived
1538                    PIV credentials) to get their opinion and establish trustworthiness in the issued
1539                    credentials.
1540           Task 7: Authorization Documentation
1541           The authorization documentation task includes (i) completing and transmitting the
1542           authorization decision package to the appropriate individuals and organizations and (ii)
1543           updating the issuer’s operations plan.
1544                    Subtask 7.1: Provide copies of the authorization decision package in either paper
1545                    or electronic form to the EIMO and any other organization officials who have
1546                    interests, roles, or responsibilities in the issuer’s operations.
1547                    Responsibility: DAO
1548                    Guidance: The authorization decision package, including the authorization
1549                    decision letter, is transmitted to the EIMO. Upon receipt of the authorization
1550                    decision package, the EIMO reviews the authorization and its terms and
1551                    conditions. The original authorization decision package is kept on file by the
1552                    EIMO. The DAO retains copies of the contents of the authorization decision
1553                    package. The authorization decision package needs to be appropriately
1554                    safeguarded and stored in a centralized organization filing system whenever
1555                    possible to ensure accessibility. The authorization decision package is made
1556                    available to authorized auditors and oversight organizations upon request. The
1557                    authorization decision package needs to be retained in accordance with the
1558                    organization’s records retention policy. The issuer and specific facilities are
1559                    authorized for a maximum of three years from the date of the ATO. After the
1560                    period ends, reauthorization is performed.
1561                    Subtask 7.2: Update the operations plan.
1562                    Responsibility: EIMO
1563                    Guidance: The operations plan needs to be updated to reflect all changes made as
1564                    a result of the assessment and authorization. All conditions of the issuer’s
1565                    operations that are set forth in the authorization decision need to be noted in the
1566                    plan and addressed in a timely manner, as conveyed by the DAO.

       NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                    Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
       December 2023                                                           and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

1567           Monitoring Phase
1568   The Monitoring Phase consists of two tasks: (i) operations plan maintenance and (ii) an annual
1569   life cycle walkthrough. Based on the importance of reliably creating and issuing PIV Cards and
1570   derived PIV credentials, it is imperative that once the authorization is completed, the issuer’s
1571   operations are monitored to ensure that policies, procedures, and processes remain in effect as
1572   originally intended. There can be significant changes in an issuer’s policies, management,
1573   operations personnel, and available technology during a three-year ATO. These changes need to
1574   be monitored so that the organization minimizes exposing itself to security and privacy threats
1575   that exist or arise after the authorization of the issuer. For example, if there is significant staff
1576   turnover, the organization needs to be sure that new staff are performing the PIV functions using
1577   the same reliable processes that were previously approved. The overall responsibility for
1578   monitoring lies with the EIMO and the DAO.
1579   An annual life cycle walkthrough of issuer operations involves reviewing all of the services and
1580   functions of an issuer and its facilities for continued reliability. The annual walkthrough covers
1581   the life cycle of PIV Card and derived PIV credential from sponsorship to maintenance.
1582   Observation of the full life cycle ensures that all processes are still reliably operating as assessed
1583   during the authorization.
1584           Task 8: Operations Plan Update
1585           An operations plan serves as the primary description on how PIV Cards or derived PIV
1586           credentials are being issued by the issuer. It is essential that this document be updated as
1587           changes occur in the issuer’s operations. Management will be able to analyze the impacts
1588           of changes as they occur and be significantly better prepared when reauthorization is
1589           required.
1590                    Subtask 8.1: Document all relevant changes in the issuance processes within the
1591                    operations plan.
1592                    Responsibility: EIMO
1593                    Guidance: If changes are made to the information system, the issuer needs to
1594                    update the operations plan, PIV Card, derived PIV credential, privacy policies,
1595                    roles and responsibilities, and issuer controls.
1596                    Subtask 8.2: Analyze the proposed or actual changes to the issuer, and determine
1597                    the impacts of such changes.
1598                    Responsibility: EIMO
1599                    Guidance: If the results of the impact analysis indicate that changes to the issuer
1600                    affect the reliability of its operations, the changes and impacts need to be reported
1601                    to the DAO, corrective actions need to be initiated, and the CAP needs to be
1602                    updated. If major changes have occurred, the issuer will need to be reauthorized.
1603           Task 9: Annual Life Cycle Walkthrough
1604           The annual life cycle walkthrough is a monitoring activity to be performed by the issuer
1605           when its PIV Card or derived PIV credential issuing services begin and annually
1606           thereafter. The EIMO (or designated appointee) is responsible for observing and
1607           reviewing the entire life cycle of the PIV Card or derived PIV credential. This


                                                         39
       NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                     Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
       December 2023                                                            and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

1608           walkthrough is intended to provide an accurate and holistic view of the issuer’s
1609           operations and reliability at a point in time. Any potential impacts to the reliability of the
1610           issuer’s operations and risks to the organization need to be documented and presented to
1611           the EIMO and the DAO.
1612                    Subtask 9.1: Observe all of the processes involved in getting a PIV Card or a
1613                    derived PIV credential, including those from sponsorship to maintenance.
1614                    Observe each process, and compare its controls against the applicable list of
1615                    required issuer controls. If an issuer has several facilities, this process needs to be
1616                    repeated using randomly selected issuing facilities.
1617                    Responsibility: EIMO (or designated appointee)
1618                    Guidance: As part of the walkthrough, the EIMO (or designated appointee)
1619                    observes the processes followed for new employees and contractors (if different)
1620                    as well any maintenance processes, such as termination, reissuance, or renewals.
1621                    The EIMO (or designated appointee) observes each process and compares it to the
1622                    documented steps for the issuer and the associated issuer controls. An annual
1623                    walkthrough is required until reauthorization is initiated.
1624                    Subtask 9.2: The results of the life cycle walkthrough are summarized in a report
1625                    to the DAO. The report highlights any deficiencies and the corrective actions that
1626                    need to be implemented to correct those deficiencies.
1627                    Responsibility: EIMO, DAO
1628                    Guidance: The EIMO (or designated appointee) documents the results of the
1629                    walkthrough, which are recorded in the assessment report template included in
1630                    Appendix E. All deficiencies need to be highlighted, and a plan for correcting
1631                    each deficiency needs to be documented. The DAO decides whether any
1632                    deficiency is significant enough to require a change of the issuer’s ATO status.

1898   maintenance
1899   The process of managing PIV Cards or derived PIV credentials once they are issued, including reissuance, post-
1900   issuance updates, and termination.

1901   mobile device
1902   A portable computing device that (i) has a small form factor such that it can easily be carried by a single individual;
1903   (ii) is designed to operate without a physical connection (e.g., wirelessly transmit or receive information); (iii)
1904   possesses local, non-removable, or removable data storage; and (iv) includes a self-contained power source. Mobile
1905   devices may also include voice communication capabilities, on-board sensors that allow the devices to capture
1906   information, and/or built-in features for synchronizing local data with remote locations. Examples include smart
1907   phones, tablets, and e-readers.

1908   personally identifiable information (PII)
1909   Any representation of information that permits the identity of an individual to whom the information applies to be
1910   reasonably inferred by either direct or indirect means. [E-GOV]

1911   PIV Card
1912   The physical artifact (e.g., identity card, “smart” card) issued to an applicant by an issuer that contains stored
1913   identity markers or credentials (e.g., a photograph, cryptographic keys, digitized fingerprint representations) so that
1914   the claimed identity of the cardholder can be verified against the stored credentials by another person (i.e., human-
1915   readable and verifiable) or an automated process (i.e., computer-readable and verifiable).

1916   PIV credential
1917   Evidence that attests to one’s right to credit or authority that authoritatively binds an identity (and, optionally,
1918   additional attributes) to an individual.

1919   PIV identity account
1920   The logical record that contains credentialing information for a given PIV cardholder. This is stored within the
1921   issuer’s identity management system and includes PIV enrollment data, cardholder identity attributes, and
1922   information regarding the cardholder’s PIV Card and any derived PIV credentials bound to the account.

1923   post-enrollment binding
1924   An association of the issued derived PIV credential to the subscriber’s PIV identity account, as specified in [SP800-
1925   63B].

1926   registration
1927   Making a person’s identity known to the enrollment/identity management information system by associating a
1928   unique identifier with that identity and collecting and recording the person’s relevant attributes into the information
1929   system. Registration is required for adjudication, card/credential personalization and issuance, and maintenance,
1930   which are necessary to issue or maintain a PIV Card or derived PIV credential. Attributes about a cardholder and
1931   derived PIV credential holder may also be recorded in the individual’s PIV identity account.

1932   risk
1933   The level of potential impact on an organization’s operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), its
1934   assets, or individuals of a threat or a given likelihood of that threat occurring.

1935   senior authorizing official (SAO)
1936   A senior organization official who has budgetary control, provides oversight, develops policy, and has authority
1937   over all functions and services provided by the issuer.

1938   subscriber
1939   A PIV cardholder to whom a derived PIV credential has been issued.

1940   system of record (SOR)
1941   A group of records under the control of a federal agency that contain a personal identifier (e.g., a name, date of birth,
1942   fingerprint, Social Security Number, Employee Number) and one other item of personal data (e.g., home address,
1943   performance rating, and blood type) from which information is retrieved using a personal identifier.

1948   Appendix C. Issuer Readiness Review Checklist
1949   The readiness review checklist is to be used by the organization while preparing for an
1950   assessment of their issuer. The checklist may also be used to validate that all relevant
1951   documentation is collected and that appropriate individuals have been identified and made
1952   available to the assessment team.

       been consulted and has reviewed the assessment (if
       needed).
       The PIV system is operational, and actual PIV
       processes can be observed by the assessment team.
       PIV Cards or derived PIV Credential tokens are ready
       to be personalized and can be used for testing by the
       assessment team.
       Personalized PIV Cards and/or derived PIV
       credentials are submitted on an annual basis to the

1955   Appendix D. Operations Plan Templates
1956   Appendices D.1 and D.2 are suggested outlines for a PCI and DPCI, respectively. It is highly
1957   recommended that an organization follow these templates to comprehensively document its
1958   operations in support of a successful authorization. An issuer of both PIV Cards and derived PIV
1959   credentials can develop a single operations plan that addresses all requirements without repeating
1960   common elements of the plan.

2213   Subject: Authorization Decision for [PCI/DPCI]
2214   After reviewing the results of the authorization package of the [PCI/DPCI NAME], I have
2215   determined that its policies, procedures, and processes comply with both [FIPS201] and our
2216   organization’s own policies, regulations, and standards. Accordingly, I am issuing an
2217   authorization to operate (ATO). [PIV Card and/or derived PIV credential] issuance services are
2218   authorized without any restrictions or limitations. This authorization is my formal declaration
2219   that the requirements of [HSPD-12] are being satisfied.
2220   This ATO also applies to issuing facilities under this [ISSUER]. Included is a list of facilities
2221   authorized to operate under this authorization decision.
2222   This authorization and ATO will remain in effect for 3 years from the date of this letter if (i) all
2223   required documentation is updated annually; (ii) a life cycle walkthrough is completed annually,
2224   and the results are sent to me within 30 days of completion; and (iii) no deficiencies are
2225   identified during the walkthrough that would increase the risk to the organization’s mission.
2226   A copy of this letter and all supporting authorization documentation shall be retained in
2227   accordance with the organization’s record retention schedule.

2235   From: Designated Authorizing Official                        Date:
2236   To: Enterprise Identity Management Official
2237   Subject: Authorization Decision for [PCI/DPCI]
2238   After reviewing the results of the assessment of [ISSUER NAME], I have determined that the
2239   requirements identified in [FIPS201] and the organization’s policies, regulations, and standards
2240   have not been implemented satisfactorily. However, I have also determined that there is an
2241   overarching need for the issuance services to continue due to mission necessity and other
2242   considerations. Accordingly, I am issuing an interim authorization to operate (IATO). Operation
2243   of the [ISSUER] shall be performed in accordance with the enclosed terms and conditions during
2244   the IATO period. The [ISSUER] is not considered authorized during this IATO period.
2245   This IATO also applies to facilities under the [ISSUER]. Included is a list of facilities authorized
2246   to operate during this interim period, along with specific limitations or restrictions that apply.
2247   This interim authorization to operate is valid until close of business on <date> [not to exceed
2248   three months]. This interim authorization will remain in effect as long as (i) the required status
2249   reports for the [ISSUER] are submitted to this office every month, (ii) the problems or
2250   deficiencies reported from the authorization do not result in additional risk that is deemed
2251   unacceptable, and (iii) continued progress is being made to reduce or eliminate the deficiencies
2252   in accordance with the corrective actions plan (CAP). At the end of IATO period, the [ISSUER]
2253   must be ready to receive an authorization to operate. A second IATO will be granted only in
2254   extenuating circumstances. This office will review the CAP submitted with the authorization
2255   package during the IATO period and monitor progress on the removal or reduction of concerns
2256   and discrepancies before reauthorization is initiated.
2257   A copy of this letter and all supporting authorization documentation shall be retained in

2268   Subject: Authorization Decision for [PCI/DPCI]
2269   After reviewing the results of the assessment of [ISSUER NAME] and the supporting evidence
2270   provided in the associated authorization package, I have determined that the requirements
2271   identified in [FIPS201] and the organization’s policies, regulations, and standards are not being
2272   met by the [ISSUER]. Accordingly, I am issuing a denial of authorization to operate (DATO) to
2273   the [ISSUER] and its issuing facilities. The [ISSUER] is not authorized and [MAY NOT BE
2274   PLACED INTO OPERATION OR ALL CURRENT OPERATIONS MUST BE HALTED].
2275   The corrective actions plan (CAP) is to be pursued immediately to ensure that proactive
2276   measures are taken to correct the deficiencies found during the assessment. Reauthorization is to
2277   be initiated at the earliest opportunity to determine the effectiveness of correcting the
2278   deficiencies.

2287   Appendix G. Issuer Controls and Assessment Procedures
2288   Appendices G.1 and G.2 list issuer controls that are applicable to a PCI and DPCI, respectively.
2289   An issuer must comply with all applicable requirements, with applicability determined by
2290   whether the organization issues the mandatory PIV Cards, the optional derived PIV credentials
2291   (if implemented), or both.

2292   G.1.     Controls and Assessment Procedures for PCIs
2293   The following tables list the set of issuer controls applicable to PCIs. Control descriptions and
2294   assessment procedures have been updated in this revision of SP 800-79 based on updates to
2295   [FIPS201] and its supporting publications. Control identifiers have been labeled with “NEW” or
2296   “UPDATED” to clearly identify whether an existing issuer control has been added or updated,
2297   respectively. Additionally, controls that were either (i) withdrawn in the previous version of SP
2298   800-79 or (ii) moved to or combined with another control in the previous version of SP 800-79
2299   have been removed from this version for the sake of conciseness and brevity.
2300   A control labeled with “NEW” represents an issuer control that has been added to the issuer
2301   control catalog. This does not necessarily represent a new requirement added to [FIPS201]. A
2302   “NEW” control signifies that a requirement in [FIPS201] needs to be explicitly assessed to
2303   ensure that the PCI is compliant with the necessary requirements associated with PIV Card
2304   issuance and maintenance. Controls labeled with “UPDATED” represent an existing issuer
2305   control for which the control description and assessment procedures have been revised
2306   considerably, though the overall intent of the control has not changed from the prior version.

                authentication mechanisms. If the biometric verification decision is negative
                or the cardholder’s biometric characteristics are not successfully acquired,
                the cardholder provides another identity source document, and an
                attending operator inspects it and compares the cardholder with the
                electronic facial image retrieved from the enrollment data record and the
                photograph printed on the card.

                Assessment
                Determine that:
                   (i) The reset PIV Card is released to the cardholder only after a

                       the photograph printed on the card (interview, observe).
    MP-13       When a PIN reset is performed at an unattended issuer-operated kiosk, the [FIPS201], Sec. 2.9.3.1 – PIN
  (UPDATED)     issuer ensures that the PIV Card is authenticated and that the cardholder’s Reset
                biometric characteristics elicit a positive biometric verification decision
                when compared to biometric data records stored in the PIV enrollment
                record or when compared to the biometric data records on the PIV Card
                using the OCC-AUTH authentication mechanism. If the biometric
                verification decision is negative or the cardholder’s biometric characteristics
                are not successfully acquired, the session is terminated, and the kiosk does
                not reset the PIV Card.

                Assessment
                Determine that:
                  (i) The reset PIV Card is only released to the cardholder after a
                      positive biometric verification decision (review, observe).

                initiates a PIN reset with the issuer operator, (ii) the operator authenticates
                the owner of the PIV Card through an independent procedure (e.g.,
                authenticating the cardholder with an associated derived PIV credential or
                by confirming reset via email to the on-record government-issued email
                address), and (iii) the cardholder’s biometric characteristics elicit a positive
                biometric verification decision when compared to the stored biometric data
                records on the PIV Card through the OCC-AUTH authentication
                mechanism.

                another primary identity source document via the scanners and sensors
                integrated into the station. The remote operator inspects the document and
                compares the video feed of the cardholder with the electronic facial image
                retrieved from the enrollment data record and the photograph printed on the
                PIV Card.

                Assessment
                Determine that:
                   (i) All protections and requirements of [FIPS201], Sec. 2.7.1 are
                       observed during the procedure (review, observe).
                  (ii) The PIV Card PIN is only reset after a positive biometric verification
                       decision (review, observe).
                 (iii) If the biometric verification decision is negative, the cardholder
                       provides another primary identity source document via the scanners
                       and sensors integrated into the station. The remote operator
                       inspects the document and compares the video feed of the
                       cardholder with the electronic facial image retrieved from the
                       enrollment data record and the photograph printed on the PIV Card
                       (interview, observe).
    MP-22       When an OCC reset is performed in person at the issuing facility, the issuer [FIPS201], Sec. 2.9.3 – OCC Reset
    (NEW)       performs a biometric verification of the cardholder to the biometric data
                records in the PIV enrollment record before the reset. If the biometric
                verification decision is negative or no alternative biometric data records are
                available, the cardholder provides another primary identity source
                document, which is inspected and compared to the cardholder with the
                electronic facial image retrieved from the enrollment data record and the
                photograph printed on the PIV Card.

                Assessment
                Determine that:
                   (i) Both fingerprints used for OCC are replaced during an OCC reset
                       (observe, test).
                  (ii) The reset PIV Card is only released to the cardholder after a
                       positive biometric verification decision (review, observe).

                       cardholder’s biometric characteristics captured at the station elicit a positive
                       biometric verification decision when compared to biometric data records

2332   G.2.     Controls and Assessment Procedures for DPCIs
2333   The following tables specify the controls and assessment procedures for derived PIV credential
2334   issuance. Unlike for a PIV Card issuer, not all controls are applicable to a derived PIV credential
2335   issuer as the issuance of a derived PIV credential is an instance of post-enrollment binding,
2336   which leverages the identity proofing and vetting associated with an existing PIV identity
2337   account. Certain issuer controls are only applicable to AAL2 or AAL3 derived PIV credentials
2338   and must therefore be implemented by the issuer only if they are issuing that level of a derived
2339   PIV credential. Similarly, certain issuer controls are applicable to PKI-based derived PIV
2340   credentials, while some are applicable to non-PKI-based derived PIV credentials. This is
2341   represented via the “applicability” columns, which identify whether the issuer control needs to be
2342   met by a PKI-based or non-PKI, AAL2, or AAL3 derived PIV credential issuer. If the
2343   “applicability” column states “DPCI,” then the issuer control is applicable to all derived
2344   credential issuers, regardless of what type of derived PIV credential is issued by the issuer.
