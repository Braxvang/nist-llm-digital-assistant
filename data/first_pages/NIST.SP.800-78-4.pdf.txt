1         Introduction

Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) mandated the creation of new standards
for interoperable identity credentials for physical and logical access to federal government
locations and systems. Federal Information Processing Standard 201 (FIPS 201), Personal
Identity Verification (PIV) of Federal Employees and Contractors, was developed to establish
standards for identity credentials [FIPS201]. This document, NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-
78-4, specifies the cryptographic algorithms and key sizes for PIV systems and is a companion
document to FIPS 201-2.

1.1       Purpose

FIPS 201-2 defines requirements for the PIV lifecycle activities including identity proofing,
registration, PIV Card issuance, and PIV Card usage. FIPS 201-2 also defines the structure of an
identity credential that includes cryptographic keys. This document contains the technical
specifications needed for the mandatory and optional cryptographic keys specified in FIPS 201-2
as well as the supporting infrastructure specified in FIPS 201-2 and the related NIST Special
Publication 800-73-4, Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification [SP800-73], and SP 800-76-2,
Biometric Specifications for Personal Identity Verification [SP800-76], that rely on
cryptographic functions.

1.2       Scope

The scope of this Recommendation encompasses the PIV Card, infrastructure components that
support issuance and management of the PIV Card, and applications that rely on the credentials
supported by the PIV Card to provide security services. The Recommendation identifies
acceptable symmetric and asymmetric encryption algorithms, digital signature algorithms, key
establishment schemes, and message digest algorithms, and specifies mechanisms to identify the
algorithms associated with PIV keys or digital signatures.

Algorithms and key sizes have been selected for consistency with applicable federal standards
and to ensure adequate cryptographic strength for PIV applications. All cryptographic algorithms
employed in this specification provide at least 112 bits of security strength. For detailed guidance
on the strength of cryptographic algorithms, see [SP800-57(1)], Recommendation on Key
Management – Part 1: General.

1.3       Audience and Assumptions

This document is targeted at federal agencies and implementers of PIV systems. Readers are
assumed to have a working knowledge of cryptography and public key infrastructure (PKI)
technology.

2       Application of Cryptography in FIPS 201-2

FIPS 201-2 employs cryptographic mechanisms to authenticate cardholders, secure information
stored on the PIV Card, and secure the supporting infrastructure.

FIPS 201-2 and its supporting documents specify a suite of keys to be stored on the PIV Card for
personal identity verification, digital signature generation, and key management. The PIV
cryptographic keys specified in FIPS 201-2 and SP 800-73-4 are:

    +    the asymmetric PIV Authentication key;
    +    an asymmetric Card Authentication key;
    +    a symmetric Card Authentication key;
    +    an asymmetric digital signature key for signing documents and messages;
    +    an asymmetric key management key, supporting key establishment or key transport, and
         up to twenty retired key management keys;
    +    a symmetric PIV Card Application Administration Key; and
    +    an asymmetric PIV Secure Messaging key, supporting the establishment of session keys
         for use with secure messaging.
The cryptographic algorithms, key sizes, and parameters that may be used for these keys are
specified in Section 3.1. PIV Cards must implement private key computations for one or more of
the algorithms identified in this section.

Cryptographically protected objects specified in FIPS 201-2, SP 800-73-4, and SP 800-76-2
include:

    +    the X.509 certificates for each asymmetric key on the PIV Card, except the PIV Secure
         Messaging key;
    +    a secure messaging card verifiable certificate (CVC) for the PIV Secure Messaging key;
    +    an Intermediate CVC for the public key needed to verify the signature on the secure
         messaging CVC;
    +    a digitally signed Card Holder Unique Identifier (CHUID);
    +    digitally signed biometrics using the Common Biometric Exchange Formats Framework
         (CBEFF) signature block; and
    +    the SP 800-73-4 Security Object, which is a digitally signed hash table.
The cryptographic algorithms, key sizes, and parameters that may be used to protect these
objects are specified in Section 3.2. Certification authorities (CA) and card management systems
that protect these objects must support one or more of the cryptographic algorithms, key sizes,
and parameters specified in Section 3.2.



                                                  3
Special Publication 800-78-4                             Cryptographic Algorithms and Key Sizes for PIV



Applications may be designed to use any or all of the cryptographic keys and objects stored on
the PIV Card. Where maximum interoperability is required, applications should support all of the
identified algorithms, key sizes, and parameters specified in Sections 3.1 and 3.2.

FIPS 201-2 requires CAs and Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) responders to generate
and distribute digitally signed certificate revocation lists (CRL) and OCSP status messages,
respectively. These certificate status mechanisms support validation of the PIV Card, the PIV
cardholder, the cardholder’s digital signature key, and the cardholder’s key management key.

The signed certificate status mechanisms specified in FIPS 201-2 are:

    +   X.509 CRLs that specify the status of a group of X.509 certificates; and
    +   OCSP status response messages that specify the status of a particular X.509 certificate.
The cryptographic algorithms, key sizes, and parameters that may be used to sign these
mechanisms are specified in Section 4. Section 4 also describes rules for encoding the signatures
to ensure interoperability.

FIPS 201-2 permits optional card management operations. These operations may only be
performed after the PIV Card authenticates the card management system. Card management
systems are authenticated through the use of PIV Card Application Administration Keys. The
cryptographic algorithms and key sizes that may be used for these keys are specified in Section
5.

3         On Card Cryptographic Requirements

FIPS 201-2 identifies a suite of objects that are stored on the PIV Card for use in authentication
mechanisms or in other security protocols. These objects may be divided into three classes:
cryptographic keys, signed authentication information stored on the PIV Card, and message
digests of information stored on the PIV Card. Cryptographic requirements for PIV keys are
detailed in Section 3.1. Cryptographic requirements for other stored objects are detailed
in Section 3.2.

3.1       PIV Cryptographic Keys

FIPS 201-2 and SP 800-73-4 specify six different classes of cryptographic keys to be used as
credentials by the PIV cardholder:

      +    the mandatory PIV Authentication key;
      +    the mandatory asymmetric Card Authentication key;
      +    an optional symmetric Card Authentication key;
      +    a conditionally mandatory digital signature key;
      +    a conditionally mandatory key management key; 1 and
      +    an optional asymmetric key to establish session keys for secure messaging.
Table 3-1 establishes specific requirements for cryptographic algorithms and key sizes for each
key type.

In addition to the key sizes, keys must be generated using secure parameters. Rivest, Shamir,
Adleman (RSA) keys must be generated using a public exponent of 65 537. Elliptic curve keys
must correspond to one of the following recommended curves from [FIPS186]:

      +    Curve P-256; or
      +    Curve P-384.
To promote interoperability, this specification further limits PIV Authentication and Card
Authentication elliptic curve keys to a single curve (P-256). 2 PIV cryptographic keys for digital
signatures and key management may use P-256 or P-384, based on application requirements.
There is no phase out date specified for either curve.

If the PIV Card Application supports the virtual contact interface [SP800-73] and the digital
signature key, the key management key, or any of the retired key management keys are elliptic
curve keys corresponding to Curve P-384, then the PIV Secure Messaging key shall use P-384,
otherwise it may use P-256 or P-384.
1
  The digital signature and key management keys are mandatory if the cardholder has a government-issued email
account at the time of credential issuance.
2
  To reduce computation times for authentication for physical access, it is recommended that the asymmetric Card
Authentication key be an elliptic curve key rather than an RSA key.

                   key


While this specification requires that the RSA public exponent associated with PIV keys be
65 537, applications should be able to process RSA public keys that have any public exponent
that is an odd positive integer greater than or equal to 65 537 and less than 2256.

This specification requires that the key management key must be an RSA key transport key or an
Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key. The specifications for RSA key transport are
[PKCS1] and [SP800-56B]; the specification for ECDH is [SP800-56A].

3.2       Authentication Information Stored on the PIV Card
3.2.1      Specification of Digital Signatures on Authentication Information

FIPS 201-2 requires the use of digital signatures to protect the integrity and authenticity of
information stored on the PIV Card. FIPS 201-2 and SP 800-73-4 require digital signatures on
the following objects stored on the PIV Card:

      +    X.509 public key certificates;
      +    the optional secure messaging card verifiable certificate (CVC);
      +    the optional Intermediate CVC;
      +    the CHUID;
      +    biometric information (e.g., fingerprints); and
      +    the SP 800-73-4 Security Object.
Approved digital signature algorithms are specified in [FIPS186]. Table 3-2 provides specific
requirements for public key algorithms and key sizes, hash algorithms, and padding schemes for
generating digital signatures for digitally signed information stored on the PIV Card. Agencies
are cautioned that generating digital signatures with elliptic curve algorithms may initially limit
interoperability.

 3TDEA is Triple DES using Keying Option 1 from [SP800-67], which requires that all three keys be unique (i.e.,
Key1 ≠ Key2, Key2 ≠ Key3, and Key3 ≠ Key1).

Note: As of January 1, 2011, only SHA-256 may be used to generate RSA signatures on PIV
objects. RSA signatures may use either the PKCS #1 v1.5 padding scheme or the Probabilistic
Signature Scheme (PSS) padding as defined in [PKCS1]. The PSS padding scheme object
identifier (OID) is independent of the hash algorithm; the hash algorithm is specified as a
parameter (for details, see [PKCS1]).

The secure messaging CVC shall be signed using ECDSA (Curve P-256) with SHA-256 if it
contains an ECDH (Curve P-256) subject public key, and shall be signed using ECDSA (Curve
P-384) with SHA-384 otherwise. The Intermediate CVC shall be signed using RSA with SHA-
256 and PKCS #1 v1.5 padding.

FIPS 201-2, SP 800-73-4, and SP 800-76-2 specify formats for the CHUID, the Security Object,
the biometric information, and X.509 public key certificates, which rely on OIDs to specify
which signature algorithm was used to generate the digital signature. The object identifiers
specified in Table 3-3, below, must be used in FIPS 201-2 implementations to identify the
signature algorithm. 4,5

3.2.2   Specification of Public Keys In X.509 Certificates

FIPS 201-2 requires generation and storage of an X.509 certificate to correspond with each
asymmetric private key contained on the PIV Card, except the PIV Secure Messaging key. X.509
certificates include object identifiers to specify the cryptographic algorithm associated with a

  The OID for RSA with SHA-1 and PKCS #1 v1.5 padding is included in Table 3-3 since applications may
encounter X.509 certificates that were signed before January 1, 2011, using this algorithm.

  For the CHUID, Security Object, and biometric information the signatureAlgorithm field of SignerInfo shall
contain rsaEncryption (1.2.840.113549.1.1.1) when the signature algorithm is RSA with PKCS #1 v1.5 padding.

A single object identifier is specified in Table 3-4 for all elliptic curve keys. An additional object
identifier must be supplied in a parameters field to indicate the elliptic curve associated with the
key. Table 3-5, below, identifies the named curves and associated OIDs. (RSA exponents are
encoded with the modulus in the certificate’s subject public key, so the OID is not affected.)

3.2.3    Specification of Message Digests in the SP 800-73-4 Security Object

SP 800-73-4 mandates inclusion of a Security Object consistent with the Authenticity/Integrity
Code defined by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in [MRTD]. This object
contains message digests of other digital information stored on the PIV Card and is digitally
signed. This specification requires that the message digests of digital information be computed
using the same hash algorithm used to generate the digital signature on the Security Object. The
set of acceptable algorithms is specified in Table 3-2. The Security Object format identifies the
hash algorithm used when computing the message digests by inclusion of an object identifier; the
appropriate object identifiers are identified in Table 3-6. 6

4       Certificate Status Information

The FIPS 201-2 functional component PIV Card Issuance and Management Subsystem generates
and distributes status information for PIV asymmetric keys, other than PIV Secure Messaging
keys. FIPS 201-2 mandates two formats for certificate status information:

    +    X.509 CRLs; and
    +    OCSP status response messages.
The CRLs and OCSP status responses shall be digitally signed to support authentication and
integrity using a key size and hash algorithm that satisfy the requirements for signing PIV
information, as specified in Table 3-2, and that are at least as large as the key size and hash
algorithm used to sign the certificate.

CRLs and OCSP messages rely on object identifiers to specify which signature algorithm was
used to generate the digital signature. The object identifiers specified in Table 3-3 must be used
in CRLs and OCSP messages to identify the signature algorithm.

5      PIV Card Application Administration Keys

PIV Cards may support card activation by the card management system to support card
personalization and post-issuance card update. PIV Cards that support card personalization and
post-issuance updates perform a challenge response protocol using a symmetric cryptographic
key (i.e., the PIV Card Application Administration Key) to authenticate the card management
system. After successful authentication, the card management system can modify information
stored in the PIV Card. Table 5-1, below, establishes specific requirements for cryptographic
algorithms and key sizes for PIV Card Application Administration Keys.

6      Identifiers for PIV Card Interfaces

SP 800-73-4 defines an application programming interface, the PIV Client Application
Programming Interface (Part 3), and a set of mandatory card commands, the PIV Card
Application Card Command Interface (Part 2). The command syntaxes for these interfaces
identify PIV keys using one-byte key references; their associated algorithms (or suites of
algorithms) are specified using one-byte algorithm identifiers. The same identifiers are used in
both interfaces.

Section 6.1 specifies the key reference values for each of the PIV key types. Section 6.2 defines
algorithm identifiers for each cryptographic algorithm supported by this specification. Section
6.3 identifies valid combinations of key reference values and algorithm identifiers.

6.1    Key Reference Values

A PIV Card key reference is a one-byte identifier that specifies a cryptographic key according to
its PIV Key Type. Table 6-1 defines the key reference values used on the PIV interfaces for PIV
Key Types.

6.2    PIV Card Algorithm Identifiers

A PIV Card algorithm identifier is a one-byte identifier that specifies a cryptographic algorithm
and key size, or a suite of algorithms and key sizes. For symmetric cryptographic operations, the
algorithm identifier also specifies a mode of operation (i.e., ECB). Table 6-2 lists the algorithm
identifiers for the cryptographic algorithms that may be recognized on the PIV interfaces. All
other algorithm identifier values are reserved for future use.

messaging and key establishment. Cipher Suite 2 (CS2) is the cipher suite used to establish
session keys and for secure messaging when the PIV Secure Messaging key is an ECDH (Curve
P-256) key, and Cipher Suite 7 (CS7) is the cipher suite used to establish session keys and for
secure messaging when the PIV Secure Messaging key is an ECDH (Curve P-384) key. Details
of secure messaging, the key establishment protocol, and the algorithms and key sizes for these
two cipher suites are specified in SP 800-73-4, Part 2.

7        Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Testing Requirements

As noted in Section 4.2.2 of [FIPS201], the PIV Card shall be validated under [FIPS140] with an
overall validation of Level 2 and with Level 3 physical security. The scope of the Cryptographic
Module Validation Program (CMVP) validation shall include all cryptographic operations
performed over both the contact and contactless interfaces. Table 7-1 describes the
Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP) tests that are required, at the time of
publication, for each supported key and algorithm. If any changes are made to the CAVP
validation requirements, the changes, along with the deadlines for conformance with these
requirements, will be posted on NIST’s “Personal Identity Verification Program (NPIVP)” web
page at http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/piv/npivp/index.html. 7

Terms used in this section are from the the corresponding algorithm validation list
at http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cavp/validation.html.
