                              Reports on Computer Systems Technology

The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical leadership for the Nation’s
measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops tests, test methods, reference data, proof of
concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance the development and productive use of
information technology. ITL’s responsibilities include the development of management, administrative,
technical, and physical standards and guidelines for the cost-effective security and privacy of other than
national security-related information in federal information systems. The Special Publication 800-series
reports on ITL’s research, guidelines, and outreach efforts in information system security, and its
collaborative activities with industry, government, and academic organizations.

                                                 Abstract
Federal agencies are concerned about the risks associated with information and communications
technology (ICT) products and services that may contain potentially malicious functionality, are
counterfeit, or are vulnerable due to poor manufacturing and development practices within the ICT supply
chain. These risks are associated with the federal agencies’ decreased visibility into, understanding of,
and control over how the technology that they acquire is developed, integrated and deployed, as well as
the processes, procedures, and practices used to assure the integrity, security, resilience, and quality of the
products and services.

This publication provides guidance to federal agencies on identifying, assessing, and mitigating ICT
supply chain risks at all levels of their organizations. The publication integrates ICT supply chain risk
management (SCRM) into federal agency risk management activities by applying a multitiered, SCRM-
specific approach, including guidance on assessing supply chain risk and applying mitigation activities.

    CHAPTER ONE

    INTRODUCTION

         nformation and Communications Technology (ICT) relies on a complex, globally distributed, and

     I   interconnected supply chain ecosystem that is long, has geographically diverse routes, and consists of
         multiple tiers of outsourcing. This ecosystem is composed of public and private sector entities (e.g.,
    acquirers, system integrators, suppliers, and external service providers) and technology, law, policy,
    procedures, and practices that interact to design, manufacture, distribute, deploy, and use ICT products
    and services. This ecosystem has evolved to provide a set of highly refined, cost-effective, reusable ICT
    solutions. Federal government information systems1 have rapidly adopted this ecosystem of solution
    options, which has increased their reliance on commercially available products, system integrator support
    for custom-built systems, and external service providers. This in turn has resulted in increased
    complexity, diversity, and scale of the federal government’s ICT supply chains.

    Commercially available ICT solutions present significant benefits including low cost, interoperability,
    rapid innovation, a variety of product features, and choice among competing vendors. These commercial
    off-the-shelf (COTS) solutions can be proprietary or open source and can meet the needs of a global base
    of public and private sector customers. However, the same globalization and other factors that allow for
    such benefits also increase the risk of a threat event which can directly or indirectly affect the ICT supply
    chain, often undetected, and in a manner that may result in risks to the end user.

    These ICT supply chain risks may include insertion of counterfeits, unauthorized production, tampering,
    theft, insertion of malicious software and hardware, as well as poor manufacturing and development
    practices in the ICT supply chain. These risks are associated with an organization’s decreased visibility
    into, and understanding of, how the technology that they acquire is developed, integrated, and deployed,
    as well as the processes, procedures, and practices used to assure the integrity, security, resilience, and
    quality of the products and services.2 Threats and vulnerabilities created by malicious actors (individuals,
    organizations, or nation states) are often especially sophisticated and difficult to detect, and thus provide a
    significant risk to organizations. It should be noted that ICT products (including libraries, frameworks,
    and toolkits) or services originating anywhere (domestically or abroad) might contain vulnerabilities that

     An information system is a discrete set of information resources organized expressly for the collection, processing,
    maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of information. Information systems also include specialized systems
    such as industrial/process controls systems, telephone switching/private branch exchange (PBX) systems, and environmental
    control systems.[NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 4]

    2
        This document adapts the definition of risk from [FIPS 200] to establish a definition for ICT supply chain risk as follows:
               Risks that arise from the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information or information systems and
               reflect the potential adverse impacts to organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation),
               organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.




CHAPTER 1                                                                                                                   PAGE 1

    can present opportunities for ICT supply chain compromises.3 For example, an adversary may have the
    power to insert malicious capability into a product or to coerce a manufacturer to hand over the
    manufacturing specifications of a sensitive U.S. system. Note that it is impossible to completely eliminate
    all risks.

    Currently, organizations, and many private sector integrators and suppliers use varied and not yet
    standardized practices, which make it difficult to consistently measure and manage ICT supply chain risks
    across different organizations. ICT Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) is the process of identifying,
    assessing, and mitigating the risks associated with the global and distributed nature of ICT product and
    service supply chains.

    1.1 PURPOSE

    The purpose of this publication is to provide guidance to federal agencies on identifying, assessing,
    selecting, and implementing risk management processes and mitigating controls throughout their
    organizations to help manage ICT supply chain risks.

    The processes and controls identified in this document can be modified or augmented with organization-
    specific requirements from policies, guidelines, and other documents. This publication empowers
    organizations to develop ICT SCRM mitigation strategies that are tailored to their particular
    mission/business needs, threats, and operational environments. The publication does not provide contract
    language or a complete list of ICT SCRM methods and techniques that mitigate specific supply chain
    threats.

    1.2 SCOPE

    This publication provides guidance to federal agencies on managing ICT supply chain risks to their
    information systems and organizations. The processes and controls described in this publication build on
    federal agency guidance and are for federal agencies to consider and implement. While entities outside of
    the federal government may decide to consult this publication as a source of good practices, the
    publication does not contain any specific guidance for those entities.

    The guidance and controls in this publication are recommended for use with high-impact systems
    according to Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 199, Standards for Security Categorization
    of Federal Information and Information Systems [FIPS 199]. However, because of interdependencies and
    individual needs, agencies may choose to apply the guidance to systems at a lower-impact level or to
    specific system components.

    Agencies should carefully consider the potential costs of applying ICT SCRM controls beyond high-
    impact information systems and weigh the costs against the risks to the organization of not applying ICT



    3
        This document defines an ICT Supply Chain Compromise as:
               An occurrence within the ICT supply chain whereby an adversary jeopardizes the confidentiality, integrity, or
               availability of a system or the information the system processes, stores, or transmits. An ICT supply chain compromise
               can occur anywhere within the system development life cycle of the product or service.

    SCRM controls. Implementing these controls will require financial and human resources, not just from
    the agencies directly but also potentially from their systems integrators, suppliers, and external service
    providers that would also result in increased costs to the acquirer. ICT SCRM controls support risk
    management, and should be considered in the context of the agency’s or organization’s unique missions,
    operational environments, and risks.

    In applying the processes and controls, organizations may decide to include requirements that they
    include in their policies, acquisition guidelines, and procurement documents.

    In this document, the word organization refers to the federal agency. In the context of this document,
    the acquirer is the federal agency.

    Federal agencies are a diverse set of organizations with different missions, structures, and sizes. The
    guidance in this publication applies across the federal sector, and therefore this publication does not
    differentiate between the terms federal agency and organization, and uses those terms interchangeably.

    1.3 TARGET AUDIENCE

    ICT SCRM is an organization-wide activity that should be directed under the overall agency governance,
    regardless of the specific organizational structure. At the organization level, ICT SCRM activities should
    be led by the risk executive function, described in [NIST SP 800-39], and implemented throughout the
    organization by a variety of individuals in different roles. The audience for this publication is federal
    agency personnel involved in engineering/developing, testing, deploying, acquiring, maintaining, and
    retiring ICT components and systems. These functions may include, but are not limited to, information
    technology, information security, contracting, risk executive, program management, legal, supply chain
    and logistics, acquisition and procurement, other related functions, and system owner. Other personnel or
    entities are free to make use of the guidance as appropriate to their situation.

    1.4 BACKGROUND

    ICT SCRM encompasses activities in the system development life cycle, including research and
    development (R&D), design, manufacturing, acquisition, delivery, integration, operations, and
    disposal/retirement of an organization’s ICT products (i.e., hardware and software) and services. ICT
    SCRM lies at the intersection of security, integrity, resilience, and quality, as depicted in Figure 1-1.
         Security provides the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information that (a) describes
            the ICT supply chain (e.g., information about the paths of ICT products and services, both logical
            and physical); or (b) traverses the ICT supply chain (e.g., intellectual property contained in ICT
            products and services), as well as information about the parties participating in the ICT supply
            chain (anyone who touches an ICT product or service throughout its life cycle);
         Integrity is focused on ensuring that the ICT products or services in the ICT supply chain are
            genuine, unaltered, and that the ICT products and services will perform according to acquirer
            specifications and without additional unwanted functionality.
         Resilience is focused on ensuring that ICT supply chain will provide required ICT products and
            services under stress or failure; and
         Quality is focused on reducing vulnerabilities that may limit the intended function of a
            component, lead to component failure, or provide opportunities for exploitation.

    This publication addresses the overlap of the four pillars of ICT SCRM - security, integrity, resilience,
    and quality - as depicted in Figure 1-1. The publication does not address the entire body of knowledge of
    these disciplines that is depicted by the non-overlapping areas of the circles in Figure 1-1.

    1.4.1    Federal Agencies ICT Supply Chain

    Federal agencies run complex information systems and networks to support their missions. These
    information systems and networks are composed of ICT products and components made available by ICT
    suppliers. Federal agencies also acquire and deploy an array of IT services, including those that:

            Integrate or provide operations, maintenance, and disposal support for federal information
             systems and networks within and outside of the federal agency authorization boundaries,4 made
             available by system integrators; and
            Provide external services to support federal agency operations that are provided from both within
             or outside of the federal agency authorization boundaries, made available by external service
             providers.

    In addition to operating information systems and networks internally, organizations also host system
    development and integration activities within their authorization boundaries. Those activities may be
    performed by the agency themselves or by system integrators. The ICT supply chain infrastructure is the
    integrated set of components (hardware, software, and processes) within the organizational boundary that




    4 NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 4 defines Authorization Boundary as:


             All components of an information system to be authorized for operation by an authorizing official and excludes
             separately authorized systems, to which the information system is connected.[NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 4, p. B-2]

    composes the environment in which a system is developed or manufactured, tested, deployed, maintained,
    and retired/decommissioned. Figure 1-2 depicts a federal agency ICT supply chain that consists of
    multiple layers of system integrators, external service providers, and suppliers with respect to the scope of
    this publication and the drivers that influence activities described herein.

    The ICT supply chain infrastructure is the integrated set of components (hardware, software and
    processes) within the organizational boundary that composes the environment in which a system is
    developed or manufactured, tested, deployed, maintained, and retired/decommissioned.

    Depicted in Figure 1-2, organizations define which mission functions and information systems compose
    the ICT supply chain infrastructure, potentially including system integrator and external service provider
    support.

    An organization’s ICT supply chain infrastructure includes internal development, information,
    information systems, services, components, and processes to create, maintain, and retire an organization’s
    information systems. Examples include development environments, individuals who are working within
    the organization’s facilities, logistics/delivery environments that transport information systems and
    components, or applicable system and communications interfaces. These elements of the ICT supply
    chain infrastructure may be provided by the organization itself, system integrator, or external service
    provider. Inclusion in ICT supply chain infrastructure is defined by agreement documents for
    organization’s information systems between system integrator or external service provider or the
    organization.

    ________________________________________________________________________________________________________


    The ICT supply chain infrastructure does not include:

               The information system traversing the supply chain;
               Any information system not used in the development, testing, maintenance, or retirement of
                information system components;
               System integrator, supplier, and external service provider information systems that are outside of
                the organization’s information system boundaries as defined by [NIST SP 800-37 Rev. 1];
               System integrator, supplier, and external service provider people, processes, and technology that
                are not engaged in supporting the information system sytem development life cycle (SDLC); and
               The organization’s people, processes, and technology not engaged in the SDLC for an
                information system. For example, organization’s shipping and receiving processes handling non-
                ICT are not included in the ICT supply chain infrastructure, such as food services or paper clips.



      Supplier and system integrator are included under the definition of “developer” by NIST SP 800-53
      Revision 4, Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations:

            A general term that includes: (i) developers or manufacturers of information systems, system
            components, or information system services; (ii) systems integrators; (iii) vendors; and (iv)
            product resellers. Development of systems, components, or services can occur internally within
            organizations (i.e., in-house development) or through external entities.[NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 4, p.
            B-6]

      NIST SP 800-161 uses NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 developer definition items (i), (iii), and (iv) to define
      supplier and item (ii) to define system integrator.

      NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 describes external information system service provider as follows:

            External services can be provided by: (i) entities within the organization but outside of the security
            authorization boundaries established for organizational information systems; (ii) entities outside
            of the organization either in the public sector (e.g., federal agencies) or private sector (e.g.,
            commercial service providers); or (iii) some combination of the public and private sector options.
            External information system services include, for example, the use of service-oriented
            architectures (SOAs), cloud-based services (infrastructure, platform, software), or data center
            operations. External information system services may be used by, but are typically not part of,
            organizational information systems. In some situations, external information system services may
            completely replace or heavily augment the routine functionality of internal organizational
            information systems. [NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 4, p. B-8]

      Additionally, NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 describes organizational users as follows:

            An organizational employee or an individual the organization deems to have equivalent status of
            an employee including, for example, contractor, guest researcher, or individual detailed from
            another organization.[NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 4, p. B-16]

    1.4.2    ICT Supply Chain Risk
    ICT supply chain risks include insertion of counterfeits, unauthorized production, tampering, theft,
    insertion of malicious software and hardware (e.g., GPS tracking devices, computer chips, etc.), as well as
    poor manufacturing and development practices in the ICT supply chain. These risks are realized when
    threats in the ICT supply chain exploit existing vulnerabilities.

    Figure 1-3 depicts ICT supply chain risk resulting from the likelihood that relevant threats may exploit
    applicable vulnerabilities and the consequential potential impact.

    It should be noted that it might take years for a vulnerability stemming from the ICT supply chain to be
    exploited or discovered. In addition, it may be difficult to determine whether an event was the direct
    result of a supply chain vulnerability. This may result in a persistent negative impact on an organization’s
    missions that could range from reduction in service levels leading to customer dissatisfaction to theft of
    intellectual property or degradation of mission-critical functions.

    1.4.3    Federal Agency Relationships with System Integrators, Suppliers, and External
             Service Providers
    ICT supply chain risks are associated with an organization’s decreased visibility into, and understanding
    of, how the technology that they acquire is developed, integrated, and deployed. They are also associated
    with the processes, procedures, and practices used to assure the integrity, security, resilience, and quality
    of the products and services. Federal agencies have a variety of relationships with their system
    integrators, suppliers, and external service providers. Figure 1-4 depicts how the diverse types of these
    relationships affect an organization’s visibility and control of the supply chain.




                Figure 1-4: An Organization’s Visibility, Understanding, and Control of its ICT Supply Chains


    Some supply chain relationships are tightly intermingled, such as when a system integrator develops a
    complex information system to be operated within the federal agency’s authorization boundary or when
    an external service provider manages federal agency information systems and resources on behalf of the
    department. These relationships are usually guided by an agreement (e.g., contract) that establishes
    detailed functional and security requirements and may provide for custom development or significant
    customization of ICT products and services. For these relationships, system integrators and external
    service providers are likely to be able to work with the federal agency to implement those processes and
    controls listed within this document, which are deemed appropriate based on the results of a risk
    assessment and cost/benefit analysis. This may include floating requirements upstream in the supply chain
    that can significantly impact costs to the supplier. The cost of requiring system integrators and external
    service providers to implement ICT SCRM processes and controls should be weighed against the risks to
    the organization of not adhering to those additional requirements. Often, working directly with the system

                                                                            Information Systems and Organizations

    integrators and external service providers to identify appropriate mitigation processes and controls will
    help create a more cost-effective strategy.

    Procuring ICT products directly from ICT suppliers establishes a direct relationship between those
    suppliers and the acquirers. This relationship is also usually guided by an agreement between the acquirer
    and ICT supplier. However, commercial ICT developed by suppliers are typically designed for general
    purposes for a global market and typically are not tailored to any individual customer’s specific
    operational or threat environments. Organizations should establish a dialog with ICT suppliers regarding
    their specific ICT SCRM requirements to determine if an ICT solution is “fit for purpose."5

    This dialog will help acquirers understand the capabilities of existing ICT products and services, set
    expectations and requirements for suppliers, and identify ICT SCRM needs not yet satisfied by the
    market. It can also help identify emerging solutions that may at least partially support the acquirer need.
    Overall, the dialog will allow the acquirer to better articulate their requirements to align with and drive
    market offerings.

    This dialog will also help system integrators, suppliers, and external service providers achieve a more
    nuanced understanding of the organization’s requirements and how their current and emerging ICT
    products and services may be able to satisfy them.

    Organizations should recognize that ICT suppliers may or may not be able to offer customization or
    tailoring to their ICT SCRM needs, and that such tailoring may have cost implications. Acquirers should
    weigh the costs and benefits afforded by these products to make their final acquisition decision. Acquirers
    should also recognize that ICT suppliers may choose to keep their processes or products as is and not
    support the acquirer’s security and ICT SCRM requirements. The dialog between acquirers and ICT
    suppliers may help acquirers and ICT suppliers achieve an understanding and identify acceptable
    solutions when such challenges occur.

    Requiring a greater level of testing, documentation, or security features from system integrators,
    suppliers, and external service providers may increase the price of a product or service. Additional costs
    may include the development or testing of products, or the collection, analysis, storage and protection of
    data. This is especially true for those products and services developed for general-purpose application and
    not tailored to the specific organization’s security or ICT SCRM requirements. Acquirers should evaluate
    and weigh the costs of adding ICT SCRM requirement into agreements against the risks to the
    organization of not adding ICT SCRM requirements.

      “Fit for purpose” is a term used informally to describe a process, configuration item, IT service, etc., that is capable of meeting
    its objectives or service levels. Being fit for purpose requires suitable design, implementation, control, and maintenance.

    1.5 FOUNDATIONAL PRACTICES

    ICT supply chain risk management builds on existing standardized practices in multiple disciplines.
    Organizations should consider reaching a base level of maturity in foundational practices prior to
    specifically focusing on ICT SCRM practices that are more advanced. Those foundational practices are
    described in NIST standards and guidelines as well as other applicable national and international
    standards and best practices. They include: ensuring that organizations understand the cost and scheduling
    constraints of implementing ICT SCRM; integrating information security requirements into the
    acquisition process; using applicable baseline security controls as one of the sources for security
    requirements; ensuring a robust software quality control process; and establishing multiple sources, e.g.,
    delivery routes, for critical system elements. A formal program and process, including dedicated
    resources, may be used to reach a base level of maturity. [FIPS 199] “high-impact” systems should
    already have these foundational practices established.

    Having foundational practices in place is critical to successfully and productively interacting with mature
    system integrators and suppliers who may have such practices standardized and in place.
    The following are specific examples of the multidisciplinary foundational practices that can be
    implemented incrementally to improve an organization’s ability to develop and implement more advanced
    ICT SCRM practices:

            Implement a risk management hierarchy and risk management process (in accordance with NIST
             SP 800-39, Managing Information Security Risk [NIST SP 800-39]) including an organization-
             wide risk assessment process (in accordance with NIST SP 800-30 Revision 1, Guide for
             Conducting Risk Assessments [NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1]);
            Establish an organization governance structure that integrates ICT SCRM requirements and
             incorporates these requirements into the organizational policies;
            Establish consistent, well-documented, repeatable processes for determining [FIPS 199]impact
             levels;
            Use risk assessment processes after the [FIPS 199] impact level has been defined, including
             criticality analysis, threat analysis, and vulnerability analysis;
            Implement a quality and reliability program that includes quality assurance and quality control
             process and practices;
            Establish a set of roles and responsibilities for ICT SCRM that ensures that the broad set of
             appropriate stakeholders are involved in decision making, including who has the required
             authority to take action, who has accountability for an action or result, and who should be
             consulted and/or informed (e.g., Legal, Risk Executive, HR, Finance, Enterprise IT, Program
             Management/System Engineering, Information Security, Acquisition/procurement, supply chain
             logistics, etc.);
            Ensure that adequate resources are allocated to information security and ICT SCRM to ensure
             proper implementation of guidance and controls;
            Implement consistent, well-documented, repeatable processes for system engineering, ICT
             security practices, and acquisition;
            Implement an appropriate and tailored set of baseline information security controls in NIST SP
             800-53 Revision 4, Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and
             Organizations [NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 4];
            Establish internal checks and balances to assure compliance with security and quality
             requirements;

    ________________________________________________________________________________________________________

               Establish a supplier management program including, for example, guidelines for purchasing
                directly from qualified original equipment manufacturers (OEMs)6 or their authorized distributors
                and resellers;
               Implement a tested and repeatable contingency plan that integrates ICT supply chain risk
                considerations to ensure the integrity and reliability of the supply chain including during adverse
                events (e.g., natural disasters such as hurricanes or economic disruptions such as labor strikes);
                and
               Implement a robust incident management program to successfully identify, respond to, and
                mitigate security incidents. This program should be capable of identifying causes of security
                incidents, including those originating from the ICT supply chain.

    The guidance and controls contained in this publication are built on existing practices from multiple
    disciplines and are intended to increase the ability of organizations to strategically manage ICT supply
    chain risks over the entire life cycle of systems, products, and services.


    1.6 RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER PROGRAMS AND PUBLICATIONS

    This publication builds on the Joint Task Force Transformation Initiative Unified Information Security
    Framework7 and uses concepts described in a number of NIST publications to facilitate integration with
    the agencies’ existing organization-wide activities. These publications are complementary and work
    together to help organizations build risk-based information security programs to help protect their
    operations and assets against a range of diverse and increasingly sophisticated threats. This publication
    will be revised to remain consistent with the NIST SP 800-53 security controls catalog, using an iterative
    process as the ICT SCRM discipline matures.

    NIST SP 800-161 builds on the fundamental concepts described in:

               FIPS 199, Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information
                Systems, to conduct criticality analysis to scoping ICT SCRM activities to high-impact
                components or systems [FIPS 199];
               NIST SP 800-30, Revision 1, Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments, to integrate ICT SCRM
                into the risk assessment process [NIST SP 800-30 Rev 1];
               NIST SP 800-37, Revision 1, Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal
                Information Systems [NIST SP 800-37 Rev. 1];

        For purposes of this publication, the term original equipment manufacturers includes original component manufacturers.

    7 The Unified Information Security Framework is a comprehensive, flexible, risk-based information security framework

    developed by the Joint Task Force, a partnership among the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the Department of
    Defense, the U.S. Intelligence Community, and the Committee on National Security Systems. The Unified Information Security
    Framework consists of five core publications including: [NIST SP 800-39]; [NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1]; [NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 4];
    and [NIST SP 800-37 Rev. 1].

    NIST SP 800-161 refines the multitiered risk management approach of [NIST SP 800-39], by providing
    ICT SCRM guidance at Organization, Mission, and Information System Tiers. It also contains an
    enhanced overlay of specific ICT SCRM controls, building on [NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 4]. Appendix C of
    this publication contains threat events described in [NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1] .

    For specific guidance on system security engineering, the readers of NIST SP 800-161 should consult
    NIST SP 800-160, Systems Security Engineering [NIST SP 800-160]. They complement each other; NIST
    SP 800-161 addresses the security engineering aspects of ICT SCRM while NIST SP 800-160 addresses
    system security engineering more broadly throughout SDLC processes. Both publications build on [NIST
    SP 800-53 Rev. 4].

    NIST SP 800-161 draws from a collaborative ICT SCRM community workshop hosted in October 2012
    [NIST SCRM Proceedings 2012] and NIST Interagency Report (IR) 7622, Notional Supply Chain Risk
    Management Practices for Federal Information Systems [NIST IR 7622], which resulted from several
    years of rigorous study of the ICT SCRM discipline and provided NIST the insight required to scope and
    develop this special publication. NISTIR 7622 can be used by the reader for background materials in
    support of applying the special publication to their specific acquisition processes.

    NIST SP 800-161 also draws from several external publications, including:

    This publication does not replace guidance provided with respect to federal agency assessment of cloud
    service providers’ security. The external service providers discussed in this publication include cloud
    service providers. When applying this publication to cloud service providers, federal agencies should first
    use Federal Risk and Authorization Program (FedRAMP) cloud services security guidelines and then
    apply NIST SP 800-161 for those processes and controls that are not addressed by FEDRAMP.8


    1.7 METHODOLOGY FOR BUILDING ICT SCRM GUIDANCE USING SP 800-39 AND
        NIST SP 800-53 REVISION 4

    This publication applies the multitiered risk management approach of [NIST SP 800-39], by providing
    ICT SCRM guidance at organization, mission, and system tiers. It also contains an enhanced overlay of
    specific ICT SCRM controls, building on NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4.

    The guidance/controls contained in this publication are built on existing practices from multiple
    disciplines and are intended to increase the ability of organizations to strategically manage the associated
    ICT supply chain risks over the entire life cycle of systems, products, and services. It should be noted that
    this publication gives organizations the flexibility to either develop stand-alone documentation (e.g.,
    policies, assessment and authorization [A&A] plan and ICT SCRM plan) for ICT SCRM or to integrate it
    into existing agency documentation.

    For individual systems, this guidance is recommended for use for those information systems that are
    categorized as high-impact systems according to [FIPS 199]. The agencies may choose to apply this
    guidance to systems at a lower-impact level or to specific system components. Finally, NIST SP 800-161
    describes the development and implementation of an ICT SCRM plan to be developed at all levels of an
    organization. An ICT SCRM plan is an output of ICT supply chain risk assessment and should contain
    ICT SCRM controls tailored to specific agency mission/business needs, operational environments, and/or
    implementing technologies.

    1.7.1    Integration into Risk Management Process

    The processes in this publication should be integrated into agencies’ existing SDLCs and organizational
    environments at all levels of the risk management processes and hierarchy (organization, mission, system)
    as described in [NIST SP 800-39]. Chapter 2.1 provides an overview of the [NIST SP 800-39] risk
    management hierarchy and approach, and identifies ICT SCRM activities in the risk management process.
    The structure of Chapter 2.1 mirrors [NIST SP 800-39]. Chapter 2.2 builds on Chapter 3 of [NIST SP
    800-39], providing descriptions and explanations of ICT SCRM activities.




    8
     For cloud services, FEDRAMP is applicable for low- and moderate-impact systems [FEDRAMP]. Ongoing work will address
    high-impact systems utilizing cloud services. Once the work is completed, agencies should refer to FEDRAMP for guidance
    applicable to high-impact systems utilizing cloud services.

    1.7.2    Enhanced ICT SCRM Overlay
    This publication contains an enhanced overlay of [NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 4]. Chapter 3 identifies, refines,
    and expands ICT SCRM-related controls from [NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 4], adds new controls that address
    specific ICT SCRM concerns, and offers ICT SCRM-specific supplemental guidance where appropriate.
    Figure 1-5 illustrates the process used to create the enhanced overlay. The individual controls and
    enhancements from [NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 4] that were relevant to ICT SCRM were extracted. These
    controls were analyzed to determine how they apply to ICT SCRM. Additional supplemental guidance
    was then developed and included for each control and control enhancement. The resulting set of controls
    and enhancements were evaluated to determine whether all ICT SCRM concerns were addressed. A new
    control family, Provenance, and some additional controls and control enhancements were created to
    address specific remaining ICT SCRM concerns.

                                             Managing Cost and Resources

      Organizations should be aware that implementing these controls will require financial and human
      resources. Any requirements that result from federal agencies implementing these controls may also
      require financial and human resources from their system integrators, suppliers, and external service
      providers potentially resulting in increased costs to the federal acquirers. The acquirers should be
      cognizant of the costs and weigh them against the risks to the organization of not selecting ICT SCRM
      controls. When appropriate, allow system integrators, suppliers, and external services providers the
      opportunity to reuse any existing data and documentation that may provide evidence to support ICT
      SCRM. The challenge of balancing ICT supply chain risks with the costs and benefits of mitigating
      controls should be a key component of the acquirer’s overall approach to ICT SCRM.

    CHAPTER TWO

    INTEGRATION OF ICT SCRM INTO ORGANIZATION-
    WIDE RISK MANAGEMENT

    ICT SCRM should be integrated into the organization-wide risk management process described in [NIST
    SP 800-39] and depicted in Figure 2-1. This process includes the following continuous and iterative steps:
        (i) Frame risk – establish the context for risk-based decisions and the current state of the information
              system or ICT supply chain infrastructure;
        (ii) Assess risk – review and interpret criticality, threat, vulnerability, likelihood, impact, and related
              information;
        (iii) Respond to risk once determined – select, tailor, and implement mitigation controls; and
        (iv) Monitor risk on an ongoing basis, including changes to an information system or ICT supply
              chain infrastructure, using effective organizational communications and a feedback loop for
              continuous improvement.




                                         Figure 2-1: Risk Management Process


    Managing ICT supply chain risks is a complex, multifaceted undertaking that requires a coordinated
    effort across an organization and building trust relationships and communicating with external and
    internal partners and stakeholders. This includes: engaging multiple disciplines in identifying priorities
    and developing solutions; ensuring that ICT SCRM activities are performed throughout the SDLC; and
    incorporating ICT SCRM into overall risk management decisions. ICT SCRM activities should involve

    ________________________________________________________________________________________________________

    identifying and assessing applicable risks, determining appropriate mitigating actions, developing ICT
    SCRM Plans to document selected mitigating actions, and monitoring performance against ICT SCRM
    Plans. Because ICT supply chains differ across and within organizations, ICT SCRM plans should be
    tailored to individual organizational, program, and operational contexts. These tailored ICT SCRM Plans
    will provide the basis for determining whether an information system is “fit for purpose” 9 and as such,
    the controls need to be tailored accordingly. Tailored ICT SCRM plans will help organizations to focus
    appropriate resources on the most critical functions and components based on organizational
    mission/business requirements and their risk environment.


        Organizations should ensure that tailored ICT SCRM Plans are designed to:
            Manage, rather than eliminate risk;
            Ensure that operations are able to adapt to constantly evolving threats;
            Be responsive to changes within their own organization, programs, and the supporting
               information systems; and
            Adjust to the rapidly evolving practices of the private sector's global ICT supply chain.


    Chapter 2.1 describes the three-tier risk management approach in terms of ICT SCRM. Generally, senior
    leaders provide the strategic direction, mid-level leaders plan and manage projects, and individuals on the
    front lines develop, implement, and operate the ICT supply chain infrastructure. The activities performed
    in each tier can be integrated into an organization’s overall risk management process in order to ensure
    that the ICT SCRM program appropriately supports the organization’s mission and goals.10 Chapter 2.2
    describes the Risk Management Framework as it applies to ICT SCRM. The foundational concepts are
    described in greater detail in [NIST SP 800-39].


    2.1 MULTITIERED RISK MANAGEMENT

    To integrate risk management throughout an organization, [NIST SP 800-39] describes three
    organizational tiers, depicted in Figure 2-2, that address risk at the: (i) organization level; (ii)
    mission/business process level; and (iii) information system level. ICT SCRM requires the involvement
    of all three tiers.




    9
     The tailoring of ICT SCRM plans to individual organizational, program, and operational contexts may be referred to as “fit for
    purpose” as defined by Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) Service Strategy.[ITIL Service Strategy]
    10 This document uses the word “mission” to mean the organization’s required tasks as determined by the organization’s purpose

    and enterprise-level goals and priorities.

                                  Figure 2-2: Multitiered Organization-wide Risk Management11


    In general, Tier 1 is engaged in the development of the overall ICT SCRM strategy, determination of
    organization-level ICT SCRM risks, and setting of the organization-wide ICT SCRM policies to guide the
    organization’s activities in establishing and maintaining organization-wide ICT SCRM capability. Tier 2
    is engaged in prioritizing the organization’s mission and business functions, conducting mission/business-
    level risk assessment, implementing Tier 1 strategy and guidance to establish an overarching
    organizational capability to manage ICT supply chain risks, and guiding organization-wide ICT
    acquisitions and their corresponding SDLCs. Tier 3 is involved in specific ICT SCRM activities to be
    applied to individual information systems and information technology acquisitions, including integration
    of ICT SCRM into these systems’ SDLCs.

    The ICT SCRM activities can be performed by a variety of individuals or groups within an organization
    ranging from a single individual to committees, divisions, programs, or any other organizational
    structures. ICT SCRM activities will be distinct for different organizations depending on their
    organization’s structure, culture, mission, and many other factors. It should be noted that this publication
    gives organizations the flexibility to either develop stand-alone documentation (e.g., policies, assessment
    and authorization [A&A] plan and ICT SCRM Plan) for ICT SCRM, or to integrate it into existing
    agency documentation.

    The ICT SCRM process should be carried out across the three risk management tiers with the overall
    objective of continuous improvement in the organization’s risk-related activities and effective inter-tier
    and intra-tier communication, thus integrating both strategic and tactical activities among all stakeholders
    with a shared interest in the mission/business success of the organization. Whether addressing a
    component, a system, a process, a mission function, or a policy, it is important to engage the relevant ICT
    SCRM stakeholders at each tier to ensure that risk management activities are as informed as possible.

    The next few sections provide example activities in each tier. However, because each organization is
    different, there may be activities that are performed in different tiers than listed as individual
    organizational context requires.

      Chapter 3 provides a number of mission/business ICT SCRM controls that organizations can tailor for
      their use to help guide Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 ICT SCRM activities. It should be noted the tailoring
      should be scoped to the organization’s risk management needs and take into consideration the costs
      associated with implementing ICT SCRM.



    2.1.1    TIER 1 – ORGANIZATION

    Tier 1 (Organization) provides strategic ICT SCRM direction for an organization using organizational-
    level mission/business requirements and policies, governance structures such as the risk executive
    (function), and organization-wide resource allocation for ICT SCRM. Tier 1 activities help to ensure that
    ICT SCRM mitigation strategies are cost-effective, efficient, and consistent with the strategic goals and
    objectives of the organization. It is critical that, as organizations define and implement organization-wide
    strategies, policies, and processes in this tier, they include ICT SCRM considerations.

    ________________________________________________________________________________________________________

    ICT SCRM activities at this tier include:
        Establish ICT SCRM policies based on external and organizational requirements and constraints
          (e.g., applicable laws and regulations). Policies should include the purpose and applicability, as
          well as investment and funding requirements, of the ICT SCRM program;
        Based on the ICT SCRM policy, identify:
               o Mission/business requirements that will influence ICT SCRM, such as cost, schedule,
                   performance, security, privacy, quality, and safety;
               o Information security requirements, including ICT SCRM-specific requirements; and
               o Organization-wide mission/business functions and how ICT SCRM will be integrated
                   into their processes;
         Establish risk tolerance level for ICT supply chain risks;
         Establish a group of individuals across the organization who will address ICT SCRM throughout
           the organization, known as the ICT SCRM Team; and
         Ensure that ICT SCRM is appropriately integrated into the organization risk management
           policies and activities.

    Implementing ICT SCRM requires that organizations establish a coordinated team-based approach to
    assess ICT supply chain risk and manage this risk by using programmatic and technical mitigation
    techniques. The coordinated team approach, either ad hoc or formal, will enable agencies to conduct a
    comprehensive analysis of their ICT supply chain, communicate with external partners/stakeholders, and
    gain broad consensus regarding appropriate resources for ICT SCRM.

    The ICT SCRM Team should consist of members with diverse roles and responsibilities for leading and
    supporting ICT SCRM activities including information technology, information security, contracting, risk
    executive, mission/business, legal, supply chain and logistics, acquisition and procurement, and other
    relevant functions. These individuals may include government personnel or prime contractors hired to
    provide acquisition services to a government client.

    Members of the ICT SCRM team should be a diverse group of people who are involved in the various
    aspects of the SDLC. Collectively, to aid in ICT SCRM, these individuals should have an awareness of,
    and provide expertise in organizational acquisition processes, legal practices, vulnerabilities, threats, and
    attack vectors, as well as an understanding of the technical aspects and dependencies of systems. The ICT
    SCRM team may be an extension of an organization’s existing information system risk management or
    include parts of a general risk management team.

    2.1.2    TIER 2 – MISSION/BUSINESS PROCESS

    Tier 2 (Mission/Business Process) addresses risk from a mission/business process perspective and is
    informed by the risk context, risk decisions, and risk activities at Tier 1.12 In this tier, program
    requirements are defined and managed – including ICT SCRM as well as cost, schedule, performance,
    and a variety of critical nonfunctional requirements. These nonfunctional requirements include concepts
    such as reliability, dependability, safety, security, and quality. Many threats to and through the supply
    chain are addressed at this level in the management of trust relationships with system integrators,

    suppliers, and external service providers of ICT products and services. Because ICT SCRM can both
    directly and indirectly impact mission/business processes, understanding, integrating and coordinating
    ICT SCRM activities at this tier are critical for ensuring successful mission and business operations.

    ICT SCRM activities at this tier include:
        Defining the risk response strategy, including ICT SCRM considerations, for critical processes;
        Establishing ICT SCRM processes to support mission/business processes;
        Determining the ICT SCRM requirements of the mission/business systems needed to execute the
          mission/business processes;
        Incorporating ICT SCRM requirements into the mission/business processes;
        Integrating ICT SCRM requirements into an enterprise architecture to facilitate the allocation of
          ICT SCRM controls to organizational information systems and the environments in which those
          systems operate; and
        Establishing a mission/business-specific ICT SCRM team that coordinates and collaborates with
          the organizational ICT SCRM team.

    2.1.3    TIER 3 – INFORMATION SYSTEMS

    Tier 3 (Information Systems) is where ICT SCRM activities are integrated into the SDLC of
    organizational information systems and system components. Many threats through the supply chain are
    addressed at this level with the use of ICT SCRM-related information security requirements. Risk
    management activities at Tier 3 reflect the organization’s risk management strategy defined in Tier 1 (per
    NIST SP 800-39), as well as cost, schedule, and performance requirements for individual information
    systems as defined in Tier 2. ICT SCRM activities at this tier include:

            Applying, monitoring and managing ICT SCRM controls in the development and sustainment of
             systems supporting mission/business processes; and
            Applying, monitoring and managing ICT SCRM controls to the SDLC and the environment in
             which the SDLC is conducted (e.g., ICT supply chain infrastructure) used to develop and
             integrate mission/business systems.

    At Tier 3, ICT SCRM significantly intersects with the SDLC, which includes acquisition (both custom
    and off-the-shelf), requirements, architectural design, development, delivery, installation, integration,
    maintenance, and disposal/retirement of information systems, including ICT products and services.

    2.2 ICT SCRM ACTIVITIES IN RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS

    Risk management is a comprehensive process that requires organizations to: (i) frame risk (i.e., establish
    the context for risk-based decisions); (ii) assess risk; (iii) respond to risk once determined; and (iv)
    monitor risk on an ongoing basis using effective organizational communications and a feedback loop for
    continuous improvement in the risk-related activities of organizations. Figure 2-3 depicts
    interrelationships among the risk management process steps, including the order in which each analysis
    may be executed and the interactions required to ensure that the analysis is inclusive of the various inputs
    at the organization, mission, and operations levels.

    The steps in the risk management process – Frame, Assess, Respond, and Monitor - are iterative and not
    inherently sequential in nature. Different individuals may be required to perform the steps at the same
    time depending on a particular need or situation. Organizations have significant flexibility in how the risk
    management steps are performed (e.g., sequence, degree of rigor, formality, and thoroughness of
    application) and in how the results of each step are captured and shared—both internally and externally.
    The outputs from a particular risk management step will directly impact one or more of the other risk
    management steps in the risk management process.

    Figure 2-4 summarizes ICT SCRM activities throughout the risk management process as they are
    performed within the three organizational tiers. The arrows between different steps of the risk
    management process depict simultaneous flow of information and guidance among the steps. Together the
    arrows indicate that the inputs, activities, and outputs are continuously interacting and influencing one
    another. More details are provided in the following subsections.

    Figure 2-4 depicts interrelationships among the risk management process steps including the order in
    which each analysis is executed and the interactions required to ensure that the analysis is inclusive of the
    various inputs at the organization, mission, and operations levels.

    The remainder of this section provides a detailed description of ICT SCRM activities within the Frame,
    Assess, Respond, and Monitor steps of the Risk Management Process. The structure of subsections 2.2.1
    through 2.2.4 mirrors the structure of NIST SP 800-39, Chapters 3.1-3.4. For each step of the Risk
    Management Process (i.e., Frame, Assess, Respond, Monitor), the structure includes Inputs and
    Preconditions, Activities, and Outputs and Post-Conditions. Activities are further organized into Tasks
    according to [NIST SP 800-39] . NIST SP 800-161 cites the steps and tasks of the risk management
    process but rather than repeating any other content of [NIST SP 800-39], it provides ICT SCRM-specific
    guidance for each step with its Inputs and Preconditions, Activities with corresponding Tasks, and
    Outputs and Post-Conditions. NIST SP 800-161 adds one task to the tasks provided in [NIST SP 800-39],
    under the Assess step: Task 2-0, Criticality Analysis.

    program/project or individual information system needs, are defined in this step. The data and information
    collected during Frame provides inputs for scoping and fine-tuning ICT SCRM activities in other risk
    management process steps throughout the three tiers.

    [NIST SP 800-39] defines risk framing as “the set of assumptions, constraints, risk tolerances, and
    priorities/trade-offs that shape an organization’s approach for managing risk.” ICT SCRM risk framing
    should be integrated into the overall organization risk framing process. Outputs of the organization’s risk
    framing and the overall risk management process should serve as inputs into the ICT SCRM risk framing,
    including but not limited to:

            Organization policies, strategies, and governance;
            Applicable laws and regulations;
            Mission functions and business goals;
            Organization processes (security, quality, etc.);
            Organization threats, vulnerabilities, risks, and risk tolerance;
            Criticality of mission functions;
            Enterprise architecture;
            Mission-level security policies;
            Functional requirements; and
            Security requirements.

    ICT SCRM risk framing is an iterative process that also uses inputs from the other steps of the risk
    management process (Assess, Respond, and Monitor) as inputs. Figure 2-5 depicts the Frame Step with
    its inputs and outputs along the three organizational tiers.

    Supplemental Guidance:

    As a part of identifying ICT supply chain Risk Assumptions within the broader Risk Management process
    (described in [NIST SP 800-39]), agencies should do the following:

    ________________________________________________________________________________________________________

            Define ICT SCRM mission, business, and system-level requirements;
            Identify which mission functions and related components are critical to the organization,
             including FIPS 199 impact level, to determine the baseline criticality;
            Identify, characterize, and provide representative examples of threat sources, vulnerabilities,
             consequences/impacts, and likelihood determinations related to ICT supply chain;
            Develop organization-wide ICT SCRM policy;
            Select appropriate ICT supply chain risk assessment methodologies, depending on organizational
             governance, culture, and diversity of the missions/business functions;
            Establish a method for the results of ICT SCRM activities to be integrated into the overall agency
             Risk Management Process; and
            Define which mission functions and information systems compose the ICT supply chain
             infrastructure, potentially including system integrator and external service provider support and
             periodically review its ICT supply chain infrastructure because it may evolve over time.

    Baseline Criticality:

    Critical functions are those functions, which if corrupted or disabled, are likely to result in mission
    degradation or failure. Mission-critical functions are dependent on their supporting systems that in turn
    depend on critical components in those systems (hardware, software, and firmware). Mission-critical
    functions also depend on processes that are used to execute the critical functions. Those components and
    processes that deliver defensive functions (e.g., access control, identity management, and crypto) and
    unmediated access (e.g., power supply) may also be considered mission-critical. A criticality analysis is
    the primary method by which mission-critical functions and associated systems/components are identified
    and prioritized.

    Baseline criticality determination is the initial identification of specific critical components and processes
    based on the required function. This includes the analysis of requirements, architecture, and design to
    identify the minimum set of components required for system operation. Baseline criticality determination
    includes first identifying system requirements that support mission function and systems/components that
    have a direct impact on system requirements. This analysis should include agency system and ICT supply
    chain dependencies. Organizations should define the baseline criticality in the Frame phase to be updated
    and tailored to specific context in the Assess phase.

    Determining baseline criticality is an iterative process performed at all tiers during both Frame and
    Assess. In Frame, baseline criticality determination is expected to be performed at a high level, using the
    available information with further detail incorporated through additional iterations or at the Assess step.
    Determining baseline criticality may include the following:

            Identify mission and business drivers, such as applicable regulations, policies, requirements, and
             operational constraints;
            Prioritize these drivers to help articulate the organization’s critical functions, systems, and
             components;
            Identify, group, and prioritize mission functions based on the drivers;
            Establish [FIPS 199] impact levels (high, moderate, low) for individual systems; and
            Map the mission functions to the system architecture and identify the systems/ components
             (hardware, software, and firmware) and processes that are critical to the mission/business
             effectiveness of the system or an interfacing network.

    Please note that baseline criticality can be determined for existing systems or for future system integration
    efforts based on system architecture and design. It is an iterative activity that should be performed if a

    For ICT SCRM, threat sources include: (i) hostile cyber/physical attacks either to the supply chain or to
    an information system component(s) traversing the supply chain; (ii) human errors; or (iii) geopolitical
    disruptions, economic upheavals, and natural or man-made disasters. [NIST SP 800-39] states that
    organizations provide a succinct characterization of the types of tactics, techniques, and procedures
    employed by adversaries that are to be addressed by safeguards and countermeasures (i.e., security
    controls) deployed at Tier 1 (organization level), at Tier 2 (mission/business process level), and at Tier 3
    (information system level)—making explicit the types of threat sources that are to be addressed as well as
    making explicit those not being addressed by the safeguards/countermeasures.

    Threat information includes historical threat data, factual threat data, or validated technology-specific
    threat information. Threat information may come from multiple information sources, including the U.S.
    Intelligence Community (for federal agencies), as well as open source reporting such as news and trade
    publications, partners, suppliers, and customers.

    Information about ICT supply chain (such as from supply chain maps) provides the context for
    identifying possible locations or access points for threat agents to enter the ICT supply chain. The ICT
    supply chain threat agents are similar to the information security threat agents, such as attackers or
    industrial spies. Table 2-2 lists examples of ICT supply chain threat agents. Appendix D provides Supply
    Chain Threat Scenarios listed in Table 2-2.

    Agencies can identify and refine ICT SCRM-specific threats in all three tiers. Table 2-3 provides
    examples of threat considerations and different methods that can be used to characterize ICT supply
    chain threats at different tiers.

    Vulnerabilities

    A vulnerability is a weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or
    implementation that could be exploited or triggered by a threat source [FIPS 200], [NIST SP 800-34 Rev.
    1], [NIST SP 800-53 Rev 4], [NIST SP 800-53A Rev. 4], [NIST SP 800-115]. Within the ICT SCRM
    context, it is any weakness in the system/component design, development, manufacturing, production,
    shipping and receiving, delivery, operation, and component end-of life that can be exploited by a threat
    agent. This definition applies to both the systems/components being developed and integrated (i.e., within
    the SDLC) and to the ICT supply chain infrastructure, including any security mitigations and techniques,
    such as identity management or access control systems.

    ICT supply chain vulnerabilities may be found in:
        The systems/components within the SDLC (i.e., being developed and integrated);
        The development and operational environment directly impacting the SDLC; and
        The logistics/delivery environment that transports ICT systems and components (logically or
           physically).

    Organizations should identify approaches used to characterize ICT supply chain vulnerabilities, consistent
    with the characterization of threat sources and events and with the overall approach used by the
    organization for characterizing vulnerabilities. Appendix C provides examples of ICT supply chain threat
    events, based on [NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1, Appendix B].

    All three organizational tiers should contribute to determining the organization’s approaches to
    characterize vulnerabilities, with progressively more detail identified and documented in the lower tiers.
    Table 2-4 provides examples of considerations and different methods that could be used to characterize
    ICT supply chain vulnerabilities at different tiers.

    Consequences and Impact

    Impact is the effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals, other organizations,
    or the Nation (including the national security interests of the United States) of a loss of confidentiality,
    integrity, or availability of information or an information system [NIST SP 800-53 Rev.4].

    For ICT SCRM, impact should be considered for the systems or components traversing the ICT supply
    chain, the supply chain itself, the ICT supply chain infrastructure, and the organization- or mission-level
    activities. All three tiers in the risk management hierarchy may be impacted. Potential impacts can be
    gathered through reviewing historical data for the agency, similar peer organizations, or applicable
    industry surveys. In this publication, impact is always in relation to the organization’s mission and
    includes the systems or components traversing the supply chain as well as the supply chain itself.

    The following are examples of ICT supply chain consequences and impact:
        An earthquake in Malaysia reduced the amount of commodity Dynamic Random Access Memory
            (DRAM) to 60 percent of the world’s supply, creating a shortage for hardware maintenance and
            new design.
        Accidental procurement of a counterfeit part resulted in premature component failure, thereby
            impacting the organization’s mission performance.

    Likelihood

    In an information security risk analysis, likelihood is a weighted factor based on a subjective analysis of
    the probability that a given threat is capable of exploiting a given vulnerability[CNSSI 4009]. Agencies
    should determine which approach(es) they will use to determine the likelihood of an ICT supply chain
    compromise, consistent with the overall approach used by the agency’s risk management function.

    RISK CONSTRAINTS
    TASK 1-2: Identify constraints16 on the conduct of risk assessment, risk response, and risk monitoring
    activities within the organization.

    Supplemental Guidance:

    Identify the following two types of constraints to ensure that the ICT supply chain is integrated into the
    agency risk management process:

         1. Agency constraints; and
         2. ICT supply chain-specific constraints.

    Agency constraints serve as an overall input into framing the ICT supply chain policy at Tier 1, mission
    requirements at Tier 2, and system-specific requirements at Tier 3. Table 2-5 lists the specific agency and
    ICT supply chain constraints. ICT supply chain constraints, such as ICT SCRM policy and ICT SCRM
    requirements, may need to be developed if they do not exist.

                  Security requirements


    An organization ICT SCRM policy is a critical vehicle for guiding ICT SCRM activities. Driven by
    applicable laws and regulations, this policy should support applicable organization policies including
    acquisition and procurement, information security, quality, and supply chain and logistics. It should
    address goals and objectives articulated in the overall agency strategic plan, as well as specific mission
    functions and business goals, along with the internal and external customer requirements. It should also
    define the integration points for ICT SCRM with the agency’s Risk Management Process and SDLC.

    ICT SCRM policy should define ICT SCRM-related roles and responsibilities of the agency ICT SCRM
    team, any dependencies among those roles, and the interaction among the roles. ICT SCRM-related roles
    will articulate responsibilities for collecting ICT supply chain threat intelligence, conducting risk
    assessments, identifying and implementing risk-based mitigations, and performing monitoring functions.
    Identifying and validating roles will help to specify the amount of effort that will be required to
    implement the ICT SCRM Plan. Examples of ICT SCRM-related roles include:

            Risk executive function that provides overarching ICT supply chain risk guidance to engineering
             decisions that specify and select ICT products as the system design is finalized;
            Procurement officer and maintenance engineering responsible for identifying and replacing the
             hardware when defective;
            Delivery organization and acceptance engineers who verify that the part is acceptable to receive
             into the acquiring organization;
            System integrator responsible for system maintenance and upgrades, whose staff resides in the
             acquirer facility and uses system integrator development infrastructure and the acquirer
             operational infrastructure;
            System Security Engineer/Systems Engineer responsible for ensuring that information system
             security concerns are properly identified and addressed; and
            The end user of ICT systems/components/services.

    ICT SCRM requirements should be guided by the ICT SCRM policy, as well as by the mission functions
    and their criticality at Tier 2 and by known functional and security requirements at Tier 3.

    RISK TOLERANCE
    TASK 1-3: Identify the level of risk tolerance for the organization.

    Supplemental Guidance:

    Risk tolerance is the level of risk that organizations are willing to accept in pursuit of strategic goals and
    objectives [NIST SP 800-39]. Organizations should take into account ICT supply chain threats,
    vulnerabilities, constraints, and baseline criticality, when identifying the overall level of risk tolerance.17



    17 Federal Departments’ and Agencies’ governance structures vary widely (see [NIST SP 800-100, Section 2.2.2]). Regardless of

    the governance structure, individual agency risk decisions should apply to the agency and any subordinate organizations, but not
    in the reverse direction.

    PRIORITIES AND TRADE-OFFS
    TASK 1-4: Identify priorities and trade-offs considered by the organization in managing risk.

    Supplemental Guidance

    As a part of identifying priorities and trade-offs, organizations should consider ICT supply chain threats,
    vulnerabilities, constraints, and baseline criticality.

    Outputs and Post Conditions
    Within the scope of NIST SP 800-39, the output of the risk framing step is the risk management strategy
    that identifies how organizations intend to assess, respond to, and monitor risk over time. This strategy
    should clearly include any identified ICT SCRM considerations and should result in the establishment of
    ICT SCRM-specific processes throughout the agency. These processes should be documented in one of
    three ways:

        1. Integrated into existing agency documentation;
        2. A separate set of documents addressing ICT SCRM; or
        3. A mix of separate and integrated documents, based on agency needs and operations.

    The following information should be provided as an output of the risk framing step, regardless of how the
    outputs are documented:

            ICT SCRM Policy;
            Baseline Criticality including prioritized mission functions and FIPS 199 criticality;
            ICT supply chain risk assessment methodology and guidance;
            ICT supply chain risk response guidance;
            ICT supply chain risk monitoring guidance;
            ICT SCRM mission/business requirements;
            Revised mission/business processes and enterprise architecture with ICT SCRM considerations
             integrated; and
            System-level ICT SCRM requirements.

    Outputs from the risk framing step serve as inputs to the risk assessment, risk response, and risk
    monitoring steps.

    2.2.2    ASSESS
    Inputs and Preconditions

    Assess is the step where all the collected data is used to conduct a risk assessment. A number of inputs are
    combined and analyzed to identify the likelihood and the impact of an ICT supply chain compromise,
    including criticality, threat, and vulnerability analysis results; stakeholder knowledge; and policy,
    constraints, and requirements.

    An ICT supply chain risk assessment should be integrated into the overall organization risk assessment
    processes. ICT SCRM risk assessment results should be used and aggregated as appropriate to
    communicate ICT supply chain risks at each tier of the organizational. Figure 2-6 depicts the Assess Step
    with its inputs and outputs along the three organizational tiers.

    Similar to Figure 2-5, Figure 2-6 depicts inputs, activities, and outputs of the Assess Step distributed
    along the three organizational tiers. The large arrows on the left and right sides of the activities depict the
    inputs from other steps of the Risk Management Process, with the arrow on the left depicting that the
    steps are in constant interaction. Inputs into the Assess Step include inputs from the other steps. Up-down
    arrows between the tiers depict flow of information and guidance from the upper tiers to the lower tiers
    and the flow of information and feedback from the lower tiers to the upper tiers. Together the arrows
    indicate that the inputs, activities, and outputs are continuously interacting and influencing one another.

    Criticality, vulnerability, and threat analyses are essential to the supply chain risk assessment process. As
    depicted in Figure 2-4, vulnerability and threat analyses can be performed in any order and may be
    performed iteratively to ensure that all applicable threats and vulnerabilities have been identified.

    The order of activities that begins with the update of the criticality analysis ensures that the assessment is
    scoped to include only relevant critical mission functions and the impact of ICT supply chain on these
    mission functions. The likelihood of exploitability is a key step to understanding impact. It becomes a
    synthesis point for criticality analysis, vulnerability analysis, and threat analysis and helps to further
    clarify impact to support an efficient and cost-effective risk decision.

    Activities

    CRITICALITY ANALYSIS

    TASK 2-0: Update Criticality Analysis of mission-critical functions, systems, and components to narrow
    the scope (and resources) for ICT SCRM activities to those most important to mission success.

    Supplemental Guidance

    Criticality analysis should include the ICT supply chain infrastructure for both the organization and
    applicable system integrators, suppliers, external service providers, and the systems/components/services.
    Criticality analysis assesses the direct impact they each have on the mission priorities. ICT supply chain
    infrastructure includes the SDLC for applicable systems, services, and components because the SDLC
    defines whether security considerations are built into the systems/components or added after
    systems/components have been created.

    Organizations should update and tailor Baseline Criticality established during the Frame Step of the risk
    management process, including FIPS 199 system categorization, based on the information newly
    discovered in the Assess step. Organizations should use their own discretion for whether to perform
    criticality analysis for moderate-impact systems.

    In addition to updating and tailoring Baseline Criticality, performing criticality analysis in the Assess Step
    may include the following:

             Perform a dependency analysis and assessment to establish which components may require
              hardening given the system architecture;
             Obtain and review existing information that the agency has about critical ICT
              systems/components such as locations where they are manufactured or developed, physical and
              logical delivery paths, information flows and financial transactions associated with these
              components, and any other available information that can provide insights into ICT supply chain
              of these components;18 and
             Correlate identified critical components/services to the information about the ICT supply chain,
              the ICT supply chain infrastructure, historical data, and SDLC to identify critical ICT supply
              chain paths.


    The outcome of the updated criticality analysis is a narrowed, prioritized list of the organization’s critical
    functions, systems, and components. Organizations can use the Baseline Criticality process in Chapter
    2.2.1, Task 1-1, to update Criticality Analysis.




    18 This information may be available from a supply chain map for the agency or individual IT projects or systems. Supply chain

    maps are descriptions or depictions of supply chains including the physical and logical flow of goods, information, processes, and
    money upstream and downstream through a supply chain. They may include supply chain nodes, locations, delivery paths, or
    transactions.

    ________________________________________________________________________________________________________

    Because more information will be available in the Assess step, organizations can narrow the scope and
    increase the granularity of a criticality analysis. When identifying critical functions and associated
    systems/components and assigning them criticality levels, consider the following:

             Functional breakdown is an effective method to identify functions, associated critical
              components, and supporting defensive functions;
             Dependency analysis is used to identify the functions on which critical functions depend (e.g.,
              defensive functions such as digital signatures used in software patch acceptance). Those functions
              become critical functions themselves;
             Identification of all access points to identify and limit unmediated access to critical
              function/components (e.g., least-privilege implementation); and
             Malicious alteration can happen throughout the SDLC.

    The resulting list of critical functions is used to guide and inform the vulnerability analysis and threat
    analysis to determine the initial ICT SCRM risk as depicted in Figure 2-3. ICT supply chain
    countermeasures and mitigations can then be selected and implemented to reduce risk to acceptable
    levels.

    Criticality analysis is performed iteratively and may be performed at any point in the SDLC and
    concurrently at each tier. The first iteration is likely to identify critical functions and systems/components
    that have a direct impact on mission functions. Successive iterations will include information from the
    criticality analysis, threat analysis, vulnerability analysis, and mitigation strategies defined at each of the
    other tiers. Each iteration will refine the criticality analysis outcomes and result in the addition of
    defensive functions. Several iterations are likely needed to establish and maintain the criticality analysis
    results.


    THREAT AND VULNERABILITY IDENTIFICATION

    TASK 2-1: Identify threats to and vulnerabilities in organizational information systems and the
    environments in which the systems operate.

    Supplemental Guidance

    In addition to threat and vulnerability identification, as described in [NIST SP 800-39] and [NIST SP 800-
    30 Rev. 1], organizations should conduct ICT supply chain threat analysis and vulnerability analysis.

    Threat Analysis

    For ICT SCRM, a threat analysis provides specific and timely threat characterization of threat events (see
    Appendix C) and potential threat actors, including any identified system integrators, suppliers, or external
    service providers,19 to inform management, acquisition, engineering, and operational activities within an




    19 Please note that threat characterization of system integrators, suppliers, and external service providers may be benign.

    organization. Threat analyses can use a variety of information to assess potential threats, including open
    source, intelligence, and counterintelligence. Organizations should use the threat sources defined during
    the Frame Step in the threat analysis conducted during the Assess Step. Organizations should use the
    results of the threat analysis in the Assess Step to ultimately support acquisition decisions, alternative
    build decisions, and development and selection of appropriate mitigations in the Respond Step. ICT
    supply chain threat analysis should be based on the results of the criticality analysis. Specific identified
    threats may include people, processes, technologies, or natural and man-made disasters.

    Agencies should use information available from existing incident management activities to determine
    whether they have experienced an ICT supply chain compromise and to further investigate such
    compromises. Some ICT supply chain compromises may not be recognized as such at first and may be
    initially identified as an information security or logistics incident. Agencies should define criteria for
    what constitutes an ICT supply chain compromise to ensure that such compromises can be identified as a
    part of post-incident activities, including forensics investigations.

    An ICT supply chain threat analysis should capture at least the following data:
         Changes to the systems/components or SDLC environment;
         Observation of ICT supply chain-related attacks while they are occurring;
         Incident data collected post-ICT supply chain-related compromise;
         Observation of tactics, techniques, and procedures used in specific attacks, whether observed or
           collected using audit mechanisms; and
         Natural and man-made disasters before, during, and after occurrence.


    Vulnerability Analysis

    For ICT SCRM, a vulnerability is any weakness in system/component design, development, production,
    or operation that can be exploited by a threat to defeat a system’s mission objectives or to significantly
    degrade its performance.

    A vulnerability analysis is an iterative process that informs risk assessment and countermeasure selection.
    The vulnerability analysis works alongside the threat analysis to help inform the impact analysis and to
    help scope and prioritize vulnerabilities to be mitigated.

    Vulnerability analysis in the Assess Step should use the approaches used during the Frame Step to
    characterize ICT supply chain vulnerabilities. Vulnerability analysis should begin with identifying
    vulnerabilities that are applicable to mission-critical functions and systems/components identified by the
    criticality analysis. An investigation of vulnerabilities may indicate the need to raise or at least reconsider
    the criticality levels of functions and components identified in earlier criticality analyses. Later iterations
    of the vulnerability analysis may also identify additional threats, or opportunities for threats, not
    considered in earlier threat assessments.

    Table 2-6 provides examples of applicable ICT supply chain vulnerabilities that can be observed within
    the three organizational tiers.

    The principal vulnerabilities to identify are:
        Access paths within the supply chain that would allow malicious actors to gain information about
            the system and ultimately introduce components that could cause the system to fail at some later
            time (“components” here include hardware, software, and firmware);
        Access paths that would allow malicious actors to trigger a component malfunction or failure
            during system operations; and
        Dependencies on supporting or associated components that might be more accessible or easier for
            malicious actors to subvert than components that directly perform critical functions.

    RISK DETERMINATION

    TASK 2-2: Determine the risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations,
    and the Nation if identified threats exploit identified vulnerabilities.

    Supplemental Guidance

    Organizations determine ICT supply chain risk by considering the likelihood that known threats exploit
    known vulnerabilities to and through the ICT supply chain and the resulting consequences or adverse
    impacts (i.e., magnitude of harm) if such exploitations occur. Organizations use threat and vulnerability

    information together with likelihood and consequences/impact information to determine ICT SCRM risk
    either qualitatively or quantitatively.

    Likelihood

    Likelihood is the probability that an exploit occurrence may result in the loss of mission capability.
    Determining the likelihood requires the consideration of the characteristics of the threat sources, the
    identified vulnerabilities, and the organizations susceptibility to the ICT supply chain compromise, prior
    to and with the safeguards/mitigations implemented. This analysis should consider the degree of an
    adversary’s intent to interfere with the organization’s mission. For example, how much time or money
    would the adversary spend to validate the existence of and leverage the vulnerability to attack a system?
    ICT supply chain risk assessment should consider two views:

            The likelihood that the ICT supply chain itself is compromised. This may impact, for example,
             the availability of quality components or increase the risk of intellectual property theft; and
            The likelihood that the system or component within the supply chain may be compromised, for
             example, if malicious code is inserted into a system or an electric storm damages a component.

    In some cases, these two views may overlap or be indistinguishable, but both may have an impact on the
    agency’s ability to perform its mission.

     Likelihood determination should consider:

            Threat assumptions that articulate the types of threats that the system or the component may be
             subject to, such as cybersecurity threats, natural disasters, or physical security threats;
            Actual supply chain threat information such as adversaries’ capabilities, tools, intentions, and
             targets;
            Exposure of components to external access;
            Identified system, process, or component vulnerabilities; and
            Empirical data on weaknesses and vulnerabilities available from any completed analysis (e.g.,
             system analysis, process analysis) to determine probabilities of ICT supply chain threat
             occurrence.

    Factors to consider include the ease or difficulty of successfully attacking through a vulnerability and the
    ability to detect the method used to introduce or trigger a vulnerability. The objective is to assess the net
    effect of the vulnerability, which will be combined with threat information to determine the likelihood of
    successful attacks in the risk assessment process. The likelihood can be based on threat assumptions or
    actual threat data, such as previous breaches of the supply chain, specific adversary capability, historical
    breach trends, or frequency of breaches. The organization may use empirical data and statistical analysis
    to determine specific probabilities of breach occurrence, depending on the type of data available and
    accessible within the organization and from supporting organizations.

    Impact

    Organizations should begin impact analysis with the potential impacts identified during the Frame Step,
    determining the impact of a compromise and then the impact of mitigating that compromise.
    Organizations need to identify the various adverse impacts of compromise, including: (i) the
    characteristics of the threat sources that could initiate the events; (ii) identified vulnerabilities; and (iii)
    the organizational susceptibility to such events based on planned or implemented countermeasures.
    Impact analysis is an iterative process performed initially when a compromise occurs, when mitigation

CHAPTER 2                                                                                                    PAGE 39

    ________________________________________________________________________________________________________

    approach is decided to evaluate the impact of change, and finally, in the ever-changing SDLC, when the
    situation/context of the system or environment changes.

    Organizations should use the result of impact analysis to define an acceptable level of ICT supply chain
    risk for a given system. Impact is derived from criticality, threat, and vulnerability analyses results, and
    should be based on the likelihood of exploit occurrence. Impact is likely to be a qualitative measure
    requiring analytic judgment. Executive/decision makers use impact as an input into the risk-based
    decisions whether to accept, avoid, mitigate, share, or transfer the resulting risks and the consequences of
    such decisions.

    Organizations should document the overall results of ICT supply chain risk assessments in risk
    assessment reports.20 ICT supply chain risk assessment reports should cover risks in all three
    organizational tiers as applicable. Based on the organizational structure and size, multiple ICT supply
    chain risk assessment reports may be required. Agencies are encouraged to develop individual reports at
    Tier 1. For Tier 2, agencies may want to integrate ICT supply chain risks into the respective mission-level
    Business Impact Assessments (BIA) or develop separate mission-level ICT supply chain risk assessment
    reports. For Tier 3, agencies may want to integrate ICT supply chain risks into the respective System Risk
    assessment reports or develop separate system-level ICT supply chain risk assessment reports. The ICT
    supply chain risk assessment report applies only to High Criticality systems per [FIPS 199].
    Organizations may decide to develop ICT supply chain risk assessment reports for Moderate Criticality
    systems per [FIPS 199].

    ICT supply chain risk assessment reports at all three tiers should be interconnected, reference each other
    when appropriate, and integrated into the ICT SCRM Plans.

    Outputs and Post Conditions
    This step results in:

            Confirmed mission function criticality;
            Establishment of relationships between the critical aspects of the system’s ICT supply chain
             infrastructure (e.g., SDLC) and applicable threats and vulnerabilities;
            Understanding of the likelihood and the impact of a potential ICT supply chain compromise;
            Understanding of mission and system-specific risks;
            Documented ICT supply chain risk assessments for mission functions and individual systems;
             and
            Integration of relevant ICT supply chain risk assessment results into the organization risk
             management process.

    2.2.3                        RESPOND
    Inputs and Preconditions

    Respond is the step in which the individuals conducting risk assessment will communicate the assessment
    results, proposed mitigation/controls options, and the corresponding acceptable level of risk for each
    proposed option to the decision makers. This information should be presented in a manner appropriate to
    inform and guide risk-based decisions. This will allow decision makers to finalize appropriate risk
    response based on the set of options along with the corresponding risk factors for choosing the various
    options. Sometimes an appropriate response is to do nothing and to monitor the adversary’s activities and
    behavior to better understand the tactics and to attribute the activities.

    ICT supply chain risk response should be integrated into the overall organization risk response. Figure 2-
    7 depicts the Respond Step with its inputs and outputs along the three organizational tiers.

    Activities
    RISK RESPONSE IDENTIFICATION

    TASK 3-1: Identify alternative courses of action to respond to risk determined during the risk
    assessment.

    Organizations should select ICT SCRM controls and tailor these controls based on the risk determination.
    ICT SCRM controls should be selected for all three organizational tiers, as appropriate per findings of the
    risk assessments for each of the tiers.

    Many of the ICT SCRM controls included in this document may be part of an IT security plan. These
    controls are included because they apply to ICT SCRM.

    This process should begin with determining acceptable risk to support the evaluation of alternatives (also
    known as trade-off analysis).

    EVALUATION OF ALTERNATIVES

    TASK 3-2: Evaluate alternative courses of action for responding to risk.

    Once an initial acceptable level of risk has been defined and options identified, these options should be
    evaluated for achieving this level of risk by selecting mitigations from ICT SCRM controls and tailoring
    them to the organization’s context. Chapter 3 provides risk mitigations and more information on how to
    select and tailor them.

    This step involves conducting analysis of alternatives to select the proposed options for ICT SCRM
    mitigations/controls to be applied throughout the organization.

    To tailor a set of ICT SCRM controls, the organization should perform ICT SCRM and mission-level
    trade-off analysis to achieve appropriate balance among ICT SCRM and functionality needs of the
    organization. This analysis will result in a set of cost-effective ICT SCRM controls that is dynamically
    updated to ensure that mission-related considerations trigger updates to ICT SCRM controls.

    During this evaluation, applicable requirements and constraints are reviewed with the stakeholders to
    ensure that ICT SCRM controls appropriately balance ICT SCRM and the broader organizational
    requirements, such as cost, schedule, performance, policy, and compliance.

    ICT SCRM controls will vary depending on where they are applied within organizational tiers and SDLC
    processes. For example, ICT SCRM controls may range from using a blind buying strategy to obscure
    end use of a critical component, to design attributes (e.g., input validation, sandboxes, and anti-tamper
    design). For each implemented control, the organization should identify someone responsible for its
    execution and develop a time- or event-phased plan for implementation throughout the SDLC. Multiple
    controls may address a wide range of possible risks. Therefore, understanding how the controls impact the
    overall risk is critical and must be considered before choosing and tailoring the combination of controls as
    yet another trade-off analysis may be needed before the controls can be finalized. The organization may

    ________________________________________________________________________________________________________

    be trading one risk for a larger risk unknowingly if the dependencies between the proposed controls and
    the overall risk are not understood and addressed.

    RISK RESPONSE DECISION

    TASK 3-3: Decide on the appropriate course of action for responding to risk.
    As described in [NIST SP 800-39] , organizations should finalize identified and tailored ICT SCRM
    controls, based on the evaluation of alternatives and an overall understanding of threats, risks, and supply
    chain priorities.

    Risk response decisions may be made by a risk executive or be delegated by the risk executive to
    someone else in the organization. While the decision can be delegated to Tier 2 or Tier 3, the significance
    and the reach of the impact should determine the tier where the decision is being made. Risk response
    decisions may be made in collaboration with an organization’s risk executives, mission owners, and
    system owners, as appropriate.

    The resulting decision, along with the selected and tailored controls should be documented in an ICT
    SCRM Plan. While the ICT SCRM Plan should ideally be developed proactively, it may also be
    developed in response to an ICT supply chain compromise. Ultimately, the ICT SCRM Plan should cover
    the full SDLC, document an ICT SCRM baseline, and identify ICT supply chain requirements and
    controls for Tiers 1, 2, and 3. The ICT SCRM Plan should be revised and updated based on the output of
    ICT supply chain monitoring.

    ICT SCRM Plans should:

            Represent the result of an internal dialogue among Tiers 1, 2, and 3 stakeholders within the
             organization in support of the organization’s mission and relevant mission function;
            Set the framework for an external dialogue between acquirers and system integrators, suppliers,
             and external service providers;
            Help define the state of the information system that will be “fit for purpose”; and
            Establish acceptance criteria that may be used in acquiring and sourcing ICT components and
             services.

    The ICT SCRM Plan should cover activities in all three organizational tiers as applicable.

    Depending on their governance structure and size, agencies can have multiple ICT SCRM Plans, one for
    Tier 1, several for Tier 2, and several for Tier 3. Agencies are encouraged to develop individual plans at
    Tiers 1 and 2. For Tier 3, agencies may want to integrate ICT SCRM controls into the respective System
    Security Plans or develop separate system-level ICT SCRM Plans. At Tier 3, the ICT SCRM Plan applies
    to High-Impact systems per [FIPS 199] , though organizations may decide to develop an ICT SCRM Plan
    for Moderate-Impact systems per [FIPS 199]. Regardless of the total number of plans, the ICT SCRM
    requirements and controls at the higher tiers will flow down to the lower tiers and should be used to guide
    the development of the lower tier ICT SCRM Plans. Conversely, the ICT SCRM controls and
    requirements at the lower tiers should be considered in developing and revising requirements and controls
    applied at the higher tiers. Agencies may choose to integrate their Tier 3 ICT SCRM controls into the
    applicable System Security Plans or create individual ICT SCRM Plans for Tier 3 that reference
    corresponding System Security Plans.

    ICT SCRM Plans at all three tiers should be interconnected and reference each other when appropriate.

    At each Tier, the plan should:

            Summarize the environment as determined in Frame such as applicable policies, processes, and
             procedures based on organization and mission requirements currently implemented in the
             organization;
            State the role responsible for the plan such as Risk Executive, Chief Financial Officer (CFO),
             Chief Information Officer (CIO), Program Manager, or System Owner;
            Identify key contributors such as CFO, Chief Operations Officer (COO), Acquisition/Contracting,
             System Engineer, System Security Engineer, Developer/Maintenance Engineer, Operations
             Manager, or System Architect;
            Provide the applicable (per tier) set of controls resulting from the Analysis of Alternatives (in
             Respond);
            Provide tailoring decision for selected controls including the rationale for the decision;
            Describe feedback processes among the tiers to ensure that ICT supply chain interdependencies
             are addressed;
            Describe monitoring and enforcement activities (including auditing if appropriate) applicable to
             the scope of each specific ICT SCRM Plan;
            If appropriate, state qualitative or quantitative measures to support implementation of the ICT
             SCRM Plan and to assess effectiveness of this implementation;21
            Define frequency for deciding whether the plan needs to be reviewed and revised;
            Include criteria that would trigger revision, for example, life cycle milestones, gate reviews, or
             significant contracting activities; and
            Include system integrator, supplier, and external service provider ICT SCRM Plans if made
             available as part of agreements.

    RISK RESPONSE IMPLEMENTATION
    TASK 3-4: Implement the course of action selected to respond to risk.

    Organizations should implement the ICT SCRM Plan in a manner that integrates the ICT SCRM controls
    into the overall agency risk management processes.

    Outputs and Post Conditions

    The output of this step is a set of ICT SCRM controls that address ICT SCRM requirements and can be
    incorporated into the system requirements baseline. These requirements and resulting controls will be
    incorporated into the SDLC and other organizational processes, throughout the three tiers.

    This step results in:
         Selected, evaluated, and tailored ICT SCRM controls that address identified risks;
         Identified consequences of accepting or not accepting the proposed mitigations; and
         Development and implementation of the ICT SCRM Plan.

    Monitor is the step in which the project/program is routinely evaluated to maintain or adjust the
    acceptable level of risk. Changes to the organization, mission/business, operations, or the supply chain
    can directly impact an individual project/program and the organization’s ICT supply chain infrastructure.
    The monitor step provides a mechanism for tracking such changes and ensuring that they are
    appropriately assessed for impact (in Assess). If ICT supply chain infrastructure is redefined as a result of
    monitoring, organizations should engage in a dialog with the system integrators, supplier, and external
    service providers about implications and mutual obligations.

    Organizations should integrate ICT SCRM into existing continuous monitoring programs.22 In case a
    Continuous Monitoring program does not exist, ICT SCRM can serve as a catalyst for establishment of a
    more comprehensive continuous monitoring program. Figure 2-8 depicts the Monitor Step with its inputs
    and outputs along the three organizational tiers.

    Activities
    RISK MONITORING STRATEGY
    TASK 4-1: Develop a risk monitoring strategy for the organization that includes the purpose, type, and
    frequency of monitoring activities.

    Supplemental Guidance:

    Organizations should integrate ICT SCRM considerations into their overall risk monitoring strategy.
    Because some of the information will be gathered from outside of the agency – from open sources,
    suppliers and integrators, monitoring ICT supply chain risk may require information that agencies have
    not traditionally collected. The strategy should, among other things, include the data to be collected, state
    the specific measures that will be compiled from the data, identify existing or required tools to collect the
    data, identify how the data will be protected, and define reporting formats for the data. Potential data
    sources may include:

            Agency vulnerability management and incident management activities;
            Agency manual reviews;
            Interagency information sharing;
            Information sharing between the agency and system integrator or external service provider;
            Supplier information sharing; and
            Contractual reviews of system integrator or external service provider.

    Organizations should ensure the appropriate protection of supplier data if that data is collected and stored
    by the agency. Agencies may also require additional data collection and analysis tools to appropriately
    evaluate the data to achieve the objective of monitoring applicable ICT supply chain risks.

    RISK MONITORING

    TASK 4-2: Monitor organizational information systems and environments of operation on an ongoing
    basis to verify compliance, determine effectiveness of risk response measures, and identify changes.

    According to [NIST SP 800-39], organizations should monitor compliance, effectiveness, and change.
    Monitoring compliance within the context of ICT SCRM involves monitoring an organization’s processes
    and ICT products and services for compliance with the established security and ICT SCRM requirements.
    Monitoring effectiveness involves monitoring the resulting risks to determine whether these established
    security and ICT SCRM requirements produce the intended results. Monitoring change involves
    monitoring the environment for any changes that would require changing requirements and
    mitigations/controls to maintain an acceptable level of ICT supply chain risk.

CHAPTER 2                                                                                                  PAGE 47

                                                                           Information Systems and Organizations

    To monitor changes, organizations need to identify and document the set of triggers that would change
    ICT supply chain risk. While the categories of triggers will likely include changes to constraints,
    identified in Table 2-6 (during the Frame Step), such as policy, mission, change to the threat environment,
    enterprise architecture, SDLC, or requirements, the specific triggers within those categories may be
    substantially different for different organizations.

    An example of the ICT supply chain infrastructure change is two key vetted suppliers23 announcing their
    departure from a specific market, therefore creating a supply shortage for specific components. This
    would trigger the need to evaluate whether reducing the number of suppliers would create vulnerabilities
    in component availability and integrity. In this scenario, potential deficit of components may result
    simply from insufficient supply of components, because fewer components are available. If none of the
    remaining suppliers are vetted, this deficit may result in uncertain integrity of the remaining components.
    If the organizational policy directs use of vetted components, this event may result in the organization’s
    inability to fulfill its mission needs.

    In addition to regularly updating existing risks assessments with the results of the ongoing monitoring, the
    organization should determine what would trigger a reassessment. Some of these triggers may include
    availability of resources, changes to ICT supply chain risk, natural disasters, or mission collapse.

    Outputs and Post Conditions

    Organizations should integrate the ICT supply chain outputs of the Monitor Step into the ICT SCRM
    Plan. This plan will provide inputs into iterative implementations of the Frame, Assess, and Respond
    Steps as required.




    23 A vetted supplier is a supplier with whom the organization is comfortable doing business. This level of comfort is usually

    achieved through developing an organization-defined set of supply chain criteria and then vetting suppliers against those criteria.

    CHAPTER THREE

    ICT SCRM CONTROLS
    NIST defines security controls as:

             The management, operational, and technical controls (i.e., safeguards or
             countermeasures) prescribed for an information system to protect the confidentiality,
             integrity, and availability of the system and its information. [FIPS 200, FIPS 199, CNSSI
             No. 4009, NIST SP 800-37 Rev. 1, NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 4, NIST SP 800-53A Rev. 4]

    [NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 4] defines a number of ICT supply chain-related controls within the catalog of
    information security controls. This chapter is structured as an enhanced overlay of [NIST SP 800-53 Rev.
    4]. It identifies and augments ICT SCRM-related controls with additional supplemental guidance and
    provides new controls as appropriate. The ICT SCRM controls are organized into the eighteen control
    families of [NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 4]. Also, an ICT SCRM-specific family, Provenance, was created,
    resulting in nineteen (19) ICT SCRM control families. This approach facilitates use of the security
    controls assessment techniques provided in [NIST SP 800-53A Rev. 4]to be used to assess
    implementation of ICT SCRM controls.

    The controls provided in this publication are intended for organizations to implement internally. As with
    [NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 4], the security controls and control enhancements are a starting point from which
    controls/enhancements may be removed, added, or specialized based on an organization’s needs. Each
    control in this chapter is listed for its applicability to ICT SCRM. Those controls from [NIST SP 800-53
    Rev. 4] not listed are not considered directly applicable to ICT SCRM, and thus are not included in this
    publication. Details and supplemental guidance for the various ICT SCRM controls in this publication are
    contained in Chapter 3.4.1. Appendix A maps the ICT SCRM controls in this publication to their
    corresponding [NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 4] controls as appropriate.

    3.1 ICT SCRM CONTROLS SUMMARY

    During the Respond Step of the risk management process discussed in Chapter 2.2.3, organizations select,
    tailor, and implement controls for mitigating ICT supply chain risk. Appendix E of NIST 800-53 Revision
    4 lists a set of information security controls at the FIPS 199 high-, moderate-, and low-impact levels. This
    chapter describes how these controls help mitigate risk to high-impact information systems and
    components, as well as the ICT supply chain infrastructure. The chapter provides nineteen (19) ICT
    SCRM control families that include relevant ICT controls and supplemental guidance.

    Figure 3-1 depicts the process used to identify, refine, and add ICT SCRM supplemental guidance to the
    [NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 4] ICT SCRM-related controls. The figure, which repeats Figure 1-5, represents
    the following steps:

        1. Selected and extracted individual controls and enhancements from [NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 4] that
           were applicable to ICT SCRM;
        2. Analyzed these controls to determine how they apply to ICT SCRM;
        3. Evaluated the resulting set of controls and enhancements to determine whether all ICT SCRM
           concerns were addressed;
        4. Developed additional controls currently not defined in [NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 4];

                                                                   Information Systems and Organizations
    ________________________________________________________________________________________________________

        5.   Assigned applicable tiers to each ICT SCRM control; and
        6.   Developed ICT SCRM-specific supplemental guidance for each ICT SCRM control.




                            Figure 3-1: ICT SCRM Security Controls in NIST SP 800-161, Chapter 3.5

    It should be noted that [NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 4] provides some ICT SCRM-related controls. These
    controls may be listed in this publication with a summary or additional guidance and a reference back to
    the original NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 control and supplemental guidance detail.

                                             Managing Cost and Resources

      Organizations should be aware that implementing these controls will require financial and human
      resources. Furthermore, any requirements for system integrators, suppliers, or external service
      providers that result from federal agencies implementing these controls may also require financial and
      human resources from those system integrators, suppliers, and external service providers, potentially
      resulting in increased costs to the federal acquirers. The acquirers should be cognizant of the costs
      and weigh them against the benefits when selecting ICT SCRM controls. This challenge of balancing
      ICT supply chain risks with benefits and costs of mitigating controls should be a key component of
      the organization’s overall approach to ICT SCRM.



    3.2 ICT SCRM CONTROLS THROUGHOUT THE ORGANIZATION

    As noted in Table 3-1, ICT SCRM controls in this publication are designated by the three tiers composing
    the organization. This is to facilitate ICT SCRM control selection specific to organizations, their various
    missions, and individual systems, as described in Chapter 2 under the Respond step of the risk
    management process. During controls selection, organizations should use the ICT SCRM controls in this
    chapter to identify appropriate ICT SCRM controls for tailoring, per risk assessment. By selecting and
    implementing applicable ICT SCRM controls for each tier, organizations will ensure that they have
    appropriately addressed ICT SCRM throughout their enterprises.

    3.3 APPLYING ICT SCRM CONTROLS TO ACQUIRING ICT PRODUCTS AND
        SERVICES

    Acquirers may use ICT SCRM controls to communicate their ICT SCRM requirements to different types
    of organizations, described within this publication, that provide ICT products and services to acquirers,
    including system integrators, suppliers, and external service providers. Acquirers are encouraged to use


CHAPTER 3                                                                                                      PAGE 50
    Special Publication 800-161                                Supply Chain Risk Management Practices for Federal
                                                               Information Systems and Organizations
    ________________________________________________________________________________________________________

    ICT SCRM plans for their respective systems and missions throughout their acquisition activities. More
    detail on how to use ICT SCRM plans for acquisition is provided in Appendix E.

    It is important to recognize that the controls in this chapter do not provide specific contracting language.
    Acquirers should develop their own contracting language using this publication as guidance to develop
    specific ICT SCRM requirements to be included in contracts. The following sections expand upon the
    system integrator, supplier, and external service provider roles with respect to ICT SCRM expectations
    for acquirers.

    Organizations may use multiple techniques to ascertain that these controls are in place. Techniques may
    include: supplier self-assessment, acquirer review, or third-party assessments for measurement and
    conformance to the organization's requirements. Organizations should first look to established third-party
    assessments to see if they meet their needs. When an organization defines ICT SCRM requirements, it
    may discover that established third-party assessments may not address all specific requirements. In this
    case, additional evidence may be needed to justify additional requirements. Please note that the data
    obtained for this purpose should be appropriately protected.

       In this document the word organization means federal department or agency. In the context of this
                            document, the federal department/agency is the acquirer.

    3.3.1    System Integrators
    System integrators are those entities that provide customized services to the acquirer including custom
    development, test, operations, and maintenance. This group usually replies to a request for proposal from
    an acquirer with a proposal that describes solution or services that are customized to the acquirer’s
    requirements. Such proposals provided by system integrators can include many layers of suppliers (see
    Chapter 3.3.2). The system integrator should ensure that those suppliers are vetted and verified with
    respect to the acquirer’s ICT SCRM requirements. Because of the level of visibility that can be obtained
    in the relationship with the system integrator, the acquirer has the ability to require rigorous supplier
    acceptance criteria as well as any relevant countermeasures to address identified or potential risks.

    3.3.2    Suppliers
    Suppliers may provide either commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) or government off-the-shelf (GOTS)
    solutions to the acquirer. COTS solutions include non-developmental items (NDI), such as commercially
    licensing solutions/products, which includes Open Source Solutions (OSS). GOTS solutions are
    government-only license-able solutions. Suppliers are a diverse group, ranging from very small to large,
    specialized to diversified, based in a single country to transnational, and range widely in the level of
    sophistication, resources, and transparency/visibility in both process and solution. Suppliers also have
    diverse levels and types of ICT SCRM practices in place. These practices and other related practices may
    provide the evidence needed for SCRM evaluation. An example of a federal resource that may be
    leveraged is the Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA) accreditation for Trusted Suppliers. When
    appropriate, allow suppliers the opportunity to reuse any existing data and documentation that may
    provide evidence of ICT SCRM implementation.

    Organizations should consider that the costs of doing business with suppliers may be directly impacted by
    the level of visibility the suppliers allow into how they apply security and supply chain practices to their
    solutions. When organizations or system integrators require greater levels of transparency from suppliers,
    they must consider the possible cost implications of such requirements. Suppliers may select to not
    participate in procurements to avoid increased costs or perceived risks to their intellectual property,


CHAPTER 3                                                                                                  PAGE 51

    ________________________________________________________________________________________________________

    limiting an organization’s supply or technology choices. The risk to suppliers is the potential for multiple,
    different sets of requirements that they may have to individually comply with, which may not be scalable.

    3.3.3    External Providers of Information System Services
    Organizations use external IT service providers to manage their mission and business functions [NIST SP
    800-53 Rev. 4, p. 12]. The outsourcing of IT systems and services creates a set of ICT supply chain
    concerns that reduces the acquirer’s visibility into, and management of, the outsourced functions.
    Therefore, it requires increased rigor from organizations in defining ICT SCRM requirements, stating
    them in procurements, and then monitoring delivered services and evaluating them for compliance with
    the stated requirements. Regardless of who performs the services, the acquirer is ultimately responsible
    and accountable for the risk to the organization’s systems and data that may result from using these
    services. Organizations should implement a set of compensating ICT SCRM controls to address this risk
    and work with the risk executive to accept this risk. A variety of methods may be used to communicate
    and subsequently verify and monitor ICT SCRM requirements through such vehicles as contracts,
    interagency agreements, lines of business arrangements, licensing agreements, and/or supply chain
    transactions.

    3.4 SELECTING AND TAILORING IMPLEMENTING ICT SCRM SECURITY
        CONTROLS

    The ICT SCRM controls defined in this chapter should be selected and tailored according to individual
    organization needs and environment using the guidance in [NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 4], in order to ensure a
    cost-effective, risk-based approach to providing ICT SCRM organization-wide. The ICT SCRM baseline
    defined in this publication addresses the basic needs of a broad and diverse set of constituencies.
    Organizations must select, tailor, and implement the security controls based on: (i) the environments in
    which organizational information systems are acquired and operate; (ii) the nature of operations
    conducted by organizations; (iii) the types of threats facing organizations, missions/business processes,
    supply chains, and information systems; and (iv) the type of information processed, stored, or transmitted
    by information systems and the supply chain infrastructure.

    After selecting the initial set of security controls from Chapter 3, the acquirer should initiate the tailoring
    process according to [NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 4] in order to appropriately modify and more closely align
    the selected controls with the specific conditions within the organization. The tailoring should be
    coordinated with and approved by the appropriate organizational officials [e.g., authorizing officials,
    authorizing official designated representatives, risk executive (function), chief information officers, or
    senior information security officers] prior to implementing the ICT SCRM controls. Additionally,
    organizations have the flexibility to perform the tailoring process at the organization level (either as the
    required tailored baseline or as the starting point for policy, program or system-specific tailoring), in
    support of a specific program, at the individual information system level, or using a combination of
    organization-level, program/mission-level and system-specific approaches.

    Selection and tailoring decisions, including the specific rationale for those decisions, should be
    documented in the ICT SCRM Plans for Tiers 1, 2, and 3 and approved by the appropriate organizational
    officials as part of the ICT SCRM Plan approval process.
    3.4.1 ICT SCRM Control Format

    Table 3-2 shows the format used in this publication for controls which provide supplemental ICT SCRM
    guidance on existing [NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 4] controls or control enhancements.

    tiers. New controls are given identifiers consistent with [NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 4], but do not duplicate
    existing control identifiers.

                   organization’s system. For example, in a “badge flipping” situation, a contract is transferred from one
                   system integrator organization to another with the same personnel supporting the contract. In that
                   situation, the organization should retire the old credentials and issue completely new credentials.

    3.4.2    Using ICT SCRM Controls in This Publication
    The remainder of Chapter 3 provides the enhanced ICT SCRM overlay of [NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 4].
    Appendix B contains the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 controls and enhancements. This chapter displays

             complete control (unchanged from NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4) provided in Appendix B. The
             tiers in which the control applies are also provided.
            If a NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 enhancement was determined to be relevant to ICT SCRM, but
             the parent control was not, the parent control number and title is included, but there is no
             supplemental ICT SCRM guidance, and the parent control text is not included in Appendix B.
            ICT SCRM controls/enhancements that do not have an associated NIST 800-53 Revision 4
             control/enhancement are listed with their titles and the control/enhancement text.
            All ICT SCRM controls include the tiers in which the control applies and supplemental ICT
             SCRM guidance as applicable.
            When a control enhancement provides a mechanism for implementing the ICT SCRM control, the
             control enhancement is listed within the Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance and is not included
             separately.

    The following new controls and control enhancement have been added:

            The Provenance control family is included in Chapter 3 with a description of the control family
             and three associated controls;
            The SCRM Control MA-7 –Maintenance Monitoring - is added to the Maintenance control
             family; and
            The control enhancement The SCRM Control Enhancement SA-15 (3) – Tamper Resistance – is
             added to the System Acquisition.

    Each SCRM control in Chapter 3 that originated from [NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 4] contains a link to
    Appendix B where the full NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 control text is provided. Controls in Appendix B
    contain links back to the related ICT SCRM control in Chapter 3.5. This feature is provided to increase

    3.5 ICT SCRM SECURITY CONTROLS

    FAMILY: ACCESS CONTROL

    [FIPS 200] specifies the Access Control minimum security requirement as follows:

             Organizations must limit information system access to authorized users, processes acting on
             behalf of authorized users, or devices (including other information systems) and to the types of
             transactions and functions that authorized users are permitted to exercise.

    Systems and components that traverse the ICT supply chain infrastructure are subject to access by a
    variety of individuals within an organization, system integrator, supplier, or external service provider.
    Such access should be defined and managed to ensure that it does not inadvertently result in
    unauthorized release, modification, or destruction of sensitive information. This access should be
    limited to only the necessary access for authorized individuals and monitored for ICT supply chain
    impact.


    AC-1     ACCESS CONTROL POLICY AND PROCEDURES


             Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: Organizations should specify and include in agreements (e.g., contracting
             language) access control policies for their system integrators, suppliers, and external service providers.
             These should include both physical and logical access to the ICT supply chain infrastructure and the
             information system.

             TIER: 1, 2, 3



    AC-2     ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT


             Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: Use of this control helps in traceability of actions and actors in the ICT
             supply chain infrastructure.

             TIER: 2, 3


    AC-3     ACCESS ENFORCEMENT


             Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: Ensure that the information systems and the ICT supply chain
             infrastructure have appropriate access enforcement mechanisms in place. This includes both physical and
             logical access enforcement mechanisms, which likely work in coordination for ICT supply chain needs.
             Organizations should ensure a detailed definition of access enforcement.

             TIER: 2, 3

             Control enhancements:

             (8)   ACCESS ENFORCEMENT | REVOCATION OF ACCESS AUTHORIZATIONS

                   Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: Prompt revocation is critical to ensure that system integrators,
                   suppliers, and external service providers who no longer require access are not able to access an
                   organization’s system. For example, in a “badge flipping” situation, a contract is transferred from one
                   system integrator organization to another with the same personnel supporting the contract. In that
                   situation, the organization should retire the old credentials and issue completely new credentials.

             (9)   ACCESS ENFORCEMENT | CONTROLLED RELEASE

                   Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: Information about the ICT supply chain should be controlled for
                   release between the organizations. Information may be continuously exchanged between the
                   organization and its system integrators, suppliers, and external service providers. Controlled release of
                   organizational information provides protection to manage risks associated with disclosure.

    AC-4     INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT


             Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: Supply chain information may traverse a large ICT supply chain
             infrastructure to a broad set of stakeholders including the organization and its various federal stakeholders,
             as well as system integrators, suppliers, and external service providers. Requirements of information flow
             enforcement should ensure that only the required information, and not more, is communicated to the
             various participants in the supply chain.

             (6)   INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | METADATA

                   Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: Metadata relevant to ICT SCRM is quite extensive and includes
                   activities within the SDLC. For example, information about systems and system components,
                   acquisition details, and delivery is considered metadata and should be appropriately protected.
                   Organizations should identify what metadata is directly relevant to their ICT supply chain security and
                   ensure that information flow enforcement is implemented in order to protect the metadata.

             (17) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | DOMAIN AUTHENTICATION

                   Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: Within the ICT SCRM context, organizations should specify various
                   source and destination points for information about ICT supply chain and information that flows
                   through the supply chain. This is so that organizations have visibility of information flow within the
                   ICT supply chain infrastructure.

             (19) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | VALIDATION OF METADATA

                   Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: For ICT SCRM, data and the relationship to its metadata and the
                   validation of it become critical. Much of the data transmitted through the ICT supply chain
                   infrastructure is validated with the verification of the metadata that is bound to it. Ensuring that proper
                   filtering and inspection is put in place for validation before allowing payloads into the ICT supply
                   chain infrastructure.

                   Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: The organization should ensure the separation of the information
                   system and ICT supply chain infrastructure information flow. Various mechanisms can be
                   implemented including, for example, encryption methods (e.g., digital signing). Addressing

    AC-5     SEPERATION OF DUTIES


             Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: The organization should ensure that appropriate separation of duties is
             established for decisions requiring the acquisition of both information system and ICT supply chain
             infrastructure components. Separation of duties helps to ensure that adequate protections are in place for
             components entering the organization’s supply chain. An example may be separating technical decision
             makers from the procurement personnel for deciding on components in the supply chain.

                   Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: Organizations should ensure that protections are in place to prevent
                   non-organizational users from having privileged access to organizational ICT supply chain
                   infrastructure and related supply chain information. When organizational users may include
                   independent consultants, system integrators, suppliers, and external services providers, relevant access
                   requirements may need to be more precisely defined regarding which information and/or components
                   are accessible, for what duration, at which frequency, using which access methods, and by whom,
                   using least privilege mechanisms. Understanding which components are critical and noncritical can aid
                   in understanding the level of detail that may need to be defined regarding least privilege access for
                   non-organizational users.

             Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: With the push toward distributed approaches to accessing ICT supply
             chain infrastructures, whether for development, maintenance, or operation of information systems,
             organizations should implement secure remote access mechanisms and allow remote access only to vetted
             personnel. Remote access to an organization’s ICT supply chain infrastructure (including distributed
             software development environments) should be limited to the organization or system integrator personnel
             as required to perform their tasks. Ensure that appropriate levels of remote access requirements are properly
             defined (including agreements between organization and its system integrators).

                   disclosure or access can have significant implications to an organization’s mission processes,
                   appropriate measures must be taken to vet both the ICT supply chain infrastructure and personnel
                   processes to ensure that adequate protections are implemented. Ensure that remote access to such

    AC-18    WIRELESS ACCESS


             Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: An organization’s ICT supply chain infrastructure may include wireless
             infrastructure that supports supply chain logistics (e.g., Radio Frequency Identification Device [RFID]
             support, software call home features). Supply chain systems/components traverse such ICT supply chain
             infrastructures as they are moved from one location to another, whether within the organization’s own
             environment or during delivery from system integrators or suppliers. Ensuring appropriate access
             mechanisms are in place within this ICT supply chain infrastructure enables the protection of the
             information systems and components, as well as logistics technologies and metadata used during shipping
             (e.g., within tracking sensors). The organization should explicitly define appropriate wireless access control
             mechanisms for the ICT supply chain infrastructure in policy and implement appropriate mechanisms.

    AC-19    ACCESS CONTROL FOR MOBILE DEVICES


             Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: Use of mobile devices has become common in ICT supply chain
             infrastructure. They are used as mechanisms for tracking supply chain logistics data as information systems
             and components traverse organization or systems integrator ICT supply chain infrastructure. Ensure that
             access control mechanisms are clearly defined and implemented where relevant when managing
             organizations ICT supply chain components. An example of such an implementation includes access
             control mechanisms implemented for use with remote handheld units in RFID for tracking components

             Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: Organizations’ external information systems include those of system
             integrators, suppliers, and external service providers. Unlike in an acquirer’s internal organization where
             direct and continuous monitoring is possible, in the external supplier relationship, information may be
             shared on an as-needed basis and should be articulated in an agreement. Access to the ICT supply chain
             infrastructure from such external information systems should be monitored and audited.

             components, or delivery information. This information sharing should be carefully managed to ensure that
             the information is accessible only to authorized individuals within the organization’s ICT supply chain.
             Organizations should clearly define boundaries for information sharing with respect to temporal,
             informational, contractual, security, access, system, and other requirements. Organizations should monitor
             and review for unintentional or intentional information sharing within its ICT supply chain activities

    FAMILY: AWARENESS AND TRAINING

    [FIPS 200] specifies the Awareness and Training minimum security requirement as follows:

             Organizations must: (i) ensure that managers and users of organizational information systems
             are made aware of the security risks associated with their activities and of the applicable laws,
             Executive Orders, directives, policies, standards, instructions, regulations, or procedures
             related to the security of organizational information systems; and (ii) ensure that
             organizational personnel are adequately trained to carry out their assigned information
             security-related duties and responsibilities.

    NIST SP 800-161 expands the Awareness and Training control of FIPS 200 to include ICT SCRM.
    Making the workforce aware of ICT SCRM concerns is key to a successful ICT SCRM strategy. ICT
    SCRM awareness and training provides understanding of the problem space and of the appropriate
    processes and controls that can help mitigate ICT supply chain risk. Organizations should provide ICT
    SCRM awareness and training to individuals at all levels within the organization including, for example,
    risk executive function, acquisition and contracting professionals, program managers, supply chain and
    logistics professionals, shipping and receiving staff, information technology professionals, quality
    professionals, mission and business owners, system owners, and information security engineers.
    Organizations should also work with system integrators and external service providers to ensure that their
    personnel that interact with an organization’s ICT supply chains receive appropriate ICT SCRM
    awareness and training, as appropriate.


    AT-1     SECURITY AWARENESS AND TRAINING POLICY AND PROCEDURES


             Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: Organizations should integrate ICT supply chain risk management training
             and awareness into the security training and awareness policy. The ICT SCRM training should target both
             the organization and its system integrators. The policy should ensure that ICT supply chain role-based
             training is required for those individuals or functions that touch or impact the ICT supply chain
             infrastructure, such as information system owner, acquisition, supply chain logistics, system engineering,
             program management, IT, quality, and incident response.

             ICT SCRM training procedures should address:
                 a. Roles throughout the supply chain and system/element life cycle to limit opportunities and means
                    available to individuals performing these roles that could result in adverse consequences;
                 b. Requirements for interaction between an organization’s personnel and individuals not employed
                    by the organization that participate in the ICT supply chain throughout the SDLC; and
                 c. Incorporating feedback and lessons learned from ICT SCRM activities into the ICT SCRM

    FAMILY: AUDIT AND ACCOUNTABILITY

    [FIPS 200] specifies the Audit and Accountability minimum security requirement as follows:

             Organizations must: (i) create, protect, and retain information system audit records to the
             extent needed to enable the monitoring, analysis, investigation, and reporting of unlawful,
             unauthorized, or inappropriate information system activity; and (ii) ensure that the actions of
             individual information system users can be uniquely traced to those users so they can be held
             accountable for their actions.

    Audit and accountability controls for ICT SCRM provide information useful in case of an ICT supply
    chain compromise. Organizations should ensure that they designate and audit ICT supply chain-relevant
    events within their information system boundaries using appropriate audit mechanisms (e.g., system logs,
    Intrusion Detection System (IDS) logs, firewall logs, paper reports, forms, clipboard checklists, digital
    records). These audit mechanisms should also be configured to work within reasonable time-frame
    boundaries, as defined by organizational policy. Organizations may encourage their system integrators
    and external service providers to do the same and may include in agreements requirements for such
    monitoring. However, organizations should not deploy audit mechanisms on systems outside of their
    organizational boundary, including those of system integrators and external service providers.
    AU-1     AUDIT AND ACCOUNTABILITY POLICY AND PROCEDURES


             Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: Audit mechanisms provide data for tracking activities in an organization’s
             ICT supply chain infrastructure. Audit and accountability policy and procedures should appropriately
             address such tracking and its availability for other various ICT supply chain activities, such as
             configuration management. System integrator, supplier, and external service provider activities should not
             be included in such policy, unless those are performed within the acquirer’s ICT supply chain

             Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: An observable occurrence within the information system or ICT supply
             chain infrastructure should be identified as an ICT supply chain auditable event, based on the
             organization’s SDLC context and requirements. Auditable events may include software/hardware changes,
             failed attempts to access ICT supply chain infrastructure systems, or movement of source code. Information
             on such events should be captured by appropriate audit mechanisms and should be traceable and verifiable.
             Information captured may include type of event, date/time, length, and frequency of occurrence. Among
             other things, auditing may help detect misuse of the ICT supply chain infrastructure caused by insider

             information security auditable events are appropriately filtered and correlated for analysis and reporting.
             For example, if new maintenance or a patch upgrade is recognized to have an invalid digital signature, the
             identification of the patch arrival qualifies as an ICT supply chain auditable event, while invalid signature
             is an information security auditable event. The combination of these two events may provide information
             valuable to ICT SCRM.

    FAMILY: SECURITY ASSESSMENT AND AUTHORIZATION

    [FIPS 200] specifies the Certification, Accreditation, and Security Assessments minimum security
    requirement as follows:

             Organizations must: (i) periodically assess the security controls in organizational information
             systems to determine if the controls are effective in their application; (ii) develop and
             implement plans of action designed to correct deficiencies and reduce or eliminate
             vulnerabilities in organizational information systems; (iii) authorize the operation of
             organizational information systems and any associated information system connections; and
             (iv) monitor information system security controls on an ongoing basis to ensure the continued
             effectiveness of the controls.

    Organizations should integrate ICT supply chain considerations, including the supply chain risk
    management process and the use of relevant controls defined in this publication, into ongoing security
    assessment and authorization activities. This includes activities to assess and authorize an
    organization’s information systems and ICT supply chain infrastructure, as well as external assessments
    of system integrators and external service providers, where appropriate. ICT supply chain aspects
    include documentation and tracking of chain of custody and system interconnections within and
    between organizations, verification of ICT supply chain security training, verification of suppliers
    claims of conformance to security, product/component integrity, and validation tools and techniques for
    noninvasive approaches to detect counterfeits or malware (e.g., Trojans) using inspection for genuine
    components including manual inspection techniques.

    FAMILY: CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT

    [FIPS 200] specifies the Configuration Management minimum security requirement as follows:

             Organizations must: (i) establish and maintain baseline configurations and inventories of
             organizational information systems (including hardware, software, firmware, and
             documentation) throughout the respective system development life cycles; and (ii) establish and
             enforce security configuration settings for information technology products employed in
             organizational information systems.

    Configuration Management helps track systems, components, and documentation within the ICT supply
    chain infrastructure. This is important for knowing what changes were made to those systems,
    components, and documentation, who made the changes, and who authorized the changes. Basically,
    configuration management provides the tools to establish the chain of custody for systems, components,
    and documentation. Configuration management also provides evidence for ICT supply chain compromise
    investigations when determining which changes were authorized and which were not, which can provide
    useful information. Organizations should apply configuration management controls to their own systems
    and encourage use of configuration management controls by their system integrators, suppliers, and
    external service providers.


    CM-1     CONFIGURATION MANGEMENT POLICY AND PROCEDURES


             Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: Configuration management impacts nearly every aspect of the ICT supply
             chain infrastructure. When defining configuration management policy and procedures, organizations should
             address the full SDLC. This should include procedures for introducing and removing components to and
             from the organization’s information system boundary. Configuration Management policy should consider
             configuration items, data retention for configuration items and corresponding metadata, and tracking of the
             configuration item and its metadata. The organization should coordinate with system integrators and

             and securing the agreement of stakeholders. The baseline configuration must take into consideration the
             organization’s operational environment and any relevant system integrator, supplier, and external service
             provider involvement within the organization’s ICT supply chain infrastructure. If the system integrator, for
             example, uses the existing organization’s infrastructure, appropriate measures should be taken to establish a

    FAMILY: CONTINGENCY PLANNING

    [FIPS 200] specifies the Contingency Planning minimum security requirement as follows:

             Organizations must establish, maintain, and effectively implement plans for emergency
             response, backup operations, and post-disaster recovery for organizational information
             systems to ensure the availability of critical information resources and continuity of operations
             in emergency situations.

    ICT supply chain concerns of contingency planning include planning for alternative suppliers of system
    components, alternative suppliers of systems and services, denial of service attacks to the supply chain,
    and planning for alternate delivery routes for critical system components. Additionally, many techniques
    used for contingency planning, such as alternative processing sites, have their own ICT supply chains
    including their own specific ICT supply chain risks. Organizations should ensure that they understand and
    manage ICT supply chain risks and dependencies related to the contingency planning activities as
    necessary.

             Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: Organizations should define and implement a contingency plan for the
             ICT supply chain infrastructure so that there is no loss of data or operations. Contingencies should be put in
             place for the ICT supply chain infrastructure (including processes) and information systems (especially
             critical components) to ensure protection against compromise and to provide appropriate failover.

    FAMILY: IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION

    [FIPS 200] specifies the Identification and Authentication minimum security requirement as follows:

             Organizations must identify information system users, processes acting on behalf of users, or
             devices and authenticate (or verify) the identities of those users, processes, or devices, as a
             prerequisite to allowing access to organizational information systems.

    NIST SP 800-161, Supply Chain Risk Management Practices for Federal Information Systems and
    Organizations, expands the FIPS 200 identification and authentication control family to include
    identification and authentication of components, in addition to individuals (users) and processes acting on
    behalf of individuals within the ICT supply chain infrastructure. Identification and authentication is
    critical for ICT SCRM because it provides traceability of individuals, processes acting on behalf of
    individuals, and specific systems/components in an organization’s ICT supply chain infrastructure.
    Identification and authentication is required to appropriately manage ICT supply chain risks to both
    reduce risks of ICT supply chain compromise and to help have needed evidence in case of ICT supply
    chain compromise.


    IA-1     IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENCITCATION POLICY AND PROCEDURES


             Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: The organization should enhance their identity and access management
             policies to ensure that critical roles within the ICT supply chain infrastructure are defined and that the
             organization's critical systems, components, and processes are identified for traceability. This should
             include the identity of critical components that may not have been considered under identification and
             authentication in the past. Note that providing identification for all items within the supply chain would be
             cost-prohibitive, and discretion should be used.

    IA-2     IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION (ORGANIZATIONAL USERS)


             Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: Organizations should ensure that identification and authentication is
             defined for organizational users accessing the information system or ICT supply chain infrastructure. An
             organizational user may include employees as well as individuals deemed to have the equivalent status of
             employees (e.g., contractors, guest researchers, etc.) and may include system integrators fulfilling
             contractor roles. Criteria such as “duration in role” can aid in defining which identification and
             authentication mechanisms are used. The organization may choose to define a set of roles and associate a
             level of authorization to ensure proper implementation.

             TIER: 1, 2, 3

    IA-4     IDENTIFIER MANAGEMENT


             Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: Identifiers allow for greater traceability. Within the organization's supply
             chain infrastructure, identifiers should be assigned to systems, individuals, documentation, devices, and
             components. In some cases, identifiers may be maintained throughout a system's life cycle, from concept to
             retirement, but at a minimum throughout the system's life within the organization.

             For software development, identifiers should be assigned for those components that have achieved
             configuration item recognition. For devices and operational systems, identifiers should be assigned when
             the items enter the organization’s ICT supply chain infrastructure, such as when they are transferred to the
             organization’s ownership or control through shipping and receiving or via download.

             System integrators, suppliers, and external service providers typically use their own identifiers for tracking
             within their own ICT supply chain infrastructures. Organizations should correlate those identifiers with the
             organization-assigned identifiers for traceability and accountability. NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 control

             auditing, use, and revocation of identification and authentication of non-organizational users within the ICT
             supply chain infrastructure. Organizations should ensure promptness in performing identification and
             authentication activities, especially in the case of revocation management, to help mitigate against ICT
             supply chain risks such as insider threat.

    FAMILY: INCIDENT RESPONSE

    [FIPS 200] specifies the Incident Response minimum security requirement as follows:

             Organizations must: (i) establish an operational incident handling capability for organizational
             information systems that includes adequate preparation, detection, analysis, containment,
             recovery, and user response activities; and (ii) track, document, and report incidents to
             appropriate organizational officials and/or authorities.

    ICT supply chain compromises may span the acquirer, system integrators, suppliers, and external service
    provider systems and organizations. Organizations should ensure that their incident response controls
    address ICT supply chain concerns including how information about incidents will be shared with system
    integrators, suppliers, and external service integrators. Incident response will help determine whether an
    incident is related to the ICT supply chain.


    IR-1     INCIDENT RESPONSE POLICY AND PROCEDURES


             Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: Organizations should integrate ICT SCRM considerations into incident
             response policy and procedures. ICT supply chain-related incidents and those cybersecurity incidents that
             may complicate or impact ICT supply chain concerns must be defined in the policy. Individuals working
             within specific mission and system environments need to recognize ICT supply chain-related incidents.
             Incident response policy should state when and how incidents should be handled, reported, and managed.

             Additionally, the policy should define when, how, and with whom to communicate (i.e., stakeholders or
             partners) within the broader ICT supply chain in the event of an incident. Bidirectional communication
             with ICT supply chain partners should be defined in agreements with system integrators, suppliers, and
             external service providers to inform all involved parties of an ICT supply chain incident. Incident
             information may also be shared with organizations such as the FBI, US CERT (United States Computer
             Emergency Readiness Team), and the NCCIC (National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration
             Center) as appropriate. Depending on the severity of the incident, the need for accelerated communications
             up and down the supply chain may be necessary. Appropriate agreements should be put in place with
             system integrators, suppliers, and external service providers to ensure speed of communication, response,
             corrective actions, and other related activities.

             In Tiers 2 and 3, procedures and organization-specific incident response methods must be in place, training
             completed (consider including IPSec and any appropriate threat briefing in training), and coordinated
             communication established throughout the ICT supply chain infrastructure to ensure an efficient and
             coordinated incident response effort.

             (10) INCIDENT HANDLING | SUPPLY CHAIN COORDINATION

                   Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: A number of organizations may be involved in managing incidents
                   and responses for supply chain security. After an initial processing of the incident is completed and a
                   decision is made to take action (in some cases, the action may be “no action”), the organization may
                   need to coordinate with their system integrators, suppliers, and external service providers to facilitate
                   communications, incident response, root cause, and corrective actions activities. Organizations should
                   securely share information through a coordinated set of personnel in key roles to allow for a more
                   comprehensive incident handling approach. Selecting system integrators, suppliers, and external
                   service providers with mature capabilities for supporting ICT supply chain incident handling is
                   important for reducing ICT supply chain risk. If transparency for incident handling is limited due to the
                   nature of the relationship, define a set of acceptable criteria in the agreement (e.g., contract). A review
                   (and potential revision) of the agreement is recommended, based on the lessons learned from previous
                   incidents.

    [FIPS 200] specifies the Maintenance minimum security requirement as follows:

             Organizations must: (i) perform periodic and timely maintenance on organizational
             information systems; and (ii) provide effective controls on the tools, techniques, mechanisms,
             and personnel used to conduct information system maintenance.

    Maintenance is frequently performed by an entity that is different from the organization. As such,
    maintenance becomes part of the ICT supply chain. Maintenance includes performing updates and
    replacements. This document can be applied to a maintenance situation including assessing the ICT
    supply chain risks, selecting ICT SCRM controls, implementing these controls, and monitoring them.

    MA-1     SYSTEM MAINTENANCE POLICY AND PROCEDURES


             Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: Organizations should ensure that ICT supply chain concerns are included
             in maintenance policies and procedures for all organizational information systems and the ICT supply chain
             infrastructure. With many maintenance contracts, information on mission, organization, and system-
             specific objectives and requirements is shared between the organization and its system integrators,
             suppliers, or external service providers, allowing for vulnerabilities and opportunities for attack. In many
             cases, the maintenance of systems is outsourced to a system integrator and as such, appropriate measures
             must be taken. Even when maintenance is not outsourced, the upgrades and patches, frequency of
             maintenance, replacement parts, and other aspects of system maintenance are affected by the supply chain.

             Maintenance policies should be defined both for the information system and the ICT supply chain
             infrastructure. The maintenance policy should reflect controls based on a risk assessment (including
             criticality analysis), including controls such as remote access, roles and attributes of maintenance personnel
             that have access, the frequency of updates, duration of contract, logistical path used for updates or
             maintenance, and monitoring and audit mechanisms. The maintenance policy should state which tools are
             explicitly allowed or not allowed. For example, in the case of software maintenance, source code, test
             cases, and other item accessibility to maintain a system or components should be stated in the contract.

             Maintenance policies should be refined and augmented at each tier. At Tier 1, the policy should define
             allowed maintenance activities. At Tier 2, the policy should reflect the mission operation’s needs and
             critical functions. At Tier 3 it should reflect the specific system needs. The requirements in Tier 1, such as
             nonlocal maintenance, should flow to Tiers 2 and 3; for example, when nonlocal maintenance is not
             allowed by Tier 1, it should also not be allowed at Tiers 2 and 3.

    MA-3     MAINTENANCE TOOLS


             Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: Maintenance tools are considered part of the ICT supply chain
             infrastructure. They also have an ICT supply chain of their own. ICT SCRM should be considered when the
             organization acquires or upgrades a maintenance tool (e.g., an update to development environment or
             testing tool), including during the selection, ordering, storage, and integration of the maintenance tool. The
             organization should also consider ICT SCRM when evaluating replacement parts for maintenance tools.
             This control may be performed at both Tiers 2 and 3, depending on how an agency handles the acquisition,
             operations, and oversight of maintenance tools.

             (1)   MAINTENANCE TOOLS | INSPECT TOOLS

                   Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: The organization should deploy acceptance testing to verify that the
                   maintenance tools of the ICT supply chain infrastructure are as expected. Maintenance tools should be
                   authorized with appropriate paperwork, verified as claimed through initial verification, and tested for
                   stated functionality.

             (3)   MAINTENANCE TOOLS | PREVENT UNAUTHORIZED REMOVAL

                   Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: Unauthorized removal of ICT maintenance tools from the ICT supply
                   chain infrastructure may introduce ICT supply chain risk including, for example, unauthorized
                   modification, replacement with counterfeit, or malware insertion while the tool is outside of the
                   organization’s control. ICT maintenance tools can include integrated development environment (IDE),
                   testing, or vulnerability scanning. For ICT SCRM, it is important that organizations should explicitly
                   authorize, track, and audit any removal of maintenance tools. Once ICT tools are allowed access to an
                   organization/information system, they should remain the property/asset of the information system
                   owner and tracked if removed and used elsewhere in the organization. ICT maintenance tools either
                   currently in use or in storage should not be allowed to leave the organization’s premises until they are
                   properly vetted for removal.

                   to ICT components or information systems by a system integrator, supplier, or external service
                   provider, the organization should ensure that:
                         Appropriate measures are taken to verify that the nonlocal environment meets appropriate
                            security levels for maintenance and diagnostics per agreements between the organization and
                            vendor;
                         Appropriate levels of sanitizing are completed to remove any organization-specific data
                            residing in components; and
                         Appropriate diagnostics are completed to ensure that components are sanitized, preventing
                            malicious insertion prior to returning to the organizational information system and or ICT

             TIER: 2, 3

    MA-6     TIMELY MAINTENANCE


             Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: For spare parts, replacement parts, or alternate sources, the organization
             should ensure appropriate lead times to purchase through original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) or
             authorized distributors. If OEMs are not available, it is preferred to acquire from authorized distributors. If
             an OEM or an authorized distributor is not available and the only alternative is to purchase from a non-
             authorized distributor or secondary market, a risk assessment should be performed, including a revisit of
             criticality and threat analysis to identify additional risk mitigations to be used. For example, the
             organization should check the source of supply for history of counterfeits, inappropriate practices, or a
             criminal record. See Chapter 2 for criticality and threat analysis details.

    FAMILY: MEDIA PROTECTION

    [FIPS 200] specifies the Media Protection minimum security requirement as follows:

             Organizations must: (i) protect information system media, both paper and digital; (ii) limit
             access to information on information system media to authorized users; and (iii) sanitize or
             destroy information system media before disposal or release for reuse.

    Media itself can be a component traversing the ICT supply chain or containing information about the
    organization’s ICT supply chain. This includes both physical and logical media including, for example,
    system documentation on paper or in electronic files, shipping and delivery documentation with acquirer
    information, memory sticks with software code, or complete routers or servers that include permanent
    media. The information contained on the media may be sensitive or proprietary information. Additionally,
    the media is used throughout the SDLC, from concept to disposal. Organizations should ensure that the
    Media Protection controls are applied to both an organization’s media and the media received from
    system integrators, suppliers, and external service providers throughout the SDLC.


    MP-1     MEDIA PROTECTION POLICY AND PROCEDURES


             Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: A number of documents and information on a variety of physical and
             electronic media is disseminated throughout the ICT supply chain. This information may contain a variety
             of sensitive information and intellectual property from the acquirer, system integrator, supplier, and
             external service provider and should be appropriately protected. Media protection policies and procedures
             should address ICT supply chain concerns including media in the organization’s ICT supply chain
             infrastructure.

    MP-5     MEDIA TRANSPORT


             Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: The organization should consider ICT supply chain risks when
             transporting media, either by organizational or non-organizational personnel or organizations. Some of the
             techniques to protect media during transport and storage include cryptographic techniques and approved
             custodian services.

    MP-6     MEDIA SANITIZATION


             Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: Media is used throughout the SDLC. Media traversing or residing in the
             ICT supply chain may originate anywhere including from system integrators, suppliers, and external
             service providers. It can be new, refurbished, or reused. Media sanitization is critical to ensure that
             information is removed before the media is used, reused or discarded. NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4, Security
             and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations, control enhancements MP-6 (1),
             (2), (3), (7), and (8) provide mechanisms for performing media sanitization.

    FAMILY: PHYSICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION

    [FIPS 200] specifies the Physical and Environmental Protection minimum security requirement as
    follows:

             Organizations must: (i) limit physical access to information systems, equipment, and the
             respective operating environments to authorized individuals; (ii) protect the physical plant and
             support infrastructure for information systems; iii) provide supporting utilities for information
             systems; (iv) protect information systems against environmental hazards; and (v) provide
             appropriate environmental controls in facilities containing information systems.

    ICT supply chains span the physical and logical world. Physical factors include, for example, weather and
    road conditions that may have an impact to transporting ICT components (or devices) from one location
    to another between system integrators, suppliers, and organizations. If not properly addressed as a part of
    the ICT SCRM risk management processes, physical and environmental risks may have a negative impact
    on the organization’s ability to receive critical components in a timely manner, which may in turn impact
    their ability to perform mission operations. Organizations should integrate physical and environmental
    protection controls into the ICT supply chain infrastructure to mitigate such risks and ensure that there are
    no gaps. It should be noted that the degree of physical and environmental protection required throughout
    the ICT supply chain is greatly dependent on the degree of integration between acquirer and system
    integrator/supplier/external service provider organizations, systems, and processes.


    PE-1     PHYSICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION POLICY AND PROCEDURES


             Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: The organization should integrate ICT supply chain risks into physical and
             environmental protection policy and procedures. The degree of such protection required throughout the ICT
             supply chain is greatly dependent on the degree of integration between the organization and its system
             integrator, supplier, and external service provider systems and processes. The physical and environmental
             protection policy should ensure that the physical interfaces of the ICT supply chain infrastructure have
             adequate protection and audit for such protection.

             TIER: 1, 2, 3

    PE-3     PHYSICAL ACCESS CONTROL


             Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: Physical access control should include individuals and organizations
             engaged in the organization’s ICT supply chain. A vetting process should be in place based on
             organizational-defined requirements and policy prior to granting access to the ICT supply chain
             infrastructure and any relevant elements. Access establishment, maintenance, and revocation processes
             should meet organizational access control policy rigor. The speed of revocation for system integrators,
             external services providers, and suppliers needing access to physical facilities should be managed in
             accordance with the activities performed in their contracts. Prompt revocation is critical when either
             individual or organizational need no longer exists.

                   hardware. The organization should implement validated tamper protections techniques within the
                   supply chain infrastructure. The organization should also verify tamper protection mechanisms
                   provided by integrators, suppliers, and external service providers.

    PE-18    LOCATION OF INFORMATION SYSTEM COMPONENTS


             Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: Physical and environmental hazards have an impact on the availability of
             systems and components that are or will be acquired and physically transported to the organization’s
             locations. For example, organizations should consider the location of information system components
             critical for agency operations when planning for alternative suppliers for these components. See CP-6 and

                  a.   Diverting system or component for counterfeit replacement;
                  b.   Loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability of system or component function and data
                       (including data contained within the component and data about the component); and
                  c.   Interrupting supply chain and logistics processes for critical components.

             Asset location technologies also help gather data that can be used later for incident management.

    FAMILY: PLANNING

    [FIPS 200] specifies the Planning minimum security requirement as follows:

             Organizations must develop, document, periodically update, and implement security plans for
             organizational information systems that describe the security controls in place or planned for
             the information systems and the rules of behavior for individuals accessing the information
             systems.

    ICT SCRM concerns should influence security planning, including such activities as security architecture,
    coordination with other organizational entities, and development of System Security Plans. When
    acquiring ICT products and services from system integrators, suppliers, and external service providers,
    organizations may be sharing facilities with those organizations, having employees of these entities on the
    organization’s premises, or use information systems that belong to those entities. In these and other
    applicable situations, organizations should coordinate their security planning activities with these entities
    to ensure appropriate protection of an organization’s ICT supply chain infrastructure, as well as of the
    information systems and components traversing the ICT supply chain. When establishing security
    architectures, organizations should provide for component and supplier diversity to manage the ICT
    supply chain-related risks of suppliers going out of business or stopping the production of specific
    components. Finally, as stated in Chapter 2, organizations may integrate ICT SCRM controls into System
    Security Plans for individual systems.


    PL-1     SECURITY PLANNING POLICY AND PROCEDURES


             Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: Security planning policy and procedures should include ICT supply chain
             risk management considerations. This includes security policy, operational policy, and procedures for ICT
             supply chain risk management to shape the requirements and the follow-on implementation of operational
             systems.

             TIER: 1

    PL-2     SYSTEM SECURITY PLAN


             Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: The system security plan should include ICT supply chain considerations.
             The organization may choose to develop a stand-alone ICT SCRM plan for an individual system. The
             system security plan and/or system-level ICT SCRM plan provide inputs into the ICT SCRM plan(s) at
             Tier 1 and Tier 2 (Chapter 2 provides guidance on the ICT SCRM plan.). Controls in this publication
             (NIST SP 800-161) should be used for the ICT SCRM portion of the system security plan.

                   Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: In addition to coordinating within the organization, the organization
                   should coordinate with system integrators, suppliers, and external service providers. For example,
                   building and operating a system requires a significant amount of coordination and collaboration
                   between the organization and system integrator personnel. Such coordination and collaboration should
                   be addressed in the system security plan. The system security plans should also take into account that
                   suppliers or external service providers may not be able to customize to the acquirer’s requirements.

             Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: Information security architecture defines and directs implementation of
             security methods, mechanisms, and capabilities to both the ICT supply chain infrastructure and the
             information system. The organization should ensure that the information security architecture is well
             understood by system engineers and system security engineers.

             (2)   INFORMATION SECURITY ARCHITECTURE | SUPPLIER DIVERSITY

                   Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: Supplier diversity provides options for addressing information
                   security and ICT supply chain concerns. The organization should consider this control as it relates to
                   system integrators, suppliers, and external service providers.

                   The organization should plan for potential replacement of system integrators, supplier or external
                   service providers in case one is no longer able to meet the organization’s requirements (e.g., company
                   goes out of business or does not meet contractual obligations).

                   Consider supplier diversity for off-the-shelf (commercial or government) components during
                   acquisition security assessments. Evaluation of alternatives should include, for example, feature parity,
                   standards interfaces, commodity components, and ability to provide multiple delivery paths.

    FAMILY: PROGRAM MANAGEMENT

    FIPS 200 does not specify Program Management minimum security requirements.

    [NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 4] states that “the information security program management controls … are
    typically implemented at the organization level and not directed at individual organizational information
    systems.” Those controls apply to the entire organization (i.e., federal agency) and support the
    organization’s overarching information security program. Program management controls support and
    provide inputs and feedback to organization-wide ICT SCRM activities.
    PM-1     INFORMATION SECURITY PROGRAM PLAN


             Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: As part of information security program planning, the organization should
             document common ICT SCRM controls. A separate ICT SCRM plan may be developed to document ICT
             SCRM controls that address organization, program, and system-specific needs. The information security
             program plan and the associated common controls addressing Tiers 1 and 2 can provide additional
             foundational practices to support the ICT SCRM plan. For Tier 3, use the existing system security plan to
             incorporate ICT SCRM controls or develop a separate ICT SCRM plan. In Tier 3, ensure that the full
             SDLC is covered from the ICT supply chain perspective.

    PM-2     SENIOR INFORMATION SECURITY OFFICER


             Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: Senior information security officer responsibilities should include ICT

    PM-3     INFORMATION SECURITY RESOURCES


             Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: The organization should ensure that ICT supply chain requirements are
             integrated into major IT investments to ensure that the funding is appropriately allocated through the capital
             planning and investment request process. For example, should RFID infrastructure be required to improve
             ICT SCRM for the ICT supply chain infrastructure and to ensure efficiency, appropriate IT investments are
             likely required to ensure successful planning and implementation to meet such needs. Other examples
             include any investment into the development or test environment in which critical components are
             developed and tested. In such a case, funding and resources are needed to ensure acquisition and
             maintenance of ICT supply chain infrastructure components that assure critical components meet their ICT
             SCRM requirements to support the organization mission.

    PM-11    MISSION/BUSINESS PROCESS DEFINITION


             Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: When addressing mission/business process definitions, the organization
             should ensure that ICT supply chain activities are incorporated into the support processes for achieving the
             mission success. For example, a system supporting a critical mission function that has been designed and
             implemented for easy removal and replacement should a component fail may require the use of somewhat
             unreliable hardware components. An ICT supply chain activity may need to be defined to ensure that the
             supplier makes component spare parts readily available if replacement is needed.

    FAMILY: PERSONNEL SECURITY


    [FIPS 200] specifies the Personnel Security minimum security requirement as follows:

             Organizations must: (i) ensure that individuals occupying positions of responsibility within
             organizations (including third-party service providers) are trustworthy and meet established
             security criteria for those positions; (ii) ensure that organizational information and information
             systems are protected during and after personnel actions such as terminations and transfers;
             and (iii) employ formal sanctions for personnel failing to comply with organizational security
             policies and procedures.

    Personnel that have access to an organization’s ICT supply chain infrastructure should be covered by the
    organization’s personnel security controls. These personnel include acquisition and contracting
    professionals, program managers, supply chain and logistics professionals, shipping and receiving staff,
    information technology professionals, quality professionals, mission and business owners, system owners,
    and information security engineers. Organizations should also work with system integrators and external
    service providers to ensure that they apply appropriate personnel security controls to their personnel that
    interact with the organization’s ICT supply chain, as appropriate.


    PS-1     PERSONNEL SECURITY POLICY AND PROCEDURES


             Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: At each tier, personnel security policy and procedures need to define the
             roles for the acquirer personnel who manage and execute ICT supply chain infrastructure security activities.
             These roles also need to state acquirer personnel responsibilities with regards to relationships with system
             integrators, suppliers, and external service providers. Policies and procedures need to consider the full
             system development life cycle of systems and the roles and responsibilities needed to address the various
             supply chain infrastructure activities.

             Tier 1: Applicable roles include risk executive, CIO, CISO, contracting, logistics, delivery/receiving,
             acquisition security, and other functions providing supporting ICT supply chain activities.

             Tier 2: Applicable roles include program executive and individuals within the acquirer organization
             responsible for program success (e.g., Program Manager and other individuals).

             Tier 3: Applicable roles include system engineers or system security engineers throughout the operational
             system life cycle from requirements definition, development, test, deployment, maintenance, updates,
             replacements, delivery/receiving, and IT.

             NOTE: Roles for system integrator, supplier, and external service provider personnel responsible for the
             success of the program should be noted in an agreement between acquirer and these parties (e.g., contract).

    PS-6     ACCESS AGREEMENTS


             Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: The organization should define and document access agreements for
             system integrators, external service providers, and suppliers. Access agreements should state the
             appropriate level of access by system integrators, external providers, and suppliers to the information
             system and ICT supply chain infrastructure. Additionally, terms of access should be consistent with the
             organization’s information security policy. The organization should deploy audit mechanisms to review,

             monitor, update, and track access by these parties in accordance with the access agreement. As personnel
             vary over time, the organization should implement a timely and rigorous personnel security update process
             for the access agreements.

             When ICT products and services are provided by an entity within the organization, there may be an existing
             access agreement in place. When such an agreement does not exist, it should be established.

             NOTE: While the audit mechanisms may be implemented in Tier 3, the agreement process with required
             updates should be implemented at Tier 2 as a part of program management activities.

    FAMILY: PROVENANCE

    Provenance is a new control family, developed specifically to address ICT supply chain concerns.

    All systems and components originate somewhere and may be changed throughout their existence. The
    recording of system and component origin along with the history of, the changes to, and the recording of
    who made the changes is called “provenance.” Acquirers and their system integrators should maintain the
    provenance of systems and components under their control to understand where the systems and
    components originated, their change history while under government control, and who might have had an
    opportunity to change them. Provenance allows for changes from the baselines of systems and
    components to be reported to specific stakeholders. Creating and maintaining provenance within the ICT
    supply chain helps government agencies to achieve greater traceability in case of an adverse event and is
    critical for understanding and mitigating risks.

    COTS suppliers (e.g., OEMs or authorized distributors) and external service providers may use
    provenance to demonstrate that the source of goods (e.g., computer hardware or software) are genuine and
    not counterfeit.

    Provenance is a new control and is likely to require additional resources to implement. Although some
    suppliers may collect and preserve certain aspects of component provenance for their solutions, they may
    not be able to share such data due to varying sensitivities. Criteria for collecting and preserving
    component provenance may be determined based on how critical the component may be and the reason
    for keeping provenance, such as intellectual property.

    Provenance is a control that requires careful consideration for the level of rigor and implementation.
    Agencies should assess the need for better understanding the level of effort that may be required for the
    acquirers’ ICT supply chain to provide this data because the cost/resource may likely be reflected in the
    cost to the acquirer. Factors driving up cost include the collection, documentation, and storage for such
    data, which may require additional protection if there are intellectual or security properties to protect.
    Continued conversations and strengthened relationships between the acquirer and its supply chain (e.g.,
    integrators, suppliers, and external service providers) can help to enable a conversation for scoping the
    need and the supply chain assurance the data may be able to provide the organization.

    The organization should keep in mind that some suppliers have comprehensive provenance practices and
    systems that may go above and beyond the organization’s requirements. The organizations should work
    with suppliers to understand the extent of their provenance practices and how they meet the organization's
    needs.
    PV-1     PROVENANCE POLICY AND PROCEDURES


             Control: The organization:
                  a.   Develops, documents, and disseminates the provenance policy and procedures for [Assignment:

             Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: Provenance policy can be included in the overall information security
             policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by multiple program security policies reflecting
             the complex nature of organizations. The procedures can be established for the security program in general

             support managing the information and documentation describing systems/components within information
             systems or the ICT supply chain infrastructure.

             The provenance policy should stipulate that information related to the tracking of the metadata (analytics)
             associated with provenance of tools, data, and processes should be collected, processed, stored, and
             disseminated in a controlled and protected manner equal to or greater than that of the individual items for
             which provenance is maintained. It should include:

             a.    Procedures for proposing, evaluating, and justifying relevant changes to system/component provenance
                   for their impact on components, processes, systems, missions, and exposure to supply chain risks;
             b.    Allocation of responsibilities for the creation, maintenance, and monitoring of provenance are

                        supply chain;
                   b.   Develops methods to document, monitor, and maintain valid provenance baselines for systems and
                        components of the information system or component and the ICT supply chain infrastructure;
                   c.   Tracks, documents, and disseminates to relevant supply ICT chain participants changes to the
                        provenance;
                   d.   Tracks individuals and processes that have access and make changes to the provenance of
                        components, tools, data, and processes in the information system or the ICT supply chain
                        infrastructure; and

                        when, what, and to whom.

             Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: Tracking of provenance helps to detect unauthorized tampering and
             modification throughout the ICT supply chain, especially during repairs/refurbishing, for example, by
             comparing the updated provenance with the original baseline provenance. Tracking of provenance
             baselines should be performed through using configuration management mechanisms. Organizations should
             ensure the timely collection of provenance and change information to provide as near real-time traceability
             as possible.

             Examples include documenting, monitoring, and maintaining valid baselines for spare parts, development
             changes, and warehoused items throughout the SDLC.

    FAMILY: RISK ASSESSMENT

    [FIPS 200] specifies the Risk Assessment minimum security requirement as follows:

             Organizations must periodically assess the risk to organizational operations (including
             mission, functions, image, or reputation), organizational assets, and individuals, resulting from
             the operating of organizational information systems and the associated processing, storage, or
             transmission of organizational information.

    NIST SP 800-161 provides guidance for managing an organization’s ICT supply chain risks and
    expands this control to integrate ICT supply chain risk assessment activities, as described in Chapter 2.
    RA-1     RISK ASSESSMENT POLICY AND PROCEDURES


             Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: Risk assessments should be performed at the organization,
             mission/program, and system levels of the organization. The system-level risk assessment should include
             both the ICT supply chain infrastructure (e.g., development and testing environments, and delivery
             systems) and the information system/components traversing the ICT supply chain. A criticality analysis
             will ensure that mission-critical functions and components are given higher priority due to their impact to
             the mission, if compromised. The policy should include ICT supply chain-relevant roles applicable to
             performing and coordinating risk assessments across the organization (see Chapter 2 for the listing and
             description of roles). Applicable roles within acquirer, system integrator, external service providers, and
             supplier organizations should be defined.

    RA-2     SECURITY CATEGORIZATION


             Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: Security categorization is critical to ICT SCRM at Tiers 1, 2, and 3. In
             addition to FIPS 199 categorization, for ICT SCRM, security categorization should be based on the
             criticality analysis. See Chapter 2 and SA-15[3] for a detailed description of criticality analysis.

             TIER: 1, 2, 3

    RA-3     RISK ASSESSMENT


             Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: Risk assessments should include consideration of criticality, threats,
             vulnerabilities, likelihood, and impact, as described in detail in Chapter 2, Integration of ICT SCRM into
             Risk Management. Data to be reviewed and collected includes ICT SCRM-specific roles, processes, and
             results of system/component implementation and acceptance. Risk assessments should be performed at
             Tiers 1, 2, and 3. Risk assessments at Tier 1 should be primarily a synthesis of various risk assessments
             performed at Tiers 2 and 3 and used for understanding the overall organizational impact.

    FAMILY: SYSTEM AND SERVICES ACQUISITION

    [FIPS 200] specifies the System and Services Acquisition minimum security requirement as follows:

             Organizations must: (i) allocate sufficient resources to adequately protect organizational
             information systems; (ii) employ system development life cycle processes that incorporate
             information security considerations; (iii) employ software usage and installation restrictions;
             and (iv) ensure that third-party providers employ adequate security measures to protect
             information, applications, and/or services outsourced from the organization.

    System and services acquisition is how organizations acquire ICT products and services. These controls
    address an acquirer’s activities, as well as the system integrator, supplier, and external service provider
    activities. They address both physical and logical aspects of ICT supply chain security, from tamper
    resistance and detection to SDLC and security engineering principles. ICT supply chain concerns are
    already prominently addressed in [NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 4]. NIST SP 800-161 adds further detail and
    refinement to these controls.

    SA-1     SYSTEM AND SERVICES ACQUISITION POLICY AND PROCEDURES


             Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: The system and services acquisition policy should address changes of
             ownership or control, and any requirements to be communicated to system integrators, suppliers, and
             external service providers. ICT supply chains evolve continuously through mergers and acquisitions, joint
             ventures, and other partnership agreements. The policy should help organizations to understand these
             changes and use this information within their ICT SCRM activities. Organizations can obtain such status
             through, for example, monitoring public announcements about company activities or any communications
             initiated by a system integrator, supplier, or external service provider.

             TIER: 1, 2, 3

    SA-2     ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES


             Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: The organization should consider ICT supply chain requirements in the
             allocation of resources.

             TIER: 1, 2

    SA-3     SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE


             Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: There is a strong relationship between the SDLC activities and ICT supply
             chain activities. The organization should ensure that ICT supply chain security considerations are
             integrated into the SDLC for information systems and the ICT supply chain infrastructure. In addition to
             traditional SDLC activities, such as requirements and design, less traditional activities also should be
             considered in the SDLC, such as inventory management, acquisition and procurement, and logical delivery
             of systems and components. See Chapter 2.

             TIER: 1, 2, 3

    SA-4     ACQUISITION PROCESS


             Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: To integrate ICT SCRM into the organization’s acquisition process, the
             organization should ensure that the following acquisition-related requirements, descriptions, and criteria are
             addressed in agreements. NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 control enhancements SA-4 (1), (2), (3), (6) and (7)
             provide further acquisition process mechanisms.

    ________________________________________________________________________________________________________


                   a. Establish baseline and tailor-able ICT supply chain security requirements to apply to system
                      integrators, suppliers, and external service providers;
                   b. Define requirements that cover regulatory requirements (i.e., telecommunications or IT), technical
                      requirements, chain of custody, transparency and visibility, sharing information on information
                      and supply chain security incidents throughout the supply chain, rules for disposal or retention of
                      elements such as components, data, or intellectual property, and other relevant requirements;
                   c. Define requirements for critical elements in the ICT supply chain to demonstrate a capability to
                      remediate emerging vulnerabilities based on open source information and other sources;
                   d. Identify requirements for managing intellectual property ownership and responsibilities for
                      elements such as software code, data and information, the manufacturing/development/integration
                      environment, designs, and proprietary processes when provided to the organization for review or
                      use;
                   e. Define requirements for the expected life span of the system and which element may be in a
                      critical path based on their life span. Establish a plan for any migration that can be required in
                      support of continued system and mission operations and ensure that the system integrator,
                      supplier, or external service provider can provide insights into their plans for the end-of-life of
                      components. Establish a plan for acquisition of spare parts to ensure adequate supply;
                   f. Work with the supplier, system integrator, or external service provider to identify and define
                      existing and acceptable incident response and information sharing processes, including inputs on
                      vulnerabilities from other organizations within their supply chains;
                   g. Define requirements for functional properties and implementation information, as well as any
                      development methods, techniques, or practices which may be relevant;
                   h. Establish and maintain verification procedures and criteria for delivered products and services;
                   i. Ensure that the continuous monitoring plan includes supply chain aspects in its criteria. Include
                      the monitoring of functions/ports/protocols in use. See Chapter 2;
                   j. Monitor system integrators’ and external service providers’ information systems located within the
                      supply chain infrastructure. Monitor and evaluate the acquired work processes and work products
                      where applicable;
                   k. Report information security weaknesses and vulnerabilities detected during the use of ICT
                      products or services to appropriate stakeholders, including OEMs where relevant;
                   l. Review and confirm that the delivered product or service complies with the agreement on an
                      ongoing basis; and
                   m. Articulate any circumstances when secondary market components may be permitted.

    SA-8     SECURITY ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES


             Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: The following security engineering techniques are helpful in managing
             ICT supply chain risks:

                   a.   Anticipate the maximum possible ways that the ICT product or service can be misused and abused
                        in order to help identify how to protect the product or system from such uses. Address intended
                        and unintended use scenarios in architecture and design;
                   b.   Design information systems and components based on the organization’s risk tolerance as
                        determined by risk assessments (see Chapter 2);
                   c.   Document and gain management acceptance and approval for risks that are not fully mitigated;
                   d.   Limit the number, size, and privilege levels of critical elements; using criticality analysis will aid
                        in determining which elements or functions are critical. See criticality analysis in Chapter 2;
                   e.   Use security mechanisms that help to reduce opportunities to exploit ICT supply chain
                        vulnerabilities, including, for example, encryption, access control, identity management, and
                        malware or tampering discovery;
                   f.   Design information system components and elements to be difficult to disable (e.g., tamper-
                        proofing techniques) and, if disabled, trigger notification methods such as audit trails, tamper
                        evidence, or alarms;
                   g.   Design delivery mechanisms (e.g., downloads for software) to avoid unnecessary exposure or
                        access to the ICT supply chain infrastructure and the information systems/components traversing
                        ICT supply chain during delivery; and
                   h.   Design relevant validation mechanisms to be used during implementation and operation.

    SA-11    DEVELOPER SECURITY TESTING AND EVALUATION


             Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: Depending on the origins of components, this control may be implemented
             differently. For OTS (off-the-shelf) components, the acquirer should request proof that the supplier (OEM)
             has performed such testing as part of their quality/security processes. When the acquirer has control over
             the application and the development processes, they should require this testing as part of the SDLC. In
             addition to the specific types of testing activities described in the enhancements, examples of ICT SCRM-
             relevant testing include: testing for counterfeits, verifying the origins of components, examining
             configuration settings prior to integration, and testing interfaces. These types of tests may require
             significant resources and should be prioritized based on criticality, threat and vulnerability analyses
             (described in Chapter 2), and the effectiveness of testing techniques. Organizations may also require third-
             party testing as part of developer security testing. NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 control enhancements SA-11

                   program to analyze system integrator, supplier, and external services provider activities where
                   relevant. Usually, an agreement is reached between the organization and system integrators, suppliers,
                   and/or external services providers that guides the level of traceability and visibility achievable.
                   Organizations should be cautious in scoping the review program, as there are costs associated with data
                   collection and keeping, managing, and analyzing the data for relevance once obtained. See NIST 800-
                   53 Revision 4, SA-12(2) for more detail.

             (5)   SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | LIMITATION OF HARM

                   Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: A number of supply chain activities may be used to limit exposure of
                   operational and supply chain data that may be used by adversaries against the organization. Some
                   examples include avoiding purchasing custom configurations or ensuring that a diverse set of suppliers
                   is used to reduce the possibility of single point of failure or threat. See NIST 800-53 Revision 4, SA-
                   12(3) for more detail.

             (7)   SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | ASSESSMENTS PRIOR TO SELECTION / ACCEPTANCE / UPDATE

                   Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: The organization may use multiple methods of assessment prior to
                   selecting supply chain components used in the organization’s information system or ICT supply chain
                   infrastructure. The selection of assessment method depends on the level of depth and breadth required
                   for component selection. The organization should ensure that a balance of requirements and budgets
                   are used so that adequate assessment measures are defined and implemented. See NIST 800-53
                   Revision 4, SA-12(7) for more detail on the types of assessments available for use prior to selection.
                   Also, the organization may leverage existing federal mechanisms, (e.g., Defense Microelectronics
                   Activity (DMEA) accreditation for Trusted Suppliers).

                   Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: Ensure that all-source threat and vulnerability information includes
                   any available foreign ownership and control (FOCI) data. Review this data periodically as mergers and
                   acquisitions, if affecting a supplier, may impact both threat and vulnerability information and therefore
                   SCRM.

                   Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: The organization should ensure that the ICT supply chain
                   infrastructure and information system are scoped as part of organizational operations security (OPSEC)
                   requirements. Criticality, threat, and vulnerability analyses can provide inputs into OPSEC
                   requirements to ensure that supply chain aspects are included for implementing requirements. See
                   Chapter 2 regarding criticality analysis, threat analysis, and vulnerability analysis as well as NIST 800-
                   53 Revision 4, SA-12(9) for more detail.

                   Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: An example of a validation procedure may be the use of digital
                   signature by an OEM to prove that the software delivered is from its originating source. When digital
                   signatures are used for this purpose, the organization should ensure, when receiving such software, that
                   the signed upgrade/download was not altered.

             (12) SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | INTER-ORGANIZATIONAL AGREEMENTS

                   Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: Inter-organizational agreements with system integrators, suppliers,
                   and external service providers should ensure that appropriate communications are established. The
                   organization should leverage the criticality analysis to identify when such agreements are necessary.
                   The communications should allow for early notifications of various supply chain-related events.
                   Events can include:

                       a.   Compromises (both information system and supply chain);
                       b.   Changes or updates to roadmaps, new component development, updates to components, end-
                            of-life decisions;
                       c.   The addition, replacement, and removal of system integrator personnel supporting
                            organizational information system and supply chain infrastructure efforts; and
                       d.   Infrastructure changes within external service providers such as any new operating system
                            rollout, hardware upgrades, or replacements due to field failures, or data store architecture
                            shifts.

             (13) SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | CRITICAL INFORMATION SYSTEM COMPONENTS

                   Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: The organization should define critical information system
                   components to protect the ICT supply chain infrastructure and the information system (see Chapter 2,
                   Criticality Analysis). A number of supply chain mitigations can be put in place including multisource
                   supply, stockpiling of spare components for critical component end of life as a short-term fix prior to
                   redesign, etc. Critical information system and ICT supply chain infrastructure components should be
                   reassessed periodically to integrate the changes that may occur during the SDLC.

                  participating in its ICT supply chain infrastructure and managing its information system are adequately
                  identified and monitored. Identifying and monitoring may need to be scoped to critical activities, thus
                  helping to scope both cost and resources. Identification of components should include inventorying any
                  open source software (OSS) components to ensure full traceability and to ensure a cross-reference and
                  match to known trusted repositories.

                  Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: Organizations should ensure that as they collect a variety of evidence
                  resulting from information system ICT supply chain infrastructure assessment, this evidence is
                  documented and integrated into the risk management process to provide inputs to criticality, threat, and
                  vulnerability analyses. This feedback provides input for ensuring that ICT supply chain protections
                  keep pace with the changes to the ICT supply chain.

    SA-13    TRUSTWORTHINESS

             SA-13


             Supplemental Guidance: The organization should ensure that both the information system and the ICT supply
             chain infrastructure are designed, developed, and implemented with an explicit definition of
             trustworthiness. With the use of system integrators, suppliers, and external service providers, defining the
             requirements to support confidentiality, integrity, and availability of supply chain information is all the
             more important for ICT SCRM. These ICT SCRM requirements must include a clear definition of supply
             chain disruptions, human errors, purposeful attacks, and other risks. Processes and procedures must be
             defined as part of the requirements activities to ensure that not only components of the ICT supply chain
             infrastructure and the information system are predictably behaving, but that the processes and procedures
             also support the requirements for trustworthiness. Examples of areas of concern include:

                      The exchange of components from one supplier to another due to a lack of availability;
                      Movement of developers and testers in an SDLC from one program to another due to the system
                       integrator’s internal needs; and
                      The change of processing and storage platforms in an approved external service provider’s hosting
                       environment.

             Maintaining trustworthiness is an ongoing process and can be a potentially resource-consuming effort. The
             organization should understand where best to apply this control as driven by the prioritization results of a
             criticality analysis (see SA-14 and Chapter 2).

    SA-14    CRITICALITY ANALYSIS


             Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: For systems in the architectural design process step, perform component-
             level security categorization to support the system-level criticality analysis. This will ensure the
             confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the system and the mission it supports. See Chapter 2, Criticality
             Analysis.

             Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: The organization should ensure that the ICT supply chain infrastructure
             (development process, standards, tools, etc.) is appropriately identified, analyzed for criticality, and
             appropriately protected from ICT supply chain risks. The organization’s development/maintenance, test,
             and deployment environments should all be considered in regards to this control. The tools included in this
             control can be manual or automated. Use of automated tools aids thoroughness, efficiency, and scale of
             analysis that helps address ICT supply chain risks in the development process. Additionally, the output of
             such activities and tools provides useful inputs for ICT SCRM processes described in Chapter 2. This

    SA-19    COMPONENT AUTHENTICITY



             Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: Organizations should include in their
             anti-counterfeit policy and procedures, a means to help ensure that the components acquired and used are
             authentic and have not been subject to tampering. In many circumstances, the most effective method to
             help ensure authenticity is to acquire needed components only from OEMs, their authorized resellers, or
             other trusted sources. However, limiting eligibility to these sources for all acquisitions may not be
             compatible with market availability, organizational needs, acquisition rules, socioeconomic procurement
             preferences, or principles of open competition. If an organization chooses other sources, it should obtain
             assurances of the provider’s ability to verify, through documentation or other means, the integrity, security,
             and quality of the components being acquired. Such assurances are especially important when acquiring
             obsolete, refurbished, or otherwise out-of-production components. If such assurances are not obtainable,
             organizations should create a risk response plan to address any additional risks to organizational missions
             or business operations.

    FAMILY: SYSTEM AND COMMUNICATIONS PROTECTION

    [FIPS 200] specifies the System and Communications Protection minimum security requirement as
    follows:

             Organizations must: (i) monitor, control, and protect organizational communications (i.e.,
             information transmitted or received by organizational information systems) at the external
             boundaries and key internal boundaries of the information systems; and (ii) employ
             architectural designs, software development techniques, and systems engineering principles
             that promote effective information security within organizational information systems.

    An organization’s communications infrastructure is composed of ICT components and systems, which
    have their own ICT supply chains and also support an organization’s ICT supply chain infrastructure.
    These communications connect an organization’s systems with system integrator and occasionally
    supplier systems. An organization’s communications may be provided by system integrators or external
    service providers.

    SC-1     SYSTEM AND COMMUNICATIONS PROTECTION POLICY AND PROCEDURES


             Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: System and communications protection policies and procedures should
             address ICT supply chain infrastructure security. Organization-level and program-specific policies help to
             set the requirements of communication and how the infrastructure is established to meet these
             requirements. Policies and procedures should include the coordination of communications among and
             across multiple organizational entities within the organization as well as communications methods and
             infrastructure used between the organization and its system integrators, suppliers, and external service
             providers.

    SC-4     INFORMATION IN SHARED RESOURCES


             Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: The organization may share information system resources with system
             integrators or external service providers. Protecting information in shared resources in support of various
             supply chain activities is challenging when outsourcing key operations. Organizations may either share too
             much, increasing their risk, or share too little, making it difficult for the system integrator or external
             service provider to be efficient in their service delivery. The organization should work with developers to
             define a structure/process of information sharing including the data shared, method of sharing, and to
             whom (the specific roles) it is provided. Appropriate privacy and clearance requirements should be
             considered in the information sharing process.

    SC-7     BOUNDARY PROTECTION


             Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: The organization should implement appropriate monitoring mechanisms
             and processes at the boundaries between the agency systems and system integrator, supplier, and external
             services provider systems. Provisions for boundary protections should be incorporated into agreements with
             system integrators, suppliers, and external service providers. There may be multiple interfaces throughout
             the ICT supply chain infrastructure and the SDLC. Appropriate vulnerability, threat, and risk assessments
             should be performed to ensure proper boundary protections for both supply chain components as well as
             supply chain information flow. The vulnerability, threat, and risk assessment can aid in scoping boundary
             protection to a relevant set of criteria and help manage associated costs. Further detail is provided in

             integrated into agreements with system integrators, suppliers, and external service providers. Acquirers,
             system integrators, suppliers, and external service providers may repurpose existing security mechanisms
             (e.g., authentication, authorization, or encryption) to achieve organizational confidentiality and integrity
             requirements. The degree of protection should be based on the sensitivity of information to be transmitted
             and the relationship between the organization and the system integrator, supplier, or external service

             techniques in the acquisition, development, and use of mobile code to be deployed in the information
             system. Examples include ensuring that mobile code originates from vetted sources when acquired, that
             vetted system integrators are used for the development of custom mobile code or prior to installing, and
             that verification processes are in place for acceptance criteria prior to install in order to verify the source
             and integrity of code. Note that mobile code can be both code for ICT supply chain infrastructure

             the organization should also ensure that they provide appropriate protections within the ICT supply chain
             infrastructure for data at rest for the system integrator, supplier, and external service provider information,
             such as source code, testing data, blueprints, and intellectual property information. This control should be

             virtualization techniques, and multiple sources of supply. Multiple sources of supply can improve
             component availability and reduce the impact of an ICT supply chain compromise. In case of an ICT
             supply chain compromise, an alternative source of supply will allow the organizations to quickly switch to
             an alternative system/component which may not be affected by the compromise. Also, heterogeneous
             components decrease the attack surface by limiting the impact to the subset of the infrastructure that is

                   For example, delivery of critical components to a central or trusted third-party depot can be used to
                   conceal or misdirect any information regarding the component use or the organization using the
                   component. Separating components from their associated information into differing physical and
                   electronic delivery channels and obfuscating the information through various techniques can be used to
                   conceal information and reduce the opportunity for potential loss of confidentiality of the component

    FAMILY: SYSTEM AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY

    [FIPS 200] specifies the System and Information Integrity minimum security requirement as follows:

             Organizations must: (i) identify, report, and correct information and information system flaws
             in a timely manner; (ii) provide protection from malicious code at appropriate locations within
             organizational information systems; and (iii) monitor information system security alerts and
             advisories and take appropriate actions in response.

    System and information integrity for systems and components traversing the ICT supply chain
    infrastructure is critical for managing ICT supply chain risks. Insertion of malicious code and counterfeits
    are two primary examples of ICT supply chain risks, both of which can be at least partially addressed by
    deploying system and information integrity controls. Organizations should ensure that adequate system
    and information integrity protections are considered as part of ICT supply chain risk management.

    SI-1     SYSTEM AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY POLICY AND PROCEDURES


             Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: The organization should include ICT SCRM considerations in system and
             information integrity policy and procedures, including ensuring that program-specific requirements for
             employing various integrity verification tools and techniques are clearly defined. System and information
             integrity for information systems and components and the ICT supply chain infrastructure is critical for
             managing ICT supply chain risks. Insertion of malicious code and counterfeits are two primary examples of
             ICT supply chain risks, both of which can be at least partially addressed by deploying system and
             information integrity controls.

             (5)   FLAW REMEDIATION | AUTOMATIC SOFTWARE / FIRMWARE UPDATES

                   Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: The organization should specify the various software assets within its
                   infrastructure that require automated updates (both indirect and direct). This specification of assets
                   should be defined from criticality analysis results, which provide information on critical and
                   noncritical functions and components (see Chapter 2). A centralized patch management process may
                   be employed to provide a buffer for evaluating and managing updates prior to deployment. Those
                   software assets that require direct updates from a supplier should only accept updates originating
                   directly from the OEM unless specifically deployed by the acquirer, such as with a centralized patch
                   management process.

    SI-4     INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING


             Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: This control includes monitoring of vulnerabilities resulting from past ICT
             supply chain compromises, such as malicious code implanted during software development and set to
             activate after deployment. Information system monitoring is frequently performed by external service

                  Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: Information system monitoring information may be correlated with
                  that of system integrators, suppliers, and external service providers, if appropriate. The results of
                  correlating monitoring information may point to ICT supply chain compromises.

                  employees meet requirements to participate in the ICT supply chain infrastructure or in developing,
                  testing, or operating of information systems and components. The organization can leverage human
                  resource records, intelligence agencies, law enforcement organizations, and other credible sources for

    SI-7     SOFTWARE, FIRMWARE, AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY


             Supplemental ICT SCRM Guidance: This control applies to the information system and ICT supply chain
             infrastructure. The integrity of the ICT supply chain infrastructure should be systematically tested and
             verified to ensure that it remains as required so that the information systems/components traversing through
             it are not impacted by unanticipated changes. The integrity of information systems and components should
             also be tested and verified. Applicable verification tools include: digital signature or checksum verification,
             acceptance testing for physical components, confining software to limited privilege environments such as
             sandboxes, code execution in contained environments prior to use, and ensuring that if only binary or
             machine-executable code is available, it is obtained directly from the OEM or a verified supplier or
             distributer. Mechanisms for this control are discussed in detail in NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 control

APPENDIX A

ICT SCRM CONTROL SUMMARY
This appendix lists the ICT SCRM controls in this publication and maps them to their corresponding
[NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 4] controls as appropriate. Table A-1 indicates those controls that are defined in
NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 as “High Baseline” requirements. Some ICT SCRM controls were added to
this baseline in order to create a baseline for ICT SCRM. Additionally, because ICT SCRM is an
organization-wide activity that requires selection and implementation of controls at the organization,
mission, and system levels (Tiers 1, 2, and 3 of the organization according to [NIST SP 800-39]), Table
A-1 indicates the organizational tiers in which the controls should be implemented. The table highlights
ICT SCRM controls and enhancements not in [NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 4] in red, viz., MA-7, PV-1, PV-2,
PV-2(1), PV-3, and SA-18(3).

APPENDIX B

NIST SP 800-53 ICT SCRM-RELEVANT CONTROLS
This appendix provides a list of the information security controls from NIST Special Publication 800-53
Revision 4 that are directly relevant and apply to supply chain security. The list is categorized
alphabetically by existing information security control families. The specific controls within those
families are ordered numerically. Note: Control families Program Management (PM) and Planning (PL)
are listed separately, as they are considered an oversight activity and ordered as such in NIST SP 800-53
Revision 4. The controls in this publication are linked to the Chapter 3 SCRM guidance to provide an
expanded description and frame of reference to the SCRM guidance.

FAMILY: ACCESS CONTROL
AC-1     ACCESS CONTROL POLICY AND PROCEDURES                                        [BACK TO SCRM CONTROL]

         Control: The organization:

         a.     Develops, documents, and disseminates to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]:
                1.    An access control policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management
                      commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and
                2.    Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the access control policy and associated access
                      controls; and
         b.     Reviews and updates the current:
                1.    Access control policy [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; and
                2.    Access control procedures [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].
         Supplemental Guidance: This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the effective
         implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the AC family. Policy and
         procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards,
         and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for
         system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general
         information security policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies
         reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security
         program in general and for particular information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management
         strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures. Related control: PM-9.
         Control Enhancements: None.

         Control: The organization:

         a.     Identifies and selects the following types of information system accounts to support organizational
                missions/business functions: [Assignment: organization-defined information system account types];

         b.    Assigns account managers for information system accounts;
         c.    Establishes conditions for group and role membership;
         d.    Specifies authorized users of the information system, group and role membership, and access
               authorizations (i.e., privileges) and other attributes (as required) for each account;
         e.    Requires approvals by [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] for requests to create
               information system accounts;
         f.    Creates, enables, modifies, disables, and removes information system accounts in accordance with
               [Assignment: organization-defined procedures or conditions];
         g.    Monitors the use of, information system accounts;
         h.    Notifies account managers:
               1.   When accounts are no longer required;
               2.   When users are terminated or transferred; and
               3.   When individual information system usage or need-to-know changes;
         i.    Authorizes access to the information system based on:
               1.   A valid access authorization;
               2.   Intended system usage; and
               3.   Other attributes as required by the organization or associated missions/business functions;
         j.    Reviews accounts for compliance with account management requirements [Assignment: organization-
               defined frequency]; and
         k.    Establishes a process for reissuing shared/group account credentials (if deployed) when individuals are
               removed from the group.
         Supplemental Guidance: Information system account types include, for example, individual, shared, group,
         system, guest/anonymous, emergency, developer/manufacturer/vendor, temporary, and service. Some of
         the account management requirements listed above can be implemented by organizational information
         systems. The identification of authorized users of the information system and the specification of access
         privileges reflects the requirements in other security controls in the security plan. Users requiring
         administrative privileges on information system accounts receive additional scrutiny by appropriate
         organizational personnel (e.g., system owner, mission/business owner, or chief information security officer)
         responsible for approving such accounts and privileged access. Organizations may choose to define access
         privileges or other attributes by account, by type of account, or a combination of both. Other attributes
         required for authorizing access include, for example, restrictions on time-of-day, day-of-week, and point-
         of-origin. In defining other account attributes, organizations consider system-related requirements (e.g.,
         scheduled maintenance, system upgrades) and mission/business requirements, (e.g., time zone differences,
         customer requirements, remote access to support travel requirements). Failure to consider these factors
         could affect information system availability. Temporary and emergency accounts are accounts intended for
         short-term use. Organizations establish temporary accounts as a part of normal account activation
         procedures when there is a need for short-term accounts without the demand for immediacy in account
         activation. Organizations establish emergency accounts in response to crisis situations and with the need for
         rapid account activation. Therefore, emergency account activation may bypass normal account
         authorization processes. Emergency and temporary accounts are not to be confused with infrequently used
         accounts (e.g., local logon accounts used for special tasks defined by organizations or when network
         resources are unavailable). Such accounts remain available and are not subject to automatic disabling or
         removal dates. Conditions for disabling or deactivating accounts include, for example: (i) when
         shared/group, emergency, or temporary accounts are no longer required; or (ii) when individuals are
         transferred or terminated. Some types of information system accounts may require specialized training.

           Control: The information system enforces approved authorizations for logical access to information and
           system resources in accordance with applicable access control policies.
           Supplemental Guidance: Access control policies (e.g., identity-based policies, role-based policies, attribute-
           based policies) and access enforcement mechanisms (e.g., access control lists, access control matrices,
           cryptography) control access between active entities or subjects (i.e., users or processes acting on behalf of
           users) and passive entities or objects (e.g., devices, files, records, domains) in information systems. In
           addition to enforcing authorized access at the information system level and recognizing that information
           systems can host many applications and services in support of organizational missions and business
           operations, access enforcement mechanisms can also be employed at the application and service level to

AC-3 (8)         ACCESS ENFORCEMENT | REVOCATION OF ACCESS AUTHORIZATIONS                        [BACK TO SCRM CONTROL]

                 The information system enforces the revocation of access authorizations resulting from changes
                 to the security attributes of subjects and objects based on [Assignment: organization-defined rules
                 governing the timing of revocations of access authorizations].

                 Supplemental Guidance: Revocation of access rules may differ based on the types of access revoked. For
                 example, if a subject (i.e., user or process) is removed from a group, access may not be revoked until
                 the next time the object (e.g., file) is opened or until the next time the subject attempts a new access to
                 the object. Revocation based on changes to security labels may take effect immediately. Organizations
                 can provide alternative approaches on how to make revocations immediate if information systems
                 cannot provide such capability and immediate revocation is necessary.


AC-3 (9)         ACCESS ENFORCEMENT | CONTROLLED RELEASE                                         [BACK TO SCRM CONTROL]

                 The information system does not release information outside of the established system boundary
                 unless:
                 a. The receiving [Assignment: organization-defined information system or system component]
                     provides [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards]; and
                 b. ([Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] are used to validate the
                     appropriateness of the information designated for release.

                 Supplemental Guidance: Information systems can only protect organizational information within the
                 confines of established system boundaries. Additional security safeguards may be needed to ensure
                 that such information is adequately protected once it is passed beyond the established information
                 system boundaries. Examples of information leaving the system boundary include transmitting
                 information to an external information system or printing the information on one of its printers. In
                 cases where the information system is unable to make a determination of the adequacy of the
                 protections provided by entities outside its boundary, as a mitigating control, organizations determine
                 procedurally whether the external information systems are providing adequate security. The means
                 used to determine the adequacy of the security provided by external information systems include, for
                 example, conducting inspections or periodic testing, establishing agreements between the organization

  APPENDIX B                                                                                                              PAGE B-3

                and its counterpart organizations, or some other process. The means used by external entities to protect
                the information received need not be the same as those used by the organization, but the means
                employed are sufficient to provide consistent adjudication of the security policy to protect the
                information. This control enhancement requires information systems to employ technical or procedural
                means to validate the information prior to releasing it to external systems. For example, if the
                information system passes information to another system controlled by another organization, technical
                means are employed to validate that the security attributes associated with the exported information are
                appropriate for the receiving system. Alternatively, if the information system passes information to a
                printer in organization-controlled space, procedural means can be employed to ensure that only
                appropriately authorized individuals gain access to the printer. This control enhancement is most
                applicable when there is some policy mandate (e.g., law, Executive Order, directive, or regulation) that
                establishes policy regarding access to the information, and that policy applies beyond the realm of a
                particular information system or organization.

AC-4     INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT                                              [BACK TO SCRM CONTROL]

         Control: The information system enforces approved authorizations for controlling the flow of information
         within the system and between interconnected systems based on [Assignment: organization-defined
         information flow control policies].
         Supplemental Guidance: Information flow control regulates where information is allowed to travel within an
         information system and between information systems (as opposed to who is allowed to access the
         information) and without explicit regard to subsequent accesses to that information. Flow control
         restrictions include, for example, keeping export-controlled information from being transmitted in the clear
         to the Internet, blocking outside traffic that claims to be from within the organization, restricting web
         requests to the Internet that are not from the internal web proxy server, and limiting information transfers
         between organizations based on data structures and content. Transferring information between information
         systems representing different security domains with different security policies introduces risk that such
         transfers violate one or more domain security policies. In such situations, information owners/stewards
         provide guidance at designated policy enforcement points between interconnected systems. Organizations
         consider mandating specific architectural solutions when required to enforce specific security policies.
         Enforcement includes, for example: (i) prohibiting information transfers between interconnected systems
         (i.e., allowing access only); (ii) employing hardware mechanisms to enforce one-way information flows;
         and (iii) implementing trustworthy regarding mechanisms to reassign security attributes and security labels.

         Organizations commonly employ information flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms to control
         the flow of information between designated sources and destinations (e.g., networks, individuals, and
         devices) within information systems and between interconnected systems. Flow control is based on the
         characteristics of the information and/or the information path. Enforcement occurs, for example, in
         boundary protection devices (e.g., gateways, routers, guards, encrypted tunnels, firewalls) that employ rule
         sets or establish configuration settings that restrict information system services, provide a packet-filtering
         capability based on header information, or message-filtering capability based on message content (e.g.,
         implementing key word searches or using document characteristics). Organizations also consider the
         trustworthiness of filtering/inspection mechanisms (i.e., hardware, firmware, and software components)
         that are critical to information flow enforcement. Control enhancements 3 through 22 primarily address
         cross-domain solution needs which focus on more advanced filtering techniques, in-depth analysis, and
         stronger flow enforcement mechanisms implemented in cross-domain products, for example, high-
         assurance guards. Such capabilities are generally not available in commercial off-the-shelf information

AC-4(6)         INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | METADATA                                [BACK TO SCRM CONTROL]

                The information system enforces information flow control based on [Assignment: organization-
                defined metadata].

                Supplemental Guidance: Metadata is information used to describe the characteristics of data. Metadata
                can include structural metadata describing data structures (e.g., data format, syntax, and semantics) or
                descriptive metadata describing data contents (e.g., age, location, telephone number). Enforcing
                allowed information flows based on metadata enables simpler and more effective flow control.
                Organizations consider the trustworthiness of metadata with regard to data accuracy (i.e., knowledge
                that the metadata values are correct with respect to the data), data integrity (i.e., protecting against
                unauthorized changes to metadata tags), and the binding of metadata to the data payload (i.e., ensuring
                sufficiently strong binding techniques with appropriate levels of assurance). Related controls: AC-16,
                SI-7.


AC-4 (17)       INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | DOMAIN AUTHENTICATION                   [BACK TO SCRM CONTROL]

                The information system uniquely identifies and authenticates source and destination points by
                [Selection (one or more): organization, system, application, individual] for information transfer.

                Supplemental Guidance: Attribution is a critical component of a security concept of operations. The
                ability to identify source and destination points for information flowing in information systems, allows
                the forensic reconstruction of events when required, and encourages policy compliance by attributing
                policy violations to specific organizations/individuals. Successful domain authentication requires that
                information system labels distinguish among systems, organizations, and individuals involved in
                preparing, sending, receiving, or disseminating information. Related controls: IA-2, IA-3, IA-4, IA-5.


AC-4 (19)       INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | VALIDATION OF METADATA                  [BACK TO SCRM CONTROL]

                The information system, when transferring information between different security domains,
                applies the same security policy filtering to metadata as it applies to data payloads.

                Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement requires the validation of metadata and the data to
                which the metadata applies. Some organizations distinguish between metadata and data payloads (i.e.,
                only the data to which the metadata is bound). Other organizations do not make such distinctions,
                considering metadata and the data to which the metadata applies as part of the payload. All information
                (including metadata and the data to which the metadata applies) is subject to filtering and inspection.


AC-4 (21)        INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | PHYSICAL / LOGICAL SEPARATION OF

                defined required separations by types of information].

                Supplemental Guidance: Enforcing the separation of information flows by type can enhance protection by
                ensuring that information is not commingled while in transit and by enabling flow control by
                transmission paths perhaps not otherwise achievable. Types of separable information include, for

          Control: The organization:

          a.    Separates [Assignment: organization-defined duties of individuals];
          b.    Documents separation of duties of individuals; and
          c.    Defines information system access authorizations to support separation of duties.
          Supplemental Guidance: Separation of duties addresses the potential for abuse of authorized privileges and
          helps to reduce the risk of malevolent activity without collusion. Separation of duties includes, for
          example: (i) dividing mission functions and information system support functions among different
          individuals and/or roles; (ii) conducting information system support functions with different individuals
          (e.g., system management, programming, configuration management, quality assurance and testing, and
          network security); and (iii) ensuring security personnel administering access control functions do not also

          users (or processes acting on behalf of users) which are necessary to accomplish assigned tasks in
          accordance with organizational missions and business functions.
          Supplemental Guidance: Organizations employ least privilege for specific duties and information systems.
          The principle of least privilege is also applied to information system processes, ensuring that the processes
          operate at privilege levels no higher than necessary to accomplish required organizational
          missions/business functions. Organizations consider the creation of additional processes, roles, and
          information system accounts as necessary, to achieve least privilege. Organizations also apply least

           Control: The organization:

           a.    Establishes and documents usage restrictions, configuration/connection requirements, and
                 implementation guidance for each type of remote access allowed; and
           b.    Authorizes remote access to the information system prior to allowing such connections.
           Supplemental Guidance: Remote access is access to organizational information systems by users (or processes
           acting on behalf of users) communicating through external networks (e.g., the Internet). Remote access
           methods include, for example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless. Organizations often employ encrypted
           virtual private networks (VPNs) to enhance confidentiality and integrity over remote connections. The use
           of encrypted VPNs does not make the access non-remote; however, the use of VPNs, when adequately
           provisioned with appropriate security controls (e.g., employing appropriate encryption techniques for
           confidentiality and integrity protection) may provide sufficient assurance to the organization that it can
           effectively treat such connections as internal networks. Still, VPN connections traverse external networks,
           and the encrypted VPN does not enhance the availability of remote connections. Also, VPNs with
           encrypted tunnels can affect the organizational capability to adequately monitor network communications
           traffic for malicious code. Remote access controls apply to information systems other than public web
           servers or systems designed for public access. This control addresses authorization prior to allowing remote
           access without specifying the formats for such authorization. While organizations may use interconnection
           security agreements to authorize remote access connections, such agreements are not required by this
           control. Enforcing access restrictions for remote connections is addressed in AC-3. Related controls: AC-2,

         Control: The organization:

         a.     Establishes usage restrictions, configuration requirements, connection requirements, and
                implementation guidance for organization-controlled mobile devices; and
         b.     Authorizes the connection of mobile devices to organizational information systems.
         Supplemental Guidance: A mobile device is a computing device that: (i) has a small form factor such that it
         can easily be carried by a single individual; (ii) is designed to operate without a physical connection (e.g.,
         wirelessly transmit or receive information); (iii) possesses local, non-removable or removable data storage;
         and (iv) includes a self-contained power source. Mobile devices may also include voice communication
         capabilities, on-board sensors that allow the device to capture information, and/or built-in features for
         synchronizing local data with remote locations. Examples include smart phones, E-readers, and tablets.
         Mobile devices are typically associated with a single individual and the device is usually in close proximity
         to the individual; however, the degree of proximity can vary depending upon on the form factor and size of
         the device. The processing, storage, and transmission capability of the mobile device may be comparable to
         or merely a subset of desktop systems, depending upon the nature and intended purpose of the device. Due
         to the large variety of mobile devices with different technical characteristics and capabilities, organizational
         restrictions may vary for the different classes/types of such devices. Usage restrictions and specific
         implementation guidance for mobile devices include, for example, configuration management, device
         identification and authentication, implementation of mandatory protective software (e.g., malicious code
         detection, firewall), scanning devices for malicious code, updating virus protection software, scanning for
         critical software updates and patches, conducting primary operating system (and possibly other resident
         software) integrity checks, and disabling unnecessary hardware (e.g., wireless, infrared). Organizations are
         cautioned that the need to provide adequate security for mobile devices goes beyond the requirements in
         this control. Many safeguards and countermeasures for mobile devices are reflected in other security
         controls in the catalog allocated in the initial control baselines as starting points for the development of
         security plans and overlays using the tailoring process. There may also be some degree of overlap in the
         requirements articulated by the security controls within the different families of controls. AC-20 addresses
         mobile devices that are not organization-controlled. Related controls: AC-3, AC-7, AC-18, AC-20, CA-9,

AC-20    USE OF EXTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS                                       [BACK TO SCRM CONTROL]

         Control: The organization establishes terms and conditions, consistent with any trust relationships
         established with other organizations owning, operating, and/or maintaining external information systems,
         allowing authorized individuals to:
         a.     Access the information system from external information systems; and
         b.     Process, store, or transmit organization-controlled information using external information systems.
         Supplemental Guidance: External information systems are information systems or components of information
         systems that are outside of the authorization boundary established by organizations and for which
         organizations typically have no direct supervision and authority over the application of required security
         controls or the assessment of control effectiveness. External information systems include, for example: (i)
         personally owned information systems/devices (e.g., notebook computers, smart phones, tablets, personal

           digital assistants); (ii) privately owned computing and communications devices resident in commercial or
           public facilities (e.g., hotels, train stations, convention centers, shopping malls, or airports); (iii)
           information systems owned or controlled by nonfederal governmental organizations; and (iv) federal
           information systems that are not owned by, operated by, or under the direct supervision and authority of
           organizations. This control also addresses the use of external information systems for the processing,
           storage, or transmission of organizational information, including, for example, accessing cloud services
           (e.g., infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, or software as a service) from organizational
           information systems.
           For some external information systems (i.e., information systems operated by other federal agencies,
           including organizations subordinate to those agencies), the trust relationships that have been established
           between those organizations and the originating organization may be such, that no explicit terms and
           conditions are required. Information systems within these organizations would not be considered external.
           These situations occur when, for example, there are pre-existing sharing/trust agreements (either implicit or
           explicit) established between federal agencies or organizations subordinate to those agencies, or when such
           trust agreements are specified by applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, or policies. Authorized
           individuals include, for example, organizational personnel, contractors, or other individuals with authorized
           access to organizational information systems and over which organizations have the authority to impose
           rules of behavior with regard to system access. Restrictions that organizations impose on authorized
           individuals need not be uniform, as those restrictions may vary depending upon the trust relationships
           between organizations. Therefore, organizations may choose to impose different security restrictions on
           contractors than on state, local, or tribal governments.
           This control does not apply to the use of external information systems to access public interfaces to
           organizational information systems (e.g., individuals accessing federal information through www.usa.gov).
           Organizations establish terms and conditions for the use of external information systems in accordance with
           organizational security policies and procedures. Terms and conditions address as a minimum: types of
           applications that can be accessed on organizational information systems from external information systems;
           and the highest security category of information that can be processed, stored, or transmitted on external
           information systems. If terms and conditions with the owners of external information systems cannot be
           established, organizations may impose restrictions on organizational personnel using those external
           systems. Related controls: AC-3, AC-17, AC-19, CA-3, PL-4, SA-9.

AC-20(1)       USE OF EXTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS | LIMITS ON AUTHORIZED USE         [BACK TO SCRM CONTROL]

               The organization permits authorized individuals to use an external information system to access
               the information system or to process, store, or transmit organization-controlled information only
               when the organization:
                    (a) Verifies the implementation of required security controls on the external system as
                        specified in the organization’s information security policy and security plan; or
                    (b)   Retains approved information system connection or processing agreements with the
                          organizational entity hosting the external information system.

               Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement recognizes that there are circumstances where
               individuals using external information systems (e.g., contractors, coalition partners) need to access
               organizational information systems. In those situations, organizations need confidence that the external
               information systems contain the necessary security safeguards (i.e., security controls), so as not to
               compromise, damage, or otherwise harm organizational information systems. Verification that the
               required security controls have been implemented can be achieved, for example, by third-party,
               independent assessments, attestations, or other means, depending on the confidence level required by
               organizations. Related control: CA-2.

                The organization [Selection: restricts; prohibits] the use of non-organizationally owned
                information systems, system components, or devices to process, store, or transmit organizational
                information.

                Supplemental Guidance: Non-organizationally owned devices include devices owned by other
                organizations (e.g., federal/state agencies, contractors) and personally owned devices. There are risks
                to using non-organizationally owned devices. In some cases, the risk is sufficiently high as to prohibit
                such use. In other cases, it may be such that the use of non-organizationally owned devices is allowed
                but restricted in some way. Restrictions include, for example: (i) requiring the implementation of
                organization-approved security controls prior to authorizing such connections; (ii) limiting access to
                certain types of information, services, or applications; (iii) using virtualization techniques to limit
                processing and storage activities to servers or other system components provisioned by the
                organization; and (iv) agreeing to terms and conditions for usage. For personally owned devices,
                organizations consult with the Office of the General Counsel regarding legal issues associated with
                using such devices in operational environments, including, for example, requirements for conducting
                forensic analyses during investigations after an incident.

         privileged medical information, contract-sensitive information, proprietary information, personally
         identifiable information, classified information related to special access programs or compartments) based
         on some formal or administrative determination. Depending on the particular information-sharing
         circumstances, sharing partners may be defined at the individual, group, or organizational level.

         standards, and/or guidance, the general public is not authorized access to nonpublic information (e.g.,
         information protected under the Privacy Act and proprietary information). This control addresses
         information systems that are controlled by the organization and accessible to the general public, typically
         without identification or authentication. The posting of information on non-organization information

         Control: The organization establishes procedures to ensure [Assignment: organization-defined access control
         decisions] are applied to each access request prior to access enforcement.
         Supplemental Guidance: Access control decisions (also known as authorization decisions) occur when
         authorization information is applied to specific accesses. In contrast, access enforcement occurs when
         information systems enforce access control decisions. While it is very common to have access control
         decisions and access enforcement implemented by the same entity, it is not required and it is not always an
         optimal implementation choice. For some architectures and distributed information systems, different
         entities may perform access control decisions and access enforcement.

                2.     Security awareness and training procedures [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].
         Supplemental Guidance: This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the effective
         implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the AT family. Policy and
         procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards,
         and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for
         system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general
         information security policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies
         reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security
         program in general and for particular information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management
         strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures. Related control: PM-9.

         Supplemental Guidance: Organizations determine the appropriate content of security training based on the
         assigned roles and responsibilities of individuals and the specific security requirements of organizations
         and the information systems to which personnel have authorized access. In addition, organizations provide
         enterprise architects, information system developers, software developers, acquisition/procurement

         management and auditing activities, personnel performing independent verification and validation
         activities, security control assessors, and other personnel having access to system-level software, adequate
         security-related technical training specifically tailored for their assigned duties. Comprehensive role-based
         training addresses management, operational, and technical roles and responsibilities covering physical,
         personnel, and technical safeguards and countermeasures. Such training can include for example, policies,

         Supplemental Guidance: This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the effective
         implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the AU family. Policy and
         procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards,
         and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for
         system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general
         information security policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies
         reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security
         program in general and for particular information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management
         strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures. Related control: PM-9.

                organization-defined auditable events];
         b.     Coordinates the security audit function with other organizational entities requiring audit-related
                information to enhance mutual support and to help guide the selection of auditable events;
         c.     Provides a rationale for why the auditable events are deemed to be adequate to support after-the-fact
                investigations of security incidents; and
         d.     Determines that the following events are to be audited within the information system: [Assignment:
                organization-defined audited events (the subset of the auditable events defined in AU-2 a.) along with
                the frequency of (or situation requiring) auditing for each identified event].
         Supplemental Guidance: An event is any observable occurrence in an organizational information system.
         Organizations identify audit events as those events which are significant and relevant to the security of
         information systems and the environments in which those systems operate in order to meet specific and
         ongoing audit needs. Audit events can include, for example, password changes, failed logons, or failed
         accesses related to information systems, administrative privilege usage, PIV credential usage, or third-party
         credential usage. In determining the set of auditable events, organizations consider the auditing appropriate

           for each of the security controls to be implemented. To balance auditing requirements with other
           information system needs, this control also requires identifying that subset of auditable events that are
           audited at a given point in time. For example, organizations may determine that information systems must
           have the capability to log every file access both successful and unsuccessful, but not activate that capability
           except for specific circumstances due to the potential burden on system performance. Auditing
           requirements, including the need for auditable events, may be referenced in other security controls and
           control enhancements. Organizations also include auditable events that are required by applicable federal
           laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, and standards. Audit records can be generated at
           various levels of abstraction, including at the packet level as information traverses the network. Selecting
           the appropriate level of abstraction is a critical aspect of an audit capability and can facilitate the
           identification of root causes to problems. Organizations consider in the definition of auditable events, the
           auditing necessary to cover related events such as the steps in distributed, transaction-based processes (e.g.,
           processes that are distributed across multiple organizations) and actions that occur in service-oriented
           architectures. Related controls: AC-6, AC-17, AU-3, AU-12, MA-4, MP-2, MP-4, SI-4.

           a.    Reviews and analyzes information system audit records [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]
                 for indications of [Assignment: organization-defined inappropriate or unusual activity]; and
           b.    Reports findings to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles].
           Supplemental Guidance: Audit review, analysis, and reporting covers information security-related auditing
           performed by organizations including, for example, auditing that results from monitoring of account usage,
           remote access, wireless connectivity, mobile device connection, configuration settings, system component
           inventory, use of maintenance tools and nonlocal maintenance, physical access, temperature and humidity,
           equipment delivery and removal, communications at the information system boundaries, use of mobile
           code, and use of VoIP. Findings can be reported to organizational entities that include, for example,
           incident response team, help desk, information security group/department. If organizations are prohibited
           from reviewing and analyzing audit information or unable to conduct such activities (e.g., in certain
           national security applications or systems), the review/analysis may be carried out by other organizations

                 INFORMATION FROM NONTECHNICAL SOURCES                                  [BACK TO SCRM CONTROL]

                 The organization correlates information from nontechnical sources with audit information to
                 enhance organization-wide situational awareness.

                 Supplemental Guidance: Nontechnical sources include, for example, human resources records
                 documenting organizational policy violations (e.g., sexual harassment incidents, improper use of
                 organizational information assets). Such information can lead organizations to a more directed
                 analytical effort to detect potential malicious insider activity. Due to the sensitive nature of the
                 information available from nontechnical sources, organizations limit access to such information to
                 minimize the potential for the inadvertent release of privacy-related information to individuals that do
                 not have a need to know. Thus, correlation of information from nontechnical sources with audit

            Control: The information system protects against an individual (or process acting on behalf of an individual)
            falsely denying having performed [Assignment: organization-defined actions to be covered by non-
            repudiation].
            Supplemental Guidance: Types of individual actions covered by non-repudiation include, for example,
            creating information, sending and receiving messages, approving information (e.g., indicating concurrence
            or signing a contract). Non-repudiation protects individuals against later claims by: (i) authors of not
            having authored particular documents; (ii) senders of not having transmitted messages; (iii) receivers of not
            having received messages; or (iv) signatories of not having signed documents. Non-repudiation services
            can be used to determine if information originated from a particular individual, or if an individual took
            specific actions (e.g., sending an email, signing a contract, approving a procurement request) or received
            specific information. Organizations obtain non-repudiation services by employing various techniques or
            mechanisms (e.g., digital signatures, digital message receipts). Related controls: SC-12, SC-8, SC-13, SC-

                           organization-defined strength of binding]; and
                      b. Provides the means for authorized individuals to determine the identity of the producer
                           of the information.
                      Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement supports audit requirements that provide
                      organizational personnel with the means to identify who produced specific information in the
                      event of an information transfer. Organizations determine and approve the strength of the binding
                      between the information producer and the information based on the security category of the
                      information and relevant risk factors. Related controls: AC-4, AC-16.

                  The information system:
                      (a)   Validates the binding of the information producer identity to the information at
                            [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; and
                      (b) Performs [Assignment: organization-defined actions] in the event of a validation error.
                  Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement prevents the modification of information between
                  production and review. The validation of bindings can be achieved, for example, by the use of
                  cryptographic checksums. Organizations determine if validations are in response to user requests or
                  generated automatically. Related controls: AC-3, AC-4, AC-16.

                The information system maintains reviewer/releaser identity and credentials within the
                established chain of custody for all information reviewed or released.
                Supplemental Guidance: Chain of custody is a process that tracks the movement of evidence through its
                collection, safeguarding, and analysis life cycle by documenting each person who handled the
                evidence, the date and time it was collected or transferred, and the purpose for the transfer. If the
                reviewer is a human or if the review function is automated but separate from the release/transfer
                function, the information system associates the identity of the reviewer of the information to be
                released with the information and the information label. In the case of human reviews, this control
                enhancement provides organizational officials the means to identify who reviewed and released the
                information. In the case of automated reviews, this control enhancement ensures that only approved
                review functions are employed. Related controls: AC-4, AC-16.

           Control: The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined methods] for coordinating
           [Assignment: organization-defined audit information] among external organizations when audit
           information is transmitted across organizational boundaries.
           Supplemental Guidance: When organizations use information systems and/or services of external
           organizations, the auditing capability necessitates a coordinated approach across organizations. For
           example, maintaining the identity of individuals that requested particular services across organizational
           boundaries may often be very difficult, and doing so may prove to have significant performance
           ramifications. Therefore, it is often the case that cross-organizational auditing (e.g., the type of auditing
           capability provided by service-oriented architectures) simply captures the identity of individuals issuing
           requests at the initial information system, and subsequent systems record that the requests emanated from
           authorized individuals. Related control: AU-6.

AU-16(2)         CROSS-ORGANIZATIONAL AUDITING | SHARING OF AUDIT INFORMATION            [BACK TO SCRM CONTROL]

                 organizations] based on [Assignment: organization-defined cross-organizational sharing agreements].


                 Supplemental Guidance: Because of the distributed nature of the audit information, cross-organization
                 sharing of audit information may be essential for effective analysis of the auditing being performed.
                 For example, the audit records of one organization may not provide sufficient information to determine
                 the appropriate or inappropriate use of organizational information resources by individuals in other
                 organizations. In some instances, only the home organizations of individuals have the appropriate
                 knowledge to make such determinations, thus requiring the sharing of audit information among
                 organizations.

________________________________________________________________________________________________________

           Supplemental Guidance: Organizations assess security controls in organizational information systems and the
           environments in which those systems operate as part of: (i) initial and ongoing security authorizations; (ii)
           FISMA annual assessments; (iii) continuous monitoring; and (iv) system development life cycle activities.
           Security assessments: (i) ensure that information security is built into organizational information systems;
           (ii) identify weaknesses and deficiencies early in the development process; (iii) provide essential
           information needed to make risk-based decisions as part of security authorization processes; and (iv) ensure
           compliance to vulnerability mitigation procedures. Assessments are conducted on the implemented security
           controls from Appendix F (main catalog) and Appendix G (Program Management controls) as documented
           in System Security Plans and Information Security Program Plans. Organizations can use other types of
           assessment activities such as vulnerability scanning and system monitoring to maintain the security posture
           of information systems during the entire life cycle. Security assessment reports document assessment
           results in sufficient detail as deemed necessary by organizations, to determine the accuracy and
           completeness of the reports and whether the security controls are implemented correctly, operating as
           intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting security requirements. The FISMA
           requirement for assessing security controls at least annually does not require additional assessment
           activities to those activities already in place in organizational security authorization processes. Security
           assessment results are provided to the individuals or roles appropriate for the types of assessments being
           conducted. For example, assessments conducted in support of security authorization decisions are provided
           to authorizing officials or authorizing official designated representatives.
           To satisfy annual assessment requirements, organizations can use assessment results from the following
           sources: (i) initial or ongoing information system authorizations; (ii) continuous monitoring; or (iii) system
           development life cycle activities. Organizations ensure that security assessment results are current, relevant
           to the determination of security control effectiveness, and obtained with the appropriate level of assessor
           independence. Existing security control assessment results can be reused to the extent that the results are
           still valid and can also be supplemented with additional assessments as needed. Subsequent to initial
           authorizations and in accordance with OMB policy, organizations assess security controls during
           continuous monitoring. Organizations establish the frequency for ongoing security control assessments in
           accordance with organizational continuous monitoring strategies. Information Assurance Vulnerability
           Alerts provide useful examples of vulnerability mitigation procedures. External audits (e.g., audits by
           external entities such as regulatory agencies) are outside the scope of this control. Related controls: CA-5,

               monitoring; vulnerability scanning; malicious user testing; insider threat assessment;
               performance/load testing; [Assignment: organization-defined other forms of security assessment]].
               Supplemental Guidance: Organizations can employ information system monitoring, insider threat
               assessments, malicious user testing, and other forms of testing (e.g., verification and validation) to
               improve readiness by exercising organizational capabilities and indicating current performance levels
               as a means of focusing actions to improve security. Organizations conduct assessment activities in
               accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, and
               standards. Authorizing officials approve the assessment methods in coordination with the
               organizational risk executive function. Organizations can incorporate vulnerabilities uncovered during
               assessments into vulnerability remediation processes. Related controls: PE-3, SI-2.

________________________________________________________________________________________________________

                 Supplemental Guidance: Organizations may often rely on assessments of specific information systems by
                 other (external) organizations. Utilizing such existing assessments (i.e., reusing existing assessment
                 evidence) can significantly decrease the time and resources required for organizational assessments by
                 limiting the amount of independent assessment activities that organizations need to perform. The
                 factors that organizations may consider in determining whether to accept assessment results from
                 external organizations can vary. Determinations for accepting assessment results can be based on, for
                 example, past assessment experiences one organization has had with another organization, the
                 reputation that organizations have with regard to assessments, the level of detail of supporting
                 assessment documentation provided, or mandates imposed upon organizations by federal legislation,
                 policies, or directives.

           Control: The organization:

           a.    Authorizes connections from the information system to other information systems through the
                 use of Interconnection Security Agreements;
           b.    Documents, for each interconnection, the interface characteristics, security requirements, and
                 the nature of the information communicated; and
           c.    Reviews and updates Interconnection Security Agreements [Assignment: organization-defined
                 frequency].
           Supplemental Guidance: This control applies to dedicated connections between information systems (i.e.,
           system interconnections) and does not apply to transitory, user-controlled connections such as email and
           website browsing. Organizations carefully consider the risks that may be introduced when information
           systems are connected to other systems with different security requirements and security controls, both
           within organizations and external to organizations. Authorizing officials determine the risk associated with
           information system connections and the appropriate controls employed. If interconnecting systems have the
           same authorizing official, organizations do not need to develop Interconnection Security Agreements.
           Instead, organizations can describe the interface characteristics between those interconnecting systems in
           their respective security plans. If interconnecting systems have different authorizing officials within the
           same organization, organizations can either develop Interconnection Security Agreements or describe the
           interface characteristics between systems in the security plans for the respective systems. Organizations
           may also incorporate Interconnection Security Agreement information into formal contracts, especially for
           interconnections established between federal agencies and nonfederal (i.e., private sector) organizations.
           Risk considerations also include information systems sharing the same networks. For certain technologies
           (e.g., space, unmanned aerial vehicles, and medical devices), there may be specialized connections in place
           during preoperational testing. Such connections may require Interconnection Security Agreements and be
           subject to additional security controls. Related controls: AC-3, AC-4, AC-20, AU-2, AU-12, AU-16, CA-7,

                 Supplemental Guidance: Organizations typically do not have control over external networks (e.g., the
                 Internet). Approved boundary protection devices (e.g., routers, firewalls) mediate communications
                 (i.e., information flows) between unclassified non-national security systems and external networks.

CA-6     SECURITY AUTHORIZATION                                                     [BACK TO SCRM CONTROL]



         Control: The organization:

         a.     Assigns a senior-level executive or manager as the authorizing official for the information system;
         b.     Ensures that the authorizing official authorizes the information system for processing before
                commencing operations; and
         c.     Updates the security authorization [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].
         Supplemental Guidance: Security authorizations are official management decisions, conveyed through
         authorization decision documents, by senior organizational officials or executives (i.e., authorizing
         officials) to authorize operation of information systems and to explicitly accept the risk to organizational
         operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation based on the implementation of
         agreed-upon security controls. Authorizing officials provide budgetary oversight for organizational
         information systems or assume responsibility for the mission/business operations supported by those
         systems. The security authorization process is an inherently federal responsibility and therefore, authorizing
         officials must be federal employees. Through the security authorization process, authorizing officials
         assume responsibility and are accountable for security risks associated with the operation and use of
         organizational information systems. Accordingly, authorizing officials are in positions with levels of
         authority commensurate with understanding and accepting such information security-related risks. OMB
         policy requires that organizations conduct ongoing authorizations of information systems by implementing
         continuous monitoring programs. Continuous monitoring programs can satisfy three-year reauthorization
         requirements, so separate reauthorization processes are not necessary. Through the employment of
         comprehensive continuous monitoring processes, critical information contained in authorization packages
         (i.e., security plans, security assessment reports, and plans of action and milestones) is updated on an
         ongoing basis, providing authorizing officials and information system owners with an up-to-date status of
         the security state of organizational information systems and environments of operation. To reduce the
         administrative cost of security reauthorization, authorizing officials use the results of continuous
         monitoring processes to the maximum extent possible as the basis for rendering reauthorization decisions.

           Supplemental Guidance: Continuous monitoring programs facilitate ongoing awareness of threats,
           vulnerabilities, and information security to support organizational risk management decisions. The terms
           continuous and ongoing imply that organizations assess/analyze security controls and information security-
           related risks at a frequency sufficient to support organizational risk-based decisions. The results of
           continuous monitoring programs generate appropriate risk response actions by organizations. Continuous
           monitoring programs also allow organizations to maintain the security authorizations of information
           systems and common controls over time in highly dynamic environments of operation with changing
           mission/business needs, threats, vulnerabilities, and technologies. Having access to security-related
           information on a continuing basis through reports/dashboards gives organizational officials the capability to
           make more effective and timely risk management decisions, including ongoing security authorization
           decisions. Automation supports more frequent updates to security authorization packages,
           hardware/software/firmware inventories, and other system information. Effectiveness is further enhanced
           when continuous monitoring outputs are formatted to provide information that is specific, measurable,
           actionable, relevant, and timely. Continuous monitoring activities are scaled in accordance with the security
           categories of information systems. Related controls: CA-2, CA-5, CA-6, CM-3, CM-4, PM-6, PM-9, RA-5,

                 Supplemental Guidance: Trend analyses can include, for example, examining recent threat information
                 regarding the types of threat events that have occurred within the organization or across the federal
                 government, success rates of certain types of cyber attacks, emerging vulnerabilities in information
                 technologies, evolving social engineering techniques, results from multiple security control
                 assessments, the effectiveness of configuration settings, and findings from Inspectors General or
                 auditors.

CM-1       CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT POLICY AND PROCEDURES                             [BACK TO SCRM CONTROL]

           Control: The organization:
           a.    Develops, documents, and disseminates to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]:
                 1.    A configuration management policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities,
                       management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and
                 2.    Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the configuration management policy and associated
                       configuration management controls; and
           b.    Reviews and updates the current:
                 1.    Configuration management policy [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; and
                 2.    Configuration management procedures [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].
           Supplemental Guidance: This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the effective
           implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the CM family. Policy and
           procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards,
           and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for
           system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general
           information security policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies
           reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security
           program in general and for particular information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management
           strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures. Related control: PM-9.
           Control Enhancements: None.

           Control: The organization develops, documents, and maintains under configuration control, a current
           baseline configuration of the information system.
           Supplemental Guidance: This control establishes baseline configurations for information systems and system
           components including communications and connectivity-related aspects of systems. Baseline
           configurations are documented, formally reviewed and agreed-upon sets of specifications for information
           systems or configuration items within those systems. Baseline configurations serve as a basis for future
           builds, releases, and/or changes to information systems. Baseline configurations include information about
           information system components (e.g., standard software packages installed on workstations, notebook
           computers, servers, network components, or mobile devices; current version numbers and patch
           information on operating systems and applications; and configuration settings/parameters), network
           topology, and the logical placement of those components within the system architecture. Maintaining
           baseline configurations requires creating new baselines as organizational information systems change over
           time. Baseline configurations of information systems reflect the current enterprise architecture. Related
           controls: CM-3, CM-6, CM-8, CM-9, SA-10, PM-5, PM-7.

CM-2 (6)         BASELINE CONFIGURATION | DEVELOPMENT AND TEST ENVIRONMENTS              [BACK TO SCRM CONTROL]

                 The organization maintains a baseline configuration for information system development and
                 test environments that is managed separately from the operational baseline configuration.
                 Supplemental Guidance: Establishing separate baseline configurations for development, testing, and
                 operational environments helps protect information systems from unplanned/unexpected events related
                 to development and testing activities. Separate baseline configurations allow organizations to apply the
                 configuration management that is most appropriate for each type of configuration. For example,
                 management of operational configurations typically emphasizes the need for stability, while
                 management of development/test configurations requires greater flexibility. Configurations in the test
                 environment mirror the configurations in the operational environment to the extent practicable so that
                 the results of the testing are representative of the proposed changes to the operational systems. This
                 control enhancement requires separate configurations but not necessarily separate physical
                 environments. Related controls: CM-4, SC-3, SC-7.

           Control: The organization:

           a.    Determines the types of changes to the information system that are configuration-controlled;
           b.    Reviews proposed configuration-controlled changes to the information system and approves or
                 disapproves such changes with explicit consideration for security impact analyses;
           c.    Documents configuration change decisions associated with the information system;
           d.    Implements approved configuration-controlled changes to the information system;
           e.    Retains records of configuration-controlled changes to the information system for [Assignment:

           f.    Audits and reviews activities associated with configuration-controlled changes to the information
                 system; and
           g.    Coordinates and provides oversight for configuration change control activities through [Assignment:

                 [Selection (one or more): [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; [Assignment: organization-
                 defined configuration change conditions]].
           Supplemental Guidance: Configuration change controls for organizational information systems involve the
           systematic proposal, justification, implementation, testing, review, and disposition of changes to the
           systems, including system upgrades and modifications. Configuration change control includes changes to
           baseline configurations for components and configuration items of information systems, changes to
           configuration settings for information technology products (e.g., operating systems, applications, firewalls,
           routers, and mobile devices), unscheduled/unauthorized changes, and changes to remediate vulnerabilities.

________________________________________________________________________________________________________

           Typical processes for managing configuration changes to information systems include, for example,
           Configuration Control Boards that approve proposed changes to systems. For new development
           information systems or systems undergoing major upgrades, organizations consider including
           representatives from development organizations on the Configuration Control Boards. Auditing of changes
           includes activities before and after changes are made to organizational information systems and the
           auditing activities required to implement such changes. Related controls: CM-2, CM-4, CM-5, CM-6, CM-

           Control: The organization analyzes changes to the information system to determine potential security
           impacts prior to change implementation.
           Supplemental Guidance: Organizational personnel with information security responsibilities (e.g., Information
           System Administrators, Information System Security Officers, Information System Security Managers, and
           Information System Security Engineers) conduct security impact analyses. Individuals conducting security
           impact analyses possess the necessary skills/technical expertise to analyze the changes to information
           systems and the associated security ramifications. Security impact analysis may include, for example,
           reviewing security plans to understand security control requirements and reviewing system design
           documentation to understand control implementation and how specific changes might affect the controls.
           Security impact analyses may also include assessments of risk to better understand the impact of the
           changes and to determine if additional security controls are required. Security impact analyses are scaled in
           accordance with the security categories of the information systems. Related controls: CA-2, CA-7, CM-3,

           Control: The organization defines, documents, approves, and enforces physical and logical access
           restrictions associated with changes to the information system.
           Supplemental Guidance: Any changes to the hardware, software, and/or firmware components of information
           systems can potentially have significant effects on the overall security of the systems. Therefore,
           organizations permit only qualified and authorized individuals to access information systems for purposes
           of initiating changes, including upgrades and modifications. Organizations maintain records of access to
           ensure that configuration change control is implemented and to support after-the-fact actions should
           organizations discover any unauthorized changes. Access restrictions for change also include software
           libraries. Access restrictions include, for example, physical and logical access controls (see AC-3 and PE-
           3), workflow automation, media libraries, abstract layers (e.g., changes implemented into third-party
           interfaces rather than directly into information systems), and change windows (e.g., changes occur only
           during specified times, making unauthorized changes easy to discover). Related controls: AC-3, AC-6, PE-

           d.    Monitors and controls changes to the configuration settings in accordance with organizational policies
                 and procedures.
           Supplemental Guidance: Configuration settings are the set of parameters that can be changed in hardware,
           software, or firmware components of the information system that affect the security posture and/or
           functionality of the system. Information technology products for which security-related configuration
           settings can be defined include, for example, mainframe computers, servers (e.g., database, electronic mail,
           authentication, web, proxy, file, domain name), workstations, input/output devices (e.g., scanners, copiers,

           and printers), network components (e.g., firewalls, routers, gateways, voice and data switches, wireless
           access points, network appliances, sensors), operating systems, middleware, and applications. Security-
           related parameters are those parameters impacting the security state of information systems including the
           parameters required to satisfy other security control requirements. Security-related parameters include, for
           example: (i) registry settings; (ii) account, file, directory permission settings; and (iii) settings for functions,
           ports, protocols, services, and remote connections. Organizations establish organization-wide configuration
           settings and subsequently derive specific settings for information systems. The established settings become
           part of the systems configuration baseline.
           Common secure configurations (also referred to as security configuration checklists, lockdown and
           hardening guides, security reference guides, security technical implementation guides) provide recognized,
           standardized, and established benchmarks that stipulate secure configuration settings for specific
           information technology platforms/products and instructions for configuring those information system
           components to meet operational requirements. Common secure configurations can be developed by a
           variety of organizations including, for example, information technology product developers, manufacturers,
           vendors, consortia, academia, industry, federal agencies, and other organizations in the public and private
           sectors. Common secure configurations include the United States Government Configuration Baseline
           (USGCB) which affects the implementation of CM-6 and other controls such as AC-19 and CM-7. The
           Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) and the defined standards within the protocol (e.g.,
           Common Configuration Enumeration) provide an effective method to uniquely identify, track, and control
           configuration settings. OMB establishes federal policy on configuration requirements for federal

           services from single information system components, but doing so increases risk over limiting the services
           provided by any one component. Where feasible, organizations limit component functionality to a single
           function per device (e.g., email servers or web servers, but not both). Organizations review functions and
           services provided by information systems or individual components of information systems, to determine
           which functions and services are candidates for elimination (e.g., Voice Over Internet Protocol, Instant
           Messaging, auto-execute, and file sharing). Organizations consider disabling unused or unnecessary
           physical and logical ports/protocols (e.g., Universal Serial Bus, File Transfer Protocol, and Hyper Text
           Transfer Protocol) on information systems to prevent unauthorized connection of devices, unauthorized
           transfer of information, or unauthorized tunneling. Organizations can utilize network scanning tools,
           intrusion detection and prevention systems, and end-point protections such as firewalls and host-based
           intrusion detection systems to identify and prevent the use of prohibited functions, ports, protocols, and

CM-8       INFORMATION SYSTEM COMPONENT INVENTORY                                   [BACK TO SCRM CONTROL]

           Control: The organization:

           a.   Develops and documents an inventory of information system components that:
                1.   Accurately reflects the current information system;
                2.   Includes all components within the authorization boundary of the information system;
                3.   Is at the level of granularity deemed necessary for tracking and reporting; and
                4.   Includes [Assignment: organization-defined information deemed necessary to achieve effective
                     information system component accountability]; and
           b.   Reviews and updates the information system component inventory [Assignment: organization-defined
                frequency].
           Supplemental Guidance: Organizations may choose to implement centralized information system component
           inventories that include components from all organizational information systems. In such situations,
           organizations ensure that the resulting inventories include system-specific information required for proper
           component accountability (e.g., information system association, information system owner). Information
           deemed necessary for effective accountability of information system components includes, for example,
           hardware inventory specifications, software license information, software version numbers, component
           owners, and for networked components or devices, machine names and network addresses. Inventory
           specifications include, for example, manufacturer, device type, model, serial number, and physical location.

                The organization updates the inventory of information system components as an integral part of
                component installations, removals, and information system updates.

                The organization employs automated mechanisms to help maintain an up-to-date, complete,
                accurate, and readily available inventory of information system components.
                Supplemental Guidance: Organizations maintain information system inventories to the extent feasible.
                Virtual machines, for example, can be difficult to monitor because such machines are not visible to the
                network when not in use. In such cases, organizations maintain as up-to-date, complete, and accurate
                an inventory as is deemed reasonable. This control enhancement can be satisfied by the
                implementation of CM-2 (2) for organizations that choose to combine information system component
                inventory and baseline configuration activities. Related control: SI-7.

                The organization includes in the information system component inventory information, a means
                for identifying by [Selection (one or more): name; position; role], individuals
                responsible/accountable for administering those components.
                Supplemental Guidance: Identifying individuals who are both responsible and accountable for
                administering information system components helps to ensure that the assigned components are
                properly administered and organizations can contact those individuals if some action is required (e.g.,
                component is determined to be the source of a breach/compromise, component needs to be
                recalled/replaced, or component needs to be relocated).

                 The organization includes assessed component configurations and any approved deviations to
                 current deployed configurations in the information system component inventory.
                 Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement focuses on configuration settings established by
                 organizations for information system components, the specific components that have been assessed to
                 determine compliance with the required configuration settings, and any approved deviations from
                 established configuration settings. Related controls: CM-2, CM-6.

                 The organization provides a centralized repository for the inventory of information system
                 components.
                 Supplemental Guidance: Organizations may choose to implement centralized information system
                 component inventories that include components from all organizational information systems.
                 Centralized repositories of information system component inventories provide opportunities for
                 efficiencies in accounting for organizational hardware, software, and firmware assets. Such
                 repositories may also help organizations rapidly identify the location and responsible individuals of
                 system components that have been compromised, breached, or are otherwise in need of mitigation
                 actions. Organizations ensure that the resulting centralized inventories include system-specific
                 information required for proper component accountability (e.g., information system association,
                 information system owner).

                 The organization employs automated mechanisms to support tracking of information system
                 components by geographic location.
                 Supplemental Guidance: The use of automated mechanisms to track the location of information system
                 components can increase the accuracy of component inventories. Such capability may also help
                 organizations rapidly identify the location and responsible individuals of system components that have
                 been compromised, breached, or are otherwise in need of mitigation actions.

                 (b) Receives an acknowledgement from the information system owner of this assignment.
                 Supplemental Guidance: Organizations determine the criteria for or types of information system
                 components (e.g., microprocessors, motherboards, software, programmable logic controllers, and
                 network devices) that are subject to this control enhancement. Related control: SA-4.

           a.    Addresses roles, responsibilities, and configuration management processes and procedures;
           b.    Establishes a process for identifying configuration items throughout the system development life cycle
                 and for managing the configuration of the configuration items;
           c.    Defines the configuration items for the information system and places the configuration items under
                 configuration management; and
           d.    Protects the configuration management plan from unauthorized disclosure and modification.
           Supplemental Guidance: Configuration management plans satisfy the requirements in configuration
           management policies while being tailored to individual information systems. Such plans define detailed
           processes and procedures for how configuration management is used to support system development life
           cycle activities at the information system level. Configuration management plans are typically developed
           during the development/acquisition phase of the system development life cycle. The plans describe how to
           move changes through change management processes, how to update configuration settings and baselines,
           how to maintain information system component inventories, how to control development, test, and
           operational environments, and how to develop, release, and update key documents. Organizations can
           employ templates to help ensure consistent and timely development and implementation of configuration
           management plans. Such templates can represent a master configuration management plan for the
           organization at large with subsets of the plan implemented on a system by system basis. Configuration
           management approval processes include designation of key management stakeholders responsible for
           reviewing and approving proposed changes to information systems, and personnel that conduct security
           impact analyses prior to the implementation of changes to the systems. Configuration items are the
           information system items (hardware, software, firmware, and documentation) to be configuration-managed.
           As information systems continue through the system development life cycle, new configuration items may
           be identified and some existing configuration items may no longer need to be under configuration control.

CM-9 (1)         CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT PLAN | ASSIGNMENT OF RESPONSIBILITY           [BACK TO SCRM CONTROL]

                 The organization assigns responsibility for developing the configuration management process to
                 organizational personnel that are not directly involved in information system development.
                 Supplemental Guidance: In the absence of dedicated configuration management teams assigned within
                 organizations, system developers may be tasked to develop configuration management processes using
                 personnel who are not directly involved in system development or integration. This separation of
                 duties ensures that organizations establish and maintain a sufficient degree of independence between
                 the information system development and integration processes and configuration management
                 processes to facilitate quality control and more effective oversight.

            software license agreements that permit individuals to study, change, and improve the software. From a
            security perspective, the major advantage of open source software is that in many cases it provides
            organizations with the ability to examine the source code. However, there are also various licensing issues
            associated with open source software including, for example, the constraints on derivative use of such

CP-1     CONTINGENCY PLANNING POLICY AND PROCEDURES                                     [BACK TO SCRM CONTROL]

         Control: The organization:

         a.     Develops, documents, and disseminates to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]:
                1.    A contingency planning policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management
                      commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and
                2.    Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the contingency planning policy and associated
                      contingency planning controls; and
         b.     Reviews and updates the current:
                1.    Contingency planning policy [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; and
                2.    Contingency planning procedures [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].
         Supplemental Guidance: This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the effective
         implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the CP family. Policy and
         procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards,
         and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for
         system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general
         information security policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies
         reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security
         program in general and for particular information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management
         strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures. Related control: PM-9.

         Control: The organization:

         a.     Develops a contingency plan for the information system that:
                1.    Identifies essential missions and business functions and associated contingency requirements;
                2.    Provides recovery objectives, restoration priorities, and metrics;

           d.   Reviews the contingency plan for the information system [Assignment: organization-defined
                frequency];
           e.   Updates the contingency plan to address changes to the organization, information system, or
                environment of operation and problems encountered during contingency plan implementation,
                execution, or testing;
           f.   Communicates contingency plan changes to [Assignment: organization-defined key contingency

           g.   Protects the contingency plan from unauthorized disclosure and modification.
           Supplemental Guidance: Contingency planning for information systems is part of an overall organizational
           program for achieving continuity of operations for mission/business functions. Contingency planning
           addresses both information system restoration and implementation of alternative mission/business
           processes when systems are compromised. The effectiveness of contingency planning is maximized by
           considering such planning throughout the phases of the system development life cycle. Performing
           contingency planning on hardware, software, and firmware development can be an effective means of
           achieving information system resiliency. Contingency plans reflect the degree of restoration required for
           organizational information systems since not all systems may need to fully recover to achieve the level of
           continuity of operations desired. Information system recovery objectives reflect applicable laws, Executive
           Orders, directives, policies, standards, regulations, and guidelines. In addition to information system
           availability, contingency plans also address other security-related events resulting in a reduction in mission
           and/or business effectiveness, such as malicious attacks compromising the confidentiality or integrity of
           information systems. Actions addressed in contingency plans include, for example, orderly/graceful
           degradation, information system shutdown, fallback to a manual mode, alternate information flows, and
           operating in modes reserved for when systems are under attack. By closely coordinating contingency
           planning with incident handling activities, organizations can ensure that the necessary contingency
           planning activities are in place and activated in the event of a security incident. Related controls: AC-14,

CP-2 (2)        CONTINGENCY PLAN | CAPACITY PLANNING                                  [BACK TO SCRM CONTROL]

                The organization conducts capacity planning so that necessary capacity for information processing,
                telecommunications, and environmental support exists during contingency operations.
                Supplemental Guidance: Capacity planning is needed because different types of threats (e.g., natural
                disasters, targeted cyber attacks) can result in a reduction of the available processing,
                telecommunications, and support services originally intended to support the organizational
                missions/business functions. Organizations may need to anticipate degraded operations during
                contingency operations and factor such degradation into capacity planning.

CP-2 (7)        CONTINGENCY PLAN | COORDINATE WITH EXTERNAL SERVICE PROVIDERS [BACK TO SCRM CONTROL]

                The organization coordinates its contingency plan with the contingency plans of external service
                providers to ensure that contingency requirements can be satisfied.
                Supplemental Guidance: When the capability of an organization to successfully carry out its core
                missions/business functions is dependent on external service providers, developing a timely and
                comprehensive contingency plan may become more challenging. In this situation, organizations
                coordinate contingency planning activities with the external entities to ensure that the individual plans
                reflect the overall contingency needs of the organization. Related control: SA-9.

________________________________________________________________________________________________________

                 Supplemental Guidance: Organizations may choose to carry out the contingency planning activities in
                 this control enhancement as part of organizational business continuity planning including, for example,
                 as part of business impact analyses. Organizations identify critical information system assets so that
                 additional safeguards and countermeasures can be employed (above and beyond those safeguards and
                 countermeasures routinely implemented) to help ensure that organizational missions/business functions
                 can continue to be conducted during contingency operations. In addition, the identification of critical
                 information assets facilitates the prioritization of organizational resources. Critical information system
                 assets include technical and operational aspects. Technical aspects include, for example, information
                 technology services, information system components, information technology products, and
                 mechanisms. Operational aspects include, for example, procedures (manually executed operations) and
                 personnel (individuals operating technical safeguards and/or executing manual procedures).
                 Organizational program protection plans can provide assistance in identifying critical assets. Related

           Control: The organization:

           a.    Establishes an alternate storage site including necessary agreements to permit the storage and retrieval
                 of information system backup information; and
           b.    Ensures that the alternate storage site provides information security safeguards equivalent to that of the
                 primary site.
           Supplemental Guidance: Alternate storage sites are sites that are geographically distinct from primary storage
           sites. An alternate storage site maintains duplicate copies of information and data in the event that the
           primary storage site is not available. Items covered by alternate storage site agreements include, for
           example, environmental conditions at alternate sites, access rules, physical and environmental protection
           requirements, and coordination of delivery/retrieval of backup media. Alternate storage sites reflect the
           requirements in contingency plans so that organizations can maintain essential missions/business functions

CP-6 (1)         ALTERNATE STORAGE SITE | SEPARATION FROM PRIMARY SITE                         [BACK TO SCRM CONTROL]

                 The organization identifies an alternate storage site that is separated from the primary storage site to reduce
                 susceptibility to the same threats.
                 Supplemental Guidance: Threats that affect alternate storage sites are typically defined in organizational
                 assessments of risk and include, for example, natural disasters, structural failures, hostile cyber attacks,
                 and errors of omission/commission. Organizations determine what is considered a sufficient degree of
                 separation between primary and alternate storage sites based on the types of threats that are of concern.
                 For one particular type of threat (i.e., hostile cyber attack), the degree of separation between sites is
                 less relevant. Related control: RA-3.

                 recovery time and recovery point objectives] when the primary processing capabilities are unavailable;
           b.    Ensures that equipment and supplies required to transfer and resume operations are available at the
                 alternate processing site or contracts are in place to support delivery to the site within the organization-
                 defined time period for transfer/resumption; and
           c.    Ensures that the alternate processing site provides information security safeguards equivalent to that of
                 the primary site.
           Supplemental Guidance: Alternate processing sites are sites that are geographically distinct from primary
           processing sites. An alternate processing site provides processing capability in the event that the primary
           processing site is not available. Items covered by alternate processing site agreements include, for example,
           environmental conditions at alternate sites, access rules, physical and environmental protection
           requirements, and coordination for the transfer/assignment of personnel. Requirements are specifically
           allocated to alternate processing sites that reflect the requirements in contingency plans to maintain
           essential missions/business functions despite disruption, compromise, or failure in organizational
           information systems. Related controls: CP-2, CP-6, CP-8, CP-9, CP-10, MA-6.

           sites.
           Supplemental Guidance: This control applies to telecommunications services (data and voice) for primary and
           alternate processing and storage sites. Alternate telecommunications services reflect the continuity
           requirements in contingency plans to maintain essential missions/business functions despite the loss of
           primary telecommunications services. Organizations may specify different time periods for
           primary/alternate sites. Alternate telecommunications services include, for example, additional
           organizational or commercial ground-based circuits/lines or satellites in lieu of ground-based
           communications. Organizations consider factors such as availability, quality of service, and access when

CP-8 (4)         TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES | PROVIDER CONTINGENCY PLAN                    [BACK TO SCRM CONTROL]

                 The organization:
                 (a)     Requires primary and alternate telecommunications service providers to have contingency
                         plans;
                 (b)     Reviews provider contingency plans to ensure that the plans meet organizational
                         contingency requirements; and
                 (c)  Obtains evidence of contingency testing/training by providers [Assignment: organization-
                      defined frequency].
                 Supplemental Guidance: Reviews of provider contingency plans consider the proprietary nature of such
                 plans. In some situations, a summary of provider contingency plans may be sufficient evidence for
                 organizations to satisfy the review requirement. Telecommunications service providers may also
                 participate in ongoing disaster recovery exercises in coordination with the Department of Homeland
                 Security, state, and local governments. Organizations may use these types of activities to satisfy
                 evidentiary requirements related to service provider contingency plan reviews, testing, and training.

IA-1     IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION POLICY AND PROCEDURES                      [BACK TO SCRM CONTROL]

         Control: The organization:

         a.     Develops, documents, and disseminates to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]:
                1.    An identification and authentication policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities,
                      management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and
                2.    Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the identification and authentication policy and
                      associated identification and authentication controls; and
         b.     Reviews and updates the current:
                1.    Identification and authentication policy [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; and
                2.    Identification and authentication procedures [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].
         Supplemental Guidance: This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the effective
         implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the IA family. Policy and
         procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards,
         and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for
         system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general
         information security policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies
         reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security
         program in general and for particular information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management
         strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures. Related control: PM-9.
         Control Enhancements: None.

IA-2     IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION (ORGANIZATIONAL USERS)                     [BACK TO SCRM CONTROL]

         Control: The information system uniquely identifies and authenticates organizational users (or processes
         acting on behalf of organizational users).
         Supplemental Guidance: Organizational users include employees or individuals that organizations deem to have
         equivalent status of employees (e.g., contractors, guest researchers). This control applies to all accesses
         other than: (i) accesses that are explicitly identified and documented in AC-14; and (ii) accesses that occur
         through authorized use of group authenticators without individual authentication. Organizations may
         require unique identification of individuals in group accounts (e.g., shared privilege accounts) or for
         detailed accountability of individual activity. Organizations employ passwords, tokens, or biometrics to
         authenticate user identities, or in the case multifactor authentication, or some combination thereof. Access
         to organizational information systems is defined as either local access or network access. Local access is
         any access to organizational information systems by users (or processes acting on behalf of users) where
         such access is obtained by direct connections without the use of networks. Network access is access to
         organizational information systems by users (or processes acting on behalf of users) where such access is
         obtained through network connections (i.e., nonlocal accesses). Remote access is a type of network access
         that involves communication through external networks (e.g., the Internet). Internal networks include local
         area networks and wide area networks. In addition, the use of encrypted virtual private networks (VPNs)
         for network connections between organization-controlled endpoints and non-organization controlled


  APPENDIX B                                                                                                     PAGE B-40

________________________________________________________________________________________________________

           endpoints may be treated as internal networks from the perspective of protecting the confidentiality and
           integrity of information traversing the network.
           Organizations can satisfy the identification and authentication requirements in this control by complying
           with the requirements in Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 consistent with the specific
           organizational implementation plans. Multifactor authentication requires the use of two or more different
           factors to achieve authentication. The factors are defined as: (i) something you know (e.g., password,
           personal identification number [PIN]); (ii) something you have (e.g., cryptographic identification device,
           token); or (iii) something you are (e.g., biometric). Multifactor solutions that require devices separate from
           information systems gaining access include, for example, hardware tokens providing time-based or
           challenge-response authenticators and smart cards such as the U.S. Government Personal Identity
           Verification card and the DoD common access card. In addition to identifying and authenticating users at
           the information system level (i.e., at logon), organizations also employ identification and authentication
           mechanisms at the application level, when necessary, to provide increased information security.
           Identification and authentication requirements for other than organizational users are described in IA-8.

           Control: The organization manages information system identifiers by:

           a.    Receiving authorization from [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] to assign an
                 individual, group, role, or device identifier;
           b.    Selecting an identifier that identifies an individual, group, role, or device;
           c.    Assigning the identifier to the intended individual, group, role, or device;
           d.    Preventing reuse of identifiers for [Assignment: organization-defined time period]; and
           e.    Disabling the identifier after [Assignment: organization-defined time period of inactivity].
           Supplemental Guidance: Common device identifiers include, for example, media access control (MAC),
           Internet protocol (IP) addresses, or device-unique token identifiers. Management of individual identifiers is
           not applicable to shared information system accounts (e.g., guest and anonymous accounts). Typically,
           individual identifiers are the user names of the information system accounts assigned to those individuals.
           In such instances, the account management activities of AC-2 use account names provided by IA-4. This
           control also addresses individual identifiers not necessarily associated with information system accounts
           (e.g., identifiers used in physical security control databases accessed by badge reader systems for access to
           information systems). Preventing reuse of identifiers implies preventing the assignment of previously used
           individual, group, role, or device identifiers to different individuals, groups, roles, or devices. Related
           controls: AC-2, IA-2, IA-3, IA-5, IA-8, SC-37.

                 The organization coordinates with [Assignment: organization-defined external organizations] for
                 cross-organization management of identifiers.
                 Supplemental Guidance: Cross-organization identifier management provides the capability for
                 organizations to appropriately identify individuals, groups, roles, or devices when conducting cross-
                 organization activities involving the processing, storage, or transmission of information.

           Control: The organization manages information system authenticators by:

           a.        Verifying, as part of the initial authenticator distribution, the identity of the individual, group, role, or
                     device receiving the authenticator;
           b.        Establishing initial authenticator content for authenticators defined by the organization;
           c.        Ensuring that authenticators have sufficient strength of mechanism for their intended use;
           d.        Establishing and implementing administrative procedures for initial authenticator distribution, for
                     lost/compromised or damaged authenticators, and for revoking authenticators;
           e.        Changing default content of authenticators prior to information system installation;
           f.        Establishing minimum and maximum lifetime restrictions and reuse conditions for authenticators;
           g.        Changing/refreshing authenticators [Assignment: organization-defined time period by authenticator
                     type];
           h.        Protecting authenticator content from unauthorized disclosure and modification;
           i.        Requiring individuals to take, and having devices implement, specific security safeguards to protect
                     authenticators; and
           j.        Changing authenticators for group/role accounts when membership to those accounts changes.
           Supplemental Guidance: Individual authenticators include, for example, passwords, tokens, biometrics, PKI
           certificates, and key cards. Initial authenticator content is the actual content (e.g., the initial password) as
           opposed to requirements about authenticator content (e.g., minimum password length). In many cases,
           developers ship information system components with factory default authentication credentials to allow for
           initial installation and configuration. Default authentication credentials are often well known, easily
           discoverable, and present a significant security risk. The requirement to protect individual authenticators
           may be implemented via control PL-4 or PS-6 for authenticators in the possession of individuals and by
           controls AC-3, AC-6, and SC-28 for authenticators stored within organizational information systems (e.g.,
           passwords stored in hashed or encrypted formats, files containing encrypted or hashed passwords
           accessible with administrator privileges). Information systems support individual authenticator
           management by organization-defined settings and restrictions for various authenticator characteristics
           including, for example, minimum password length, password composition, validation time window for time
           synchronous one-time tokens, and number of allowed rejections during the verification stage of biometric
           authentication. Specific actions that can be taken to safeguard authenticators include, for example,
           maintaining possession of individual authenticators, not loaning or sharing individual authenticators with
           others, and reporting lost, stolen, or compromised authenticators immediately. Authenticator management
           includes issuing and revoking, when no longer needed, authenticators for temporary access such as that
           required for remote maintenance. Device authenticators include, for example, certificates and passwords.

                 The organization requires developers/installers of information system components to provide
                 unique authenticators or change default authenticators prior to delivery/installation.
                 Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement extends the requirement for organizations to change
                 default authenticators upon information system installation, by requiring developers and/or installers to
                 provide unique authenticators or change default authenticators for system components prior to delivery
                 and/or installation. However, it typically does not apply to the developers of commercial off-the-shelve
                 information technology products. Requirements for unique authenticators can be included in
                 acquisition documents prepared by organizations when procuring information systems or system

           Supplemental Guidance: Non-organizational users include information system users other than organizational
           users explicitly covered by IA-2. These individuals are uniquely identified and authenticated for accesses
           other than those accesses explicitly identified and documented in AC-14. In accordance with the E-
           Authentication E-Government initiative, authentication of non-organizational users accessing federal
           information systems may be required to protect federal, proprietary, or privacy-related information (with
           exceptions noted for national security systems). Organizations use risk assessments to determine
           authentication needs and consider scalability, practicality, and security in balancing the need to ensure ease
           of use for access to federal information and information systems with the need to protect and adequately
           mitigate risk. IA-2 addresses identification and authentication requirements for access to information

         Supplemental Guidance: This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the effective
         implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the IR family. Policy and
         procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards,

         access monitoring, user/administrator reports, and reported supply chain events. Effective incident handling
         capability includes coordination among many organizational entities including, for example,
         mission/business owners, information system owners, authorizing officials, human resources offices,
         physical and personnel security offices, legal departments, operations personnel, procurement offices, and
         the risk executive (function). Relate control: AU-6, CM-6, CP-2, CP-4, IR-2, IR-3, IR-8, PE-6, SC-5, SC-7,

IR-4 (6)          INCIDENT HANDLING | INSIDER THREATS - SPECIFIC CAPABILITIES             [BACK TO SCRM CONTROL]

                  The organization implements incident handling capability for insider threats.
                  Supplemental Guidance: While many organizations address insider threat incidents as an inherent part of
                  their organizational incident response capability, this control enhancement provides additional
                  emphasis on this type of threat and the need for specific incident handling capabilities (as defined
                  within organizations) to provide appropriate and timely responses.

                  The organization coordinates incident handling capability for insider threats across [Assignment:
                  organization-defined components or elements of the organization].
                  Supplemental Guidance: Incident handling for insider threat incidents (including preparation, detection
                  and analysis, containment, eradication, and recovery) requires close coordination among a variety of
                  organizational components or elements to be effective. These components or elements include, for
                  example, mission/business owners, information system owners, human resources offices, procurement
                  offices, personnel/physical security offices, operations personnel, and risk executive (function). In
                  addition, organizations may require external support from federal, state, and local law enforcement
                  agencies.

IR-4 (10)         INCIDENT HANDLING | SUPPLY CHAIN COORDINATION                            [BACK TO SCRM CONTROL]

                  The organization coordinates incident handling activities involving supply chain events with
                  other organizations involved in the supply chain.
                  Supplemental Guidance: Organizations involved in supply chain activities include, for example,
                  system/product developers, integrators, manufacturers, packagers, assemblers, distributors, vendors,
                  and resellers. Supply chain incidents include, for example, compromises/breaches involving
                  information system components, information technology products, development processes or
                  personnel, and distribution processes or warehousing facilities.

            Control: The organization:

            a.    Requires personnel to report suspected security incidents to the organizational incident response
                  capability within [Assignment: organization-defined time period]; and
            b.    Reports security incident information to [Assignment: organization-defined authorities].
            Supplemental Guidance: The intent of this control is to address both specific incident reporting requirements
            within an organization and the formal incident reporting requirements for federal agencies and their
            subordinate organizations. Suspected security incidents include, for example, the receipt of suspicious
            email communications that can potentially contain malicious code. The types of security incidents reported,
            the content and timeliness of the reports, and the designated reporting authorities reflect applicable federal
            laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance. Current federal policy
            requires that all federal agencies (unless specifically exempted from such requirements) report security
            incidents to the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) within specified time
            frames designated in the US-CERT Concept of Operations for Federal Cyber Security Incident Handling.

IR-6 (3)         INCIDENT REPORTING | COORDINATION WITH SUPPLY CHAIN                     [BACK TO SCRM CONTROL]

                 The organization provides security incident information to other organizations involved in the
                 supply chain for information systems or information system components related to the incident.
                 Supplemental Guidance: Organizations involved in supply chain activities include, for example,
                 system/product developers, integrators, manufacturers, packagers, assemblers, distributors, vendors,
                 and resellers. Supply chain incidents include, for example, compromises/breaches involving
                 information system components, information technology products, development processes or
                 personnel, and distribution processes or warehousing facilities. Organizations determine the
                 appropriate information to share considering the value gained from support by external organizations
                 with the potential for harm due to sensitive information being released to outside organizations of
                 perhaps questionable trustworthiness.

IR-9       INFORMATION SPILLAGE RESPONSE                                              [BACK TO SCRM CONTROL]

           Control: The organization responds to information spills by:

           a.    Identifying the specific information involved in the information system contamination;
           b.    Alerting [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] of the information spill using a method
                 of communication not associated with the spill;
           c.    Isolating the contaminated information system or system component;
           d.    Eradicating the information from the contaminated information system or component;
           e.    Identifying other information systems or system components that may have been subsequently
                 contaminated; and
           f.    Performing other [Assignment: organization-defined actions].
           Supplemental Guidance: Information spillage refers to instances where either classified or sensitive
           information is inadvertently placed on information systems that are not authorized to process such
           information. Such information spills often occur when information that is initially thought to be of lower
           sensitivity is transmitted to an information system and then is subsequently determined to be of higher
           sensitivity. At that point, corrective action is required. The nature of the organizational response is
           generally based upon the degree of sensitivity of the spilled information (e.g., security category or
           classification level), the security capabilities of the information system, the specific nature of contaminated
           storage media, and the access authorizations (e.g., security clearances) of individuals with authorized
           access to the contaminated system. The methods used to communicate information about the spill after the
           fact do not involve methods directly associated with the actual spill to minimize the risk of further
           spreading the contamination before such contamination is isolated and eradicated.

         Control: The organization:

         a.     Develops, documents, and disseminates to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]:
                1.    A system maintenance policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management
                      commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and
                2.    Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the system maintenance policy and associated
                      system maintenance controls; and
         b.     Reviews and updates the current:
                1.    System maintenance policy [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; and
                2.    System maintenance procedures [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].
         Supplemental Guidance: This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the effective
         implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the MA family. Policy and
         procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards,
         and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for
         system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general
         information security policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies
         reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security
         program in general and for particular information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management
         strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures. Related control: PM-9.

           Supplemental Guidance: This control addresses the information security aspects of the information system
           maintenance program and applies to all types of maintenance to any system component (including
           applications) conducted by any local or nonlocal entity (e.g., in-contract, warranty, in-house, software
           maintenance agreement). System maintenance also includes those components not directly associated with
           information processing and/or data/information retention such as scanners, copiers, and printers.
           Information necessary for creating effective maintenance records includes, for example: (i) date and time of
           maintenance; (ii) name of individuals or group performing the maintenance; (iii) name of escort, if
           necessary; (iv) a description of the maintenance performed; and (v) information system
           components/equipment removed or replaced (including identification numbers, if applicable). The level of
           detail included in maintenance records can be informed by the security categories of organizational
           information systems. Organizations consider supply chain issues associated with replacement components

           Control: The organization approves, controls, and monitors information system maintenance tools.

           Supplemental Guidance: This control addresses security-related issues associated with maintenance tools used
           specifically for diagnostic and repair actions on organizational information systems. Maintenance tools can
           include hardware, software, and firmware items. Maintenance tools are potential vehicles for transporting
           malicious code, either intentionally or unintentionally, into a facility and subsequently into organizational
           information systems. Maintenance tools can include, for example, hardware/software diagnostic test
           equipment and hardware/software packet sniffers. This control does not cover hardware/software
           components that may support information system maintenance, yet are a part of the system, for example,
           the software implementing “ping,” “ls,” “ipconfig,” or the hardware and software implementing the

                 The organization prevents the unauthorized removal of maintenance equipment containing
                 organizational information by:
                 (a) Verifying that there is no organizational information contained on the equipment;
                 (b) Sanitizing or destroying the equipment;
                 (c) Retaining the equipment within the facility; or
                 (d) Obtaining an exemption from [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] explicitly
                     authorizing removal of the equipment from the facility.
                 Supplemental Guidance: Organizational information includes all information specifically owned by
                 organizations and information provided to organizations in which organizations serve as information
                 stewards.

           c.    Employs strong authenticators in the establishment of nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic sessions;
           d.    Maintains records for nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic activities; and
           e.    Terminates session and network connections when nonlocal maintenance is completed.
           Supplemental Guidance: Nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic activities are those activities conducted by
           individuals communicating through a network, either an external network (e.g., the Internet) or an internal
           network. Local maintenance and diagnostic activities are those activities carried out by individuals
           physically present at the information system or information system component and not communicating
           across a network connection. Authentication techniques used in the establishment of nonlocal maintenance
           and diagnostic sessions reflect the network access requirements in IA-2. Typically, strong authentication
           requires authenticators that are resistant to replay attacks and employ multifactor authentication. Strong
           authenticators include, for example, PKI where certificates are stored on a token protected by a password,
           passphrase, or biometric. Enforcing requirements in MA-4 is accomplished in part by other controls. Relate

MA-4 (3)         NONLOCAL MAINTENANCE | COMPARABLE SECURITY / SANITIZATION                [BACK TO SCRM CONTROL]

                 The organization:
                 Requires that nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic services be performed from an information
                 system that implements a security capability comparable to the capability implemented on the
                 system being serviced; or
                 Removes the component to be serviced from the information system and prior to nonlocal
                 maintenance or diagnostic services, sanitizes the component (with regard to organizational
                 information) before removal from organizational facilities, and after the service is performed,
                 inspects and sanitizes the component (with regard to potentially malicious software) before
                 reconnecting the component to the information system.
                 Supplemental Guidance: Comparable security capability on information systems, diagnostic tools, and
                 equipment providing maintenance services implies that the implemented security controls on those
                 systems, tools, and equipment are at least as comprehensive as the controls on the information system
                 being serviced. Related controls: MA-3, SA-12, SI-3, SI-7.

           Control: The organization:

           a.    Establishes a process for maintenance personnel authorization and maintains a list of authorized
                 maintenance organizations or personnel;
           b.    Ensures that non-escorted personnel performing maintenance on the information system have required
                 access authorizations; and
           c.    Designates organizational personnel with required access authorizations and technical competence to
                 supervise the maintenance activities of personnel who do not possess the required access
                 authorizations.
           Supplemental Guidance: This control applies to individuals performing hardware or software maintenance on
           organizational information systems, while PE-2 addresses physical access for individuals whose
           maintenance duties place them within the physical protection perimeter of the systems (e.g., custodial staff,
           physical plant maintenance personnel). Technical competence of supervising individuals relates to the
           maintenance performed on the information systems while having required access authorizations refers to
           maintenance on and near the systems. Individuals not previously identified as authorized maintenance
           personnel, such as information technology manufacturers, vendors, systems integrators, and consultants,
           may require privileged access to organizational information systems, for example, when required to
           conduct maintenance activities with little or no notice. Based on organizational assessments of risk,
           organizations may issue temporary credentials to these individuals. Temporary credentials may be for one-

         Control: The organization:

         a.     Develops, documents, and disseminates to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]:
                1.    A media protection policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management
                      commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and
                2.    Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the media protection policy and associated media
                      protection controls; and

         Media protection policy [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; and
                1.    Media protection procedures [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].
         Supplemental Guidance: This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the effective
         implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the MP family. Policy and
         procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards,
         and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for
         system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general
         information security policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies
         reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security
         program in general and for particular information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management
         strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures. Related control: PM-9.

         Control: The organization:

         a.     Protects and controls [Assignment: organization-defined types of information system media] during
                transport outside of controlled areas using [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards];
         b.     Maintains accountability for information system media during transport outside of controlled areas;
         c.     Documents activities associated with the transport of information system media; and
         d.     Restricts the activities associated with the transport of information system media to authorized
                personnel.
         Supplemental Guidance: Information system media includes both digital and non-digital media. Digital media
         includes, for example, diskettes, magnetic tapes, external/removable hard disk drives, flash drives, compact
         disks, and digital video disks. Non-digital media includes, for example, paper and microfilm. This control
         also applies to mobile devices with information storage capability (e.g., smart phones, tablets, E-readers)
         that are transported outside of controlled areas. Controlled areas are areas or spaces for which organizations
         provide sufficient physical and/or procedural safeguards to meet the requirements established for protecting
         information and/or information systems.
         Physical and technical safeguards for media are commensurate with the security category or classification
         of the information residing on the media. Safeguards to protect media during transport include, for

         example, locked containers and cryptography. Cryptographic mechanisms can provide confidentiality and
         integrity protections depending upon the mechanisms used. Activities associated with transport include the
         actual transport as well as those activities such as releasing media for transport and ensuring that media
         enters the appropriate transport processes. For the actual transport, authorized transport and courier
         personnel may include individuals from outside the organization (e.g., U.S. Postal Service or a commercial
         transport or delivery service). Maintaining accountability of media during transport includes, for example,
         restricting transport activities to authorized personnel, and tracking and/or obtaining explicit records of
         transport activities as the media moves through the transportation system to prevent and detect loss,
         destruction, or tampering. Organizations establish documentation requirements for activities associated
         with the transport of information system media in accordance with organizational assessments of risk to
         include the flexibility to define different record-keeping methods for the different types of media transport
         as part of an overall system of transport-related records. Related controls: AC-19, CP-9, MP-3, MP-4, RA-

                organizational control, or release for reuse using [Assignment: organization-defined sanitization
                techniques and procedures] in accordance with applicable federal and organizational standards and
                policies; and
         b.     Employs sanitization mechanisms with the strength and integrity commensurate with the security
                category or classification of the information.
         Supplemental Guidance: This control applies to all information system media, both digital and non-digital,
         subject to disposal or reuse, whether or not the media is considered removable. Examples include media
         found in scanners, copiers, printers, notebook computers, workstations, network components, and mobile
         devices. The sanitization process removes information from the media such that the information cannot be
         retrieved or reconstructed. Sanitization techniques, including clearing, purging, cryptographic erase, and
         destruction, prevent the disclosure of information to unauthorized individuals when such media is reused or
         released for disposal. Organizations determine the appropriate sanitization methods recognizing that
         destruction is sometimes necessary when other methods cannot be applied to media requiring sanitization.
         Organizations use discretion on the employment of approved sanitization techniques and procedures for
         media containing information deemed to be in the public domain or publicly releasable, or deemed to have
         no adverse impact on organizations or individuals if released for reuse or disposal. Sanitization of non-
         digital media includes, for example, removing a classified appendix from an otherwise unclassified
         document, or redacting selected sections or words from a document by obscuring the redacted
         sections/words in a manner equivalent in effectiveness to removing them from the document. NSA
         standards and policies control the sanitization process for media containing classified information. Related
         controls: MA-2, MA-4, RA-3, SC-4.

           Supplemental Guidance: This control applies to organizational employees and visitors. Individuals (e.g.,
           employees, contractors, and others) with permanent physical access authorization credentials are not
           considered visitors. Organizations determine the types of facility guards needed including, for example,
           professional physical security staff or other personnel such as administrative staff or information system
           users. Physical access devices include, for example, keys, locks, combinations, and card readers.
           Safeguards for publicly accessible areas within organizational facilities include, for example, cameras,
           monitoring by guards, and isolating selected information systems and/or system components in secured
           areas. Physical access control systems comply with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives,
           policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. The Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management
           Program provides implementation guidance for identity, credential, and access management capabilities for
           physical access control systems. Organizations have flexibility in the types of audit logs employed. Audit
           logs can be procedural (e.g., a written log of individuals accessing the facility and when such access
           occurred), automated (e.g., capturing ID provided by a PIV card), or some combination thereof. Physical
           access points can include facility access points, interior access points to information systems and/or
           components requiring supplemental access controls, or both. Components of organizational information
           systems (e.g., workstations, terminals) may be located in areas designated as publicly accessible with

                1.    A security planning policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management
                      commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and
                2.    Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the security planning policy and associated security

         Supplemental Guidance: This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the effective
         implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the PL family. Policy and
         procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards,
         and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for
         system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general
         information security policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies
         reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security
         program in general and for particular information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management
         strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures. Related control: PM-9.

           e.    Protects the security plan from unauthorized disclosure and modification.

           Supplemental Guidance: Security plans relate security requirements to a set of security controls and control
           enhancements. Security plans also describe, at a high level, how the security controls and control
           enhancements meet those security requirements, but do not provide detailed, technical descriptions of the
           specific design or implementation of the controls/enhancements. Security plans contain sufficient
           information (including the specification of parameter values for assignment and selection statements either
           explicitly or by reference) to enable a design and implementation that is unambiguously compliant with the
           intent of the plans and subsequent determinations of risk to organizational operations and assets,
           individuals, other organizations, and the Nation if the plan is implemented as intended. Organizations can
           also apply tailoring guidance to the security control baselines in Appendix B and CNSS Instruction 1253 to
           develop overlays for community-wide use or to address specialized requirements, technologies, or
           missions/environments of operation (e.g., DoD-tactical, Federal Public Key Infrastructure, or Federal
           Identity, Credential, and Access Management, space operations). Appendix I provides guidance on
           developing overlays.
           Security plans need not be single documents; the plans can be a collection of various documents including
           documents that already exist. Effective security plans make extensive use of references to policies,
           procedures, and additional documents (e.g., design and implementation specifications) where more detailed
           information can be obtained. This reduces the documentation requirements associated with security
           programs and maintains security-related information in other established management/operational areas
           related to enterprise architecture, system development life cycle, systems engineering, and acquisition. For
           example, security plans do not contain detailed contingency plan or incident response plan information but
           instead provide explicitly or by reference, sufficient information to define what needs to be accomplished
           by those plans. Related controls: AC-2, AC-6, AC-14, AC-17, AC-20, CA-2, CA-3, CA-7, CM-9, CP-2,

         b.     Reviews and updates the information security architecture [Assignment: organization-defined
                frequency] to reflect updates in the enterprise architecture; and
         c.     Ensures that planned information security architecture changes are reflected in the security plan, the
                security Concept of Operations (CONOPS), and organizational procurements/acquisitions.
         Supplemental Guidance: This control addresses actions taken by organizations in the design and development
         of information systems. The information security architecture at the individual information system level is
         consistent with and complements the more global, organization-wide information security architecture
         described in PM-7 that is integral to and developed as part of the enterprise architecture. The information
         security architecture includes an architectural description, the placement/allocation of security functionality
         (including security controls), security-related information for external interfaces, information being
         exchanged across the interfaces, and the protection mechanisms associated with each interface. In addition,
         the security architecture can include other important security-related information, for example, user roles
         and access privileges assigned to each role, unique security requirements, the types of information
         processed, stored, and transmitted by the information system, restoration priorities of information and
         information system services, and any other specific protection needs.
         In today’s modern architecture, it is becoming less common for organizations to control all information
         resources. There are going to be key dependencies on external information services and service providers.
         Describing such dependencies in the information security architecture is important to developing a
         comprehensive mission/business protection strategy. Establishing, developing, documenting, and
         maintaining under configuration control, a baseline configuration for organizational information systems is
         critical to implementing and maintaining an effective information security architecture. The development of
         the information security architecture is coordinated with the Senior Agency Official for Privacy
         (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) to ensure that security controls needed to support privacy
         requirements are identified and effectively implemented. PL-8 is primarily directed at organizations (i.e.,
         internally focused) to help ensure that organizations develop an information security architecture for the
         information system, and that the security architecture is integrated with or tightly coupled to the enterprise
         architecture through the organization-wide information security architecture. In contrast, SA-17 is primarily
         directed at external information technology product/system developers and integrators (although SA-17
         could be used internally within organizations for in-house system development). SA-17, which is
         complementary to PL-8, is selected when organizations outsource the development of information systems
         or information system components to external entities, and there is a need to demonstrate/show consistency
         with the organization’s enterprise architecture and information security architecture. Related controls: CM-

    PL-8 (2)    INFORMATION SECURITY ARCHITECTURE | SUPPLIER DIVERSITY                  [BACK TO SCRM CONTROL]

                The organization requires that [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] allocated
                to [Assignment: organization-defined locations and architectural layers] are obtained from
                different suppliers.
                Supplemental Guidance: Different information technology products have different strengths and
                weaknesses. Providing a broad spectrum of products complements the individual offerings. For
                example, vendors offering malicious code protection typically update their products at different times,
                often developing solutions for known viruses, Trojans, or worms according to their priorities and
                development schedules. By having different products at different locations (e.g., server, boundary,
                desktop) there is an increased likelihood that at least one will detect the malicious code. Related

PM-1     INFORMATION SECURITY PROGRAM PLAN                                          [BACK TO SCRM CONTROL]

         Control: The organization:

         a.    Develops and disseminates an organization-wide information security program plan that:
               1.   Provides an overview of the requirements for the security program and a description of the
                    security program management controls and common controls in place or planned for meeting
                    those requirements;
               2.   Includes the identification and assignment of roles, responsibilities, management commitment,
                    coordination among organizational entities, and compliance;
               3.   Reflects coordination among organizational entities responsible for the different aspects of
                    information security (i.e., technical, physical, personnel, cyber-physical); and
               4.   Is approved by a senior official with responsibility and accountability for the risk being incurred to
                    organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, and reputation), organizational
                    assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation;
         b.    Reviews the organization-wide information security program plan [Assignment: organization-defined
               frequency];
         c.    Updates the plan to address organizational changes and problems identified during plan
               implementation or security control assessments; and
         d.    Protects the information security program plan from unauthorized disclosure and modification.
         Supplemental Guidance: Information security program plans can be represented in single documents or
         compilations of documents at the discretion of organizations. The plans document the program
         management controls and organization-defined common controls. Information security program plans
         provide sufficient information about the program management controls/common controls (including
         specification of parameters for any assignment and selection statements either explicitly or by reference) to
         enable implementations that are unambiguously compliant with the intent of the plans and a determination
         of the risk to be incurred if the plans are implemented as intended.
         The security plans for individual information systems and the organization-wide information security
         program plan together, provide complete coverage for all security controls employed within the
         organization. Common controls are documented in an appendix to the organization’s information security
         program plan unless the controls are included in a separate security plan for an information system (e.g.,
         security controls employed as part of an intrusion detection system providing organization-wide boundary
         protection inherited by one or more organizational information systems). The organization-wide
         information security program plan will indicate which separate security plans contain descriptions of
         common controls.
         Organizations have the flexibility to describe common controls in a single document or in multiple
         documents. In the case of multiple documents, the documents describing common controls are included as
         attachments to the information security program plan. If the information security program plan contains
         multiple documents, the organization specifies in each document the organizational official or officials
         responsible for the development, implementation, assessment, authorization, and monitoring of the
         respective common controls. For example, the organization may require that the Facilities Management
         Office develop, implement, assess, authorize, and continuously monitor common physical and
         environmental protection controls from the PE family when such controls are not associated with a
         particular information system but instead, support multiple information systems. Related control: PM-8.

PM-2     SENIOR INFORMATION SECURITY OFFICER                                       [BACK TO SCRM CONTROL]


         Control: The organization appoints a senior information security officer with the mission and resources to
         coordinate, develop, implement, and maintain an organization-wide information security program.
         Supplemental Guidance: The security officer described in this control is an organizational official. For a
         federal agency (as defined in applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, or regulations)
         this official is the Senior Agency Information Security Officer. Organizations may also refer to this official
         as the Senior Information Security Officer or Chief Information Security Officer.

         Control: The organization:

         a.    Ensures that all capital planning and investment requests include the resources needed to implement
               the information security program and documents all exceptions to this requirement;
         b.    Employs a business case/Exhibit 300/Exhibit 53 to record the resources required; and
         c.    Ensures that information security resources are available for expenditure as planned.
         Supplemental Guidance: Organizations consider establishing champions for information security efforts and
         as part of including the necessary resources, assign specialized expertise and resources as needed.
         Organizations may designate and empower an Investment Review Board (or similar group) to manage and
         provide oversight for the information security-related aspects of the capital planning and investment control
         process. Related controls: PM-4, SA-2.

PM-11    MISSION/BUSINESS PROCESS DEFINITION                                       [BACK TO SCRM CONTROL]

         Control: The organization:

         a.    Defines mission/business processes with consideration for information security and the resulting risk to
               organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation; and
         b.    Determines information protection needs arising from the defined mission/business processes and
               revises the processes as necessary, until achievable protection needs are obtained.
         Supplemental Guidance: Information protection needs are technology-independent, required capabilities to
         counter threats to organizations, individuals, or the Nation through the compromise of information (i.e.,
         loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability). Information protection needs are derived from the
         mission/business needs defined by the organization, the mission/business processes selected to meet the
         stated needs, and the organizational risk management strategy. Information protection needs determine the
         required security controls for the organization and the associated information systems supporting the
         mission/business processes. Inherent in defining an organization’s information protection needs is an
         understanding of the level of adverse impact that could result if a compromise of information occurs. The
         security categorization process is used to make such potential impact determinations. Mission/business
         process definitions and associated information protection requirements are documented by the organization
         in accordance with organizational policy and procedure. Related controls: PM-7, PM-8, RA-2.

  APPENDIX B                                                                                                  PAGE B-62

________________________________________________________________________________________________________

         Control: The organization implements an insider threat program that includes a cross-discipline insider
         threat incident handling team.
         Supplemental Guidance: Organizations handling classified information are required, under Executive Order
         13587 and the National Policy on Insider Threat, to establish insider threat programs. The standards and
         guidelines that apply to insider threat programs in classified environments can also be employed effectively
         to improve the security of Controlled Unclassified Information in non-national security systems. Insider
         threat programs include security controls to detect and prevent malicious insider activity through the
         centralized integration and analysis of both technical and nontechnical information to identify potential
         insider threat concerns. A senior organizational official is designated by the department/agency head as the
         responsible individual to implement and provide oversight for the program. In addition to the centralized
         integration and analysis capability, insider threat programs as a minimum, prepare department/agency
         insider threat policies and implementation plans, conduct host-based user monitoring of individual
         employee activities on government-owned classified computers, provide insider threat awareness training
         to employees, receive access to information from all offices within the department/agency (e.g., human
         resources, legal, physical security, personnel security, information technology, information system security,
         and law enforcement) for insider threat analysis, and conduct self-assessments of department/agency
         insider threat posture.
         Insider threat programs can leverage the existence of incident handling teams organizations may already
         have in place, such as computer security incident response teams. Human resources records are especially
         important in this effort, as there is compelling evidence to show that some types of insider crimes are often
         preceded by nontechnical behaviors in the workplace (e.g., ongoing patterns of disgruntled behavior and
         conflicts with coworkers and other colleagues). These precursors can better inform and guide
         organizational officials in more focused, targeted monitoring efforts. The participation of a legal team is
         important to ensure that all monitoring activities are performed in accordance with appropriate legislation,
         directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Related controls: AC-6, AT-2, AU-6, AU-7-

PM-16    THREAT AWARENESS PROGRAM                                                 [BACK TO SCRM CONTROL]

         Control: The organization implements a threat awareness program that includes a cross-organization
         information-sharing capability.
         Supplemental Guidance: Because of the constantly changing and increasing sophistication of adversaries,
         especially the advanced persistent threat (APT), it is becoming more likely that adversaries may
         successfully breach or compromise organizational information systems. One of the best techniques to
         address this concern is for organizations to share threat information. This can include, for example, sharing
         threat events (i.e., tactics, techniques, and procedures) that organizations have experienced, mitigations that
         organizations have found are effective against certain types of threats, threat intelligence (i.e., indications
         and warnings about threats that are likely to occur). Threat information sharing may be bilateral (e.g.,
         government-commercial cooperatives, government-government cooperatives), or multilateral (e.g.,
         organizations taking part in threat-sharing consortia). Threat information may be highly sensitive requiring
         special agreements and protection, or less sensitive and freely shared. Related controls: PM-12, PM-16.

                2.    Personnel security procedures [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].
         Supplemental Guidance: This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the effective
         implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the PS family. Policy and
         procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards,
         and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for
         system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general
         information security policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies
         reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security
         program in general and for particular information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management
         strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures. Related control: PM-9.

         d.     Requires third-party providers to notify [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] of any
                personnel transfers or terminations of third-party personnel who possess organizational credentials
                and/or badges, or who have information system privileges within [Assignment: organization-defined
                time period]; and
         e.     Monitors provider compliance.
         Supplemental Guidance: Third-party providers include, for example, service bureaus, contractors, and other
         organizations providing information system development, information technology services, outsourced
         applications, and network and security management. Organizations explicitly include personnel security
         requirements in acquisition-related documents. Third-party providers may have personnel working at
         organizational facilities with credentials, badges, or information system privileges issued by organizations.
         Notifications of third-party personnel changes ensure appropriate termination of privileges and credentials.
         Organizations define the transfers and terminations deemed reportable by security-related characteristics
         that include, for example, functions, roles, and nature of credentials/privileges associated with individuals

         c.     Ensures that the security categorization decision is reviewed and approved by the authorizing official
                or authorizing official designated representative.
         Supplemental Guidance: Clearly defined authorization boundaries are a prerequisite for effective security
         categorization decisions. Security categories describe the potential adverse impacts to organizational
         operations, organizational assets, and individuals if organizational information and information systems are
         comprised through a loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Organizations conduct the security
         categorization process as an organization-wide activity with the involvement of chief information officers,
         senior information security officers, information system owners, mission/business owners, and information

         Control: The organization:

         a.     Conducts an assessment of risk, including the likelihood and magnitude of harm, from the
                unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of the information system
                and the information it processes, stores, or transmits;
         b.     Documents risk assessment results in [Selection: security plan; risk assessment report; [Assignment:
                organization-defined document]];
         c.     Reviews risk assessment results [Assignment: organization-defined frequency];
         d.     Disseminates risk assessment results to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]; and
         e.     Updates the risk assessment [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] or whenever there are
                significant changes to the information system or environment of operation (including the identification
                of new threats and vulnerabilities), or other conditions that may impact the security state of the system.
                Supplemental Guidance: Clearly defined authorization boundaries are a prerequisite for effective risk
                assessments. Risk assessments take into account threats, vulnerabilities, likelihood, and impact to
                organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation based on the
                operation and use of information systems. Risk assessments also take into account risk from external
                parties (e.g., service providers, contractors operating information systems on behalf of the
                organization, individuals accessing organizational information systems, outsourcing entities). In
                accordance with OMB policy and related E-authentication initiatives, authentication of public users
                accessing federal information systems may also be required to protect nonpublic or privacy-related
                information. As such, organizational assessments of risk also address public access to federal
                information systems.
                Risk assessments (either formal or informal) can be conducted at all three tiers in the risk management
                hierarchy (i.e., organization level, mission/business process level, or information system level) and at
                any phase in the system development life cycle. Risk assessments can also be conducted at various
                steps in the Risk Management Framework, including categorization, security control selection, security
                control implementation, security control assessment, information system authorization, and security
                control monitoring. RA-3 is noteworthy in that the control must be partially implemented prior to the
                implementation of other controls in order to complete the first two steps in the Risk Management
                Framework. Risk assessments can play an important role in security control selection processes,
                particularly during the application of tailoring guidance, which includes security control
                supplementation. Related controls: RA-2, PM-9.

         Supplemental Guidance: This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the effective
         implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the SA family. Policy and
         procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards,
         and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for
         system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general
         information security policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies
         reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security
         program in general and for particular information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management
         strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures. Related control: PM-9.

SA-3     SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE                                              [BACK TO SCRM CONTROL]

         Control: The organization:

         a.     Manages the information system using [Assignment: organization-defined system development life
                cycle] that incorporates information security considerations;
         b.     Defines and documents information security roles and responsibilities throughout the system
                development life cycle;
         c.     Identifies individuals having information security roles and responsibilities; and
         d.     Integrates the organizational information security risk management process into system development
                life cycle activities.
         Supplemental Guidance: A well-defined system development life cycle provides the foundation for the
         successful development, implementation, and operation of organizational information systems. To apply
         the required security controls within the system development life cycle requires a basic understanding of
         information security, threats, vulnerabilities, adverse impacts, and risk to critical missions/business
         functions. The security engineering principles in SA-8 cannot be properly applied if individuals that design,
         code, and test information systems and system components (including information technology products) do
         not understand security. Therefore, organizations include qualified personnel, for example, chief
         information security officers, security architects, security engineers, and information system security
         officers in system development life cycle activities to ensure that security requirements are incorporated
         into organizational information systems. It is equally important that developers include individuals on the
         development team that possess the requisite security expertise and skills to ensure that needed security
         capabilities are effectively integrated into the information system. Security awareness and training
         programs can help ensure that individuals having key security roles and responsibilities have the
         appropriate experience, skills, and expertise to conduct assigned system development life cycle activities.
         The effective integration of security requirements into enterprise architecture also helps to ensure that
         important security considerations are addressed early in the system development life cycle and that those
         considerations are directly related to the organizational mission/business processes. This process also
         facilitates the integration of the information security architecture into the enterprise architecture, consistent
         with organizational risk management and information security strategies. Related controls: AT-3, PM-7,
         SA-8.

                is intended to operate; and
           g.   Acceptance criteria.
           Supplemental Guidance: Information system components are discrete, identifiable information technology
           assets (e.g., hardware, software, or firmware) that represent the building blocks of an information system.
           Information system components include commercial information technology products. Security functional
           requirements include security capabilities, security functions, and security mechanisms. Security strength
           requirements associated with such capabilities, functions, and mechanisms include degree of correctness,
           completeness, resistance to direct attack, and resistance to tampering or bypass. Security assurance
           requirements include: (i) development processes, procedures, practices, and methodologies; and (ii)
           evidence from development and assessment activities providing grounds for confidence that the required
           security functionality has been implemented and the required security strength has been achieved. Security
           documentation requirements address all phases of the system development life cycle.
           Security functionality, assurance, and documentation requirements are expressed in terms of security
           controls and control enhancements that have been selected through the tailoring process. The security
           control tailoring process includes, for example, the specification of parameter values through the use of
           assignment and selection statements and the specification of platform dependencies and implementation
           information. Security documentation provides user and administrator guidance regarding the
           implementation and operation of security controls. The level of detail required in security documentation is
           based on the security category or classification level of the information system and the degree to which
           organizations depend on the stated security capability, functions, or mechanisms to meet overall risk
           response expectations (as defined in the organizational risk management strategy). Security requirements
           can also include organizationally mandated configuration settings specifying allowed functions, ports,
           protocols, and services. Acceptance criteria for information systems, information system components, and
           information system services are defined in the same manner as such criteria for any organizational
           acquisition or procurement. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Section 7.103 contains information
           security requirements from FISMA. Related controls: CM-6, PL-2, PS-7, SA-3, SA-5, SA-8, SA-11, SA-

                (b) Use the configurations as the default for any subsequent system, component, or service
                    reinstallation or upgrade.
                Supplemental Guidance: Security configurations include, for example, the U.S. Government
                Configuration Baseline (USGCB) and any limitations on functions, ports, protocols, and services.
                Security characteristics include, for example, requiring that all default passwords have been changed.

         Control: The organization:

         a.     Obtains administrator documentation for the information system, system component, or information
                system service that describes:
                1.    Secure configuration, installation, and operation of the system, component, or service;
                2.    Effective use and maintenance of security functions/mechanisms; and
                3.    Known vulnerabilities regarding configuration and use of administrative (i.e., privileged)
                      functions;
         b.     Obtains user documentation for the information system, system component, or information system
                service that describes:
                1.    User-accessible security functions/mechanisms and how to effectively use those security
                      functions/mechanisms;
                2.    Methods for user interaction, which enables individuals to use the system, component, or service
                      in a more secure manner; and
                3.    User responsibilities in maintaining the security of the system, component, or service;
         c.     Documents attempts to obtain information system, system component, or information system service
                documentation when such documentation is either unavailable or nonexistent and [Assignment:
                organization-defined actions] in response;
         d.     Protects documentation as required, in accordance with the risk management strategy; and
         e.     Distributes documentation to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles].
         Supplemental Guidance: This control helps organizational personnel understand the implementation and
         operation of security controls associated with information systems, system components, and information
         system services. Organizations consider establishing specific measures to determine the
         quality/completeness of the content provided. The inability to obtain needed documentation may occur, for
         example, due to the age of the information system/component or lack of support from developers and
         contractors. In those situations, organizations may need to recreate selected documentation if such
         documentation is essential to the effective implementation or operation of security controls. The level of
         protection provided for selected information system, component, or service documentation is
         commensurate with the security category or classification of the system. For example, documentation
         associated with a key DoD weapons system or command and control system would typically require a
         higher level of protection than a routine administrative system. Documentation that addresses information
         system vulnerabilities may also require an increased level of protection. Secure operation of the
         information system, includes, for example, initially starting the system and resuming secure system
         operation after any lapse in system operation. Related controls: CM-6, CM-8, PL-2, PL-4, PS-2, SA-3, SA-

         Control: The organization applies information system security engineering principles in the specification,
         design, development, implementation, and modification of the information system.
         Supplemental Guidance: Organizations apply security engineering principles primarily to new development
         information systems or systems undergoing major upgrades. For legacy systems, organizations apply
         security engineering principles to system upgrades and modifications to the extent feasible, given the
         current state of hardware, software, and firmware within those systems. Security engineering principles
         include, for example: (i) developing layered protections; (ii) establishing sound security policy,
         architecture, and controls as the foundation for design; (iii) incorporating security requirements into the
         system development life cycle; (iv) delineating physical and logical security boundaries; (v) ensuring that
         system developers are trained on how to build secure software; (vi) tailoring security controls to meet
         organizational and operational needs; (vii) performing threat modeling to identify use cases, threat agents,
         attack vectors, and attack patterns as well as compensating controls and design patterns needed to mitigate
         risk; and (viii) reducing risk to acceptable levels, thus enabling informed risk management decisions.

SA-9     EXTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEM SERVICES                                       [BACK TO SCRM CONTROL]

         Control: The organization:

         a.     Requires that providers of external information system services comply with organizational
                information security requirements and employ [Assignment: organization-defined security controls] in
                accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards,
                and guidance;
         b.     Defines and documents government oversight and user roles and responsibilities with regard to
                external information system services; and
         c.     Employs [Assignment: organization-defined processes, methods, and techniques] to monitor security
                control compliance by external service providers on an ongoing basis.
         Supplemental Guidance: External information system services are services that are implemented outside of
         the authorization boundaries of organizational information systems. This includes services that are used by,
         but not a part of, organizational information systems. FISMA and OMB policy require that organizations
         using external service providers that are processing, storing, or transmitting federal information or
         operating information systems on behalf of the federal government ensure that such providers meet the
         same security requirements that federal agencies are required to meet. Organizations establish relationships
         with external service providers in a variety of ways including, for example, through joint ventures, business
         partnerships, contracts, interagency agreements, lines of business arrangements, licensing agreements, and
         supply chain exchanges. The responsibility for managing risks from the use of external information system
         services remains with authorizing officials. For services external to organizations, a chain of trust requires

           that organizations establish and retain a level of confidence that each participating provider in the
           potentially complex consumer-provider relationship provides adequate protection for the services rendered.
           The extent and nature of this chain of trust varies based on the relationships between organizations and the
           external providers. Organizations document the basis for trust relationships so the relationships can be
           monitored over time. External information system services documentation includes government, service
           providers, end user security roles and responsibilities, and service-level agreements. Service-level
           agreements define expectations of performance for security controls, describe measurable outcomes, and
           identify remedies and response requirements for identified instances of noncompliance. Related controls:

               The organization:
               (a)   Conducts an organizational assessment of risk prior to the acquisition or outsourcing of
                     dedicated information security services; and
               (b) Ensures that the acquisition or outsourcing of dedicated information security services is
                   approved by [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles].
               Supplemental Guidance: Dedicated information security services include, for example, incident
               monitoring, analysis and response, operation of information security-related devices such as firewalls,
               or key management services. Related controls: CA-6, RA-3.

               The organization establishes, documents, and maintains trust relationships with external service
               providers based on [Assignment: organization-defined security requirements, properties, factors, or
               conditions defining acceptable trust relationships].
               Supplemental Guidance: The degree of confidence that the risk from using external services is at an
               acceptable level depends on the trust that organizations place in the external providers, individually or
               in combination. Trust relationships can help organization to gain increased levels of confidence that
               participating service providers are providing adequate protection for the services rendered. Such
               relationships can be complicated due to the number of potential entities participating in the consumer-
               provider interactions, subordinate relationships and levels of trust, and the types of interactions
               between the parties. In some cases, the degree of trust is based on the amount of direct control
               organizations are able to exert on external service providers with regard to employment of security
               controls necessary for the protection of the service/information and the evidence brought forth as to the
               effectiveness of those controls. The level of control is typically established by the terms and conditions
               of the contracts or service-level agreements and can range from extensive control (e.g., negotiating
               contracts or agreements that specify security requirements for the providers) to very limited control
               (e.g., using contracts or service-level agreements to obtain commodity services such as commercial
               telecommunications services). In other cases, levels of trust are based on factors that convince
               organizations that required security controls have been employed and that determinations of control
               effectiveness exist. For example, separately authorized external information system services provided
               to organizations through well-established business relationships may provide degrees of trust in such
               services within the tolerable risk range of the organizations using the services. External service
               providers may also outsource selected services to other external entities, making the trust relationship
               more difficult and complicated to manage. Depending on the nature of the services, organizations may
               find it very difficult to place significant trust in external providers. This is not due to any inherent
               untrustworthiness on the part of providers, but to the intrinsic level of risk in the services.

                 The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] to ensure that
                 the interests of [Assignment: organization-defined external service providers] are consistent with
                 and reflect organizational interests.
                 Supplemental Guidance: As organizations increasingly use external service providers, the possibility
                 exists that the interests of the service providers may diverge from organizational interests. In such
                 situations, simply having the correct technical, procedural, or operational safeguards in place may not
                 be sufficient if the service providers that implement and control those safeguards are not operating in a
                 manner consistent with the interests of the consuming organizations. Possible actions that
                 organizations might take to address such concerns include, for example, requiring background checks
                 for selected service provider personnel, examining ownership records, employing only trustworthy
                 service providers (i.e., providers with which organizations have had positive experiences), and
                 conducting periodic/unscheduled visits to service provider facilities.

                 The organization restricts the location of [Selection (one or more): information processing;
                 information/data; information system services] to [Assignment: organization-defined locations]
                 based on [Assignment: organization-defined requirements or conditions].
                 Supplemental Guidance: The location of information processing, information/data storage, or information
                 system services that are critical to organizations can have a direct impact on the ability of those
                 organizations to successfully execute their missions/business functions. This situation exists when
                 external providers control the location of processing, storage or services. The criteria external
                 providers use for the selection of processing, storage, or service locations may be different from
                 organizational criteria. For example, organizations may want to ensure that data/information storage
                 locations are restricted to certain locations to facilitate incident response activities (e.g., forensic
                 analyses, after-the-fact investigations) in case of information security breaches/compromises. Such
                 incident response activities may be adversely affected by the governing laws or protocols in the
                 locations where processing and storage occur and/or the locations from which information system
                 services emanate.

         management activities conducted by developers as evidence of applying effective security safeguards.
         Safeguards include, for example, protecting from unauthorized modification or destruction, the master
         copies of all material used to generate security-relevant portions of the system hardware, software, and
         firmware. Maintaining the integrity of changes to the information system, information system component,
         or information system service requires configuration control throughout the system development life cycle
         to track authorized changes and prevent unauthorized changes. Configuration items that are placed under
         configuration management (if existence/use is required by other security controls) include: the formal
         model; the functional, high-level, and low-level design specifications; other design data; implementation
         documentation; source code and hardware schematics; the running version of the object code; tools for
         comparing new versions of security-relevant hardware descriptions and software/firmware source code
         with previous versions; and test fixtures and documentation. Depending on the mission/business needs of
         organizations and the nature of the contractual relationships in place, developers may provide configuration
         management support during the operations and maintenance phases of the life cycle. Related controls: CM-

SA-11    DEVELOPER SECURITY TESTING AND EVALUATION                                  [BACK TO SCRM CONTROL]


         Control: The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or
         information system service to:
         a.     Create and implement a security assessment plan;
         b.     Perform [Selection (one or more): unit; integration; system; regression] testing/evaluation at
                [Assignment: organization-defined depth and coverage];
         c.     Produce evidence of the execution of the security assessment plan and the results of the security
                testing/evaluation;
         d.     Implement a verifiable flaw remediation process; and
         e.     Correct flaws identified during security testing/evaluation.
         Supplemental Guidance: Developmental security testing/evaluation occurs at all post‐design phases of the
         system development life cycle. Such testing/evaluation confirms that the required security controls are
         implemented correctly, operating as intended, enforcing the desired security policy, and meeting
         established security requirements. Security properties of information systems may be affected by the
         interconnection of system components or changes to those components. These interconnections or changes
         (e.g., upgrading or replacing applications and operating systems) may adversely affect previously
         implemented security controls. This control provides additional types of security testing/evaluation that
         developers can conduct to reduce or eliminate potential flaws. Testing custom software applications may
         require approaches such as static analysis, dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three
         approaches. Developers can employ these analysis approaches in a variety of tools (e.g., web-based
         application scanners, static analysis tools, binary analyzers) and in source code reviews. Security
         assessment plans provide the specific activities that developers plan to carry out including the types of
         analyses, testing, evaluation, and reviews of software and firmware components, the degree of rigor to be
         applied, and the types of artifacts produced during those processes. The depth of security testing/evaluation
         refers to the rigor and level of detail associated with the assessment process (e.g., black box, gray box, or
         white box testing). The coverage of security testing/evaluation refers to the scope (i.e., number and type) of
         the artifacts included in the assessment process. Contracts specify the acceptance criteria for security
         assessment plans, flaw remediation processes, and the evidence that the plans/processes have been
         diligently applied. Methods for reviewing and protecting assessment plans, evidence, and documentation
         are commensurate with the security category or classification level of the information system. Contracts

            Control: The organization protects against supply chain threats to the information system, system
            component, or information system service by employing [Assignment: organization-defined security
            safeguards] as part of a comprehensive, defense-in-breadth information security strategy.
            Supplemental Guidance: Information systems (including system components that compose those systems)
            need to be protected throughout the system development life cycle (i.e., during design, development,
            manufacturing, packaging, assembly, distribution, system integration, operations, maintenance, and
            retirement). Protection of organizational information systems is accomplished through threat awareness, by
            the identification, management, and reduction of vulnerabilities at each phase of the life cycle and the use
            of complementary, mutually reinforcing strategies to respond to risk. Organizations consider implementing
            a standardized process to address supply chain risk with respect to information systems and system
            components, and to educate the acquisition workforce on threats, risk, and required security controls.
            Organizations use the acquisition/procurement processes to require supply chain entities to implement
            necessary security safeguards to: (i) reduce the likelihood of unauthorized modifications at each stage in the
            supply chain; and (ii) protect information systems and information system components, prior to taking
            delivery of such systems/components. This control enhancement also applies to information system
            services. Security safeguards include, for example: (i) security controls for development systems,
            development facilities, and external connections to development systems; (ii) vetting development
            personnel; and (iii) use of tamper-evident packaging during shipping/warehousing. Methods for reviewing
            and protecting development plans, evidence, and documentation are commensurate with the security
            category or classification level of the information system. Contracts may specify documentation protection

                  use available all-source intelligence analysis to inform the tailoring of acquisition strategies, tools, and
                  methods. There are a number of different tools and techniques available (e.g., obscuring the end use of
                  an information system or system component, using blind or filtered buys). Organizations also consider
                  creating incentives for suppliers who: (i) implement required security safeguards; (ii) promote
                  transparency into their organizational processes and security practices; (iii) provide additional vetting
                  of the processes and security practices of subordinate suppliers, critical information system
                  components, and services; (iv) restrict purchases from specific suppliers or countries; and (v) provide
                  contract language regarding the prohibition of tainted or counterfeit components. In addition,
                  organizations consider minimizing the time between purchase decisions and required delivery to limit
                  opportunities for adversaries to corrupt information system components or products. Finally,
                  organizations can use trusted/controlled distribution, delivery, and warehousing options to reduce

               shipping and warehousing). Related control: SA-19.

SA-12 (2)      SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | SUPPLIER REVIEWS                              [BACK TO SCRM CONTROL]

               The organization conducts a supplier review prior to entering into a contractual agreement to
               acquire the information system, system component, or information system service.
               Supplemental Guidance: Supplier reviews include, for example: (i) analysis of supplier processes used to
               design, develop, test, implement, verify, deliver, and support information systems, system components,
               and information system services; and (ii) assessment of supplier training and experience in developing
               systems, components, or services with the required security capability. These reviews provide
               organizations with increased levels of visibility into supplier activities during the system development
               life cycle to promote more effective supply chain risk management. Supplier reviews can also help to
               determine whether primary suppliers have security safeguards in place and a practice for vetting
               subordinate suppliers, for example, second- and third-tier suppliers, and any subcontractors.

SA-12 (5)      SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | LIMITATION OF HARM                            [BACK TO SCRM CONTROL]

               The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] to limit harm
               from potential adversaries identifying and targeting the organizational supply chain.
               Supplemental Guidance: Supply chain risk is part of the advanced persistent threat (APT). Security
               safeguards and countermeasures to reduce the probability of adversaries successfully identifying and
               targeting the supply chain include, for example: (i) avoiding the purchase of custom configurations to
               reduce the risk of acquiring information systems, components, or products that have been corrupted via
               supply chain actions targeted at specific organizations; (ii) employing a diverse set of suppliers to limit
               the potential harm from any given supplier in the supply chain; (iii) employing approved vendor lists
               with standing reputations in industry, and (iv) using procurement carve outs (i.e., exclusions to
               commitments or obligations).

SA-12 (7)      SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | ASSESSMENTS PRIOR TO SELECTION /
               ACCEPTANCE / UPDATE                                                     [BACK TO SCRM CONTROL]

               The organization conducts an assessment of the information system, system component, or
               information system service prior to selection, acceptance, or update.
               Supplemental Guidance: Assessments include, for example, testing, evaluations, reviews, and analyses.
               Independent, third-party entities or organizational personnel conduct assessments of systems,
               components, products, tools, and services. Organizations conduct assessments to uncover unintentional
               vulnerabilities and intentional vulnerabilities including, for example, malicious code, malicious
               processes, defective software, and counterfeits. Assessments can include, for example, static analyses,
               dynamic analyses, simulations, white, gray, and black box testing, fuzz testing, penetration testing, and
               ensuring that components or services are genuine (e.g., using tags, cryptographic hash verifications, or
               digital signatures). Evidence generated during security assessments is documented for follow-on
               actions carried out by organizations. Related controls: CA-2, SA-11.

SA-12 (8)      SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | USE OF ALL-SOURCE INTELLIGENCE                [BACK TO SCRM CONTROL]

               The organization uses all-source intelligence analysis of suppliers and potential suppliers of the
               information system, system component, or information system service.
               Supplemental Guidance: All-source intelligence analysis is employed by organizations to inform
               engineering, acquisition, and risk management decisions. All-source intelligence consists of
               intelligence products and/or organizations and activities that incorporate all sources of information,
               most frequently including human intelligence, imagery intelligence, measurement and signature
               intelligence, signals intelligence, and open source data in the production of finished intelligence.
               Where available, such information is used to analyze the risk of both intentional and unintentional
               vulnerabilities from development, manufacturing, and delivery processes, people, and the environment.

SA-12 (9)      SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | OPERATIONS SECURITY                           [BACK TO SCRM CONTROL]

               The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined Operations Security (OPSEC)
               safeguards] in accordance with classification guides to protect supply chain-related information
               for the information system, system component, or information system service.
               Supplemental Guidance: Supply chain information includes, for example: user identities; uses for
               information systems, information system components, and information system services; supplier
               identities; supplier processes; security requirements; design specifications; testing and evaluation
               results; and system/component configurations. This control enhancement expands the scope of OPSEC
               to include suppliers and potential suppliers. OPSEC is a process of identifying critical information and
               subsequently analyzing friendly actions attendant to operations and other activities to: (i) identify those
               actions that can be observed by potential adversaries; (ii) determine indicators that adversaries might
               obtain that could be interpreted or pieced together to derive critical information in sufficient time to
               cause harm to organizations; (iii) implement safeguards or countermeasures to eliminate or reduce to
               an acceptable level, exploitable vulnerabilities; and (iv) consider how aggregated information may
               compromise the confidentiality of users or uses of the supply chain. OPSEC may require organizations
               to withhold critical mission/business information from suppliers and may include the use of
               intermediaries to hide the end use, or users, of information systems, system components, or
               information system services. Related control: PE-21.

SA-12 (10)     SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | VALIDATE AS GENUINE AND NOT ALTERED            [BACK TO SCRM CONTROL]



               The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] to validate
               that the information system or system component received is genuine and has not been altered.

               Supplemental Guidance: For some information system components, especially hardware, there are
               technical means to help determine if the components are genuine or have been altered. Security
               safeguards used to validate the authenticity of information systems and information system
               components include, for example, optical/nanotechnology tagging and side-channel analysis. For
               hardware, detailed bill of material information can highlight the elements with embedded logic
               complete with component and production location

SA-12 (11)     SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | PENETRATION TESTING / ANALYSIS OF
               ELEMENTS, PROCESSES, AND ACTORS                                         [BACK TO SCRM CONTROL]

               The organization employs [Selection (one or more): organizational analysis, independent third-
               party analysis, organizational penetration testing, independent third-party penetration testing] of
               [Assignment: organization-defined supply chain elements, processes, and actors] associated with
               the information system, system component, or information system service.

               Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement addresses analysis and/or testing of the supply chain,
               not just delivered items. Supply chain elements are information technology products or product
               components that contain programmable logic and that are critically important to information system
               functions. Supply chain processes include, for example: (i) hardware, software, and firmware
               development processes; (ii) shipping/handling procedures; (iii) personnel and physical security
               programs; (iv) configuration management tools/measures to maintain provenance; or (v) any other
               programs, processes, or procedures associated with the production/distribution of supply chain
               elements. Supply chain actors are individuals with specific roles and responsibilities in the supply
               chain. The evidence generated during analyses and testing of supply chain elements, processes, and
               actors is documented and used to inform organizational risk management activities and decisions.

SA-12 (12)     SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | INTER-ORGANIZATIONAL AGREEMENTS                [BACK TO SCRM CONTROL]

               The organization establishes inter-organizational agreements and procedures with entities
               involved in the supply chain for the information system, system component, or information
               system service.

               Supplemental Guidance: The establishment of inter-organizational agreements and procedures provides
               for notification of supply chain compromises. Early notification of supply chain compromises that can
               potentially adversely affect or have adversely affected organizational information systems, including
               critical system components, is essential for organizations to provide appropriate responses to such
               incidents.

SA-12 (13)     SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | CRITICAL INFORMATION SYSTEM COMPONENTS
                                                                             [BACK TO SCRM CONTROL]

               The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] to ensure an
               adequate supply of [Assignment: organization-defined critical information system components].

               Supplemental Guidance: Adversaries can attempt to impede organizational operations by disrupting the
               supply of critical information system components or corrupting supplier operations. Safeguards to
               ensure adequate supplies of critical information system components include, for example: (i) the use of
               multiple suppliers throughout the supply chain for the identified critical components; and (ii)
               stockpiling of spare components to ensure operation during mission-critical times.

SA-12 (14)     SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | IDENTITY AND TRACEABILITY                     [BACK TO SCRM CONTROL]

               The organization establishes and retains unique identification of [Assignment: organization-
               defined supply chain elements, processes, and actors] for the information system, system
               component, or information system service.

               Supplemental Guidance: Knowing who and what is in the supply chains of organizations is critical to
               gaining visibility into what is happening within such supply chains, as well as monitoring and
               identifying high-risk events and activities. Without reasonable visibility and traceability into supply
               chains (i.e., elements, processes, and actors), it is very difficult for organizations to understand and
               therefore manage risk, and to reduce the likelihood of adverse events. Uniquely identifying acquirer
               and integrator roles, organizations, personnel, mission and element processes, testing and evaluation
               procedures, delivery mechanisms, support mechanisms, communications/delivery paths, and
               disposal/final disposition activities as well as the components and tools used, establishes a foundational
               identity structure for assessment of supply chain activities. For example, labeling (using serial
               numbers) and tagging (using radio-frequency identification [RFID] tags) individual supply chain
               elements including software packages, modules, and hardware devices, and processes associated with
               those elements can be used for this purpose. Identification methods are sufficient to support the
               provenance in the event of a supply chain issue or adverse supply chain event

SA-12 (15)     SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | PROCESSES TO ADDRESS WEAKNESSES OR

               The organization establishes a process to address weaknesses or deficiencies in supply chain
               elements identified during independent or organizational assessments of such elements.

               Supplemental Guidance: Evidence generated during independent or organizational assessments of supply
               chain elements (e.g., penetration testing, audits, verification/validation activities) is documented and
               used in follow-on processes implemented by organizations to respond to the risks related to the
               identified weaknesses and deficiencies. Supply chain elements include, for example, supplier
               development processes and supplier distribution systems.

         Control: The organization:

         a.     Describes the trustworthiness required in the [Assignment: organization-defined information system,
                information system component, or information system service] supporting its critical missions/business
                functions; and
         b.     Implements [Assignment: organization-defined assurance overlay] to achieve such trustworthiness.
         Supplemental Guidance: This control helps organizations to make explicit trustworthiness decisions when
         designing, developing, and implementing information systems that are needed to conduct critical
         organizational missions/business functions. Trustworthiness is a characteristic/property of an information
         system that expresses the degree to which the system can be expected to preserve the confidentiality,
         integrity, and availability of the information it processes, stores, or transmits. Trustworthy information
         systems are systems that are capable of being trusted to operate within defined levels of risk despite the
         environmental disruptions, human errors, and purposeful attacks that are expected to occur in the specified
         environments of operation. Trustworthy systems are important to mission/business success. Two factors
         affecting the trustworthiness of information systems include: (i) security functionality (i.e., the security
         features, functions, and/or mechanisms employed within the system and its environment of operation); and
         (ii) security assurance (i.e., the grounds for confidence that the security functionality is effective in its
         application). Developers, implementers, operators, and maintainers of organizational information systems
         can increase the level of assurance (and trustworthiness), for example, by employing well-defined security
         policy models, structured and rigorous hardware, software, and firmware development techniques, sound
         system/security engineering principles, and secure configuration settings (defined by a set of assurance-
         related security controls in Appendix B).
         Assurance is also based on the assessment of evidence produced during the system development life cycle.
         Critical missions/business functions are supported by high-impact systems and the associated assurance
         requirements for such systems. The additional assurance controls in Table E-4 in Appendix B (designated
         as optional) can be used to develop and implement high-assurance solutions for specific information
         systems and system components using the concept of overlays described in Appendix I. Organizations
         select assurance overlays that have been developed, validated, and approved for community adoption (e.g.,
         cross-organization, governmentwide), limiting the development of such overlays on an organization-by-
         organization basis. Organizations can conduct criticality analyses as described in SA-14, to determine the
         information systems, system components, or information system services that require high-assurance
         solutions. Trustworthiness requirements and assurance overlays can be described in the security plans for
         organizational information systems. Related controls: RA-2, SA-4, SA-8, SA-14, SC-3.

            components, or information system services] at [Assignment: organization-defined decision points in the
            system development life cycle].
            Supplemental Guidance: Criticality analysis is a key tenet of supply chain risk management and informs the
            prioritization of supply chain protection activities such as attack surface reduction, use of all-source
            intelligence, and tailored acquisition strategies. Information system engineers can conduct an end-to-end
            functional decomposition of an information system to identify mission-critical functions and components.
            The functional decomposition includes the identification of core organizational missions supported by the
            system, decomposition into the specific functions to perform those missions, and traceability to the
            hardware, software, and firmware components that implement those functions, including when the
            functions are shared by many components within and beyond the information system boundary.
            Information system components that allow for unmediated access to critical components or functions are
            considered critical due to the inherent vulnerabilities such components create. Criticality is assessed in
            terms of the impact of the function or component failure on the ability of the component to complete the
            organizational missions supported by the information system. A criticality analysis is performed whenever
            an architecture or design is being developed or modified, including upgrades. Related controls: CP-2, PL-2,

            Control: The organization:

            a.    Requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service to
                  follow a documented development process that:
                  1.     Explicitly addresses security requirements;
                  2.     Identifies the standards and tools used in the development process;
                  3.     Documents the specific tool options and tool configurations used in the development process; and
                  4.     Documents, manages, and ensures the integrity of changes to the process and/or tools used in
                         development; and
            b.    Reviews the development process, standards, tools, and tool options/configurations [Assignment:
                  organization-defined frequency] to determine if the process, standards, tools, and tool
                  options/configurations selected and employed can satisfy [Assignment: organization-defined security
                  requirements].
            Supplemental Guidance: Development tools include, for example, programming languages and computer-
            aided design (CAD) systems. Reviews of development processes can include, for example, the use of
            maturity models to determine the potential effectiveness of such processes. Maintaining the integrity of
            changes to tools and processes enables accurate supply chain risk assessment and mitigation, and requires
            robust configuration control throughout the life cycle (including design, development, transport, delivery,
            integration, and maintenance) to track authorized changes and prevent unauthorized changes. Related
            controls: SA-3, SA-8.

                  Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement provides developer input to the criticality analysis
                  performed by organizations in SA-14. Developer input is essential to such analysis because
                  organizations may not have access to detailed design documentation for information system
                  components that are developed as commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) information technology products
                  (e.g., functional specifications, high-level designs, low-level designs, and source code/hardware
                  schematics). Related controls: SA-4, SA-14.

                  The organization requires that developers perform threat modeling and a vulnerability analysis
                  for the information system at [Assignment: organization-defined breadth/depth] that:
                  (a) Uses [Assignment: organization-defined information concerning impact, environment of
                      operations, known or assumed threats, and acceptable risk levels];
                  (b) Employs [Assignment: organization-defined tools and methods]; and

                  The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or
                  information system service to use threat modeling and vulnerability analyses from similar
                  systems, components, or services to inform the current development process.
                  Supplemental Guidance: Analysis of vulnerabilities found in similar software applications can inform
                  potential design or implementation issues for information systems under development. Similar
                  information systems or system components may exist within developer organizations. Authoritative
                  vulnerability information is available from a variety of public and private sector sources including, for
                  example, the National Vulnerability Database.

            Control: The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or
            information system service to provide [Assignment: organization-defined training] on the correct use and
            operation of the implemented security functions, controls, and/or mechanisms.
            Supplemental Guidance: This control applies to external and internal (in-house) developers. Training of
            personnel is an essential element to ensure the effectiveness of security controls implemented within
            organizational information systems. Training options include, for example, classroom-style training, web-
            based/computer-based training, and hands-on training. Organizations can also request sufficient training
            materials from developers to conduct in-house training or offer self-training to organizational personnel.
            Organizations determine the type of training necessary and may require different types of training for
            different security functions, controls, or mechanisms. Related controls: AT-2, AT-3, SA-5.

SA-17       DEVELOPER SECURITY ARCHITECTURE AND DESIGN                                [BACK TO SCRM CONTROL]

            Control: The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or
            information system service to produce a design specification and security architecture that:

            a.    Is consistent with and supportive of the organization’s security architecture which is established within
                  and is an integrated part of the organization’s enterprise architecture;
            b.    Accurately and completely describes the required security functionality, and the allocation of security
                  controls among physical and logical components; and
            c.    Expresses how individual security functions, mechanisms, and services work together to provide
                  required security capabilities and a unified approach to protection.
            Supplemental Guidance: This control is primarily directed at external developers, although it could also be
            used for internal (in-house) development. In contrast, PL-8 is primarily directed at internal developers to
            help ensure that organizations develop an information security architecture and such security architecture is
            integrated or tightly coupled to the enterprise architecture. This distinction is important if/when
            organizations outsource the development of information systems, information system components, or
            information system services to external entities, and there is a requirement to demonstrate consistency with
            the organization’s enterprise architecture and information security architecture. Related controls: PL-8,

            Control: The organization implements a tamper protection program for the information system, system
            component, or information system service.
            Supplemental Guidance: Anti-tamper technologies and techniques provide a level of protection for critical
            information systems, system components, and information technology products against a number of related
            threats including modification, reverse engineering, and substitution. Strong identification combined with
            tamper resistance and/or tamper detection is essential to protecting information systems, components, and
            products during distribution and when in use. Related controls: PE-3, SA-12, SI-7.

SA-18 (1)         TAMPER RESISTANCE AND DETECTION | MULTIPLE PHASES OF SDLC              [BACK TO SCRM CONTROL]

                  The organization employs anti-tamper technologies and techniques during multiple phases in the
                  system development life cycle including design, development, integration, operations, and
                  maintenance.
                  Supplemental Guidance: Organizations use a combination of hardware and software techniques for
                  tamper resistance and detection. Organizations employ obfuscation and self-checking, for example, to
                  make reverse engineering and modifications more difficult, time-consuming, and expensive for
                  adversaries. Customization of information systems and system components can make substitutions
                  easier to detect and therefore limit damage. Related control: SA-3.

SA-20       CUSTOMIZED DEVELOPMENT OF CRITICAL COMPONENTS                            [BACK TO SCRM CONTROL]

            Control: The organization re-implements or custom develops [Assignment: organization-defined critical
            information system components].
            Supplemental Guidance: Organizations determine that certain information system components likely cannot
            be trusted due to specific threats to and vulnerabilities in those components, and for which there are no
            viable security controls to adequately mitigate the resulting risk. Re-implementation or custom
            development of such components helps to satisfy requirements for higher assurance. This is accomplished
            by initiating changes to system components (including hardware, software, and firmware) such that the
            standard attacks by adversaries are less likely to succeed. In situations where no alternative sourcing is
            available and organizations choose not to re-implement or custom develop critical information system
            components, additional safeguards can be employed (e.g., enhanced auditing, restrictions on source code
            and system utility access, and protection from deletion of system and application files. Related controls:

            b.    Satisfy [Assignment: organization-defined additional personnel screening criteria].
            Supplemental Guidance: Because the information system, system component, or information system service
            may be employed in critical activities essential to the national and/or economic security interests of the
            United States, organizations have a strong interest in ensuring that the developer is trustworthy. The degree
            of trust required of the developer may need to be consistent with that of the individuals accessing the
            information system/component/service once deployed. Examples of authorization and personnel screening
            criteria include clearance, satisfactory background checks, citizenship, and nationality. Trustworthiness of
            developers may also include a review and analysis of company ownership and any relationships the
            company has with entities potentially affecting the quality/reliability of the systems, components, or
            services being developed. Related controls: PS-3, PS-7.

                  The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or
                  information system service take [Assignment: organization-defined actions] to ensure that the
                  required access authorizations and screening criteria are satisfied.
                  Supplemental Guidance: Satisfying required access authorizations and personnel screening criteria
                  includes, for example, providing a listing of all the individuals authorized to perform development
                  activities on the selected information system, system component, or information system service so that
                  organizations can validate that the developer has satisfied the necessary authorization and screening
                  requirements.

            Supplemental Guidance: Support for information system components includes, for example, software
            patches, firmware updates, replacement parts, and maintenance contracts. Unsupported components (e.g.,
            when vendors are no longer providing critical software patches), provide a substantial opportunity for
            adversaries to exploit new weaknesses discovered in the currently installed components. Exceptions to
            replacing unsupported system components may include, for example, systems that provide critical
            mission/business capability where newer technologies are not available or where the systems are so isolated

                  relationships, provide ongoing support for the designated unsupported components. Such contractual
                  relationships can include, for example, Open Source Software value-added vendors.

         a.     Develops, documents, and disseminates to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]:
                1.     A system and communications protection policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles,
                       responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and
                       compliance; and
                2.     Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the system and communications protection policy
                       and associated system and communications protection controls; and
         b.     Reviews and updates the current:
                1.     System and communications protection policy [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; and
                2.     System and communications protection procedures [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].
         Supplemental Guidance: This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the effective
         implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the SC family. Policy and
         procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards,
         and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for
         system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general
         information security policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies
         reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security
         program in general and for particular information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management
         strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures. Related control: PM-9.

         Control: The information system prevents unauthorized and unintended information transfer via shared
         system resources.
         Supplemental Guidance: This control prevents information, including encrypted representations of
         information, produced by the actions of prior users/roles (or the actions of processes acting on behalf of
         prior users/roles) from being available to any current users/roles (or current processes) that obtain access to
         shared system resources (e.g., registers, main memory, hard disks) after those resources have been released
         back to information systems. The control of information in shared resources is also commonly referred to
         as object reuse and residual information protection. This control does not address: (i) information
         remanence which refers to residual representation of data that has been nominally erased or removed; (ii)
         covert channels (including storage and/or timing channels) where shared resources are manipulated to
         violate information flow restrictions; or (iii) components within information systems for which there are

SC-5       DENIAL OF SERVICE PROTECTION                                              [BACK TO SCRM CONTROL]

           Control: The information system protects against or limits the effects of the following types of denial of
           service attacks: [Assignment: organization-defined types of denial of service attacks or reference to source
           for such information] by employing [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards].
           Supplemental Guidance: A variety of technologies exist to limit, or in some cases, eliminate the effects of
           denial of service attacks. For example, boundary protection devices can filter certain types of packets to
           protect information system components on internal organizational networks from being directly affected by
           denial of service attacks. Employing increased capacity and bandwidth combined with service redundancy
           may also reduce the susceptibility to denial of service attacks. Related controls: SC-6, SC-7.

                 The information system manages excess capacity, bandwidth, or other redundancy to limit the
                 effects of information flooding denial of service attacks.
                 Supplemental Guidance: Managing excess capacity ensures that sufficient capacity is available to counter
                 flooding attacks. Managing excess capacity may include, for example, establishing selected usage
                 priorities, quotas, or partitioning.

           Control: The information system:

           a.    Monitors and controls communications at the external boundary of the system and at key internal
                 boundaries within the system;
           b.    Implements subnetworks for publicly accessible system components that are [Selection: physically;
                 logically] separated from internal organizational networks; and
           c.    Connects to external networks or information systems only through managed interfaces consisting of
                 boundary protection devices arranged in accordance with an organizational security architecture.
           Supplemental Guidance: Managed interfaces include, for example, gateways, routers, firewalls, guards,
           network-based malicious code analysis and virtualization systems, or encrypted tunnels implemented
           within a security architecture (e.g., routers protecting firewalls or application gateways residing on
           protected subnetworks). Subnetworks that are physically or logically separated from internal networks are
           referred to as demilitarized zones or DMZs. Restricting or prohibiting interfaces within organizational
           information systems includes, for example, restricting external web traffic to designated web servers within
           managed interfaces and prohibiting external traffic that appears to be spoofing internal addresses.
           Organizations consider the shared nature of commercial telecommunications services in the implementation
           of security controls associated with the use of such services. Commercial telecommunications services are
           commonly based on network components and consolidated management systems shared by all attached
           commercial customers, and may also include third party-provided access lines and other service elements.

                  The organization isolates [Assignment: organization-defined information security tools,
                  mechanisms, and support components] from other internal information system components by
                  implementing physically separate subnetworks with managed interfaces to other components of
                  the system.

                  Supplemental Guidance: Physically separate subnetworks with managed interfaces are useful, for
                  example, in isolating computer network defenses from critical operational processing networks to
                  prevent adversaries from discovering the analysis and forensics techniques of organizations. Related

                  end users and external service providers.

                  Supplemental Guidance: Communication clients independently configured by end users and external
                  service providers include, for example, instant messaging clients. Traffic blocking does not apply to
                  communication clients that are configured by organizations to perform authorized functions.

            Control: The information system protects the [Selection (one or more): confidentiality; integrity] of
            transmitted information.
            Supplemental Guidance: This control applies to both internal and external networks and all types of
            information system components from which information can be transmitted (e.g., servers, mobile devices,
            notebook computers, printers, copiers, scanners, facsimile machines). Communication paths outside the
            physical protection of a controlled boundary are exposed to the possibility of interception and modification.
            Protecting the confidentiality and/or integrity of organizational information can be accomplished by
            physical means (e.g., by employing physical distribution systems) or by logical means (e.g., employing
            encryption techniques). Organizations relying on commercial providers offering transmission services as
            commodity services rather than as fully dedicated services (i.e., services which can be highly specialized to
            individual customer needs), may find it difficult to obtain the necessary assurances regarding the
            implementation of needed security controls for transmission confidentiality/integrity. In such situations,
            organizations determine what types of confidentiality/integrity services are available in standard,
            commercial telecommunication service packages. If it is infeasible or impractical to obtain the necessary
            security controls and assurances of control effectiveness through appropriate contracting vehicles,
            organizations implement appropriate compensating security controls or explicitly accept the additional risk.

                  code technologies; and
            c.    Authorizes, monitors, and controls the use of mobile code within the information system.
            Supplemental Guidance: Decisions regarding the employment of mobile code within organizational
            information systems are based on the potential for the code to cause damage to the systems if used
            maliciously. Mobile code technologies include, for example, Java, JavaScript, ActiveX, Postscript, PDF,
            Shockwave movies, Flash animations, and VBScript. Usage restrictions and implementation guidance
            apply to both the selection and use of mobile code installed on servers and mobile code downloaded and

SC-28    PROTECTION OF INFORMATION AT REST                                           [BACK TO SCRM CONTROL]

         Control: The information system protects the [Selection (one or more): confidentiality; integrity] of
         [Assignment: organization-defined information at rest].
         Supplemental Guidance: This control addresses the confidentiality and integrity of information at rest and
         covers user information and system information. Information at rest refers to the state of information when
         it is located on storage devices as specific components of information systems. System-related information
         requiring protection includes, for example, configurations or rule sets for firewalls, gateways, intrusion
         detection/prevention systems, filtering routers, and authenticator content. Organizations may employ
         different mechanisms to achieve confidentiality and integrity protections, including the use of
         cryptographic mechanisms and file share scanning. Integrity protection can be achieved, for example, by
         implementing Write-Once-Read-Many (WORM) technologies. Organizations may also employ other
         security controls including, for example, secure off-line storage in lieu of online storage when adequate
         protection of information at rest cannot otherwise be achieved and/or continuous monitoring to identify
         malicious code at rest. Related controls: AC-3, AC-6, CA-7, CM-3, CM-5, CM-6, PE-3, SC-8, SC-13, SI-3,

         Control: The organization employs a diverse set of information technologies for [Assignment: organization-
         defined information system components] in the implementation of the information system.
         Supplemental Guidance: Increasing the diversity of information technologies within organizational
         information systems reduces the impact of potential exploitations of specific technologies and also defends
         against common mode failures, including those failures induced by supply chain attacks. Diversity in
         information technologies also reduces the likelihood that the means adversaries use to compromise one
         information system component will be equally effective against other system components, thus further
         increasing the adversary work factor to successfully complete planned cyber attacks. An increase in
         diversity may add complexity and management overhead which could ultimately lead to mistakes and
         unauthorized configurations. Related controls: SA-12, SA-14, SC-27.

         Supplemental Guidance: Concealment and misdirection techniques can significantly reduce the targeting
         capability of adversaries (i.e., window of opportunity and available attack surface) to initiate and complete
         cyber attacks. For example, virtualization techniques provide organizations with the ability to disguise
         information systems, potentially reducing the likelihood of successful attacks without the cost of having
         multiple platforms. Increased use of concealment/misdirection techniques including, for example,
         randomness, uncertainty, and virtualization, may sufficiently confuse and mislead adversaries and
         subsequently increase the risk of discovery and/or exposing tradecraft. Concealment/misdirection

  APPENDIX B                                                                                                    PAGE B-92

________________________________________________________________________________________________________

            techniques may also provide organizations additional time to successfully perform core missions and
            business functions. Because of the time and effort required to support concealment/misdirection techniques,
            it is anticipated that such techniques would be used by organizations on a very limited basis. Related
            controls: SC-26, SC-29, SI-14.

SC-30 (2)       CONCEALMENT AND MISDIRECTION | RANDOMNESS                              [BACK TO SCRM CONTROL]

                The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined techniques] to introduce
                randomness into organizational operations and assets.
                Supplemental Guidance: Randomness introduces increased levels of uncertainty for adversaries regarding
                the actions organizations take in defending against cyber attacks. Such actions may impede the ability
                of adversaries to correctly target information resources of organizations supporting critical
                missions/business functions. Uncertainty may also cause adversaries to hesitate before initiating or
                continuing attacks. Misdirection techniques involving randomness include, for example, performing
                certain routine actions at different times of day, employing different information technologies (e.g.,
                browsers, search engines), using different suppliers, and rotating roles and responsibilities of
                organizational personnel.

SC-30 (3)       CONCEALMENT AND MISDIRECTION | CHANGE PROCESSING / STORAGE
                LOCATIONS                                                              [BACK TO SCRM CONTROL]

                The organization changes the location of [Assignment: organization-defined processing and/or
                storage] [Selection: [Assignment: organization-defined time frequency]; at random time intervals]].
                Supplemental Guidance: Adversaries target critical organizational missions/business functions and the
                information resources supporting those missions and functions while at the same time, trying to
                minimize exposure of their existence and tradecraft. The static, homogeneous, and deterministic nature
                of organizational information systems targeted by adversaries, make such systems more susceptible to
                cyber attacks with less adversary cost and effort to be successful. Changing organizational processing
                and storage locations (sometimes referred to as moving target defense) addresses the advanced
                persistent threat (APT) using techniques such as virtualization, distributed processing, and replication.
                This enables organizations to relocate the information resources (i.e., processing and/or storage)
                supporting critical missions and business functions. Changing locations of processing activities and/or
                storage sites introduces uncertainty into the targeting activities by adversaries. This uncertainty
                increases the work factor of adversaries making compromises or breaches to organizational
                information systems much more difficult and time-consuming, and increases the chances that
                adversaries may inadvertently disclose aspects of tradecraft while attempting to locate critical
                organizational resources.

SC-30 (4)       CONCEALMENT AND MISDIRECTION | MISLEADING INFORMATION                  [BACK TO SCRM CONTROL]

                The organization employs realistic, but misleading information in [Assignment: organization-
                defined information system components] with regard to its security state or posture.
                Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement misleads potential adversaries regarding the nature
                and extent of security safeguards deployed by organizations. As a result, adversaries may employ
                incorrect (and as a result ineffective) attack techniques. One way of misleading adversaries is for
                organizations to place misleading information regarding the specific security controls deployed in
                external information systems that are known to be accessed or targeted by adversaries. Another
                technique is the use of deception nets (e.g., honeynets, virtualized environments) that mimic actual
                aspects of organizational information systems but use, for example, out-of-date software
                configurations.

                The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined techniques] to hide or conceal
                [Assignment: organization-defined information system components].

                  Supplemental Guidance: By hiding, disguising, or otherwise concealing critical information system
                  components, organizations may be able to decrease the probability that adversaries target and
                  successfully compromise those assets. Potential means for organizations to hide and/or conceal
                  information system components include, for example, configuration of routers or the use of honeynets
                  or virtualization techniques.

            Control: The organization distributes [Assignment: organization-defined processing and storage] across
            multiple physical locations.
            Supplemental Guidance: Distributing processing and storage across multiple physical locations provides some
            degree of redundancy or overlap for organizations, and therefore increases the work factor of adversaries to
            adversely impact organizational operations, assets, and individuals. This control does not assume a single
            primary processing or storage location, and thus allows for parallel processing and storage. Related

            Control: The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined out-of-band channels] for the
            physical delivery or electronic transmission of [Assignment: organization-defined information, information
            system components, or devices] to [Assignment: organization-defined individuals or information systems].
            Supplemental Guidance: Out-of-band channels include, for example, local (nonnetwork) accesses to
            information systems, network paths physically separate from network paths used for operational traffic, or
            nonelectronic paths such as the US Postal Service. This is in contrast with using the same channels (i.e., in-
            band channels) that carry routine operational traffic. Out-of-band channels do not have the same
            vulnerability/exposure as in-band channels, and hence the confidentiality, integrity, or availability
            compromises of in-band channels will not compromise the out-of-band channels. Organizations may
            employ out-of-band channels in the delivery or transmission of many organizational items including, for
            example, identifiers/authenticators, configuration management changes for hardware, firmware, or
            software, cryptographic key management information, security updates, system/data backups, maintenance
            information, and malicious code protection updates. Related controls: AC-2, CM-3, CM-5, CM-7, IA-4,

                  [Assignment: organization-defined information, information system components, or devices].
                  Supplemental Guidance: Techniques and/or methods employed by organizations to ensure that only
                  designated information systems or individuals receive particular information, system components, or
                  devices include, for example, sending authenticators via courier service but requiring recipients to
                  show some form of government-issued photographic identification as a condition of receipt.

         Control: The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined operations security safeguards] to
         protect key organizational information throughout the system development life cycle.
         Supplemental Guidance: Operations security (OPSEC) is a systematic process by which potential adversaries
         can be denied information about the capabilities and intentions of organizations by identifying, controlling,
         and protecting generally unclassified information that specifically relates to the planning and execution of
         sensitive organizational activities. The OPSEC process involves five steps: (i) identification of critical
         information (e.g., the security categorization process); (ii) analysis of threats; (iii) analysis of
         vulnerabilities; (iv) assessment of risks; and (v) the application of appropriate countermeasures. OPSEC
         safeguards are applied to both organizational information systems and the environments in which those
         systems operate. OPSEC safeguards help to protect the confidentiality of key information including, for
         example, limiting the sharing of information with suppliers and potential suppliers of information system
         components, information technology products and services, and with other non-organizational elements and
         individuals. Information critical to mission/business success includes, for example, user identities, element
         uses, suppliers, supply chain processes, functional and security requirements, system design specifications,
         testing protocols, and security control implementation details. Related controls: RA-2, RA-5, SA-12.

                      management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and
                2.    Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the system and information integrity policy and
                      associated system and information integrity controls; and

                1.    System and information integrity policy [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; and
                2.     System and information integrity procedures [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].
         Supplemental Guidance: This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the effective
         implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the SI family. Policy and
         procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards,
         and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for
         system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general
         information security policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies
         reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security
         program in general and for particular information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management
         strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures. Related control: PM-9.

         Supplemental Guidance: Organizations identify information systems affected by announced software flaws
         including potential vulnerabilities resulting from those flaws, and report this information to designated
         organizational personnel with information security responsibilities. Security-relevant software updates
         include, for example, patches, service packs, hot fixes, and anti-virus signatures. Organizations also address
         flaws discovered during security assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response activities, and
         system error handling. Organizations take advantage of available resources such as the Common Weakness
         Enumeration (CWE) or Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) databases in remediating flaws
         discovered in organizational information systems. By incorporating flaw remediation into ongoing
         configuration management processes, required/anticipated remediation actions can be tracked and verified.
         Flaw remediation actions that can be tracked and verified include, for example, determining whether

          organizations follow US-CERT guidance and Information Assurance Vulnerability Alerts. Organization-
          defined time periods for updating security-relevant software and firmware may vary based on a variety of
          factors including, for example, the security category of the information system or the criticality of the
          update (i.e., severity of the vulnerability related to the discovered flaw). Some types of flaw remediation
          may require more testing than other types. Organizations determine the degree and type of testing needed
          for the specific type of flaw remediation activity under consideration and also the types of changes that are
          to be configuration-managed. In some situations, organizations may determine that the testing of software
          and/or firmware updates is not necessary or practical, for example, when implementing simple anti-virus
          signature updates. Organizations may also consider in testing decisions, whether security-relevant software
          or firmware updates are obtained from authorized sources with appropriate digital signatures. Relate

            occurring within the information system. Organizations can monitor information systems, for example, by
            observing audit activities in real time or by observing other system aspects such as access patterns,
            characteristics of access, and other actions. The monitoring objectives may guide determination of the
            events. Information system monitoring capability is achieved through a variety of tools and techniques
            (e.g., intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems, malicious code protection software,
            scanning tools, audit record monitoring software, network monitoring software). Strategic locations for
            monitoring devices include, for example, selected perimeter locations and near server farms supporting
            critical applications, with such devices typically being employed at the managed interfaces associated with
            controls SC-7 and AC-17. Einstein network monitoring devices from the Department of Homeland Security
            can also be included as monitoring devices. The granularity of monitoring information collected is based on
            organizational monitoring objectives and the capability of information systems to support such objectives.
            Specific types of transactions of interest include, for example, Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) traffic
            that bypasses HTTP proxies. Information system monitoring is an integral part of organizational continuous
            monitoring and incident response programs. Output from system monitoring serves as input to continuous
            monitoring and incident response programs. A network connection is any connection with a device that
            communicates through a network (e.g., local area network, Internet). A remote connection is any
            connection with a device communicating through an external network (e.g., the Internet). Local, network,
            and remote connections can be either wired or wireless. Relate control: AC-3, AC-4, AC-8, AC-17, AU-2,

SI-4 (17)        INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | INTEGRATED SITUATIONAL AWARENESS
                                                                               [BACK TO SCRM CONTROL]

                 The organization correlates information from monitoring physical, cyber, and supply chain
                 activities to achieve integrated, organization-wide situational awareness.
                 Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement correlates monitoring information from a more
                 diverse set of information sources to achieve integrated situational awareness. Integrated situational
                 awareness from a combination of physical, cyber, and supply chain monitoring activities enhances the
                 capability of organizations to more quickly detect sophisticated cyber attacks and investigate the
                 methods and techniques employed to carry out such attacks. In contrast to SI-4 (16) which correlates
                 the various cyber monitoring information, this control enhancement correlates monitoring beyond just
                 the cyber domain. Such monitoring may help reveal attacks on organizations that are operating across
                 multiple attack vectors. Related control: SA-12.

                 The organization implements [Assignment: organization-defined additional monitoring] of
                 individuals who have been identified by [Assignment: organization-defined sources] as posing an
                 increased level of risk.
                 Supplemental Guidance: Indications of increased risk from individuals can be obtained from a variety
                 of sources including, for example, human resource records, intelligence agencies, law enforcement
                 organizations, and/or other credible sources. The monitoring of individuals is closely coordinated with
                 management, legal, security, and human resources officials within organizations conducting such
                 monitoring and complies with federal legislation, Executive Orders, policies, directives, regulations,
                 and standards.

            c.    Disseminates security alerts, advisories, and directives to: [Selection (one or more): [Assignment:
                  organization-defined personnel or roles]; [Assignment: organization-defined elements within the
                  organization]; [Assignment: organization-defined external organizations]]; and
            d.    Implements security directives in accordance with established time frames, or notifies the issuing
                  organization of the degree of noncompliance.
            Supplemental Guidance: The United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) generates
            security alerts and advisories to maintain situational awareness across the federal government. Security
            directives are issued by OMB or other designated organizations with the responsibility and authority to
            issue such directives. Compliance to security directives is essential due to the critical nature of many of
            these directives and the potential immediate adverse effects on organizational operations and assets,
            individuals, other organizations, and the Nation should the directives not be implemented in a timely
            manner. External organizations include, for example, external mission/business partners, supply chain
            partners, external service providers, and other peer/supporting organizations. Related control: SI-2.

            Supplemental Guidance: Unauthorized changes to software, firmware, and information can occur due to errors
            or malicious activity (e.g., tampering). Software includes, for example, operating systems (with key internal
            components such as kernels, drivers), middleware, and applications. Firmware includes, for example, the
            Basic Input Output System (BIOS). Information includes metadata such as security attributes associated
            with information. State-of-the-practice integrity-checking mechanisms (e.g., parity checks, cyclical
            redundancy checks, cryptographic hashes) and associated tools can automatically monitor the integrity of

                  software products without accompanying source code from sources with limited or no warranty for
                  potential security impacts. The assessments address the fact that these types of software products may
                  be very difficult to review, repair, or extend, given that organizations, in most cases, do not have
                  access to the original source code, and there may be no owners who could make such repairs on behalf
                  of organizations. Related control: SA-5.

ICT SUPPLY CHAIN THREAT EVENTS
This appendix provides examples of ICT supply chain threat events. These examples are based on [NIST
SP 800-30 Rev. 1], Appendix E, Threat Events. Specifically, Tables E-2, Representative Examples –
Adversarial Threat Events, and E-3, Representative Examples – Non-Adversarial Threat Events, were
used to create the two corresponding tables in this document. It should be noted that the threat events in
NIST SP 800-30 Revision 1, Appendix E, are generic threat events for information security rather than for
ICT SCRM. The tables used as source material for this appendix contain 2 columns – Threat Events and
Description.

The generic threats in NIST SP 800-30 Revision 1, Appendix E, are at times quite broad and needed to be
further specified to be ICT supply chain-specific for use in this document. This document lists only those
threats events that are relevant to ICT supply chain in all or under some circumstances. A comment is
included in the third column, Comments, to provide the rationale for when the specific threat event is
relevant to the ICT supply chain or relevant under some, but not all, circumstances.

Organizations may use the examples of ICT supply chain threat events provided in this appendix during
threat analysis described in Chapter 2, if appropriate.

APPENDIX D

SUPPLY CHAIN THREAT SCENARIOS AND ANALYSIS
FRAMEWORK
There are numerous opportunities for vulnerabilities that impact the environment or the system/element to
be intentionally or unintentionally inserted, created, or exploited throughout the supply chain.
Exploitation of these vulnerabilities is known as supply chain threats. A Threat Scenario is a summary
of potential consequence(s) of the successful exploitation of a specific vulnerability or vulnerabilities
by a threat agent. Analyzing threat scenarios can help organizations to determine the likelihood and
impact a specific event or events would have on an organization and identify appropriate mitigating
strategies.

Threat scenarios are generally used in two ways:

        To translate the often disconnected information garnered from a risk assessment, such as
         described in [NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1] , into a more narrowly scoped and tangible, story-like
         situation for further evaluation. These stories can help organizations to discover dependencies and
         additional vulnerabilities requiring mitigation and used for training; and

        To determine the impact that the successful exercise of a specific vulnerability would have on the
         organization and identify the benefits of mitigating strategies.

Information garnered from these scenarios can be used to help identify areas requiring increased controls
and also for training purposes. The Threat Scenario analysis may be conducted in conjunction with or as
part of ongoing risk assessment processes. By performing an in-depth analysis of how a specific event
will impact an organization using a threat scenario, critical relationships and dependencies that might
otherwise be overlooked during an initial criticality analysis or risk assessment can become visible and
appropriate mitigating strategies employed.

A threat scenario analysis may mimic an organization’s ICT supply chain risk management process, as
described in Chapter 2 of this publication. However, because threat scenarios focus on very specific, often
hypothetical events, they should not be used to replace a holistic ICT supply chain risk assessment.
Rather, they should be used as a tool to further evaluate specific vulnerabilities or areas of concern. They
are often used during the “monitor” phase of the risk management process (described in chapter 2.2.4 of
this publication) as a means of identifying and evaluating potential changes. Due to the infinite number of
possible scenarios and directions into which a threat scenario can evolve, it is important to have a
structured approach with well-defined goals and scope.

This appendix provides an example of a generic threat scenario analysis framework for ICT SCRM that
can be used by organizations to develop a framework that best suits their needs. It contains four examples
of how this framework may be used. The examples differ slightly in their implementation of the
framework so as to show how the framework may be tailored. Each example identifies one or more
vulnerabilities, describes a specific threat source, identifies the expected impact on the organization, and
proposes SP 800-161 SCRM controls that would help mitigate the resulting risk.

DEVELOPING AND ANALYZING THREAT SCENARIOS & IDENTIFYING
   APPLICABLE CONTROLS

Step 1: Create a Plan for Developing and Analyzing Scenarios
     Identify the purpose of the threat scenario analysis in terms of the objectives, milestones, and
        expected deliverables;
     Identify the scope of organizational applicability, level of detail, and other constraints;
     Identify resources to be used, including personnel, time, and equipment; and
     Define a framework to be used for analyzing scenarios.

Step 2: Characterize the Environment
     Identify core mission/business processes and key organizational dependencies;
     Describe threat sources that are relevant to the organization. Include the motivation and resources
        available to the threat source, if applicable;
     List known vulnerabilities or areas of concern (Note: Examples of areas of concern include the
        planned outsourcing of a manufacturing plant, the pending termination of a maintenance contract,
        or the discontinued manufacture of an element.);
     Identify existing and planned controls;
     Identify related regulations, standards, policies, and procedures; and
     Define an acceptable level of risk (risk threshold) per organizational TTPs, system criticality, and
        a risk owners set of mission priorities. The level of risk or risk threshold can be constantly
        adjusted to reflect the elasticity of the global supply chain, organizational changes, and new
        mission priorities.

Step 3: Develop and Select Threat Event(s) for Analysis
     List possible ways threat sources could exploit known vulnerabilities or impact areas of concern
        to create a list of events (Note: Historical data is useful in determine this information.);
     Briefly outline the series of consequences that could occur as a result of each threat event. These
        may be as broad or specific as necessary. If applicable, estimate the likelihood and impact of each
        event;
     Eliminate those events that are clearly outside the defined purpose and scope of the analysis;
     Describe in more detail the remaining threat events. Include the tactics, techniques, and
        procedures used to carry out attacks (Note: The level of detail in the description is dependent on
        the needs of the organization.); and
     Select for analysis those events that best fit the defined purpose and scope of the analysis. More
        likely events, events of special concern, and an event that can represent several of the other listed
        events are generally useful candidates.

Step 4: Conduct the Threat Scenario Analysis
     For each threat event, note any immediate consequences of the event and identify those
        organizational units and processes that would be affected, taking into account existing and
        planned controls, and applicable regulations, standards, policies, and procedures;
     Estimate the impact these consequences would have on the mission/business processes as well as
        the organizational units affected, preferably in quantitative terms from historical data and taking
        into account existing and planned controls, and applicable regulations, standards, policies, and
        procedures (Note: It may be beneficial to identify a “most likely” impact level and a “worst-case”
        or “100-year” impact level.); and
     Identify those organizational units or processes that would be subsequently affected, the
        consequences and the impact levels, until each affected process has been analyzed, taking into


  APPENDIX D                                                                                            PAGE D-2
Special Publication 800-161                                 Supply Chain Risk Management Practices for Federal
                                                            Information Systems and Organizations
________________________________________________________________________________________________________

         account existing and planned controls, and applicable regulations, standards, policies, and
         procedures (e.g., If a critical server goes down, one of the first processes affected may be the
         technology support department, but if they determine a new part is needed to bring the server
         back up, the procurement department may become involved.).

Step 5: Determine Applicable Controls
     Determine if threat scenario events create a risk level that exceeds a risk owner’s acceptable level
        of risk (risk threshold). (Note: In some cases, the level of acceptable risk may be dependent on
        the cost of mitigating strategies.) Identify potential mitigating controls. Using a list of standard or
        recommended controls can make this process simpler. This appendix uses the controls in Chapter
        3 of NIST SP 800-161. Furthermore, factoring any available FedRAMP certifications for the
        organization and any other applicable recognized external assessments for system integrators,
        suppliers, and external service providers in the mitigating control identification process may
        eliminate duplicate resources without compromising the effectiveness of the resultant
        mitigation.);
     Estimate the effectiveness of those controls at reducing the risk of a scenario;
     Estimate the resources needed (in terms of money, personnel, time) to implement potential
        controls; and
     Identify those controls or combinations of controls that would cause the estimated residual risk of
        a threat event to drop to an acceptable level in the most resource-effective manner, taking into
        account any rules or regulations that may apply (Note: Consideration should be given to the
        potential that one control will help mitigate the risk from more than one event, or that a control
        may increase the risk of a separate event.).

Step 6: Evaluate / Feedback
     Develop a plan to implement the selected controls and evaluate their effectiveness; and
     Evaluate the effectiveness of the threat scenario analysis and make improvements as needed.

SAMPLE SCENARIOS

This appendix provides four example threat scenarios specific to the U.S. government using the generic
framework described above. The examples purposely vary in level of specificity and detail to show that
threat scenarios can be as broad or specific, as detailed or generic, as necessary. While these scenarios use
basic scoring measures (High, Moderate, Low) for likelihood, impact, and risk, organizations may use
any of a number of different units of measure (e.g., percentage, CVSS score, etc.). Additionally, these
scenarios vary slightly in implementation of the framework to show that the framework can be adapted as
needed.

SCENARIO 1: Telecommunications Counterfeits

Background:

A large organization has developed a system that is maintained through contract by an external
integration company. The system requires a common telecommunications element that is no longer
available from the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). The OEM has offered a newer product as a
replacement, but it would require modifications to the system at a cost of approximately $1 million. If the
element is not upgraded, the agency and system integrator would have to rely on secondary market
suppliers for replacements. The newer product provides no significant improvement on the element
currently being used.

The organization has decided to perform a threat scenario analysis to determine whether to modify the
system to accept the new product, or accept the risk of continuing to use a product that is no longer in
production.

Environment

The environment is characterized as follows:
    The system is expected to last ten more years without any major upgrades/modifications and has
       a 99.9 % uptime requirement.
    Over 1000 of the $200 elements are used throughout the system and approximately 10 % are
       replaced every year due to regular wear-and-tear, malfunctions, or other reasons. The integrator
       has approximately a three-month supply on hand at any time.
    The element is continuously monitored for functionality, and efficient procedures exist to reroute
       traffic and replace the element should it unexpectedly fail.
    Outages resulting from unexpected failure of the element are rare, localized, and last only a few
       minutes. More frequently, when an element fails, the system’s functionality is severely reduced
       for approximately one-to-four hours while the problem is diagnosed and fixed or the element
       replaced.
    Products such as the element in question have been a common target for counterfeiting.
    The integrator has policies restricting the purchase of counterfeit goods and a procedure to follow
       if a counterfeit is discovered [Ref. SA-19].
    The integrator and acquiring agency have limited testing procedures to ensure functionality of the
       element before acceptance [Ref. SA-12(7)].

________________________________________________________________________________________________________

To support the threat scenario, the agency created a fictitious threat source described as a group motivated
by profit with vast experience creating counterfeit solutions. The counterfeiter is able to make a high
profit margin by creating and selling as genuine, products that are visually identical to their genuine
counterparts but which use lower-quality materials. They have the resources to copy most trademark and
other identifying characteristics and insert counterfeits into a supply chain commonly used by the
organization with little to no risk of detection. The counterfeit product is appealing to unaware purchasing
authorities as it is generally offered at a discount - sold as excess inventory or as stockpile.

If an inferior quality element was inserted into the system, it would likely fail more often than expected,
causing reduced functionality of the system. In the event a large number of counterfeit products were
mixed in with genuine parts and integrated into the system randomly, the number and severity of
unexpected outages could grow significantly. The agency and integrator decided that the chances a
counterfeit product could be purchased to maintain the system and the estimated potential impact of such
an event were high enough to warrant further evaluation.

Threat Scenario Analysis

The person(s) purchasing the element from a supplier will be the first affected by a counterfeit product.
Policy dictates that they attempt to purchase a genuine product from vetted suppliers. This person will
have to be led to believe that the product is genuine. As the counterfeit product in question is visually
identical to the element desired, and at a discount, there is a high chance the counterfeit will be purchased.
One will be tested to ensure functionality, and then the items will be placed into storage.

When one of the elements in the system needs to be replaced, an engineer will install a counterfeit,
quickly test to ensure it is running properly, and record the change. It could take two years for the
counterfeit product to fail, so up to 200 counterfeit elements could be inserted into the system before the
first one fails. If all the regularly replaced elements are substituted for counterfeits and each counterfeit
fails after two years, the cost of the system would increase by $160,000 in ten years. The maintenance
time required would also cost the integration company in personnel and other expenses.

When a counterfeit fails, it will take approximately one-to-four hours to diagnose and replace the element.
During this time, productivity is severely reduced. If more than one of the elements fails at the same time,
the system could fail. This could cause significant damage to agency operations and violate the 99.9%
uptime requirements set forth in the contract. Plus, if it is determined that the element failed because it
was a counterfeit, there would be additional costs associated with reporting the counterfeit.

Mitigation Strategy:

The following were identified as potential mitigating activities (from NIST SP 800-161):

        Require developers to perform security testing/evaluation at all post‐design phases of the SDLC
         [Ref. SA-11];
        Validate that the information system or system component received is genuine and has not been
         altered [Ref. SA-12(10)];
        Incorporate security requirements into the design of information systems (security engineering)
         [Ref. PL-8, SC-36]; and
        Employ supplier diversity requirements [PL-8(2)].

Based on these controls, the agency was able to devise a strategy that would include:

________________________________________________________________________________________________________

        Acceptance testing: Examination of elements to ensure that they are new, genuine, and that all
         associated licenses are valid. Testing methods include, where appropriate: physical inspection by
         trained personnel using digital imaging, digital signature verification, serial/part number
         verification, and sample electrical testing;
        Increase security requirements into the design of the system by adding redundant elements along
         more critical paths (as determined by a criticality analysis) in order to minimize the impact of an
         element failure; and
        Search for alternative vetted suppliers/trusted components.

It was determined that this strategy would cost less than accepting the risk of allowing counterfeits into
the system or modifying the system to accept the upgraded element. The estimated cost for implementing
a more rigorous acquisition and testing program was $80,000; the cost for increasing security engineering
requirements was $100,000.

SCENARIO 2: Industrial Espionage

Background:

Harlow Inc., a semiconductor (SC) company used by the organization to produce military and aerospace
systems, is considering a partnership with a KXY Co. to leverage their fabrication facility. This would
represent a significant change in the supply chain related to a critical system element. A committee was
formed including representatives from the organization, Harlow Inc., and the integration company to help
identify the impact that the partnership would have on the organization and risk-appropriate mitigating
practices to enact when the partnership is completed.

Environment:

The systems of concern are vital to the safety of military and aerospace missions. While not classified, the
element that KXY would be expected to manufacture is unique, patented, and critical to the operational
status of the systems. Loss of availability of the element while the system is operational could have
significant, immediate impact across multiple agencies and the civilian populous, including loss of life
and millions of dollars in damages. An initial Risk Assessment was accomplished using [NIST SP 800-30
Rev. 1], and the existing level of risk for this is was given a score of “Moderate.”

KXY currently produces a state-of-the-art, low-cost wafer fabrication whose focus is primarily
commercial. The nation-state in which KXY operates has a history of conducting industrial espionage to
gain IP / technology. They have shown interest in semiconductor technology and provided a significant
grant to KXY to expand into the military and aerospace markets. While KXY does not currently have the
testing infrastructure to meet U.S. industry compliance requirements, the nation-state’s resources are
significant, including the ability to provide both concessions as well as incentives to help KXY meet
those requirements.

The key area of concern was that the nation-state in which KXY operates would be able to use its
influence to gain access to the element or the element’s design.

The committee reviewed current mitigation strategies in place and determined that Harlow, Inc., the
integration company, and the organization had several existing practices to ensure that the system and all
critical elements, as determined by a criticality analysis, met specific functionality requirements. For
example, the system and critical elements are determined compliant with relevant industry standards. As
part of their requirements under [NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 4], the agency had some information protection
requirements (Ref. PM-11). In addition, Harlow, Inc. had a sophisticated inventory tracking system that
required that most elements be uniquely tagged using RFID technology or otherwise identified for
traceability (Ref. SA-12(14)).


Threat Scenario:

Based on past experience, the organization decided that KXY’s host nation would likely perform one of
two actions if given access to the technology: sell it to interested parties or insert / identify vulnerabilities
for later exploitation. For either of these threat events to be successful, the host nation would have to
understand the purpose of the element and be given significant access to the element or element’s design.
This could be done with cooperation of KXY’s human resources department, through deception, or by
physical or electronic theft. Physical theft would be difficult given existing physical control requirements
and inventory control procedures. For a modified element to be purchased and integrated with the system,

  APPENDIX D                                                                                               PAGE D-9

________________________________________________________________________________________________________

it would need to pass various testing procedures at both the integrator and agency levels. Testing methods
currently implemented include radiographic examination, material analysis, electrical testing, and sample
accelerated life testing. Modifications to identification labels/schemes would need to be undetectable in a
basic examination. In addition, KXY would need to pass routine audits, which would check KXY’s
processes for ensuring the quality and functionality of the element.

The committee decided that, despite existing practices, there was a 30 % chance that the host nation
would have the motivation and ability to develop harmful modifications to the element without detection,
exploit previously unknown vulnerabilities, or provide the means for one of their allies to do the same.
This could result in a loss of availability or integrity of the system, causing significant harm. Using
information from an initial Risk Assessment accomplished using [NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1], the
committee identified this as the worst-case scenario with an impact score of “High.”

There is approximately a 40% chance that the host nation could and would sell the technology to
interested parties, resulting in a loss of technological superiority. If this scenario occurred, friendly
military and civilian lives could be at risk, intelligence operations would be damaged, and more money
would be required to invest in a new solution. The committee assigned an impact score for this scenario
of “Moderate.”

The committee determined that the overall combined risk score for the vulnerability of concern was
“High.”

Mitigating strategies:

Using NIST SP 800-161 as a base, three broad strategies were identified by the committee: (1) improve
traceability capabilities, (2) increase provenance and information requirements, and (3) choose another
supplier. These three options were analyzed in more detail to determine specific implementation
strategies, their impact on the scenarios, and their estimated cost to implement. (Specific technologies and
techniques are not described in this case, but would be useful in an actual threat scenario evaluation.)

Improve traceability and monitoring capabilities.

Impact = 80 % decrease

Based on this analysis, the committee decided to implement a combination of practices:
    Develop and require unique, difficult-to-copy labels or alter labels to discourage cloning or
       modification of the component [Ref. SA-12(5)];
    Minimize the amount of information that is shared to suppliers. Require that the information be
       secured [Ref. AC-21]; and
    Require provenance be kept and updated throughout the SDLC [Ref. PV-1].

With this combination of controls, the estimated residual risk was determined to be equivalent with the
existing risk without the partnership at a cost increase that is less than if the organization changed
suppliers.

SCENARIO 3: Malicious Code Insertion

Background:

An organization has decided to perform a threat scenario analysis on a traffic control system. The
scenario is to focus on software vulnerabilities and should provide general recommendations regarding
mitigating practices.

Environment:

The system runs nearly automatically and uses computers running a commonly available operating
system along with centralized servers. The software was created in-house and is regularly maintained and
updated by an integration company on contract for the next five years. The integration company is large,
frequently used by the organization in a variety of projects, and has significant resources to ensure that the
system maintains its high availability and integrity requirements.

Threats to the system could include: loss of power to the system, loss of functionality, or loss of integrity
causing incorrect commands to be processed. Some threat sources could include nature, malicious
outsiders, and malicious insiders. The system is equipped with certain safety controls such as backup
generator power, redundancy of design, and contingency plans if the system fails.

Threat Event:

The organization decided that the most concerning threat event would be if a malicious insider were to
compromise the integrity of the system. Possible attacks included that the threat actor could insert a worm
or a virus into the system, reducing its ability to function, or they could manually control the system from
one of the central servers or by creating a back-door in the server to be accessed remotely. Depending on
the skillfulness of the attack, an insider could gain control of the system, override certain fail-safes, and
cause significant damage.

Based on this information, the organization developed the following fictitious threat event to be analyzed:

         John Poindexter, a disgruntled employee of the integration company, decides to insert some
         open source malware into a component of the system. He then resigns from the firm, leaving no
         traceability of his work. The malware has the ability to call home to John and provides him
         access to stop or allow network traffic at any or all 50 of the transportation stations. As a
         result, there would be unpredictable, difficult-to-diagnose disruptions, causing significant
         monetary losses and safety concerns.

After a Risk Assessment was accomplished using [NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1], management has decided
that the acceptable level of risk for this scenario is “Moderate.”

Threat Scenario Analysis:

If John were successful, a potential course of events would be as follows:

         John conducts a trial run – shutting off the services of one station for a short time. It would be
         discounted as a fluke and have minimal impact. Later, John would create increasingly frequent
         disruptions at various stations. These disruptions would cause anger among employees and
         customers and some safety concerns. The integration company would be made aware of problem

  APPENDIX D                                                                                            PAGE D-13

________________________________________________________________________________________________________

         and begin to investigate the cause. They would create a work-around, assuming there was a bug
         in the system. However, because the malicious code would be buried and difficult to identify, the
         integration company wouldn’t discover it. John would then create a major disruption across
         several transportation systems at once. The work-around created by the integration company
         would fail due to the size of the attack, and all transportation services would be halted. Travelers
         would be severely impacted, and the media alerted. The method of attack would be identified and
         the system modified to prevent John from accessing the system again. However, the underlying
         malicious code would remain. Revenue would decrease significantly for several months. Legal
         questions would be raised. Resources would be invested in assuring the public that the system
         was safe.

Mitigating Practices:

The organization identified the following as potential areas for improvement:

        Establish and retain identification of supply chain elements, processes, and actors [SA-12(14)];
        Control access and configuration changes within the SDLC and require periodic code reviews
         [AC-1, AC-2, CM-3];
        Require static code testing [SA-14]; and
        Incident Response Handling [IR-4].

SCENARIO 4: Unintentional Compromise

Background:

Uninformed insiders replace components with more cost-efficient solutions without understanding the
implications to performance, safety, and long-term costs.

An organization has concerns about its acquisition policies and has decided to conduct a threat scenario
analysis to identify applicable mitigating practices. Any practices selected must be applicable to a variety
of projects and have significant success within a year.

Environment:

The agency acquires many different systems with varying degrees of requirements. Because of the
complexity of the environment, agency officials decided that they should use a scenario based on an
actual past event.

Threat Event:

Using an actual event as a basis, the agency designed the following threat event narrative:

         Gill, a newly hired program manager, is tasked with reducing the cost of a $5 million system
         being purchased to support complex research applications in a unique physical environment. The
         system would be responsible for relaying information regarding temperature, humidity, and toxic
         chemical detection as well as for storing and analyzing various data sets. There must not be any
         unscheduled outages more than 10 seconds long, or there will be serious safety concerns and
         potential destruction of research. The agency’s threat assessment committee determined that the
         acceptable level of risk for this type of event has a score of 2/10.

         Gill sees that a number of components in the system design are priced high compared with similar
         components he has purchased in the commercial acquisition space. Gill asks John, a junior
         engineer with the integration company, to replace several load balancer / routers in the system
         design to save costs.

Threat Scenario Analysis:

The agency decided that there were three potential outcomes to the scenario:
   1. It is determined that the modifications are inadequate before any are purchased (30 % chance, no
       impact);
   2. It is determined that the modifications are inadequate during testing (40 % chance, low impact);
       or
   3. The inadequacy of the modifications is undetected, the routers are installed in the system, begin
       to fail, and create denial of service incidents (30 % chance, high impact).


Mitigating strategies:

Three potential mitigating strategies were identified:
    Improve the existing training program [Ref. AT-1] and add configuration management controls to
       monitor all proposed changes to critical systems [Ref. CM-1];

  APPENDIX D                                                                                           PAGE D-16

                                                           Information Systems and Organizations
________________________________________________________________________________________________________

        Improve the testing requirements [Ref. SA-11]; and
        Require redundancy and heterogeneity in the design of systems [Ref. SC-29, SC-36].

Adding configuration management controls would increase the likelihood that the modifications are
rejected either at the initial stage or during testing, but it was determined that a $200,000 investment in
training alone could not bring the level of risk to an acceptable level in the time required.

Improving the testing requirements would increase the likelihood that the modifications are rejected
during testing, but it was determined that no amount of testing alone could bring the level of risk to an
acceptable level.

Requiring redundancy and heterogeneity in the design of the system would significantly reduce the
impact of this and other events of concern, but could double the cost of a project. In this scenario, it was
determined that an investment of $2 million would be required to bring the risk to an acceptable level.

As a result of this analysis, the agency decided to implement a combination of practices:
     A mandatory, day-long training program for those handling the acquisition of critical systems and
        adding configuration management controls requiring changes be approved by a configuration
        management board (CMB) ($80,000 initial investment);
     $60,000 investment in testing equipment and software for critical systems and elements; and
     Redundancy and diversity of design requirements as deemed appropriate for each project.

It was determined that this combination provided a series of practices that would be most cost-effective
for a variety of projects and would also help mitigate the risk from a variety of threats.

APPENDIX E

ICT SCRM PLAN TEMPLATE
The following template is an example of the sections and the type of information that organizations
should include in their ICT SCRM plans. Guidance for specific Tiers is provided, where applicable.

Agencies should have at least one ICT SCRM plan. Depending on their governance structure and size,
agencies can have multiple ICT SCRM plans, one for Tier 1, several for Tier 2, and several for Tier 3.24
Regardless of the total number of plans, the ICT SCRM requirements and controls at the higher tiers will
flow down to the lower tiers and should be used to guide the development of the lower tier ICT SCRM
plans. Conversely, the ICT SCRM controls and requirements at the lower tiers should be considered in
developing and revising requirements and controls applied at the higher tiers.

ICT SCRM controls in the ICT SCRM plan can be applied in different life cycle processes, for example,
the incident response (IR) control can be applied in both the Infrastructure Management life cycle process
and the Operations life cycle process. Figure H-2 lists [ISO/IEC 15288] life cycle processes.

When addressing security concerns within an ICT SCRM plan, agencies may choose to integrate their
Tier 3 ICT SCRM controls into the applicable System Security plans or create individual ICT SCRM
plans for Tier 3 that reference corresponding System Security plans.

ICT SCRM plans should cover the full SDLC of ICT systems and programs, including research and
development, design, manufacturing, acquisition, delivery, integration, operations, and
disposal/retirement. The ICT SCRM plan activities should be integrated into the organization’s system
and software life cycle processes to ensure that ICT SCRM activities are integrated into those processes.
Similar controls in the ICT SCRM plan can be applied in more than one life cycle process. Figure H-2
shows how the ICT SCRM plan activities can be integrated into various example life cycles.

These ICT SCRM plans should include as attachments relevant agreements provided by system
integrators, suppliers, and external service providers as part of the contracting process.25 It is expected
that these agreements will be mostly attached at Tier 3 ICT SCRM plans, but they may also be attached to
Tier 1 and Tier 2 ICT SCRM plans for acquisitions that span multiple systems. Review and update ICT
SCRM plans on a schedule that includes life cycle milestones or gate reviews and significant contracting

1      INTRODUCTION

Describe the purpose of the ICT SCRM plan. Tier 1 and 2 ICT SCRM plans may need to be derived in
whole or in part from existing policies or other guidance. Tier 3 plans may be closely tied to system
security plans (SSPs).

For all tiers, provide a general statement that conveys the intent of the organizational leadership to adhere
to the plan, enforce its controls, and ensure that it remains current.

1.1       Purpose and Scope

Include: agency name, tier for which this plan applies.

For Tier 1, list all Tier 2 ICT SCRM plans within the scope of the Tier 1 ICT SCRM plan. (This list is an
attachment to the ICT SCRM plan. In the event of organizational changes, it would be preferable to make
changes to the Tier 1 attachment than to each individual System Security plan.) For Tier 1, describe the
scope of the applicable organization to which this ICT SCRM plan applies.

For Tier 2:
     List a unique identifier given to the mission/business. This may be names of acquisition
        programs, IT acquisition (e.g., listed in applicable OMB Exhibit 300), or any other designator that
        describes the scope of the ICT SCRM plan at Tier 2.
     Provide a brief explanation of what this mission/business encompasses, including a high-level
        summary of systems within the scope of this ICT SCRM plan.
     List all Tier 3 ICT SCRM plans and/or System Security plans within the scope of this Tier 2 ICT
        SCRM plan.

For Tier 3, if creating a separate ICT SCRM plan, include a unique identifier and name given to the
system. (For consideration: List all essential supporting systems and interfaces (such as network
infrastructure) and their relevant SCRM data from their ICT SCRM plans if such a plan exists. This
provides the opportunity for the agency to find missing, overlapping, and redundant controls. Most, if not
all supporting systems will require as a minimum, replacements, supplies, and upgrades.)

1.2       Authority

Include: Authorities and references to relevant agency documents such as policies, strategic plan(s),
acquisition guidelines, processes, procedures, etc. Policies may include ICT SCRM policy, security
policy, acquisition policy, or any other policy applicable in the context of this ICT SCRM plan.

For Tier 2, include applicable Tier 1 ICT SCRM plan title.

For Tier 3, include applicable Tier 1 and Tier 2 ICT SCRM plan titles.

1.3       Audience

For all three tiers, include any agency organizational units that should be active participants or interested
parties in this ICT SCRM plan and that should be using it to inform their activities. These may include
legal, acquisition, IT security, supply chain and logistics, human resources, finance, etc., and specific
individual roles such as CISO, procurement personnel, program managers, etc., as appropriate.

________________________________________________________________________________________________________

4.1       Communicating ICT SCRM Plan

Describe the processes by which this ICT SCRM plan will be communicated to other Tiers to ensure that
ICT supply chain interdependencies are addressed. Examples include:

         Posting on appropriate agency portal(s);
         Communicating via email;
         Briefing appropriate individuals including those responsible for addressing deficiencies; and
         Including information contained in the ICT SCRM plan in applicable training and outreach
          materials.

4.2       Revision and Improvement

Tier 1 and 2 ICT SCRM plans should be reviewed at a minimum on an annual basis since changes to
laws, policies, standards, guidelines, and controls are dynamic and evolving. As a minimum, review and
update Tier 3 ICT SCRM plans at life cycle milestones, gate reviews, and significant contracting
activities, and verify for compliance with upper tier plans as appropriate.

State the required frequency for ICT SCRM plan reviews to consider updates.

Define criteria that would trigger ICT SCRM plan revisions. This may include:

         Change of authorities that apply to the ICT SCRM plan;
         Change of policies that apply to the ICT SCRM plan;
         Significant ICT SCRM events;
         Introduction of new technologies;
         Shortcomings in the ICT SCRM plan;
         For Tiers 2 and 3, change of governing ICT SCRM plan for the Tiers above;
         Change of scope; and
         Other agency-specific criteria.

If deemed helpful, ICT SCRM plan owners can use the ICT SCRM plan of Action and Milestones
(POAM) to assess the impact of the changes and guide ICT SCRM plan revisions and to ensure that the
updated plan does not leave a gap in coverage from the previous version. Describe the ICT SCRM
POA&M process and resolution steps.

4.3 Implementing and Assessing Effectiveness of ICT SCRM Plans

Agencies should use their ICT SCRM plans during the budgeting and planning process, particularly with
respect to acquisition and procurement activities. This includes the operations staff procuring
replacement parts and ancillary services that may not be aware of the potential ICT supply chain risks
associated with such procurements without following applicable ICT SCRM plans. Each tier’s ICT SCRM

plan should describe ICT supply chain risk management monitoring and enforcement activities (including
auditing if appropriate) applicable to the scope of each specific plan.

If appropriate, ICT SCRM plan owners may decide to use qualitative or quantitative measures to support
implementation of the plan and to assess effectiveness of this implementation. 26 If measures are used, they
should be stated in the plan.

Contractor and supplier-provided plans, associated with Tier 3 systems, should be included if such plans
are part of contractual agreements. Figure H-3 depicts an example process flow for implementing agency
ICT SCRM plan(s).

A useful approach to implementing the SCRM plan is to ensure that the various activities are mapped and
tracked as part of an SDLC. This ensures full coverage of SCRM activities since these activities may
requires repeating and reintegrating (using spiral or agile techniques) which is a common effort in an
SDLC. SCRM plan activities are necessarily needed as early as in the concept and R&D steps of an
SDLC and certainly continue into the various SDLC steps including development, production, utilization,
support, and retirement steps.

There are a number of SDLCs that have been described by various entities. And each organization may
have its own variant that may have been defined and is currently implemented. What is important is the
general understanding and definition of the various SCRM plan activities and how they are mapped in the
agency-specific SDLC.

To provide some guidance on how SCRM activities can be mapped to an SDLC, three example SDLCs
are provided with SCRM plan activities mapped (see figure H-2). These SDLCs are from NIST, DHS, and
an example SDLC described in ISO/IEC15288. These SDLCs and the mapping are provided only as an
example and should be used as a guideline for agency-specific SCRM plan implementation. We are not
endorsing or recommending any one SDLC.



Use of the following paragraphs is optional. Agencies should decide whether to use them depending on
mission criticality, applicable threats, and other factors per agency determination.

4.4      Use of ICT SCRM Plan during Contingencies and Emergencies

In the event of contingency or emergency operations, the agency may need to bypass normal acquisition
processes to allow for mission continuity. Contracting activities that are not vetted using approved ICT
SCRM plan processes introduce unknown risk to the organization.

When appropriate at Tier 1, 2, or 3, describe abbreviated acquisition procedures to follow during
contingencies and emergencies, such as the contact information for ICT SCRM subject matter experts
who can provide advice absent a formal tasking and approval chain of command.

For Tier 1, describe agency procedures and waiver processes.
For Tier 2, describe mission/business procedures and waiver processes in addition to Tier 1.
For Tier 3, describe system-specific procedures and waiver processes in addition to Tiers 1 and 2.

                         evaluations and provide mitigation techniques to customers

                         network security posture. The Blue Team identifies security
                         threats and risks in the operating environment, and in
                         cooperation with the customer, analyzes the network
                         environment and its current state of security readiness. Based
                         on the Blue Team findings and expertise, they provide
                         recommendations that integrate into an overall community
                         security solution to increase the customer's cyber security
                         readiness posture. Often times a Blue Team is employed by
