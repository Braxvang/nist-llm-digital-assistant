                        Reports on Computer Systems Technology

The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical
leadership for the nation’s measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops tests, test
methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance the
development and productive use of information technology. ITL’s responsibilities include the
development of management, administrative, technical, and physical standards and guidelines for
the cost-effective security and privacy of other than national security-related information in
federal information systems. The Special Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research,
guidelines, and outreach efforts in information system security, and its collaborative activities
with industry, government, and academic organizations.


                                            Abstract

This publication provides a set of procedures for conducting assessments of security controls and
privacy controls employed within federal information systems and organizations. The assessment
procedures, executed at various phases of the system development life cycle, are consistent with
the security and privacy controls in NIST Special Publication 800-53, Revision 4. The procedures
are customizable and can be easily tailored to provide organizations with the needed flexibility to
conduct security control assessments and privacy control assessments that support organizational
risk management processes and that are aligned with the stated risk tolerance of the organization.
Information on building effective security assessment plans and privacy assessment plans is also
provided along with guidance on analyzing assessment results.

                       ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES FOR PRIVACY CONTROLS
      Appendix J, Privacy Assessment Procedures, is a new addition to NIST Special Publication 800-
      53A. The appendix, when completed, will provide a complete set of assessment procedures for
      the privacy controls in NIST Special Publication 800-53, Appendix J. The new privacy control
      assessment procedures are under development and will be added to the appendix after a
      thorough public review and vetting process. The terminology throughout this publication has
      been updated to include references to privacy in all aspects of the assessment process to
      include mirroring the artifacts that are essential inputs to the current security authorization
      process. Each organization employing these guidelines has the flexibility to address the privacy
      assessment process and the integration of privacy-related artifacts into the organization’s risk
      management processes in the manner that best supports the organizational missions and
      business objectives consist with Office of Management and Budget policies.
      Standardized assessment procedures for privacy controls provide a more disciplined and
      structured approach for determining compliance to federal privacy requirements and also
      promote more cost-effective methods to determine such compliance. There will be a strong
      similarity in the structure of the assessment procedures for privacy controls in Appendix J and
      the assessment procedures for security controls in Appendix F. This similarity will promote
      closer cooperation between privacy and security officials within the federal government to
      help achieve the objectives of senior leaders/executives in enforcing the requirements in
      federal privacy legislation, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance.
      Finally, it should be noted that as the assessment procedures for privacy controls are added to
      Appendix J, certain terminology traditionally associated with security controls and security
      control assessments contained in earlier versions of this publication is being modified where
      appropriate, to include references to privacy. However, there are some security-related terms
      (e.g., security categorization, security control baseline, tailored security control baseline) that
      are unique to security controls and do not have direct analogs in the privacy arena. In such
      cases, the equivalent privacy-related terminology has not been added to the publication.
      Privacy officials, at their discretion, may choose to adopt any or all of the security-related
      terms in this publication in support of privacy control assessments.

                              ASSESSMENT PROCEDURE FORMATTING
     A new format for assessment procedures is introduced in this revision to Special Publication
     800-53A. The format reflects the decomposition of assessment objectives into more granular
     determination statements wherever possible—thus providing the capability to identify and
     assess specific parts of security and privacy controls. The changes have been initiated to: (i)
     help improve the readability of assessment procedures; (ii) provide a better format and
     structure for automated tools when assessment information is imported into such tools; (iii)
     provide greater flexibility in conducting assessments by giving organizations the capability to
     target certain aspects of security controls and privacy controls (highlighting the particular
     weaknesses and/or deficiencies in controls); (iv) improve the efficiency of security and privacy
     assessments; and (v) support continuous monitoring and ongoing authorization programs by
     providing a greater number of component parts of security and privacy controls that can be
     assessed at organization-defined frequencies and degrees of rigor. Having the ability to apply
     assessment and monitoring resources in a targeted and precise manner and simultaneously
     maximize the use of automation technologies, can result in more timely and cost-effective
     assessment processes for organizations.
     Note: Special Publication 800-53 will be updated accordingly to ensure that the numbering
     scheme for all security and privacy controls is consistent with the new format introduced in
     this publication.

                                    ALIGNING REVISION NUMBERS
                       WHAT HAPPENED TO SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-53A REVISIONS 2 AND 3?

     Revision numbers between NIST Special Publications 800-53 and 800-53A were misaligned
     from the start because the initial publication of SP 800-53A did not occur until after the
     publication of SP 800-53, Revision 2. When SP 800-53, Revision 3 was published, SP 800-53A
     was updated to Revision 1 for consistency with the updates to SP 800-53. This revision number
     mismatch created ongoing uncertainty and confusion regarding which revision of SP 800-53
     was consistent with which revision of SP 800-53A. To reduce this uncertainty going forward,
     revision numbers 2 and 3 have been skipped for SP 800-53A, and this version of SP 800-53A
     has been given revision number 4 since this version is consistent with the updates to SP 800-
     53, Revision 4. Future revisions of SPs 800-53 and 800-53A will maintain the revision number
     consistency.

                 DEVELOPING COMMON INFORMATION SECURITY FOUNDATIONS
                              COLLABORATION AMONG PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR ENTITIES

      In developing standards and guidelines required by FISMA, NIST consults with other federal
      agencies and offices as well as the private sector entities to improve information security,
      avoid unnecessary and costly duplication of effort, and ensure that NIST publications are
      complementary with the standards and guidelines employed for the protection of national
      security systems. In addition to its comprehensive public review and vetting process, NIST is
      collaborating with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), the Department of
      Defense (DoD), and the Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS) to establish a unified
      framework and common foundation for information security across the federal government. A
      common foundation and framework for information security will provide the Intelligence,
      Defense, and Civilian sectors of the federal government and their contractors, more uniform
      and consistent ways to manage the risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals,
      other organizations, and the Nation that results from the operation and use of information
      systems. A common foundation and framework will also provide a strong basis for reciprocal
      acceptance of security authorization decisions and facilitate information sharing. NIST is also
      working with public and private sector entities to establish specific mappings and relationships
      between the security standards and guidelines developed by NIST and the International
      Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).

                                                     Foreword

Security control assessments and privacy control assessments are not about checklists, simple
pass-fail results, or generating paperwork to pass inspections or audits—rather, such assessments
are the principal vehicle used to verify that implemented security controls and privacy controls
are meeting their stated goals and objectives. Special Publication 800-53A, Assessing Security
and Privacy Controls in Federal Information Systems and Organizations, is written to facilitate
security control assessments and privacy control assessments conducted within an effective risk
management framework. The control assessment results provide organizational officials with:
•      Evidence about the effectiveness of implemented controls;
•      An indication of the quality of the risk management processes employed within the
       organization; and
•      Information about the strengths and weaknesses of information systems which are supporting
       organizational missions and business functions in a global environment of sophisticated and
       changing threats.

The findings produced by assessors are used to determine the overall effectiveness of security and
privacy controls associated with information systems (including system-specific, common, and
hybrid controls) and their environments of operation and to provide credible and meaningful
inputs to the organization’s risk management process. A well-executed assessment helps to: (i)
determine the validity of the controls contained in the organization’s security plans and privacy
plans and subsequently employed in organizational information systems and environments of
operation; and (ii) facilitate a cost-effective approach to correcting weaknesses or deficiencies in
systems in an orderly and disciplined manner consistent with organizational mission/business
needs.

Special Publication 800-53A is a companion guideline to Special Publication 800-53, Security
and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations. Each publication
provides guidance for implementing specific steps in the Risk Management Framework (RMF). 1
Special Publication 800-53 covers Step 2 in the RMF, security and privacy control selection (i.e.,
determining what controls are needed to manage risks to organizational operations and assets,
individuals, other organizations, and the Nation). Special Publication 800-53A covers RMF Step
4, Assess, and RMF Step 6, Monitor, and provides guidance on the security assessment and
privacy assessment processes. This guidance includes how to build effective assessment plans
and how to analyze and manage assessment results.

Special Publication 800-53A allows organizations to tailor the basic assessment procedures
provided. The concepts of tailoring used in this document are similar to the concepts described in
Special Publication 800-53. Tailoring involves customizing the assessment procedures to more
closely match the characteristics of the information system and its environment of operation. The
tailoring process gives organizations the flexibility needed to avoid assessment approaches that
are unnecessarily complex or costly while simultaneously meeting the assessment requirements
established by applying the fundamental concepts in the RMF. Tailoring can also include adding
assessment procedures or assessment details to adequately meet the risk management needs of the
organization (e.g., adding system/platform-specific information for selected controls). Tailoring
decisions are left to the discretion of the organization in order to maximize the flexibility in

developing assessment plans—applying the results of risk assessments to determine the extent,
rigor, and level of intensity of the assessments. While flexibility continues to be an important
factor in developing security assessment plans and privacy assessment plans, consistency of
assessments is also an important consideration. A major design objective for Special Publication
800-53A is to provide an assessment framework and initial starting point for assessment
procedures that are essential for achieving such consistency.

NIST initiated the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) 2 project that supports the
approach for achieving consistent, cost-effective security control assessments. The primary
purpose of SCAP is to standardize the format and nomenclature used for communicating
information about configurations and security flaws. This standardization enables automated
system configuration assessment, vulnerability assessment, patch checking, as well as report
aggregation and interoperability between SCAP-enabled security products. As a result, SCAP
enables organizations to identify and reduce vulnerabilities associated with products that are not
patched or insecurely configured. SCAP also includes the Open Checklist Interactive Language
(OCIL) 3 specification that provides the capability to express the determination statements in the
assessment procedures in Appendix F in a framework that will establish interoperability with the
SCAP-enabled tools. Privacy control assessments are discussed separately in Appendix J to this
publication.




2
 Special Publication 800-126 provides guidance on the technical specification of SCAP. Additional details on the
SCAP initiative, as well as freely available SCAP reference data, can be found at http://nvd.nist.gov.
3
  OCIL is a framework for expressing security checks that cannot be evaluated without some human interaction or
feedback. It is used to determine the state of a system by presenting one or more questionnaires to its intended users.
The language includes constructs for questions, instructions for guiding users towards an answer, responses to
questions, artifacts, and evaluation results.

CHAPTER ONE

INTRODUCTION
THE NEED TO ASSESS SECURITY AND PRIVACY CONTROL EFFECTIVENESS




T      oday’s information systems 4 are complex assemblages of technology (i.e., hardware,
       software, and firmware), processes, and people, working together to provide organizations
       with the capability to process, store, and transmit information in a timely manner to
support various missions and business functions. The degree to which organizations have come to
depend upon these information systems to conduct routine, important, and critical missions and
business functions means that the protection of the underlying systems and environments of
operation is paramount to the success of the organization. The selection of appropriate security
and privacy controls for an information system is an important task that can have significant
implications on the operations and assets of an organization as well as the welfare of individuals. 5
Security and privacy controls are the safeguards or countermeasures prescribed for an information
system or an organization designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its
information.

Once employed within an information system, security and privacy controls are assessed to
provide the information necessary to determine their overall effectiveness, that is, the extent to
which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired
outcome with respect to meeting the security and privacy requirements for the system and the
organization. Understanding the overall effectiveness of implemented security and privacy
controls is essential in determining the risk to the organization’s operations and assets, to
individuals, to other organizations, and to the Nation resulting from the use of the system.

1.1 PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY
The purpose of this publication is to provide: (i) guidelines for building effective security
assessment plans and privacy assessment plans; and (ii) a comprehensive set of procedures for
assessing the effectiveness of security controls and privacy controls employed in information
systems and organizations supporting the executive agencies of the federal government. The
guidelines apply to the security and privacy controls defined in Special Publication 800-53 (as
amended), Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations.
The guidelines have been developed to help achieve more secure information systems within the
federal government by:
•    Enabling more consistent, comparable, and repeatable assessments of security controls and
     privacy controls with reproducible results;
•    Promoting a better understanding of the risks to organizational operations, organizational
     assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation resulting from the operation and use
     of federal information systems;


4
  An information system is a discrete set of information resources organized expressly for the collection, processing,
maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of information.
5
 When selecting security controls and privacy controls for an information system, the organization also considers
potential impacts to other organizations and, in accordance with the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 and Homeland
Security Presidential Directives, potential national-level impacts.



CHAPTER 1                                                                                                         PAGE 1

•    Facilitating more cost-effective assessments of security controls and privacy controls
     contributing to the determination of overall control effectiveness; and
•    Creating more complete, reliable, and trustworthy information for organizational officials to
     support risk management decisions, reciprocity of assessment results, information sharing,
     and compliance to federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, and policies.

This publication satisfies the requirements of the Federal Information Security Management Act
(FISMA) and meets or exceeds the information security and privacy requirements established for
executive agencies 6 by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in Circular A-130,
Appendix I, Federal Agency Responsibilities for Maintaining Records About Individuals, and
Appendix III, Security of Federal Automated Information Resources. The security guidelines in
this publication are applicable to federal information systems other than those systems designated
as national security systems as defined in 44 U.S.C., Section 3542. The guidelines have been
broadly developed from a technical perspective to complement similar guidelines for national
security systems and may be used for such systems with the approval of appropriate federal
officials exercising policy authority over such systems. The guidelines in Appendix J may have
broader applicability, depending upon organizational authorities and missions. State, local, and
tribal governments, as well as private sector organizations are encouraged to consider using these
guidelines, as appropriate. 7

Organizations use this publication in conjunction with approved security plans and privacy plans
in developing viable assessment plans for producing and compiling the information necessary to
determine the effectiveness of the security and privacy controls employed in the information
system and organization. This publication has been developed with the intention of enabling
organizations to tailor the basic assessment procedures provided. The assessment procedures are
used as a starting point for and as input to the assessment plan. In developing effective security
assessment plans and privacy assessment plans, organizations take into consideration existing
information about the controls to be assessed (e.g., results from organizational assessments of
risk, platform-specific dependencies in the hardware, software, or firmware, and any assessment
procedures needed as a result of organization-specific controls not included in Special Publication
800-53). 8

The selection of appropriate assessment procedures and the rigor, intensity, and scope of the
assessment depend on three factors:


6
  An executive agency is: (i) an executive department specified in 5 U.S.C., Section 101; (ii) a military department
specified in 5 U.S.C., Section 102; (iii) an independent establishment as defined in 5 U.S.C., Section 104(1); and (iv) a
wholly owned government corporation fully subject to the provisions of 31 U.S.C., Chapter 91. In this publication, the
term executive agency is synonymous with the term federal agency.
7
  In accordance with the provisions of FISMA and OMB policy, whenever the interconnection of federal information
systems to information systems operated by state/local/tribal governments, contractors, or grantees involves the
processing, storage, or transmission of federal information, the information security standards and guidelines described
in this publication apply. Specific information security requirements and the terms and conditions of the system
interconnections, are expressed in the Memoranda of Understanding and Interconnection Security Agreements
established by participating organizations.
8
  For example, detailed test scripts may need to be developed for the specific operating system, network component,
middleware, or application employed within the information system to adequately assess certain characteristics of a
particular security or privacy control. Such test scripts are at a lower level of detail than provided by the assessment
procedures contained in Appendices F and J and are therefore beyond the scope of this publication. Additional details
for assessments are provided in the supporting assessment cases described in Appendix H.



CHAPTER 1                                                                                                          PAGE 2

•    The security categorization of the information system; 9
•    The assurance requirements that the organization intends to meet in determining the overall
     effectiveness of the security and privacy controls; and
•    The security and privacy controls from Special Publication 800-53 as identified in the
     approved security plans and privacy plans. 10

The assessment process is an information-gathering activity, not a security- or privacy-producing
activity. Organizations determine the most cost-effective implementation of this key element in
the organization’s information security and privacy programs by applying the results of risk
assessments, considering the maturity and quality level of the organization’s risk management
processes, and taking advantage of the flexibility in the concepts described in this publication.
The use of Special Publication 800-53A as a starting point in the process of defining procedures
for assessing the security and privacy controls in information systems and organizations,
promotes a consistent level of security and privacy and offers the needed flexibility to customize
the assessment based on organizational policies and requirements, known threat and vulnerability
information, operational considerations, information system and platform dependencies, and
tolerance for risk. 11 The information produced during control assessments can be used by an
organization to:
•    Identify potential problems or shortfalls in the organization’s implementation of the Risk
     Management Framework;
•    Identify security- and privacy-related weaknesses and deficiencies in the information system
     and in the environment in which the system operates;
•    Prioritize risk mitigation decisions and associated risk mitigation activities;
•    Confirm that identified security- and privacy-related weaknesses and deficiencies in the
     information system and in the environment of operation have been addressed;
•    Support monitoring activities and information security and privacy situational awareness;
•    Facilitate security authorization decisions, privacy authorization decisions, and ongoing
     authorization decisions; and
•    Inform budgetary decisions and the capital investment process.

Organizations are not expected to employ all of the assessment methods and assessment objects
contained within the assessment procedures identified in this publication for the associated
security and privacy controls deployed within or inherited by organizational information systems.
Rather, organizations have the inherent flexibility to determine the level of effort needed and the
assurance required for a particular assessment (e.g., which assessment methods and assessment
objects are deemed to be the most useful in obtaining the desired results). This determination is

9
  For national security systems, security categorization is accomplished in accordance with CNSS Instruction 1253.
For other than national security systems, security categorization is accomplished in accordance with Federal
Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 199 and NIST Special Publication 800-60.
10
   The security and privacy controls for the information system and organization are documented in the security plans
and privacy plans after the initial selection and tailoring of the controls as described in NIST Special Publication 800-
53 and CNSS Instruction 1253.
11
   In this publication, the term risk is used to mean risk to organizational operations (i.e., mission, functions, image, and
reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.

made on the basis of what will accomplish the assessment objectives in the most cost-effective
manner and with sufficient confidence to support the subsequent determination of the resulting
mission or business risk. Organizations should balance the resources expended on the deployment
of security and privacy controls (i.e., safeguards and countermeasures implemented for security
and privacy protection) versus the resources expended to determine overall control effectiveness,
both initially and on an ongoing basis through continuous monitoring programs.

1.2 TARGET AUDIENCE
This publication is intended to serve a diverse group of information system, information security,
and privacy professionals including:
•    Individuals with information system development responsibilities (e.g., program managers,
     system designers and developers, systems integrators, information security engineers);
•    Individuals with information security assessment and monitoring responsibilities (e.g.,
     Inspectors General, system evaluators, assessors, independent verifiers/validators, auditors,
     analysts, information system owners, common control providers);
•    Individuals with information system, security, privacy, and risk management and oversight
     responsibilities (e.g., authorizing officials, chief information officers, senior information
     security officers,12 senior agency officials for privacy/chief privacy officers, information
     system managers, information security managers); and
•    Individuals with information security implementation and operational responsibilities (e.g.,
     information system owners, common control providers, information owners/stewards,
     mission/business owners, systems administrators, information system security officers).

1.3 RELATED PUBLICATIONS AND ASSESSMENT PROCESSES
Special Publication 800-53A is designed to support Special Publication 800-37, Guide for
Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems: A Security Life
Cycle Approach. In particular, the assessment procedures contained in this publication and the
guidelines provided for developing security and privacy assessment plans for organizational
information systems directly support the assessment and monitoring activities that are integral to
the risk management process. This includes providing near real-time security- and privacy-related
information to organizational officials regarding the ongoing security and privacy state of their
systems and organizations.

Organizations are encouraged, whenever possible, to take advantage of the assessment results and
associated assessment documentation and evidence available on information system components
from previous assessments including independent third-party testing, evaluation, and validation. 13
Product testing, evaluation, and validation may be conducted on cryptographic modules and
general-purpose information technology products such as operating systems, database systems,
firewalls, intrusion detection devices, Web browsers, Web applications, smart cards, biometrics

12
   At the agency level, this position is known as the Senior Agency Information Security Officer. Organizations may
also refer to this position as the Senior Information Security Officer or the Chief Information Security Officer.
13
   Assessment results can be obtained from many activities that occur routinely during the system development life
cycle. For example, assessment results are produced during the testing and evaluation of new information system
components during system upgrades or system integration activities. Organizations can take advantage of previous
assessment results whenever possible, to reduce the overall cost of assessments and to make the assessment process
more efficient.

devices, personal identity verification devices, network devices, and hardware platforms using
national and international standards. If an information system component product is identified as
providing support for the implementation of a particular security or privacy control in Special
Publication 800-53, then evidence produced during the product testing, evaluation, and validation
processes (e.g., security specifications, analyses and test results, validation reports, and validation
certificates) 14 is used to the extent that it is applicable. This evidence can be combined with the
assessment-related evidence obtained from the application of the assessment procedures in this
publication, to cost-effectively produce the information necessary to determine whether the
security and privacy controls are effective in their application.

what security and privacy controls are implemented by the product; (ii) if those security and privacy controls meet the
intended control requirements of the information system under assessment; (iii) if the configuration of the product and
the environment in which the product operates are consistent with the environmental and product configuration stated
by the vendor and/or developer; and (iv) if the assurance requirements stated in the developer/vendor specification
satisfy the assurance requirements for assessing those controls. Meeting the above criteria provides a sound rationale
that the product is suitable and meets the intended security and privacy control requirements of the information system
under assessment.

CHAPTER TWO

THE FUNDAMENTALS
BASIC CONCEPTS ASSOCIATED WITH SECURITY AND PRIVACY CONTROL ASSESSMENTS




T      his chapter describes the basic concepts associated with assessing the security and privacy
       controls in organizational information systems and the environments in which those
       systems operate including: (i) the integration of assessments into the system development
life cycle; (ii) the importance of an organization-wide strategy for conducting assessments; (iii)
the development of effective assurance cases to help increase the grounds for confidence in the
effectiveness of security and privacy controls; and (iv) the format and content of assessment
procedures. While flexibility continues to be an important factor in developing assessment plans,
consistency of assessments is also an important consideration. A fundamental design objective for
Special Publication 800-53A is to provide an assessment framework and a starting point for
assessment procedures that are essential for achieving such consistency.

2.1 ASSESSMENTS WITHIN THE SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE
Security and privacy assessments can be effectively carried out at various stages in the system
development life cycle 15 to increase the grounds for confidence that the security and privacy
controls employed within or inherited by an information system are effective in their application.
This publication provides a comprehensive set of assessment procedures to support security and
privacy assessment activities throughout the system development life cycle. For example, security
assessments are routinely conducted by system developers and system integrators during the
development/acquisition and implementation phases of the life cycle. Privacy assessments are
conducted by senior agency officials for privacy/privacy officers and privacy staff in these early
life cycle phases as well. This helps to ensure that the required security and privacy controls for
the system are properly designed and developed, correctly implemented, and consistent with the
established organizational information security architecture before the system enters the
operations and maintenance phase. Security assessments in the initial system development life
cycle phases include, for example, design and code reviews, application scanning, and regression
testing. Privacy assessments include reviews to ensure that applicable privacy laws and policies
are adhered to and that privacy protections are embedded in system design. Security-related and
privacy-related weaknesses and deficiencies identified early in the system development life cycle
can be resolved more quickly and in a much more cost-effective manner before proceeding to
subsequent phases in the life cycle. The objective is to identify the security and privacy controls
early in the life cycle to ensure that the system design and testing validate the implementation of
these controls. The assessment procedures described in Appendices F and J support assessments
carried out during the initial stages of the system development life cycle.

Security and privacy assessments are also conducted during the operations and maintenance
phase of the life cycle to ensure that security and privacy controls continue to be effective in the
operational environment and can protect against constantly evolving threats. Security assessments
are typically conducted by information system owners, common control providers, information
system security officers, independent assessors, auditors, and Inspectors General. Privacy
assessments are typically conducted by senior agency officials for privacy/privacy officers and

15
   There are typically five phases in a generic system development life cycle: (i) initiation; (ii) development/acquisition;
(iii) implementation; (iv) operations and maintenance; and (v) disposition (disposal). Special Publication 800-64
provides guidance on security considerations in the system development life cycle.



CHAPTER 2                                                                                                            PAGE 6

privacy staff. For example, organizations assess all security controls and privacy controls
employed within and inherited by the information system during the initial security authorization.
Subsequent to the initial authorization, the organization assesses all implemented security
controls on an ongoing basis in accordance with its Information Security Continuous Monitoring
strategy. 16 Privacy controls are also assessed on an ongoing basis to ensure compliance with
applicable privacy laws and policies. The ongoing assessment and monitoring of security controls
and privacy controls use the assessment procedures defined in this publication. The frequency of
such assessments and monitoring is determined by the organization and/or information system
owner or common control provider and approved by the authorizing official. Finally, at the end of
the life cycle, security assessments are conducted to ensure that important organizational
information is purged from the information system prior to disposal. Privacy assessments are also
conducted to ensure adherence to organizational retention schedules.

2.2 STRATEGY FOR CONDUCTING CONTROL ASSESSMENTS
Organizations are encouraged to develop a broad-based, organization-wide strategy for
conducting security and privacy assessments, facilitating more cost-effective and consistent
assessments across the inventory of information systems. An organization-wide strategy begins
by applying the initial steps of the Risk Management Framework to all information systems
within the organization, with an organizational view of the security categorization process and the
security and privacy control selection process (including the identification of common controls).
Categorizing information systems as an organization-wide activity taking into consideration not
only the criticality and sensitivity of information but also the enterprise architecture and the
information security architecture helps to ensure that the individual systems are categorized based
on the mission and business objectives of the organization. 17 Maximizing the number of common
controls employed within an organization: (i) significantly reduces the cost of development,
implementation, and assessment of security and privacy controls; (ii) allows organizations to
centralize and automate control assessments and to amortize the cost of those assessments across
all information systems organization-wide; and (iii) increases the consistency of security and
privacy controls. An organization-wide approach to identifying common controls early in the
application of the RMF facilitates a more global strategy for assessing those controls and sharing
essential assessment results with information system owners and authorizing officials. The
sharing of assessment results among key organizational officials across information system
boundaries has many important benefits including:
•      Providing the capability to review assessment results for all information systems and to make
       mission/business-related decisions on risk mitigation activities according to organizational
       priorities, the security categorization of the information systems, and risk assessments;
•      Providing a more global view of systemic weaknesses and deficiencies occurring in
       information systems across the organization and an opportunity to develop organization-wide
       solutions to information security and privacy problems; and
•      Increasing the organization’s knowledge base regarding threats, vulnerabilities, and strategies
       for more cost-effective solutions to common information security and privacy problems.

Organizations can also promote a more focused and cost-effective assessment process by: (i)
developing more specific assessment procedures that are tailored for their specific environments

16
     Special Publications 800-37 and 800-137 provide guidance on the continuous monitoring of security controls.
17
     Privacy controls are selected and implemented irrespective of the security categorization of the information system.



CHAPTER 2                                                                                                           PAGE 7

of operation and requirements (instead of relegating these tasks to each control assessor or
assessment team); and (ii) providing organization-wide tools, templates, and techniques to
support more consistent assessments throughout the organization. 18

The conduct of security control assessments is the primary responsibility of information system
owners and common control providers with oversight by their respective authorizing officials.
The conduct of privacy control assessments is the primary responsibility of senior agency
officials for privacy/chief privacy officers and privacy staff. There is also significant involvement
in the assessment process by other parties within the organization who have a vested interest in
the outcome of assessments. Other interested parties include, for example, mission/business
owners, information owners/stewards (when those roles are filled by someone other than the
information system owner), information security personnel, and designated privacy staff. It is
imperative that information system owners and common control providers coordinate with the
other parties in the organization having an interest in control assessments to help ensure that the
organization’s core missions and business functions are adequately addressed in the selection of
security and privacy controls to be assessed.



                                              CAUTIONARY NOTE
      Organizations should carefully consider the potential impacts of employing the assessment
      procedures defined in this Special Publication when assessing the security and privacy controls
      in operational systems. Certain assessment procedures, particularly those procedures that
      directly impact the operation or function of the hardware, software, or firmware components
      of an information system, may inadvertently affect the routine processing, transmission, or
      storage of information supporting organizational missions or business functions. For example, a
      critical information system component may be taken offline for assessment purposes or a
      component may suffer a fault or failure during the assessment process. Organizations should
      also take the necessary precautions to ensure that organizational missions and business
      functions continue to be supported by information systems and that any potential impacts to
      operational effectiveness resulting from assessment activities are considered in advance.




2.3 BUILDING AN EFFECTIVE ASSURANCE CASE
Building an effective assurance case 19 for security and privacy control effectiveness is a process
that involves: (i) compiling evidence from a variety of activities conducted during the system
development life cycle that the controls employed in the information system are implemented
correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the
security and privacy requirements of the system and the organization; and (ii) presenting this

18
  Organizations may also provide security assessment plans including tailored assessment procedures to external
service providers that are operating information systems on behalf of those organizations. In addition, these plans can
recommend supporting templates, tools, and techniques and also be further tailored specific to the contract with the
service provider, helping to make assessments more consistent and to maximize reuse of assessment-related artifacts.
This reuse can improve security through uniformity and reduce/eliminate contracting ambiguity, resulting in reduced
costs and risk to the organization.
19
  An assurance case is a body of evidence organized into an argument demonstrating that some claim about an
information system holds (i.e., is assured). An assurance case is needed when it is important to show that a system
exhibits some complex property such as safety, security, or reliability.



CHAPTER 2                                                                                                         PAGE 8

evidence in a manner that decision makers are able to use effectively in making risk-based
decisions about the operation or use of the system. The evidence described above comes from the
implementation of the security and privacy controls in the information system and inherited by
the system (i.e., common controls) and from the assessments of that implementation. Ideally, the
assessor is building on previously developed materials that started with the specification of the
organization’s information security and privacy needs and was further developed during the
design, development, and implementation of the information system. These materials, developed
while implementing security and privacy throughout the life cycle of the information system,
provide the initial evidence for an assurance case.

Assessors obtain the required evidence during the assessment process to allow the appropriate
organizational officials to make objective determinations about the effectiveness of the security
and privacy controls and the overall security and privacy state of the information system. The
assessment evidence needed to make such determinations can be obtained from a variety of
sources including, for example, information technology product and system assessments and, in
the case of privacy assessments, privacy compliance documentation such as Privacy Impact
Assessments and Privacy Act System of Record Notices. Product assessments (also known as
product testing, evaluation, and validation) are typically conducted by independent, third-party
testing organizations. These assessments examine the security and privacy functions of products
and established configuration settings. Assessments can be conducted to demonstrate compliance
to industry, national, or international information security standards, privacy standards embodied
in applicable laws and policies, and developer/vendor claims. Since many information technology
products are assessed by commercial testing organizations and then subsequently deployed in
millions of information systems, these types of assessments can be carried out at a greater level of
depth and provide deeper insights into the security and privacy capabilities of the particular
products.

System assessments are typically conducted by information systems developers, systems
integrators, information system owners, common control providers, assessors, auditors, Inspectors
General, and the information security and privacy staffs of organizations. The assessors or
assessment teams bring together available information about the information system such as the
results from individual component product assessments, if available, and conduct additional
system-level assessments using a variety of methods and techniques. System assessments are
used to compile and evaluate the evidence needed by organizational officials to determine how
effective the security and privacy controls employed in the information system are likely to be in
mitigating risks to organizational operations and assets, to individuals, to other organizations, and
to the Nation. The results of assessments conducted using information system-specific and
organization-specific assessment procedures derived from the guidelines in this publication
contribute to compiling the necessary evidence to determine security and privacy control
effectiveness in accordance with the assurance requirements documented in the security and
privacy plans.

2.4 ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES
An assessment procedure consists of a set of assessment objectives, each with an associated set of
potential assessment methods and assessment objects. An assessment objective includes a set of
determination statements related to the particular security or privacy control under assessment.
The determination statements are linked to the content of the security or privacy control (i.e., the
security/privacy control functionality) to ensure traceability of assessment results back to the
fundamental control requirements. The application of an assessment procedure to a security or



CHAPTER 2                                                                                              PAGE 9

________________________________________________________________________________________________

privacy control produces assessment findings. These findings reflect, or are subsequently used, to
help determine the overall effectiveness of the security or privacy control.

Assessment objects identify the specific items being assessed and include specifications,
mechanisms, activities, and individuals. Specifications are the document-based artifacts (e.g.,
policies, procedures, plans, system security and privacy requirements, functional specifications,
architectural designs) associated with an information system. Mechanisms are the specific
hardware, software, or firmware safeguards and countermeasures employed within an information
system. 20 Activities are the specific protection-related actions supporting an information system
that involve people (e.g., conducting system backup operations, monitoring network traffic,
exercising a contingency plan). Individuals, or groups of individuals, are people applying the
specifications, mechanisms, or activities described above.

Assessment methods define the nature of the assessor actions and include examine, interview, and
test. The examine method is the process of reviewing, inspecting, observing, studying, or
analyzing one or more assessment objects (i.e., specifications, mechanisms, or activities). The
purpose of the examine method is to facilitate assessor understanding, achieve clarification, or
obtain evidence. The interview method is the process of holding discussions with individuals or
groups of individuals within an organization to once again, facilitate assessor understanding,
achieve clarification, or obtain evidence. The test method is the process of exercising one or more
assessment objects (i.e., activities or mechanisms) under specified conditions to compare actual
with expected behavior. In all three assessment methods, the results are used in making specific
determinations called for in the determination statements and thereby achieving the objectives for
the assessment procedure. A complete description of assessment methods and assessment objects
is provided in Appendix D.

Assessment methods have a set of associated attributes, depth and coverage, which help define
the level of effort for the assessment. These attributes are hierarchical in nature, providing the
means to define the rigor and scope of the assessment for the increased assurances that may be
needed for some information systems. The depth attribute addresses the rigor of and level of
detail in the examination, interview, and testing processes. Values for the depth attribute include
basic, focused, and comprehensive. The coverage attribute addresses the scope or breadth of the
examination, interview, and testing processes including the number and type of specifications,
mechanisms, and activities to be examined or tested, and the number and types of individuals to
be interviewed. Similar to the depth attribute, values for the coverage attribute include basic,
focused, and comprehensive. The appropriate depth and coverage attribute values for a particular
assessment method are based on the assurance requirements specified by the organization. 21 As
assurance requirements increase with regard to the development, implementation, and operation
of security and privacy controls within or inherited by the information system, the rigor and scope
of the assessment activities (as reflected in the selection of assessment methods and objects and
the assignment of depth and coverage attribute values) tend to increase as well. Appendix D
provides a detailed description of assessment method attributes and attribute values.




20
  Mechanisms also include physical protection devices associated with an information system (e.g., locks, keypads,
security cameras, fire protection devices, fireproof safes, etc.).
21
   For other than national security systems, organizations meet minimum assurance requirements specified in Special
Publication 800-53, Appendix E.

                                       recovery point objectives as specified in the information system
                                       contingency plan, to conduct backups of user-level information
                                       contained in the information system;

              CP-9(c)    CP-9(c)[1]    defines a frequency, consistent with recovery time objectives and
                                       recovery point objectives as specified in the information system
                                       contingency plan, to conduct backups of information system
                                       documentation including security-related documentation;
                         CP-9(c)[2]    conducts backups of information system documentation, including
                                       security-related documentation, with the organization-defined
                                       frequency; and
              CP-9(d)    protects the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of backup information at
                         storage locations.
              POTENTIAL ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS:
              Examine: [SELECT FROM: Contingency planning policy; procedures addressing information system
                       backup; contingency plan; backup storage location(s); information system backup logs or
                       records; other relevant documents or records].
              Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information system backup responsibilities;
                         organizational personnel with information security responsibilities].
              Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for conducting information system backups; automated
                    mechanisms supporting and/or implementing information system backups].

                        FIGURE 1: ASSESSMENT PROCEDURE FOR SECURITY CONTROL

The assessment objectives are numbered sequentially, first in accordance with the numbering
scheme in Special Publication 800-53, and subsequently, where necessary to further apportion the
security or privacy control requirements to facilitate assessment, bracketed sequential numbers
or letters, as opposed to parentheses, are used to make that distinction (e.g., CP-9(a), CP-9(a)[1],
CP-9(a)[2], CP-9(b)[1], CP-9(b)[2], CP-9(c)[1], CP-9(c)[2], CP-9(d), etc.). The initial bracketed
character is always a number. For some controls, the column with the initial control designation
(e.g., CP-9, CP-9(a), CP-9(b), and CP-9(c) in Figure 1) is simply a placeholder to help facilitate
apportioning the control while maintaining the formatting scheme. Although not explicitly noted
with each identified assessment method in the assessment procedure, the attribute values of depth

and coverage described in Appendix D are assigned by the organization and applied by the
assessor/assessment team in the execution of the assessment method against an assessment object.

If the control has any enhancements (as designated by sequential parenthetical numbers, for
example, CP-9 (3) for the third enhancement for CP-9), assessment objectives are developed for
each enhancement using the same process as for the base control. The resulting assessment
objectives are numbered sequentially in the same way as the assessment procedure for the base
control, first in accordance with the numbering scheme in Special Publication 800-53, and
subsequently, using bracketed sequential numbers or letters to further apportion control
enhancement requirements to facilitate assessments (e.g., CP-9(3)[1], CP-9(3)[2]). Figure 2
illustrates an example of an assessment procedure developed to assess the effectiveness of the
third enhancement to security control CP-9.

                                              separate facility; or
                              CP-9(3)[1][b]   defines critical information system software and other security-
                                              related information requiring backup copies to be stored in a
                                              fire-rated container that is not collocated with the operational
                                              system; and
              CP-9(3)[2]      stores backup copies of organization-defined critical information system
                              software and other security-related information in a separate facility or in a
                              fire-rated container that is not collocated with the operational system.
              POTENTIAL ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS:
              Examine: [SELECT FROM: Contingency planning policy; procedures addressing information system
                       backup; contingency plan; backup storage location(s); information system backup
                       configurations and associated documentation; information system backup logs or records;
                       other relevant documents or records].
              Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with contingency planning and plan implementation
                         responsibilities; organizational personnel with information system backup responsibilities;
                         organizational personnel with information security responsibilities].

              FIGURE 2: ASSESSMENT PROCEDURE FOR SECURITY CONTROL ENHANCEMENT

Recall that numbers in parentheses immediately after the base control designation (as in Figure 2)
indicate the number of the control enhancement while letters in parentheses immediately after the
base control designation (as in Figure 1) indicate division of the base control into separate control
requirements. When further division of a control is necessary to support assessment, bracketed
characters that alternate between numbers and letters (e.g., CP-9(3)[1][a], CP-9(3)[1][b]) are used
with the initial bracketed character always being a number whether it follows a parenthetical
letter (base control) or number (control enhancement).

The Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) supports the assessment process for security
controls and facilitates more efficient and cost-effective assessments. SCAP is a collection of
related specifications for automating the collection and representation of evidence in a standards-
based format that enables interoperability between SCAP-enabled tools. The SCAP specifications
define the formats by which assessment criteria, also called SCAP content, can be exchanged and

provided to assessment tools. This content can be used to automate the collection and evaluation
of evidence sourced from both machine- and human-oriented artifacts. SCAP also defines formats
that capture and enable the exchange of results of collecting and evaluating artifacts. Typically,
machine-oriented artifacts that can be collected and evaluated using SCAP pertain to mechanisms
(e.g., configuration settings, installed hardware/software, operational state of countermeasures).
Additionally, human-oriented artifacts, such as those that pertain to specifications and activities,
can be collected using the Open Checklist Interactive Language (OCIL). OCIL is an SCAP
component specification that enables the collection and representation of interview data in a
standards-based format. The content-driven nature of SCAP-enabled automation solutions can
support flexible and consistent assessment of security and privacy controls.

CHAPTER THREE

THE PROCESS
CONDUCTING EFFECTIVE SECURITY AND PRIVACY CONTROL ASSESSMENTS




T       his chapter describes the process of assessing the security and privacy controls in
        organizational information systems and environments of operation including: (i) the
        activities carried out by organizations and assessors to prepare for security and privacy
control assessments; (ii) the development of security and privacy assessment plans; (iii) the
conduct of control assessments and the analysis, documentation, and reporting of assessment
results; and (iv) post-assessment report analysis and follow-on activities.

3.1 PREPARING FOR SECURITY AND PRIVACY CONTROL ASSESSMENTS
Conducting security control assessments and privacy control assessments in today’s complex
environment of sophisticated information technology infrastructures and high-visibility, mission-
critical applications can be difficult, challenging, and resource-intensive. Security and privacy
control assessments may be conducted by different organizational entities with distinct oversight
responsibilities. However, success requires the cooperation and collaboration among all parties
having a vested interest in the organization’s information security or privacy posture, including
information system owners, common control providers, authorizing officials, chief information
officers, senior information security officers, senior agency officials for privacy/chief privacy
officers, chief executive officers/heads of agencies, security and privacy staffs, Inspectors
General, and OMB. Establishing an appropriate set of expectations before, during, and after an
assessment is paramount to achieving an acceptable outcome—that is, producing information
necessary to help the authorizing official make a credible, risk-based decision on whether to place
the information system into operation or continue its operation.

Thorough preparation by the organization and the assessors is an important aspect of conducting
effective security control assessments and privacy control assessments. Preparatory activities
address a range of issues relating to the cost, schedule, and performance of the assessment. From
the organizational perspective, preparing for a security or privacy control assessment includes the
following key activities:
•    Ensuring that appropriate policies covering security and privacy control assessments,
     respectively, are in place and understood by all affected organizational elements;
•    Ensuring that all steps in the RMF 22 prior to the security or privacy control assessment step,
     have been successfully completed and received appropriate management oversight; 23
•    Establishing the objective and scope of assessments (i.e., the purpose of the assessments and
     what is being assessed);

22
   While the RMF can be employed for privacy controls (see Special Publication 800-53, Appendix J), privacy control
selection is conducted irrespective of the security categories of organizational information systems.
23
   Conducting security control assessments in parallel with the development/acquisition and implementation phases of
the life cycle permits the identification of weaknesses and deficiencies early and provides the most cost-effective
method for initiating corrective actions. Issues found during these assessments can be referred to authorizing officials
for early resolution, as appropriate. The results of security control assessments carried out during system development
and implementation can also be used (consistent with reuse criteria) during the security authorization process to avoid
system fielding delays or costly repetition of assessments.

________________________________________________________________________________________________

•    Ensuring that security and privacy controls identified as common controls (and the common
     portion of hybrid controls) have been assigned to appropriate organizational entities (i.e.,
     common control providers) for development and implementation; 24
•    Notifying key organizational officials of impending assessments and allocating necessary
     resources to carry out the assessments;
•    Establishing appropriate communication channels among organizational officials having an
     interest in the assessments; 25
•    Establishing time frames for completing the assessments and key milestone decision points
     required by the organization to effectively manage the assessments;
•    Identifying and selecting competent assessors/assessment teams that will be responsible for
     conducting the assessments, considering issues of assessor independence;
•    Collecting artifacts to provide to the assessors/assessment teams (e.g., policies, procedures,
     plans, specifications, designs, records, administrator/operator manuals, information system
     documentation, interconnection agreements, previous assessment results, legal requirements);
     and
•    Establishing a mechanism between the organization and the assessors and/or assessment
     teams to minimize ambiguities or misunderstandings about the implementation of security or
     privacy controls and security/privacy control weaknesses/deficiencies identified during the
     assessments.

Security and privacy control assessors/assessment teams begin preparing for their respective
assessments by:
•    Obtaining a general understanding of the organization’s operations (including mission,
     functions, and business processes) and how the information system that is the subject of the
     particular assessment supports those organizational operations;
•    Obtaining an understanding of the structure of the information system (i.e., system
     architecture) and the security or privacy controls being assessed (including system-specific,
     hybrid, and common controls);
•    Identifying the organizational entities responsible for the development and implementation of
     the common controls (or the common portion of hybrid controls) supporting the information
     system;
•    Meeting with appropriate organizational officials to ensure common understanding for
     assessment objectives and the proposed rigor and scope of the assessment;
•    Obtaining artifacts needed for the assessment (e.g., policies, procedures, plans, specifications,
     designs, records, administrator and operator manuals, information system documentation,
     interconnection agreements, previous assessment results);

24
  Security control assessments and privacy control assessments include common controls that are the responsibility of
organizational entities other than the information system owner inheriting the controls or hybrid controls where there is
shared responsibility among the system (or program) owner and designated organizational entities.
25
   Depending upon whether security controls or privacy controls are being assessed, these individuals typically include
authorizing officials, information system (or program) owners, common control providers, mission/business owners,
information owners/stewards, chief information officers, senior information security officers, senior agency officials
for privacy/chief privacy officers, privacy staff, Inspectors General, information system security officers, users from
organizations that the information system supports, and assessors.



CHAPTER 3                                                                                                        PAGE 15

________________________________________________________________________________________________

•    Establishing appropriate organizational points of contact needed to carry out the assessments;
•    Obtaining previous assessment results that may be appropriately reused for the current
     assessment (e.g., Inspector General reports, audits, vulnerability scans, physical security
     inspections, prior security or privacy assessments, developmental testing and evaluation,
     vendor flaw remediation activities, ISO/IEC 15408 [Common Criteria] evaluations); and
•    Developing security and privacy assessment plans which may be integrated into one plan or
     developed separately.

In preparation for the assessment of security or privacy controls, the necessary background
information is assembled and made available to the assessors or assessment team. 26 To the extent
necessary to support the specific assessment, and depending upon whether security controls or
privacy controls are being assessed, the organization identifies and arranges access to: (i)
elements of the organization responsible for developing, documenting, disseminating, reviewing,
and updating all security or privacy policies and associated procedures for implementing policy-
compliant controls; (ii) the security or privacy policies for the information system and any
associated implementing procedures; (iii) individuals or groups responsible for the development,
implementation, operation, and maintenance of security or privacy controls; (iv) any materials
(e.g., security or privacy plans, records, schedules, assessment reports, after-action reports,
agreements, authorization packages) associated with the implementation and operation of the
security or privacy controls to be assessed; and (v) the specific objects to be assessed. 27 The
availability of essential documentation as well as access to key organizational personnel and the
information system being assessed are paramount to a successful assessment.

Organizations consider both the technical expertise and level of independence required in
selecting security or privacy control assessors. Organizations ensure that assessors possess the
required skills and technical expertise to successfully carry out assessments of system-specific,
hybrid, and common controls. 28 This includes knowledge of and experience with the specific
hardware, software, and firmware components employed by the organization. An independent
assessor is any individual capable of conducting an impartial assessment of security and privacy
controls employed within or inherited by an information system. Impartiality implies that security
control assessors and privacy control assessors are free from any perceived or actual conflicts of
interest with respect to the development, operation, and/or management of the information system
or the determination of security or privacy control effectiveness. 29 The authorizing official or
designated representative determines the required level of independence for assessors based on
the results of the security categorization process for the information system (in the case of
security control assessments) and the risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals,
other organizations, and the Nation. The authorizing official determines if the level of assessor
independence is sufficient to provide confidence that the assessment results produced are sound


26
  Information system (or program) owners and organizational entities developing, implementing, and/or administering
common controls (i.e., common control providers) are responsible for providing needed information to assessors.
27
   In situations where there are multiple security or privacy assessments ongoing or planned within an organization,
access to organizational elements, individuals, and artifacts supporting the assessments is centrally managed by the
organization to ensure a cost-effective use of time and resources.
28
  The National Cybersecurity Workforce Framework provides information about skill sets and technical expertise
needed by security or privacy control assessors. See www.niccs.us-cert.gov/training/tc/framework.
29
   Contracted assessment services are considered independent if the information system (or program) owner is not
directly involved in the contracting process or cannot unduly influence the independence of the assessor(s) conducting
the assessment of the security or privacy controls.



CHAPTER 3                                                                                                       PAGE 16

and can be used to make a risk-based decision on whether to place the information system into
operation or continue its operation.

Independent security and privacy control assessment services can be obtained from other
elements within the organization or can be contracted to a public or private sector entity outside
of the organization. In special situations, for example when the organization that owns the
information system is small or the organizational structure requires that the security or privacy
control assessment be accomplished by individuals that are in the developmental, operational,
and/or management chain of the system owner, independence in the assessment process can be
achieved by ensuring that the assessment results are carefully reviewed and analyzed by an
independent team of experts to validate the completeness, consistency, and veracity of the
results. 30

3.2 DEVELOPING SECURITY AND PRIVACY ASSESSMENT PLANS
The security assessment plan and privacy assessment plan provide the objectives for the security
and privacy control assessments, respectively, and a detailed roadmap of how to conduct such
assessments. These plans may be developed as one integrated plan or as distinct plans, depending
upon organizational needs. The following steps are considered by assessors in developing plans to
assess the security or privacy controls in organizational information systems or inherited by those
systems:
•    Determine which security and privacy controls/control enhancements are to be included in
     assessments based upon the contents of the security plan and privacy plan and the purpose
     and scope of the assessments;
•    Select the appropriate assessment procedures to be used during assessments based on the
     security or privacy controls and control enhancements to be included in the assessments;
•    Tailor the selected assessment procedures (e.g., select appropriate assessment methods and
     objects, assign depth and coverage attribute values);
•    Develop additional assessment procedures to address any security requirements or privacy
     requirements or controls that are not sufficiently covered by Special Publication 800-53;
•    Optimize the assessment procedures to reduce duplication of effort (e.g., sequencing and
     consolidating assessment procedures) and provide cost-effective assessment solutions; and
•    Finalize assessment plans and obtain the necessary approvals to execute the plans.

3.2.1 Determine which security or privacy controls are to be assessed.
The security plan and privacy plan provide an overview of the security and privacy requirements,
respectively, for the information system and organization and describe the security controls and
privacy controls in place or planned for meeting those requirements. The assessor starts with the
security or privacy controls described in the security or privacy plan and considers the purpose of
the assessment. A security or privacy control assessment can be a complete assessment of all
controls in the information system or inherited by the system (e.g., during an initial security or
privacy authorization process) or a partial assessment of the controls in the information system or
inherited by the system (e.g., during system development as part of a targeted assessment

30
   The authorizing official consults with the Office of the Inspector General, the senior information security officer,
senior agency officials for privacy/chief privacy officers, and the chief information officer, as appropriate, to discuss
the implications of any decisions on assessor independence in the types of special circumstances described above.



CHAPTER 3                                                                                                           PAGE 17

resulting from changes affecting specific controls, or where controls were previously assessed
and the results accepted in the reciprocity process).

For partial assessments, information system owners and common control providers collaborate
with organizational officials having an interest in the assessment (e.g., senior information security
officers, senior agency officials for privacy/chief privacy officers, mission/information owners,
Inspectors General, and authorizing officials) to determine which security or privacy controls are
to be assessed. The determination of the controls to be assessed depends on the purpose of the
assessment. For example, during the initial phases of the system development life cycle, specific
controls may be selected for assessment to promote early detection of weakness and deficiencies
and a more cost-effective approach to risk mitigation. After the initial authorization to operate has
been granted, targeted assessments may need to be conducted when changes are made to the
system, specific security or privacy controls, or to the environment of operation. In such cases,
the focus for the assessment is on the security or privacy controls that may have been affected by
the change.

3.2.2 Select procedures to assess the security or privacy controls.
Special Publication 800-53A provides assessment procedures for each security and privacy
control and control enhancement in Special Publication 800-53. For each security or privacy
control in the security plan and privacy plan to be included in the assessment, assessors select the
corresponding assessment procedure from Appendix F (security assessment procedures) or
Appendix J (privacy assessment procedures). The selected assessment procedures can vary from
assessment to assessment based on the current content of the security plans and privacy plans and
the purpose of the assessment (e.g., complete assessment, partial assessment).

3.2.3 Tailor assessment procedures.
In a similar manner to how the security controls and privacy controls from Special Publication
800-53 are tailored for the organization’s mission, business functions, characteristics of the
information system, and operating environment, organizations tailor the assessment procedures
listed in Appendices F and J to meet specific organizational needs. Organizations have the
flexibility to perform the tailoring process at the organization level for all information systems, at
the individual information-system level, or using a combination of organization-level and system-
specific approaches. Security control assessors and privacy control assessors determine if the
organization provides additional tailoring guidance prior to initiating the tailoring process.
Assessment procedures are tailored by:
•   Selecting the appropriate assessment methods and objects needed to satisfy the stated
    assessment objectives;
•   Selecting the appropriate depth and coverage attribute values to define the rigor and scope of
    the assessment;
•   Identifying common controls that have been assessed by a separately documented security
    assessment plan or privacy assessment plan, and do not require the repeated execution of the
    assessment procedures;
•   Developing information system/platform-specific and organization-specific assessment
    procedures (which may be adaptations to those procedures in Appendices F and J);
•   Incorporating assessment results from previous assessments where the results are deemed
    applicable; and



CHAPTER 3                                                                                              PAGE 18

________________________________________________________________________________________________

•    Making appropriate adjustments in assessment procedures to be able to obtain the requisite
     assessment evidence from external providers.

Assessment method and object-related considerations—
It is recognized that organizations can specify, document, and configure their information systems
in a variety of ways, and that the content and applicability of existing assessment evidence will
vary. This may result in the need to apply a variety of assessment methods to various assessment
objects to generate the assessment evidence needed to determine whether the security or privacy
controls are effective in their application. Therefore, the assessment methods and objects
provided with each assessment procedure are termed potential to reflect the need to be able to
choose the methods and objects most appropriate for a specific assessment. The assessment
methods and objects chosen are those deemed as necessary to produce the evidence needed to
make the determinations described in the determination statements. The potential methods and
objects in the assessment procedure are provided as a resource to assist in the selection of
appropriate methods and objects, and not with the intent to limit the selection. Organizations use
their judgment in selecting from the potential assessment methods and the list of assessment
objects associated with each selected method. Organizations select those methods and objects that
most cost-effectively contribute to making the determinations associated with the assessment
objective. 31 The measure of the quality of assessment results is based on the soundness of the
rationale provided, not the specific set of methods and objects applied. It will not be necessary, in
most cases, to apply every assessment method to every assessment object to obtain the desired
assessment results. And for certain assessments, it may be appropriate to employ a method not
currently listed in the set of potential methods.

Depth and coverage-related considerations—
In addition to selecting appropriate assessment methods and objects, each assessment method
(i.e., examine, interview, and test) is associated with depth and coverage attributes that are
described in Appendix D. The attribute values identify the rigor and scope of the assessment
procedures executed by the assessor. The values selected by the organization are based on the
characteristics of the information system being assessed (including assurance requirements) and
the specific determinations to be made. The depth and coverage attribute values are associated
with the assurance requirements specified by the organization (i.e., the rigor and scope of the
assessment increases in direct relationship to the assurance requirements). For security controls,
SCAP checklists provide a profile-based mechanism that enables tailoring of attribute values and
selection of specific control requirements based on the desired level of assurance required for an
information system. These checklists enable customizable, automated assessment using SCAP-
validated products.

Common control-related considerations—
Assessors note which security or privacy controls (or parts of such controls) in security plans or
privacy plans are designated as common controls. 32 Since the assessment of common controls is

31
   The selection of assessment methods and objects (including the number and type of assessment objects) can be a
significant factor in cost-effectively meeting the assessment objectives.
32
   Common controls support multiple information systems within the organization, and the protection measures
provided by those controls are inherited by the individual systems. Therefore, the organization determines the
appropriate set of common controls to ensure that both the strength of the controls (i.e., security capability) and level of
rigor and intensity of the control assessments are commensurate with the criticality and/or sensitivity of the individual
information systems inheriting those controls. Weaknesses or deficiencies in common controls have the potential to
adversely affect large portions of the organization and thus require significant attention.



CHAPTER 3                                                                                                           PAGE 19

________________________________________________________________________________________________

the responsibility of the organizational entity that developed and implemented the controls (i.e.,
common control provider), the assessment procedures in Appendices F and J used to assess these
controls incorporate assessment results from that organizational entity. Common controls may
have been previously assessed as part of the organization’s information security program or
privacy program or as part of an information system providing common controls inherited by
other organizational systems. There may also be separate plans to assess common controls. In
either situation, information system owners coordinate the assessment of common controls with
appropriate organizational officials (e.g., chief information officer, senior information security
officer, senior agency official for privacy/chief privacy officer, mission/information owners,
authorizing officials) obtaining the results of common control assessments or, if the common
controls have not been assessed or are due to be reassessed, making the necessary arrangements
to include or reference the common control assessment results in the current assessment. 33

Another consideration in assessing common controls is that there are occasionally system-specific
aspects of a common control that are not covered by the organizational entities responsible for the
common aspects of the control. These types of controls are referred to as hybrid controls. For
example, CP-2, the contingency planning security control, may be considered a hybrid control by
the organization if there is a contingency plan developed by the organization for all organizational
information systems. Following up on the initial contingency plan, information system owners are
expected to adjust or tailor the contingency plan as necessary, when there are specific aspects of
the plan that need to be defined for the particular system where the control is employed. For each
hybrid control, assessors include in security assessment plans or privacy assessment plans, the
portions of the assessment procedures from Appendices F or J related to the parts of the control
that are system-specific to ensure that, along with the results from common control assessments,
all aspects of the control are assessed.

System/platform and organization-related considerations—
The assessment procedures in Special Publication 800-53A may be adapted to address system-
and platform-specific or organization-specific dependencies. For example, the assessment of a
UNIX implementation of the IA-2 control for identification and authentication of users might
include an explicit examination of the .rhosts file for UNIX systems since improper entries in that
file can result in bypassing user authentication. Recent test results may also be applicable to the
current assessment if those test methods provide a high degree of transparency (e.g., what was
tested, when was it tested, how was it tested). Standards-based testing protocols such as SCAP
provide an example of how organizations can help achieve this level of transparency. SCAP
provides transparency through the use of standardized content that defines testing methods, and
through standardized results that indicate what content was used, what system state was tested,
what state was found, what tool was used to perform the testing, and when the testing was
performed.

Reuse of assessment evidence-related considerations—
Reuse of assessment results from previously accepted or approved assessments is considered in
the body of evidence for determining overall security or privacy control effectiveness. Previously
accepted or approved assessments include: (i) those assessments of common controls that are
managed by the organization and support multiple information systems; (ii) assessments of

33
  If assessment results are not currently available for the common controls, the assessment plans for the information
systems under assessment that depend on those controls are duly noted. The assessments cannot be considered
complete until the assessment results for the common controls are made available to information system owners.



CHAPTER 3                                                                                                       PAGE 20

security or privacy controls that are reviewed as part of the control implementation (e.g., CP-2
requires a review of the contingency plan); or (iii) security-related information generated by the
organization’s Information Security Continuous Monitoring program. The acceptability of using
previous assessment results in a security control assessment or privacy control assessment is
coordinated with and approved by the users of the assessment results. It is essential that
information system owners and common control providers collaborate with authorizing officials
and other appropriate organizational officials in determining the acceptability of using previous
assessment results. When considering the reuse of previous assessment results and the value of
those results to the current assessment, assessors determine: (i) the credibility of the assessment
evidence; (ii) the appropriateness of previous analysis; and (iii) the applicability of the assessment
evidence to current information system operating conditions. If previous assessment results are
reused, the date of the original assessment and type of assessment are documented in the security
assessment plan or privacy assessment plan and security assessment report or privacy assessment
report. When applicable, the standardized security assessment results provided by SCAP tools
may be reused by multiple parties.

It may be necessary, in certain situations, to supplement previous assessment results under
consideration for reuse with additional assessment activities to fully address the assessment
objectives. For example, if an independent evaluation of an information technology product did
not test a particular configuration setting that is employed by the organization in an information
system, then the assessor may need to supplement the original test results with additional testing
to cover that configuration setting for the current information system environment. The decision
to reuse assessment results is documented in the security assessment plan or privacy assessment
plan and the final security assessment report or privacy assessment report, and is consistent with
federal legislation, policies, directives, standards, and guidelines.

The following items are considered in validating previous assessment results for reuse:
•   Changing conditions associated with security controls and privacy controls over time.
Security and privacy controls that were deemed effective during previous assessments may have
become ineffective due to changing conditions within the information system or its environment
of operation, including emergent threat information. Assessment results that were found to be
previously acceptable may no longer provide credible evidence for the determination of security
or privacy control effectiveness, and therefore, a reassessment would be required. Applying
previous assessment results to a current assessment necessitates the identification of any changes
that have occurred since the previous assessment and the impact of these changes on the previous
results. For example, reusing previous assessment results from examining an organization’s
security or privacy policies and procedures may be acceptable if it is determined that there have
not been any significant changes to the identified policies and procedures. Reusing assessment
results produced during the previous authorization of an information system is a cost-effective
method for supporting continuous monitoring activities and annual FISMA reporting
requirements when the related controls have not changed, and there are adequate reasons for
confidence in their continued application.

•   Amount of time that has transpired since previous assessments.
In general, as the time period between current and previous assessments increases, the credibility
and utility of the previous assessment results decrease. This is primarily due to the fact that the
information system or the environment in which the information system operates is more likely to
change with the passage of time, possibly invalidating the original conditions or assumptions on
which the previous assessment was based.

•    Degree of independence of previous assessments.
Assessor independence can be a critical factor in certain types of assessments. The degree of
independence required from assessment to assessment should be consistent. For example, it is not
appropriate to reuse results from a previous self-assessment where no assessor independence was
required, in a current assessment requiring a greater degree of independence.

External information system-related considerations—
The assessment procedures in Appendices F and J need to be adjusted, as appropriate, to
accommodate the assessment of external information systems. 34 Because the organization does
not always have direct control over the security or privacy controls used in external information
systems, or sufficient visibility into the development, implementation, and assessment of those
controls, alternative assessment approaches may need to be applied, resulting in the need to tailor
the assessment procedures described in Appendices F and J. Where required assurances of
agreed-upon security or privacy controls within an information system or inherited by the system
are documented in contracts or service-level agreements, assessors review these contracts or
agreements, and where appropriate, tailor the assessment procedures to assess either the security
or privacy controls or the security control assessment or privacy control assessment results
provided through these agreements. In addition, assessors take into account any other assessments
that have been conducted or are in the process of being conducted, for external information
systems that are relied upon with regard to protecting the information system under assessment.
Applicable information from these assessments, if deemed reliable, is incorporated into the
security assessment report or privacy assessment report, as appropriate.

3.2.4 Develop assessment procedures for organization-specific controls.
Based on organizational policies, mission or business function requirements, and an assessment
of risk, organizations may choose to develop and implement additional (organization-specific)
security or privacy controls or control enhancements for their information systems that are
beyond the scope of Special Publication 800-53. Such controls are documented in the security
plan or privacy plan as controls not found in Special Publication 800-53. To assess the security or
privacy controls in this situation, assessors use the guidelines in Chapter Two to develop
assessment procedures for those controls and control enhancements. The assessment procedures
developed are subsequently integrated into the security assessment plan or privacy assessment
plan, as appropriate.

3.2.5 Optimize selected assessment procedures to ensure maximum efficiency.
Assessors have a great deal of flexibility in organizing assessment plans that meet the needs of
the organization and that provide the best opportunity for obtaining the necessary evidence to
determine security or privacy control effectiveness, while reducing overall assessment costs.
Combining and consolidating assessment procedures is one area where this flexibility can be
applied. During the assessment of an information system, assessment methods are applied
numerous times to a variety of assessment objects within a particular family of security or privacy
controls. To save time, reduce assessment costs, and maximize the usefulness of assessment
results, assessors review the selected assessment procedures for the security or privacy control

34
   An external information system is an information system or component of an information system that is outside of
the authorization boundary established by the organization and for which the organization typically has no direct
control over the application of required security and privacy controls or the assessment of security and privacy control
effectiveness. Special Publications 800-37 and 800-53 provide additional guidance on external information systems and
the effect of employing security controls in those types of environments.



CHAPTER 3                                                                                                       PAGE 22

families and combine or consolidate the procedures (or parts of procedures) whenever possible or
practicable. For example, assessors may wish to consolidate interviews with key organizational
officials dealing with a variety of security- or privacy-related topics. Assessors may have other
opportunities for significant consolidations and cost savings by examining all policies and
procedures from the families of security controls and privacy controls at the same time or by
organizing groups of related policies and procedures that could be examined as a unified entity.
Obtaining and examining configuration settings from similar hardware and software components
within the information system is another example that can provide significant assessment
efficiencies.

An additional area for consideration in optimizing the assessment process is the sequence in
which security or privacy controls are assessed. The assessment of some security controls and
privacy controls before others may provide useful information that facilitates understanding and
more efficient assessments of other controls. For example, security controls such as CM-2
(Baseline Configuration), CM-8 (Information System Component Inventory), PL-2 (System
Security Plan), RA-2 (Security Categorization), and RA-3 (Risk Assessment) produce general
descriptions of the information system. Assessing these security controls early in the assessment
process may provide a basic understanding of the information system that can aid in assessing
other security controls. The supplemental guidance for many security controls and privacy
controls also identifies related controls that can provide useful information in organizing the
assessment procedures. For example, AC-19 (Access Control for Portable and Mobile Devices)
lists security controls MP-4 (Media Storage) and MP-5 (Media Transport) as being related to AC-
19. Since AC-19 is related to MP-4 and MP-5, the sequence in which assessments are conducted
for AC-19, MP-4, and MP-5 may facilitate the reuse of assessment information from one control
in assessing other related controls.

3.2.6 Finalize assessment plan and obtain approval to execute plan.
After selecting the assessment procedures (including developing necessary procedures not
contained in the Special Publication 800-53A catalog of procedures), tailoring the procedures for
information system/platform-specific and organization-specific conditions, optimizing the
procedures for efficiency, and addressing the potential for unexpected events impacting the
assessment, the assessment plan is finalized, and the schedule is established including key
milestones for the assessment process. Once the security assessment plan or privacy assessment
plan is completed, the plan is reviewed and approved by appropriate organizational officials 35 to
ensure that the plan is: (i) complete; (ii) consistent with the security or privacy objectives of the
organization, as appropriate, and the organization’s assessment of risk; and (iii) cost-effective
with regard to the resources allocated for the assessment.

3.3 CONDUCTING SECURITY AND PRIVACY CONTROL ASSESSMENTS
After the security assessment plan or privacy assessment plan is approved by the organization, the
assessor(s) or assessment team executes the plan in accordance with the agreed-upon schedule.
Determining the size and organizational makeup of the assessment team (i.e., skill sets, technical
expertise, and assessment experience of the individuals composing the team) is part of the risk
management decisions made by the organization requesting and initiating the assessment. The

35
   Organizations establish a security and privacy assessment plan approval process with the specific organizational
officials (e.g., information systems owners, common control providers, information system security officers, senior
information security officers, senior agency officials for privacy/chief privacy officers, authorizing officials) designated
as approving authorities.



CHAPTER 3                                                                                                           PAGE 23

________________________________________________________________________________________________

results of security control assessments and privacy control assessments are documented in
security assessment reports and privacy assessment reports, respectively, which are key inputs to
the authorization package developed by information system owners and common control
providers for authorizing officials. 36 Security assessment reports and privacy assessment reports
include information from assessors (in the form of assessment findings) necessary to determine
the effectiveness of the security or privacy controls employed within or inherited by the
information system. These assessment reports are an important factor in an authorizing official’s
determination of risk. Organizations may choose to develop an assessment summary from the
detailed findings that are generated by assessors during the security control assessments and
privacy control assessments. An assessment summary can provide an authorizing official with an
abbreviated version of an assessment report focusing on the highlights of the assessment,
synopsis of key findings, and recommendations for addressing weaknesses and deficiencies in the
security or privacy controls assessed. Appendix G provides information on the recommended
content of assessment reports.

Assessment objectives are achieved by applying the designated assessment methods to selected
assessment objects and compiling/producing the evidence necessary to make the determination
associated with each assessment objective. Each determination statement contained within an
assessment procedure executed by an assessor produces one of the following findings: (i)
satisfied (S); or (ii) other than satisfied (O). A finding of satisfied indicates that for the portion of
the security or privacy control addressed by the determination statement, the assessment
information obtained (i.e., evidence collected) indicates that the assessment objective for the
control has been met producing a fully acceptable result. A finding of other than satisfied
indicates that for the portion of the security or privacy control addressed by the determination
statement, the assessment information obtained indicates potential anomalies in the operation or
implementation of the control that may need to be addressed by the organization. A finding of
other than satisfied may also indicate that for reasons specified in the assessment report, the
assessor was unable to obtain sufficient information to make the particular determination called
for in the determination statement. For assessment findings that are other than satisfied,
organizations may choose to define subcategories of findings indicating the severity and/or
criticality of the weaknesses or deficiencies discovered and the potential adverse effects on
organizational operations (i.e., mission, functions, image, or reputation), organizational assets,
individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. Defining such subcategories can help to establish
priorities for needed risk mitigation actions.

Assessor findings are an unbiased, factual reporting of what was found concerning the security or
privacy control assessed. For each finding of other than satisfied, assessors indicate which parts
of the security or privacy control are affected by the finding (i.e., aspects of the control that were
deemed not satisfied or were not able to be assessed) and describe how the control differs from
the planned or expected state. The potential for compromises to confidentiality, integrity, and
availability due to other than satisfied findings are also noted by the assessor in the security or
privacy assessment report. This notation reflects the lack of a specified protection and the
exploitation that could occur as a result (i.e., workstation, dataset, root level access). Risk
determination and acceptance activities are conducted by the organization post-assessment as part
of the risk management strategy established by the organization. These risk management
activities involve the senior leadership of the organization including, for example, heads of
agencies, mission/business owners, information owners/stewards, risk executive (function), and

  In accordance with Special Publication 800-37, the security authorization package consists of the security plan, the
security assessment report, and the plan of action and milestones (POAM).

authorizing officials, in consultation with appropriate organizational support staff (e.g., senior
information security officers, senior agency officials for privacy/chief privacy officers, chief
information officers, information system owners, common control providers, and assessors).
Security control assessment and privacy control assessment results are documented at the level of
detail appropriate for the assessment in accordance with the reporting format prescribed by
organizational policy, NIST guidelines, and OMB policy. The reporting format is appropriate for
the type of assessment conducted (e.g., self-assessments by information system owners and
common control providers, independent verification and validation, independent assessments
supporting the authorization process, automated assessments, or independent audits or
inspections).

Information system owners and common control providers rely on the expertise and the technical
judgment of assessors to: (i) assess the security and privacy controls in the information system
and inherited by the system; and (ii) provide recommendations on how to correct weaknesses or
deficiencies in the controls and reduce or eliminate identified vulnerabilities. The assessment
results produced by the assessor (i.e., findings of satisfied or other than satisfied, identification of
the parts of the security or privacy control that did not produce a satisfactory result, and a
description of resulting potential for compromises to the information system or its environment of
operation) are provided to information system owners and common control providers in the initial
security assessment reports and privacy assessment reports. System owners and common control
providers may choose to act on selected recommendations of the assessor before the assessment
reports are finalized if there are specific opportunities to correct weaknesses or deficiencies in the
security or privacy controls or to correct and/or clarify misunderstandings or interpretations of
assessment results. 37 Security or privacy controls that are modified, enhanced, or added during
this process are reassessed by the assessor prior to the production of the final assessment reports.

3.4 ANALYZING ASSESSMENT REPORT RESULTS
The results of security control assessments and privacy control assessments ultimately influence
control implementations, the content of security plans and privacy plans, and the respective plans
of action and milestones. Accordingly, information system owners and common control providers
review the security assessment reports and privacy assessment reports and the updated risk
assessment and with the concurrence of designated organizational officials (e.g., authorizing
officials, chief information officer, senior information security officer, senior agency officials for
privacy/chief privacy officers, mission/information owners), determine the appropriate steps
required to respond to those weaknesses and deficiencies identified during the assessment. By
using the labels of satisfied and other than satisfied, the reporting format for the assessment
findings provides visibility for organizational officials into specific weaknesses and deficiencies
in security or privacy controls within the information system or inherited by the system and
facilitates a disciplined and structured approach to responding to risks in accordance with
organizational priorities. For example, information system owners or common control providers
in consultation with designated organizational officials, may decide that certain assessment

37
   The correction of weaknesses or deficiencies in security or privacy controls or carrying out recommendations during
the review of the initial security assessment reports or privacy assessment reports by information system owners or
common control providers is not intended to replace the formal risk response process by the organization which occurs
after the delivery of the final reports. Rather, it provides the information system owner or common control provider
with an opportunity to address weaknesses or deficiencies that may be quickly corrected. However, in situations where
limited resources exist for remediating weaknesses and deficiencies discovered during the security control assessments
or privacy control assessments, organizations may decide without prejudice that waiting for the risk assessment to
prioritize remediation efforts is the better course of action.



CHAPTER 3                                                                                                      PAGE 25

________________________________________________________________________________________________

findings marked as other than satisfied are of an inconsequential nature and present no significant
risk to the organization. Conversely, system owners or common control providers may decide that
certain findings marked as other than satisfied are significant, requiring immediate remediation
actions. In all cases, the organization reviews each assessor finding of other than satisfied and
applies its judgment with regard to the severity or seriousness of the finding and whether the
finding is significant enough to be worthy of further investigation or remedial action. 38

Senior leadership involvement in the mitigation process may be necessary in order to ensure that
the organization’s resources are effectively allocated in accordance with organizational priorities,
providing resources first to the information systems that are supporting the most critical and
sensitive missions for the organization or correcting the deficiencies that pose the greatest degree
of risk. Ultimately, the assessment findings and any subsequent mitigation actions (informed by
the updated risk assessment) initiated by information system owners or common control providers
in collaboration with designated organizational officials, trigger updates to the key documents
used by authorizing officials to determine the security or privacy status of the information system
and its suitability for authorization to operate. These documents include security plans and
privacy plans, security assessment reports and privacy assessment reports, and the respective
plans of action and milestones.

3.5 ASSESSING SECURITY AND PRIVACY CAPABILITIES
In accordance with NIST Special Publication 800-53, organizations may define a set of security
capabilities or privacy capabilities as a precursor to the security control or privacy control
selection process. The concept of capability 39 recognizes that the protection of information being
processed, stored, or transmitted by information systems, seldom derives from a single security
safeguard or countermeasure. In most cases, such protection results from the selection and
implementation of a set of mutually reinforcing security controls and privacy controls. Each
control contributes to the overall organization-defined capability—with some controls potentially
contributing to a greater degree and other controls contributing to a lesser degree. For example,
organizations may wish to define a capability for secure remote authentication. This capability
can be achieved by the implementation of a set of security controls from Special Publication 800-
53, Appendix F (i.e., IA-2[1], IA-2[2], IA-2[8], IA-2[9], and SC-8[1]).

Security and privacy capabilities can address a variety of areas that can include technical means,
physical means, procedural means, or any combination thereof. By employing the capability
concept, organizations can obtain greater visibility into and a better understanding of: (i) the
relationships (i.e., dependencies) among controls; (ii) the effects of specific control failures on
organization-defined capabilities; and (iii) the potential severity of control weaknesses or
deficiencies. However, this approach may add complexity to assessments and necessitate root
cause failure analysis when specific capabilities are affected by the failure of particular security
or privacy controls in order to determine which control or controls are contributing to the failure.
The greater the number of controls included in an organization-defined capability, the more
difficult it may be to ascertain the root cause of failures. There may also be interactions among
defined capabilities which may contribute to the complexity of assessments. If it is found that a

38
   Potential risk response actions include risk acceptance, risk mitigation, risk rejection, and risk transfer/sharing. NIST
Special Publication 800-39 provides guidance on risk response actions from a risk management perspective.
39
  A security capability or privacy capability is a combination of mutually reinforcing security controls or privacy
controls (i.e., safeguards and countermeasures) implemented by technical means (i.e., functionality in hardware,
software, and firmware), physical means (i.e., physical devices and protective measures), and procedural means (i.e.,
procedures performed by individuals).



CHAPTER 3                                                                                                           PAGE 26

________________________________________________________________________________________________

control is neither contributing to a defined capability nor to the overall security of the system, the
organization revisits RMF Step 2, tailoring the control set and documenting the rationale in the
security plan.

Traditionally, assessments have been conducted on a control-by-control basis producing results
that are characterized as pass (i.e., control satisfied) or fail (i.e., control not satisfied). However,
the failure of a single control or in some cases, the failure of multiple controls, may not affect the
overall security capability or privacy capability required by an organization. This is not to say that
such controls are not contributing to the security or privacy of the system and/or organization (as
defined by the security requirements and privacy requirements during the initiation phase of the
system development life cycle), but rather that such controls may not be supporting the particular
security capability or privacy capability. Furthermore, every implemented security control or
privacy control may not necessarily support or need to support an organization-defined capability.

When organizations employ the concept of capabilities, both automated and manual assessments
take into account all security controls and privacy controls that comprise the security or privacy
capabilities. Assessors are aware of how the controls work together to provide such capabilities.
In this way, when assessments identify a failure in a capability, a root cause analysis can be
conducted to determine the specific control or controls that are responsible for the failure based
on the established relationships among controls. Moreover, employing the broader capability
construct allows organizations to assess the severity of vulnerabilities discovered in their systems
and organizations and determine if the failure of a particular security control or privacy control
(associated with a vulnerability) or the decision not to deploy a certain control during the initial
tailoring process (RMF Select step), affects the overall capability needed for mission/business
protection. For example, the failure of a security control deemed critical for a particular security
capability may be assigned a higher severity rating than a failed control of lesser importance to
the capability.

Ultimately, authorization decisions (i.e., risk acceptance decisions) are made based on the degree
to which the desired security capabilities and privacy capabilities have been effectively achieved
and are meeting the security requirements and privacy requirements defined by an organization.
These risk-based decisions are directly related to organizational risk tolerance that is defined as
part of an organization’s risk management strategy.



                                CAPABILITY-BASED ASSESSMENTS
     The grouping of controls into security capabilities and privacy capabilities necessitates the
     conduct of root cause analyses to determine if the failure of a particular security or privacy
     capability can be traced to the failure of one or more security or privacy controls based on the
     established relationships among controls. The structure of the assessment procedures in this
     publication with the token-level decomposition and labelling of assessment objectives linked
     to the specific content of security and privacy controls, supports such root cause analysis.
     Thus, assessments of security and privacy controls (defined as part of capabilities) can be
     tailored based on the guidance in Section 3.2.3 and Special Publication 800-137, to define the
     resource expenditures (e.g., frequency and level of effort) associated with such assessments.
     This additional precision in assessments is essential in supporting the continuous monitoring
     strategies developed by organizations and the ongoing authorization decisions by senior
     leaders.

________________________________________________________________________________________________


 Assurance Case                       A structured set of arguments and a body of evidence
 [Software Engineering Institute,     showing that an information system satisfies specific
 Carnegie Mellon University]          claims with respect to a given quality attribute.
 Authentication                       Verifying the identity of a user, process, or device, often
 [FIPS 200]                           as a prerequisite to allowing access to resources in an
                                      information system.
 Authenticity                         The property of being genuine and being able to be
                                      verified and trusted; confidence in the validity of a
                                      transmission, a message, or message originator. See
                                      Authentication.
 Authorization                        The official management decision given by a senior
 (to operate)                         organizational official to authorize operation of an
 [NIST SP 800-37, Adapted]            information system and to explicitly accept the risk to
                                      organizational operations (including mission, functions,
                                      image, or reputation), organizational assets, individuals,
                                      other organizations, and the Nation based on the
                                      implementation of an agreed-upon set of security controls
                                      and privacy controls.
 Authorization Boundary               All components of an information system to be
 [NIST SP 800-37]                     authorized for operation by an authorizing official and
                                      excludes separately authorized systems, to which the
                                      information system is connected.
 Authorizing Official                 A senior (federal) official or executive with the authority
 [NIST SP 800-37]                     to formally assume responsibility for operating an
                                      information system at an acceptable level of risk to
                                      organizational operations (including mission, functions,
                                      image, or reputation), organizational assets, individuals,
                                      other organizations, and the Nation.
 Authorizing Official Designated      An organizational official acting on behalf of an
 Representative                       authorizing official in carrying out and coordinating the
 [NIST SP 800-37, Adapted]            required activities associated with security authorization
                                      or privacy authorization.
 Availability                         Ensuring timely and reliable access to and use of
 [44 U.S.C., Sec. 3542]               information.
 Basic Testing                        A test methodology that assumes no knowledge of the
                                      internal structure and implementation detail of the

                                      Special Publication 800-53A are adjusted, or scoped, to
                                      match the characteristics of the information system under
                                      assessment, providing organizations with the flexibility
                                      needed to meet specific organizational requirements and
                                      to avoid overly-constrained assessment approaches.

                                      under specified conditions to compare actual with
                                      expected behavior, the results of which are used to
                                      support the determination of security control or privacy
                                      control effectiveness over time.

ASSESSMENT METHOD DESCRIPTIONS
ASSESSMENT METHOD DEFINITIONS, APPLICABLE OBJECTS, AND ATTRIBUTES




T
       his appendix defines the three assessment methods that can be used by assessors during
       security and privacy control assessments: (i) examine; (ii) interview; and (iii) test. Included
       in the definition of each assessment method are types of objects to which the method can
be applied. The application of each method is described in terms of the attributes of depth and
coverage, progressing from basic to focused to comprehensive. The attribute values correlate to
the assurance requirements specified by the organization. 40

The depth attribute addresses the rigor and level of detail of the assessment. For the depth
attribute, the focused attribute value includes and builds upon the assessment rigor and level of
detail defined for the basic attribute value; the comprehensive attribute value includes and builds
upon the assessment rigor and level of detail defined for the focused attribute value.

The coverage attribute addresses the scope or breadth of the assessment. For the coverage
attribute, the focused attribute value includes and builds upon the number and type of assessment
objects defined for the basic attribute value; the comprehensive attribute value includes and
builds upon the number and type of assessment objects defined for the focused attribute value.

The use of bolded text in the assessment method description indicates the content that was added
to and appears for the first time, in the description indicating greater rigor and level of detail for
the attribute value.




40
   For other than national security systems, organizations meet minimum assurance requirements specified in Special
Publication 800-53, Appendix E.



APPENDIX D                                                                                                   PAGE D-1

ASSESSMENT METHOD:            Examine
ASSESSMENT OBJECTS:           Specifications (e.g., policies, plans, procedures, system requirements, designs)
                              Mechanisms (e.g., functionality implemented in hardware, software, firmware)
                              Activities (e.g., system operations, administration, management; exercises)
DEFINITION: The process of checking, inspecting, reviewing, observing, studying, or analyzing one or more
assessment objects to facilitate understanding, achieve clarification, or obtain evidence, the results of which
are used to support the determination of security and privacy control existence, functionality, correctness,
completeness, and potential for improvement over time.
SUPPLEMENTAL GUIDANCE: Typical assessor actions may include, for example: reviewing information
security policies, plans, and procedures; analyzing system design documentation and interface
specifications; observing system backup operations; reviewing the results of contingency plan exercises;
observing incident response activities; studying technical manuals and user/administrator guides; checking,
studying, or observing the operation of an information technology mechanism in the information system
hardware/software; or checking, studying, or observing physical security measures related to the operation
of an information system.
SCAP-validated tools that support the OCIL component specification may be used to automate the
collection of assessment objects from specific, responsible individuals within an organization. The resulting
information can then be examined by assessors during the security and privacy control assessments.
ATTRIBUTES: Depth, Coverage

•   The depth attribute addresses the rigor of and level of detail in the examination process. There are three
    possible values for the depth attribute: (i) basic; (ii) focused; and (iii) comprehensive.
    -    Basic examination: Examination that consists of high-level reviews, checks, observations, or inspections of
         the assessment object. This type of examination is conducted using a limited body of evidence or
         documentation (e.g., functional-level descriptions for mechanisms; high-level process descriptions for
         activities; actual documents for specifications). Basic examinations provide a level of understanding of the
         security and privacy controls necessary for determining whether the controls are implemented and free of
         obvious errors.
    -    Focused examination: Examination that consists of high-level reviews, checks, observations, or inspections
         and more in-depth studies/analyses of the assessment object. This type of examination is conducted using a
         substantial body of evidence or documentation (e.g., functional-level descriptions and where appropriate
         and available, high-level design information for mechanisms; high-level process descriptions and
         implementation procedures for activities; the actual documents and related documents for specifications).
         Focused examinations provide a level of understanding of the security and privacy controls necessary for
         determining whether the controls are implemented and free of obvious errors and whether there are
         increased grounds for confidence that the controls are implemented correctly and operating as
         intended.
    -    Comprehensive examination: Examination that consists of high-level reviews, checks, observations, or
         inspections and more in-depth, detailed, and thorough studies/analyses of the assessment object. This type
         of examination is conducted using an extensive body of evidence or documentation (e.g., functional-level
         descriptions and where appropriate and available, high-level design information, low-level design
         information, and implementation information for mechanisms; high-level process descriptions and
         detailed implementation procedures for activities; the actual documents and related documents for
                       41
         specifications ). Comprehensive examinations provide a level of understanding of the security and privacy
         controls necessary for determining whether the controls are implemented and free of obvious errors and
         whether there are further increased grounds for confidence that the controls are implemented correctly and
         operating as intended on an ongoing and consistent basis, and that there is support for continuous
         improvement in the effectiveness of the controls.



41
   While additional documentation is likely for mechanisms when moving from basic to focused to comprehensive
examinations, the documentation associated with specifications and activities may be the same or similar for focused
and comprehensive examinations, with the rigor of the examinations of these documents being increased at the
comprehensive level.

•    The coverage attribute addresses the scope or breadth of the examination process and includes the
     types of assessment objects to be examined, the number of objects to be examined (by type), and
     specific objects to be examined. 42 There are three possible values for the coverage attribute: (i) basic;
     (ii) focused; and (iii) comprehensive.
     -    Basic examination: Examination that uses a representative sample of assessment objects (by type and number
          within type) to provide a level of coverage necessary for determining whether the security and privacy
          controls are implemented and free of obvious errors.
     -    Focused examination: Examination that uses a representative sample of assessment objects (by type and
          number within type) and other specific assessment objects deemed particularly important to achieving
          the assessment objective to provide a level of coverage necessary for determining whether the security and
          privacy controls are implemented and free of obvious errors and whether there are increased grounds for
          confidence that the controls are implemented correctly and operating as intended.
     -    Comprehensive examination: Examination that uses a sufficiently large sample of assessment objects (by
          type and number within type) and other specific assessment objects deemed particularly important to
          achieving the assessment objective to provide a level of coverage necessary for determining whether the
          security and privacy controls are implemented and free of obvious errors and whether there are further
          increased grounds for confidence that the controls are implemented correctly and operating as intended on an
          ongoing and consistent basis, and that there is support for continuous improvement in the effectiveness

ASSESSMENT METHOD:            Interview
ASSESSMENT OBJECTS:           Individuals or groups of individuals.
DEFINITION: The process of conducting discussions with individuals or groups within an organization to
facilitate understanding, achieve clarification, or lead to the location of evidence, the results of which are
used to support the determination of security and privacy control existence, functionality, correctness,
completeness, and potential for improvement over time.
SUPPLEMENTAL GUIDANCE: Typical assessor actions may include, for example, interviewing agency
heads, chief information officers, senior agency information security officers, authorizing officials,
information owners, information system and mission owners, information system security officers,
information system security managers, personnel officers, human resource managers, facilities managers,
training officers, information system operators, network and system administrators, site managers, physical
security officers, and users.
SCAP-validated tools that support the OCIL component specification may be used to automate the
interview process for specific individuals or groups of individuals. The resulting information can then be
examined by assessors during the security and privacy control assessments.
ATTRIBUTES: Depth, Coverage

•    The depth attribute addresses the rigor of and level of detail in the interview process. There are three
     possible values for the depth attribute: (i) basic; (ii) focused; and (iii) comprehensive.
     -    Basic interview: Interview that consists of broad-based, high-level discussions with individuals or groups of
          individuals. This type of interview is conducted using a set of generalized, high-level questions. Basic
          interviews provide a level of understanding of the security and privacy controls necessary for determining
          whether the controls are implemented and free of obvious errors.
     -    Focused interview: Interview that consists of broad-based, high-level discussions and more in-depth
          discussions in specific areas with individuals or groups of individuals. This type of interview is conducted
          using a set of generalized, high-level questions and more in-depth questions in specific areas where
          responses indicate a need for more in-depth investigation. Focused interviews provide a level of
          understanding of the security and privacy controls necessary for determining whether the controls are
          implemented and free of obvious errors and whether there are increased grounds for confidence that the
          controls are implemented correctly and operating as intended.
     -    Comprehensive interview: Interview that consists of broad-based, high-level discussions and more in-depth,
          probing discussions in specific areas with individuals or groups of individuals. This type of interview is
          conducted using a set of generalized, high-level questions and more in-depth, probing questions in specific
          areas where responses indicate a need for more in-depth investigation. Comprehensive interviews provide a
          level of understanding of the security and privacy controls necessary for determining whether the controls are
          implemented and free of obvious errors and whether there are further increased grounds for confidence that
          the controls are implemented correctly and operating as intended on an ongoing and consistent basis, and
          that there is support for continuous improvement in the effectiveness of the controls.
•    The coverage attribute addresses the scope or breadth of the interview process and includes the types
     of individuals to be interviewed (by organizational role and associated responsibility), the number of
     individuals to be interviewed (by type), and specific individuals to be interviewed. 43 There are three
     possible values for the coverage attribute: (i) basic; (ii) focused; and (iii) comprehensive.
     -    Basic interview: Interview that uses a representative sample of individuals in key organizational roles to
          provide a level of coverage necessary for determining whether the security and privacy controls are
          implemented and free of obvious errors.
     -    Focused interview: Interview that uses a representative sample of individuals in key organizational roles and
          other specific individuals deemed particularly important to achieving the assessment objective to
          provide a level of coverage necessary for determining whether the security and privacy controls are

ASSESSMENT METHOD:            Test
ASSESSMENT OBJECTS:           Mechanisms (e.g., hardware, software, firmware)
                              Activities (e.g., system operations, administration, management; exercises)
DEFINITION: The process of exercising one or more assessment objects under specified conditions to
compare actual with expected behavior, the results of which are used to support the determination of
security and privacy control existence, functionality, correctness, completeness, and potential for
improvement over time. 44
SUPPLEMENTAL GUIDANCE: Typical assessor actions may include, for example: testing access control,
identification and authentication, and audit mechanisms; testing security configuration settings; testing
physical access control devices; conducting penetration testing of key information system
components; testing information system backup operations; testing incident response capability; and
exercising contingency planning capability.
SCAP-validated tools can be used to automate the collection of assessment objects and evaluate these
objects against expected behavior. The use of SCAP is specifically relevant to the testing of mechanisms
that involve assessment of actual machine state. The National Checklist Program catalogs a number of
SCAP-enabled checklists that are suitable for assessing the configuration posture of specific operating
systems and applications. SCAP-validated tools can use these checklists to determine the aggregate
compliance of a system against all of the configuration settings in the checklist (e.g., CM-6) or specific
configurations that are relevant to a security or privacy control that pertains to one or more configuration
settings. SCAP-validated tools can also determine the absence of a patch or the presence of a vulnerable
condition. The results produced by the SCAP tools can then be examined by assessors as part of the
security and privacy control assessments.
ATTRIBUTES: Depth, Coverage

•    The depth attribute addresses the types of testing to be conducted. There are three possible values for
     the depth attribute: (i) basic testing; (ii) focused testing; and (iii) comprehensive testing.
     -    Basic testing: Test methodology (also known as black box testing) that assumes no knowledge of the internal
          structure and implementation detail of the assessment object. This type of testing is conducted using a
          functional specification for mechanisms and a high-level process description for activities. Basic testing
          provides a level of understanding of the security and privacy controls necessary for determining whether the
          controls are implemented and free of obvious errors.
     -    Focused testing: Test methodology (also known as gray box testing) that assumes some knowledge of the
          internal structure and implementation detail of the assessment object. This type of testing is conducted using
          a functional specification and limited system architectural information (e.g., high-level design) for
          mechanisms and a high-level process description and high-level description of integration into the
          operational environment for activities. Focused testing provides a level of understanding of the security and
          privacy controls necessary for determining whether the controls are implemented and free of obvious errors
          and whether there are increased grounds for confidence that the controls are implemented correctly
          and operating as intended.
     -    Comprehensive testing: Test methodology (also known as white box testing) that assumes explicit and
          substantial knowledge of the internal structure and implementation detail of the assessment object. This type
          of testing is conducted using a functional specification, extensive system architectural information (e.g.,
          high-level design, low-level design) and implementation representation (e.g., source code, schematics)
          for mechanisms and a high-level process description and detailed description of integration into the
          operational environment for activities. Comprehensive testing provides a level of understanding of the
          security and privacy controls necessary for determining whether the controls are implemented and free of
          obvious errors and whether there are further increased grounds for confidence that the controls are



44
   Testing is typically used to determine if mechanisms or activities meet a set of predefined specifications. Testing can
also be performed to determine characteristics of a security or privacy control that are not commonly associated with
predefined specifications, with an example of such testing being penetration testing. Guidelines for conducting
penetration testing are provided in Appendix E.

APPENDIX E

PENETRATION TESTING
ASSESSMENT TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES TO IDENTIFY INFORMATION SYSTEM WEAKNESSES




O         rganizations may consider adding controlled penetration testing to their arsenal of tools
          and techniques used to assess the security and privacy controls in organizational
          information systems. Penetration testing is a specific type of assessment in which
assessors simulate the actions of a given class of attacker by using a defined set of documentation
(that is, the documentation representative of what that class of attacker is likely to possess) and
working under other specific constraints to attempt to circumvent the security or privacy features
of an information system. Penetration testing is conducted as a controlled attempt to breach the
security and privacy controls employed within the information system using the attacker’s
techniques and appropriate hardware and software tools. Penetration testing represents the results
of a specific assessor or group of assessors at a specific point in time using agreed-upon rules of
engagement. Considering the complexity of the information technologies commonly employed by
organizations today, penetration testing can be viewed not as a means to verify the security or
privacy features of an information system, but rather as a means to: (i) enhance the organization’s
understanding of the system; (ii) uncover weaknesses or deficiencies in the system; and (iii)
indicate the level of effort required on the part of adversaries to breach the system safeguards.

Penetration testing exercises can be scheduled and/or random in accordance with organizational
policy and organizational assessments of risk. Consideration can be given to performing
penetration tests: (i) on any newly developed information system (or legacy system undergoing a
major upgrade) before the system is authorized for operation; (ii) after important changes are
made to the environment in which the information system operates; and (iii) when a new type of
attack is discovered that may impact the system. Organizations actively monitor the information
systems environment and the threat landscape (e.g., new vulnerabilities, attack techniques, new
technology deployments, user security and privacy awareness and training) to identify changes
that require out-of-cycle penetration testing.

Organizations specify which components within the information system are subject to penetration
testing and the attacker’s profile to be adopted throughout the penetration testing exercises.
Organizations train selected personnel in the use and maintenance of penetration testing tools and
techniques. Effective penetration testing tools have the capability to readily update the list of
attack techniques and exploitable vulnerabilities used during the exercises. Organizations update
the list of attack techniques and exploitable vulnerabilities used in penetration testing based on an
organizational assessment of risk or when significant new vulnerabilities or threats are identified
and reported. Whenever possible, organizations employ tools and attack techniques that include
the capability to perform penetration testing exercises on information systems and security and
privacy controls in an automated manner. 46

The information obtained from the penetration testing process can be shared with appropriate
personnel throughout the organization to help prioritize the vulnerabilities in the information

46
   While automated penetration testing tools provide repeatable results and reduce the resources used, organizations
carefully consider the potential detrimental effects of automated exploits on system availability when employing
automated penetration testing tools. Additionally, penetration testing based solely on automated tools may not provide
the level of attempted system compromise that organizations might experience from an actual attacker.

system that are demonstrably subject to compromise by attackers of a profile equivalent to the
ones used in the penetration testing exercises. The prioritization helps to determine effective
strategies for eliminating the identified vulnerabilities and mitigating associated risks to the
organization’s operations and assets, to individuals, to other organizations, and to the Nation
resulting from the operation and use of the information system. Penetration testing can be
integrated into the network security testing process and the patch and vulnerability management
process. Special Publication 800-40 provides guidance on patch and vulnerability management.
Special Publication 800-115 provides guidance on information and network security testing.

Penetration Testing Considerations
Organizations consider the following criteria in developing and implementing a controlled
penetration testing program. An effective penetration test:
    •    Goes beyond vulnerability scanning, to provide an explicit and often dramatic proof of
         mission risks and an indicator of the level of effort an adversary would need to expend in
         order to cause harm to the organization’s operations and assets, to individuals, to other
         organizations, or to the Nation;
    •    Approaches the information system as the adversary would, considering vulnerabilities,
         incorrect system configurations, trust relationships between organizations, and
         architectural weaknesses in the environment under test;
    •    Has a clearly defined scope and contains as a minimum:
         - A definition of the environment subject to test (e.g., facilities, users, organizational
           groups);
         - A definition of the attack surface to be tested (e.g., servers, desktop systems, wireless
           networks, Web applications, intrusion detection and prevention systems, firewalls,
           email accounts, user security awareness and training posture, incident response
           posture);
         - A definition of the threat sources to simulate (e.g., an enumeration of attacker’s profiles
           to be used: internal attacker, casual attacker, single or group of external targeted
           attackers, criminal organization);
         - A definition of the objectives for the simulated attacker (e.g., gain domain administrator
           access on the organization’s LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) structure,
           access and modify information in the organization’s financial system);
         - A definition of level of effort (time and resources) to be expended; and
         - A definition of the rules of engagement.
    •    Thoroughly documents all activities performed during the test, including all exploited
         vulnerabilities and how the vulnerabilities were combined into attacks;
    •    Produces results indicating a likelihood of occurrence for a given attacker by using the
         level of effort the team needed to expend in penetrating the information system as an
         indicator of the penetration resistance of the system;
    •    Validates existing security and privacy controls (including risk mitigation mechanisms
         such as firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems);
    •    Provides a verifiable and reproducible log of all the activities performed during the test;
         and

APPENDIX F

SECURITY ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES
OBJECTIVES, METHODS, AND OBJECTS FOR ASSESSING SECURITY CONTROLS




T      his appendix provides a catalog of procedures to assess the security controls and control
       enhancements in Special Publication 800-53. 47 Assessors select assessment procedures
       from the catalog in accordance with the guidance provided in Section 3.2. Since the
contents of the security plan affect the development of the security assessment plan and the
assessment, there will likely be assessment procedures in the catalog that assessors will not use
because: (i) the associated security controls or control enhancements are not contained in the
security plan for the information system; 48 or (ii) the security controls or control enhancements
are not being assessed at this particular time.

Assessment objectives are numbered sequentially, first in accordance with the numbering scheme
in Special Publication 800-53, and subsequently, where necessary to further apportion the
security control requirements to facilitate assessment, bracketed sequential numbers or letters, as
opposed to parentheses, are used to make that distinction (e.g., CP-9(a), CP-9(a)[1], CP-9(a)[2],
etc.). The initial bracketed character is always a number. For some security controls, the column
with the initial control designation (e.g., CP-9, CP-9(a)) is simply a placeholder to help facilitate
apportioning the control while maintaining the formatting scheme. Although not explicitly noted
with each identified assessment method in the assessment procedure, the attribute values of depth
and coverage described in Appendix D are typically assigned by the organization and applied by
the assessor or assessment team in the execution of the assessment method against an assessment
object.

If the security control has any enhancements (as designated by sequential parenthetical numbers,
for example, CP-9(3) for the third enhancement to CP-9), assessment objectives are numbered
sequentially in the same way as the assessment procedure for the base control, first in accordance
with the numbering scheme in Special Publication 800-53, and subsequently, using bracketed
sequential numbers or letters to further apportion control enhancement requirements to facilitate
assessments (e.g., CP-9(3)[1], CP-9(3)[2]).

The same assessment object may appear in multiple object lists in a variety of assessment
procedures. The same object may be used in multiple contexts to obtain needed information or
evidence for a particular aspect of an assessment. Assessors use the general references as
appropriate to obtain the necessary information to make the specified determinations required by
the assessment objective. For example, a reference to access control policy appears in the
assessment procedures for AC-2 and AC-7. For assessment procedure AC-2, assessors use the
access control policy to find information about that portion of the policy that addresses account
management for the information system. For assessment procedure AC-7, assessors use the

47
  In the event of any differences between the assessment objectives identified for assessing the security controls and
the underlying intent expressed by the security control statements defined in the most recent version of Special
Publication 800-53. Special Publication 800-53 remains the definitive expression of the control or enhancement.
48
   The execution of the RMF includes the selection of an initial set of security controls employed within or inherited by
an organizational information system followed by a control tailoring process. The tailoring process will likely change
the set of security controls that will be contained in the final security plan. Therefore, the selection of assessment
procedures from the catalog of available procedures is based solely on the content of the security plan after the tailoring
activities are completed.



APPENDIX F                                                                                                        PAGE F-1

access control policy to find information about that portion of the policy that addresses
unsuccessful login attempts for the information system.

Assessors are responsible for combining and consolidating the assessment procedures whenever
possible or practical. Optimizing assessment procedures can save time, reduce assessment costs,
and maximize the usefulness of assessment results. Assessors optimize assessment procedures by
determining the best sequencing of the procedures. The assessment of some security controls
before others may provide information that facilitates understanding and assessment of other
controls.



                                         IMPLEMENTATION TIPS
     TIP #1: Select only those assessment procedures from Appendix F that correspond to the
     security controls and control enhancements in the approved security plan and that are to be
     included in the assessment.

     TIP #2: The assessment procedures selected from Appendix F are simply example procedures
     that serve as a starting point for organizations preparing for assessments. These assessment
     procedures are tailored as necessary, in accordance with the guidance in Section 3.2 to adapt
     the procedures to specific organizational requirements and operating environments.

     TIP #3: With respect to the assessment procedures in Appendix F, assessors need apply only
     those procedures, methods, and objects necessary for making a final determination that a
     particular security control objective is satisfied or not satisfied (see Section 3.3).

     TIP #4: Assessors apply to each assessment method, values for depth and coverage (described
     in Appendix D) that are commensurate with the characteristics of the information system
     (including assurance requirements) and the specific assessment activity that supports making a
     determination of the effectiveness of the security controls under review. The values selected
     for the depth and coverage attributes indicate the relative effort required in applying an
     assessment method to an assessment object (i.e., the rigor and scope of the activities
     associated with the assessment). The depth and coverage attributes, while not repeated in
     every assessment procedure in this appendix, can be represented as follows:
     Interview: [ASSIGN ATTRIBUTE VALUES: <depth>, <coverage>].
     [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with contingency planning and plan implementation
     responsibilities].

     TIP #5: Assessors may find useful assessment-related information in the Supplemental
     Guidance section of each security control described in Special Publication 800-53. This
     information can be used to carry out more effective assessments with regard to the application
     of assessment procedures.

     Note: When assessing agency compliance with NIST guidance, auditors, Inspectors General, evaluators,
     and/or assessors consider the intent of the security concepts and principles articulated within the
     particular guidance document and how the agency applied the guidance in the context of its specific
     mission responsibilities, operational environments, and unique organizational conditions.

APPENDIX G

ASSESSMENT REPORTS
DOCUMENTING THE FINDINGS FROM SECURITY AND PRIVACY CONTROL ASSESSMENTS




T       he primary purpose of the security and privacy assessment reports is to convey the results
        of the security and privacy control assessments to appropriate organizational officials.
        The security assessment report is included in the security authorization package along with
the security plan (including an updated risk assessment) and the plan of action and milestones to
provide authorizing officials with the information necessary to make risk-based decisions on
whether to place an information system into operation or continue its operation. Organizations
may choose to include similar privacy-related artifacts in the authorization package to convey
essential information to authorizing officials. All issues associated with compliance to privacy-
related legislation, directives, regulations, or policies are coordinated with the Senior Agency
Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer. 49 As the assessment and authorization process
becomes more dynamic in nature, relying to a greater degree on the continuous monitoring
aspects of the process as an integrated and tightly coupled part of the system development life
cycle, the ability to update the security and privacy assessment reports frequently becomes a
critical aspect of information security and privacy programs.

It is important to emphasize the relationship, described in Special Publication 800-37, among the
three key documents in the authorization package (i.e., the security plan, the security assessment
report, and the plan of action and milestones). It is these documents that provide the most reliable
indication of the overall security state of the information system and the ability of the system to
protect to the degree necessary, the organization’s operations and assets, individuals, other
organizations, and the Nation. Updates to these key documents are provided on an ongoing basis
in accordance with the continuous monitoring program established by the organization. Updates
to similar privacy-related documents occur at a frequency and format determined by the SAOP in
coordination with authorizing officials.

The security and privacy assessment reports provide a disciplined and structured approach for
documenting the findings of the assessor and the recommendations for correcting any weaknesses
or deficiencies in the security and privacy controls. 50 This appendix provides a template for
reporting the results from security and privacy control assessments. Organizations are not
restricted to the specific template format; however, it is anticipated that the overall report of an
assessment will include similar information to that detailed in the template for each security and
privacy control assessed, preceded by a summary providing the list of all security and privacy
controls assessed and the overall status of each control.




49
   In accordance with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) policy, an assessment of compliance with applicable
Appendix J privacy controls must be conducted by the Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP) or the SAOP's
designated representative. SAOP approval is required as a precondition for the issuance of an authorization to operate.
Organizations have the flexibility to determine the appropriate process for SAOP approval.
50
   While the rationale for each determination made is a part of the formal Security and Privacy Assessment Reports, the
complete set of records produced as a part of the assessment is likely not included in the report. However, organizations
retain the portion of these records necessary for maintaining an audit trail of assessment evidence, facilitating reuse of
evidence and promoting repeatability of assessor actions.

Key Elements for Assessment Reporting
The following elements are included in security and privacy assessment reports: 51
•     Information system name;
•     Security categorization;
•     Site(s) assessed and assessment date(s);
•     Assessor’s name/identification;
•     Previous assessment results (if reused);
•     Security/privacy control or control enhancement designator;
•     Selected assessment methods and objects;
•     Depth and coverage attributes values;
•     Assessment finding summary (indicating satisfied or other than satisfied);
•     Assessor comments (weaknesses or deficiencies noted); and
•     Assessor recommendations (priorities, remediation, corrective actions, or improvements).

The Assessment Findings
Each determination statement executed by an assessor results in one of the following findings: (i)
satisfied (S); or (ii) other than satisfied (O). Consider the following example for security control
CP-2(3). The assessor executes the assessment procedure for CP-2(3) and produces the following
findings:

    CP-3     CONTINGENCY TRAINING

             ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE:
             Determine if the organization provides contingency training to information system users
             consistent with assigned roles and responsibilities:
             CP-3(a)    CP-3(a)[1]    within the organization-defined time period of assuming a contingency
                                      role or responsibility; (S)
                        CP-3(a)[2]    defines a time period within which contingency training is to be
                                      provided to information system users assuming a contingency role or
                                      responsibility; (S)
             CP-3(b)    when required by information system changes; (O)

             CP-3(c)    CP-3(c)[1]    thereafter, in accordance with the organization-defined frequency; (S)
                        CP-3(c)[2]    defines the frequency for contingency training. (S)

             Comments and Recommendations:
             CP-3(b) is marked as other than satisfied because assessors could not find evidence that the
             organization provided contingency training to information system users consistent with their
             assigned roles and responsibilities when there were significant changes to the system.



51
  Information available in other key organizational documents (e.g., security or privacy plans, risk assessments, plans
of action and milestones, or security or privacy assessment plans) need not be duplicated in the security and privacy
assessment reports.

During an actual security and privacy control assessment, the assessment findings, comments,
and recommendations are documented on appropriate organization-defined reporting forms.
Organizations are encouraged to develop standard templates for reporting that contain the key
elements for assessment reporting described above. Whenever possible, automation is used to
make assessment data collection and reporting cost-effective, timely, and efficient.

      NIST initiated the Assessment Case Development Project in October 2007 in a joint partnership
      with the Departments of Justice, Energy, Transportation, and the Intelligence Community. The
      interagency task force developed a full suite of assessment cases based on the assessment
      procedures in Special Publication 800-53A, Revision 1. There will be no further development of
      assessment cases effective with the publication of Special Publication 800-53A, Revision 4. All
      previously developed assessment cases will continue to be available and can be downloaded
      from the NIST website at http://csrc.nist.gov/sec-cert. The material contained in Appendix H,
      including the exemplary templates for developing assessment cases will also continue to be
      available in the archived versions of Special Publication 800-53A, Revision 1.

APPENDIX I

ONGOING ASSESSMENT AND AUTOMATION
USING AUTOMATED TECHNIQUES TO ACHIEVE MORE EFFICIENT ASSESSMENTS




O
         ngoing security assessment is the continuous evaluation of the effectiveness of security
         control implementation. 52 It is an essential subset of Information Security Continuous
         Monitoring (ISCM) activities. 53 Ongoing assessment encompasses ISCM Steps 3 and 4
and is initiated as part of ISCM Step 3, Implement, when the collection of security-related
information begins in accordance with the organization-defined frequencies. Ongoing assessment
continues as the security-related information generated as part of ISCM Step 3 is correlated,
analyzed, and reported to senior leaders as part of ISCM Step 4. As noted in Special Publication
800-137, security-related information is generated, correlated, analyzed, and reported using
automated tools to the extent that it is possible and practical to do so. When it is not possible and
practical to use automated tools, security-related information is generated, correlated, analyzed,
and reported using manual or procedural methods. In this way, senior leaders are provided with
the security-related information necessary to make credible, risk-based decisions regarding
information security risk to the mission/business. 54

Automating assessments is a fundamental element in helping organizations manage information
security risks. Evolving threats create a challenge for organizations that design, implement, and
operate complex information systems that contain many hardware, firmware, and software
components. The ability to assess all implemented security controls as frequently as needed using
manual or procedural methods has become impractical for most organizations due to the size,
complexity, and scope of their information technology infrastructures.

One strategy to increase the number of security controls for which assessment/monitoring can be
automated depends on defining a desired state specification and expressing the desired state in a
form that can be compared automatically with the actual state. The desired state is a defined value
or specification to which the actual state value can be compared. Mismatches of the two values
indicate a defect is present in the effectiveness of one or more security controls. For example, an
organizational policy may state that user accounts will be locked after three unsuccessful logon
attempts. The desired state specification would be that applicable devices are configured to lock
accounts after three unsuccessful logon attempts. If, during automated assessment, the security-
related information collected indicates a specific device is configured such that accounts are
locked only after five unsuccessful logon attempts, a mismatch between the desired state (three
attempts allowed before lockout) and the actual state (five attempts allowed before lockout) is
identified. This mismatch may reflect a problem with the effectiveness of Special Publication
800-53 security controls AC-7, Unsuccessful Logon Attempts, AC-2, Account Management, and
CM-2, Baseline Configuration. When such a strategy is employed, security-related information
generated from ISCM activities is equivalent to security control assessment results.

   The concepts and techniques employed by organizations for the ongoing assessment of security controls can also be
effectively employed for the ongoing assessment of privacy controls.

     Special Publication 800-137 provides guidance on Information Security Continuous Monitoring.
54
  Continuous monitoring can be applied effectively to privacy controls consistent with the concepts, techniques, and
principles described in Special Publication 800-137. Senior Agency Officials for Privacy (SAOPs)/Chief Privacy
Officers (CPOs) provide guidance on the ongoing monitoring of privacy controls.

________________________________________________________________________________________________

In order to effectively automate security control assessments using the desired state specification
strategy, it is important to meet the following prerequisites:
•    Automated actual state/behavior specifications are defined;
•    Data-based desired state specifications (comparable to the actual state) are defined; and
•    A method to compute/identify defects (differences between desired and actual state/behavior)
     is defined.

When the prerequisites are met, the assessment system can automatically compute where
differences between desired state and actual state (defects) occur and use that information to
create security assessment reports and deliver those reports to designated personnel via a security
management console (dashboard).

When automated tools are used to conduct assessments, the test assessment method is used. 55 The
organization determines and documents: (i) the specific capabilities 56 or security controls that are
being assessed by the automated tool; (ii) the frequency with which the tool will assess the
capabilities or controls; and (iii) the analysis and reporting requirements for the capabilities or
controls.

To help automate ongoing assessment, NIST and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
have collaborated on the development of a process that leverages the test assessment method and
ensuring the process is consistent with the Risk Management Framework as described in Special
Publication 800-37 and the ISCM guidance in Special Publication 800-137. The automation of
the test method for security assessments is facilitated in the form of a new service from DHS
known as the Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM) program.

The transition from manual to automated assessments requires time to implement the data
collection system to support automated assessments and a security management console to
present assessment results. It also requires time and effort to modify and update the assessment
process. More information on automation support for ongoing assessments and how the DHS
CDM program facilitates ongoing assessment is provided in Draft NIST Interagency Report
8011, Automation Support for Ongoing Assessment (projected for publication in FY2015).




55
   If greater depth and coverage are needed to provide additional assurance, the automated test method may be
supplemented by use of manual/procedural assessment methods (i.e., interview, examine, or manual test).
56
  If a security capability is defined, a mapping of all individual controls that support the capability is documented. If
organizations define multiple capabilities, a many-to-many relationship between security controls and capabilities is to
be expected. See Section 3.5 for additional information regarding security capability assessments.

APPENDIX J

PRIVACY ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES
OBJECTIVES, METHODS, AND OBJECTS FOR ASSESSING PRIVACY CONTROLS




               FUTURE HOME OF PRIVACY CONTROL ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES
      NIST, in cooperation and collaboration with the Best Practices Subcommittee of the Chief
      Information Officer (CIO) Council Privacy Committee, has initiated an interagency effort to
      develop assessment procedures for the privacy controls contained in Special Publication 800-
      53, Appendix J. The format for the privacy assessment procedures will be similar to the
      security assessment procedure format in Appendix F. The assessment procedures and
      supplemental material to be included in this appendix will undergo an extensive public review
      in the same manner that the privacy controls in Special Publication 800-53 were vetted prior
      to be included in the final publication. Organizations should consult their senior agency
      officials for privacy/chief privacy officers for guidance on assessing the privacy controls in
      Special Publication 800-53, Appendix J, until such time when the assessment procedures for
      Appendix J are completed.
