Executive Summary

Organizations have information technology (IT) plans in place, such as contingency and computer
security incident response plans, so that they can respond to and manage adverse situations involving IT.
These plans should be maintained in a state of readiness, which should include having personnel trained
to fulfill their roles and responsibilities within a plan, having plans exercised to validate their content, and
having systems and system components tested to ensure their operability in an operational environment
specified in a plan. These three types of events can be carried out efficiently and effectively through the
development and implementation of a test, training, and exercise (TT&E) program. Organizations should
consider having such a program in place because tests, training, and exercises are so closely related. For
example, exercises and tests offer different ways of identifying deficiencies in IT plans, procedures, and
training.

This document provides guidance on designing, developing, conducting, and evaluating TT&E events so
that organizations can improve their ability to prepare for, respond to, manage, and recover from adverse
events that may affect their missions. The scope of this document is limited to TT&E events for single
organizations, as opposed to large-scale events involving multiple organizations, involving internal IT
operational procedures for emergencies. This document does not address TT&E for a specific type of IT
plan; rather, the TT&E methodology described in this document can be applied to TT&E events built
around any IT plan or around an IT emergency-handling capability that is not necessarily documented in a
plan, such as computer security incident response.

As part of creating a comprehensive TT&E program, a TT&E plan should be developed that outlines the
steps to be taken. The TT&E plan should define the organization’s roadmap for ensuring a viable
capability, and outline the organization’s approach to maintaining plans, as well as enhancing and
managing the capability. Enhancing emergency plans, policies, and procedures will promote more
efficient utilization of capabilities in responding to cyber attacks. In addition, the TT&E plan should
identify resource and budget requirements that enable organizations to achieve an effective, proven
capability, and provide a schedule for conducting various types of TT&E events. Creating the TT&E
program should also involve several other steps, including developing a TT&E policy, identifying roles
and responsibilities, and documenting a TT&E event methodology.

The TT&E program should include several types of events to ensure the availability of a wide range of
methods for validating various planning elements in the context of cyber incidents. The types of events
covered in this guide are as follows:

     Tests. 1 Tests are evaluation tools that use quantifiable metrics to validate the operability of an IT
      system or system component in an operational environment specified in an IT plan. For example,
      an organization could test if call tree cascades can be executed within prescribed time limits;
      another test would be removing power from a system or system component. A test is conducted
      in as close to an operational environment as possible; if feasible, an actual test of the components
      or systems used to conduct daily operations for the organization should be used. The scope of
      testing can range from individual system components or systems to comprehensive tests of all
      systems and components that support an IT plan. Tests often focus on recovery and backup
      operations; however, testing varies depending on the goal of the test and its relation to a specific
      IT plan.

    Many people use the terms “test” and “exercise” interchangeably, such as “performing testing through exercises”. However,
    there are distinctions between the two terms. For the purpose of this document, the term “test” is reserved for testing
    systems or system components; it is not used to describe “exercising” plans.

GUIDE TO TEST, TRAINING, AND EXERCISE PROGRAMS FOR IT PLANS AND CAPABILITIES



     Training. For the purposes of this publication, training refers only to informing personnel of
      their roles and responsibilities within a particular IT plan and teaching them skills related to those
      roles and responsibilities, thereby preparing them for participation in exercises, tests, and actual
      emergency situations related to the IT plan. Training personnel on their roles and responsibilities
      before an exercise or test event is typically split between a presentation on their roles and
      responsibilities, and activities that allow personnel to demonstrate their understanding of the
      subject matter.
     Exercises. An exercise is a simulation of an emergency designed to validate the viability of one
      or more aspects of an IT plan. In an exercise, personnel with roles and responsibilities in a
      particular IT plan meet to validate the content of a plan through discussion of their roles and their
      responses to emergency situations, execution of responses in a simulated operational
      environment, or other means of validating responses that does not involve using the actual
      operational environment. Exercises are scenario-driven, such as a power failure in one of the
      organization’s data centers or a fire causing certain systems to be damaged, with additional
      situations often being presented during the course of an exercise. There are several types of
      exercises, and this publication focuses on the following two types that are widely used in TT&E
      programs by single organizations:

        –   Tabletop Exercises. Tabletop exercises are discussion-based exercises where personnel
            meet in a classroom setting or in breakout groups to discuss their roles during an emergency
            and their responses to a particular emergency situation. A facilitator presents a scenario and
            asks the exercise participants questions related to the scenario, which initiates a discussion
            among the participants of roles, responsibilities, coordination, and decision-making. A
            tabletop exercise is discussion-based only and does not involve deploying equipment or other
            resources.

        –   Functional Exercises. Functional exercises allow personnel to validate their operational
            readiness for emergencies by performing their duties in a simulated operational environment.
            Functional exercises are designed to exercise the roles and responsibilities of specific team
            members, procedures, and assets involved in one or more functional aspects of a plan (e.g.,
            communications, emergency notifications, IT equipment setup). Functional exercises vary in
            complexity and scope, from validating specific aspects of a plan to full-scale exercises that
            address all plan elements. Functional exercises allow staff to execute their roles and
            responsibilities as they would in an actual emergency situation, but in a simulated manner.
Organizations should conduct TT&E events periodically; following organizational changes, updates to an
IT plan, or the issuance of new TT&E guidance; or as otherwise needed. This assists organizations in
ensuring that their IT plans are reasonable, effective, and complete, and that all personnel know what their
roles are in the conduct of each IT plan. TT&E event schedules are often dictated in part by
organizational requirements. For example, NIST Special Publication 800-53 requires Federal agencies to
conduct exercises or tests for their systems’ contingency plans and incident response capabilities at least
annually.

1.    Introduction

1.1   Authority

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed this document in furtherance of its
statutory responsibilities under the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002,
Public Law 107-347.

NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements, for
providing adequate information security for all agency operations and assets; but such standards and
guidelines shall not apply to national security systems. This guideline is consistent with the requirements
of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Section 8b(3), “Securing Agency
Information Systems,” as analyzed in A-130, Appendix IV: Analysis of Key Sections. Supplemental
information is provided in A-130, Appendix III.

This guideline has been prepared for use by Federal agencies. It may be used by nongovernmental
organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright, though attribution is desired.

Nothing in this document should be taken to contradict standards and guidelines made mandatory and
binding on Federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory authority, nor should these
guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the Secretary of Commerce,
Director of the OMB, or any other Federal official.

1.2   Purpose and Scope

Although it is important to have plans in place to help an organization respond to and manage various
situations involving information technology (IT), it is equally important to maintain these plans in a state
of readiness. This includes having IT personnel trained to fulfill their roles and responsibilities; having
plans exercised to validate their policies and procedures; and having systems tested to ensure their
operability. These three types of events can be carried out efficiently and effectively through the
development and implementation of a test, training, and exercise (TT&E) program.

This publication seeks to assist organizations in designing, developing, conducting, and evaluating TT&E
events in an effort to aid personnel in preparing for adverse situations involving IT. The events are
designed to train personnel, exercise IT plans, and test IT systems, so that an organization can maximize
its ability to prepare for, respond to, manage, and recover from disasters that may affect its mission. The
guide describes the design, development, conduct, and evaluation of events for single organizations, as
opposed to large-scale events that may involve multiple organizations. The TT&E methodology
described in this document can be applied to TT&E events built around any type of IT-related plan,
including, but not limited to, contingency plans (e.g., disaster recovery plans) and computer security
incident response plans. The vocabulary related to TT&E varies across organizations; this document
provides definitions of the terms most commonly used for TT&E-related activities and teams.

1.3   Audience

This document has been created for individuals responsible for their organization’s TT&E program.
Specifically, the document is designed to assist the IT personnel responsible for designing, developing,
conducting, and/or evaluating TT&E events in fulfilling these responsibilities effectively.

2.     Establishing a Test, Training, and Exercise Program

An organization’s IT plans need to be maintained to sustain the organization’s ability to prepare for,
respond to, manage, and recover from disasters affecting its mission. 2 Common types of IT plans used
for this purpose are as follows:

      Contingency plan: Recovering and reconstituting IT systems. 3 Contingency plans include
       continuity of operations plans, business continuity plans, and disaster recovery plans.
      Incident response plan: Reporting and managing computer security incidents. 4
The following are the major types of events used to maintain these plans:

      Tests. A test is an evaluation tool that uses quantifiable metrics to validate the operability of a
       system or system component in an operational environment specified in an IT plan. 5 For
       example, an organization could test if call tree cascades can be executed within prescribed time
       limits; another test would be removing power from a system or system component. The
       quantifiable metrics are created by developing a test plan that identifies the systems or
       components to be tested (and the components of any systems being tested) and the overall test
       objectives. Testing that results in components or systems malfunctioning or becoming inoperable
       could indicate problems in personnel training or in IT plans and procedures. Tests often focus on
       recovery and backup operations; however, testing varies depending on the goal of the test and its
       relation to a specific IT plan. Section 6 contains detailed information about testing.
      Training. For the purposes of this publication, training refers only to informing personnel of
       their roles and responsibilities within a particular IT plan, such as decision making, and teaching
       them skills related to those roles and responsibilities. 6 This prepares the personnel for
       participation in exercises, tests, and actual emergency situations related to the IT plan. Training
       personnel on their roles and responsibilities before an exercise or test event is typically split
       between a presentation on their roles and responsibilities, and activities that allow personnel to
       demonstrate their understanding of the subject matter. Section 3 contains a brief overview of
       training events, which are already discussed in detail in other NIST publications.
      Exercises. An exercise is a simulation of an emergency designed to validate the viability of one
       or more aspects of an IT plan. Exercises helps to identify gaps and inconsistencies within IT
       plans and procedures, as well as cases where personnel need additional training or when training
       needs to be changed. In an exercise, personnel with roles and responsibilities in a particular IT
       plan meet to validate the content of a plan through discussion of their roles and their responses to
       emergency situations, execution of responses in a simulated operational environment, or other
       means of validating responses that does not involve using the actual operational environment for

     Organizations also need to maintain IT capabilities, such as incident response capabilities, that are not necessarily
     documented in a plan. For the sake of simplicity, this guide refers to “IT plans” instead of “IT plans and capabilities”.

     Technology Systems.

     The terms “test” and “exercise” are often used interchangeably. There are, however, distinctions between the two terms.
     For the purpose of this document, the term “test” is reserved for testing systems or system components; it is not used to
     describe “exercising” plans.

     There are many types of training events not discussed in this publication. Some are discussed in detail in NIST SP 800-16,

         deployment of personnel. Exercises are scenario-driven, such as a power failure in one of the
         organization’s data centers or a fire causing certain systems to be damaged, with additional
         situations often being presented during the course of an exercise. There are several types of
         exercises, and this publication focuses on the following two types that are widely used in TT&E
         programs by single organizations: 7

         –    Tabletop. Tabletop exercises are discussion-based exercises where personnel meet in a
              classroom setting or in breakout groups to discuss their roles during an emergency and their
              responses to a particular emergency situation. A facilitator presents a scenario and asks the
              exercise participants questions related to the scenario, which initiates a discussion among the
              participants of roles, responsibilities, coordination, and decision-making. A tabletop exercise
              is discussion-based only and does not involve deploying equipment or other resources.
              Section 4 contains detailed information about tabletop exercises.

         –    Functional. Functional exercises allow personnel to validate their operational readiness for
              emergencies in a simulated operational environment. Functional exercises are designed to
              exercise the roles and responsibilities of specific team members, procedures, and assets
              involved in one or more functional aspects of an IT plan (e.g., communications, emergency
              notifications, IT equipment setup). Functional exercises vary in complexity and scope, from
              validating specific aspects of a plan to full-scale exercises that address all plan elements.
              Functional exercises allow staff to execute their roles and responsibilities as they would in an
              actual emergency situation, but in a simulated manner. Section 5 contains detailed
              information about functional exercises.
Although an organization could perform tests, training, and exercises as discrete activities without any
coordination, organizations should consider having a program in place that addresses all three because
they are so closely related. For example, exercises and tests offer different ways of identifying problems
with IT plans, procedures, and training. An effective TT&E program should comprise a combination of
training, exercise, and testing events. 8 The program should include a TT&E plan, policy, event
methodology, and procedures. Using these elements should cause TT&E events to be performed more
consistently and effectively, particularly reducing duplication of effort. A program should also address
resource and budget requirements, and provide a schedule for conducting types of TT&E events. This
section discusses the steps involved in creating a TT&E program. 9

Regardless of the type of IT plans an organization has developed, it should have mechanisms in place to
validate the plans’ effectiveness and manage their maintenance. Organizations that want to establish a
TT&E program should first develop a TT&E plan that outlines the steps to be taken to ensure that
personnel are trained in their IT plan roles and responsibilities, IT plans are exercised to validate their

7
    There are many conventions for categorizing exercises. For example, some people use “tabletop exercises” to refer to
    discussion-based exercises in general, while other people consider “tabletop exercises” to refer to a specific type of
    discussion-based exercise, and use additional terms for other exercises (e.g., “seminar exercises” for exercises that combine
    training lectures and group discussion). Similarly, the term “functional exercise” can be thought of as a generic term for
    exercises involving simulated operations, or it can be thought of as a specific type of operational exercise, with other terms
    used for other exercise types (e.g., “command post exercise” for something very similar to a functional exercise that focuses
    on senior management’s decision-making). The definitions used in this publication are not meant to be definitive, but rather
    to provide a basis for subsequent discussions of exercises in the publication. For more information on other types of
    exercises, see the extensive documentation provided at the Homeland Security Exercise and Evaluation Program (HSEEP)
    Web site, located at https://www.hseep.dhs.gov/.
8
    Although “TT&E” stands for “test, training, and exercise”, the remainder of this publication typically discusses the three
    types of events in the sequence 1) training, 2) exercise, and 3) test because they usually occur in that order (individuals
    should be trained before they participate in exercises, and exercises are usually held before tests are performed).
9
    This section assumes that the individuals creating the TT&E program have already requested and obtained senior
    management buy-in and support.


                                                              2-2

viability; and IT components or systems are tested to validate their operability in the context of an IT
plan. The TT&E plan should outline all elements of the program and ensure that information surrounding
the program is documented. In addition to creating the TT&E plan, other major steps in creating a TT&E
program are as follows:

       Develop a comprehensive policy
       Identify roles and responsibilities
       Establish overall schedule
       Document methodology.
These steps are described in more detail in Sections 2.1 through 2.4.

2.1     Develop Comprehensive TT&E Policy

A TT&E program should include a policy that outlines the organization’s internal and external
requirements associated with training personnel, exercising plans, and testing components and systems.
The policy forms the framework for the purpose and objectives of the program and cites applicable
Federal and internal guidance. The policy further provides the framework or “rules” that govern how the
organization develops and administers the TT&E events. The policy establishes a clear and consistent
framework for creating all of the documentation associated with TT&E events.

Key steps for developing a TT&E policy are as follows:

       Win the support and involvement of senior management, which includes ensuring that senior
        managers understand the program, the resources needed to make the program successful, the
        benefits and need for having the program, and any potential risks involved in creating the
        program
       Identify all relevant planning documentation (internal and external), such as past training records;
        organization’s policies; Federal guidance; and other practices obtained from other organizations
        or industry partners
       Collect all governing documentation and maintain the documentation within a central repository.
The following are suggested elements to include in a TT&E policy:

       Purpose
       Effective date
       Objectives
       Applicability and scope
       Authorities and related policies
       Roles and responsibilities of key business units and staff positions
       TT&E requirements
       TT&E review and approval




                                                      2-3
GUIDE TO TEST, TRAINING, AND EXERCISE PROGRAMS FOR IT PLANS AND CAPABILITIES



       Enforcement and compliance
       Points of contact for additional information
       Definition of terms.
Once the TT&E policy is developed, the policy statement should be updated as new guidance is applied to
or impacts the program.

2.2     Identify TT&E Roles and Responsibilities

The office with primary oversight of and responsibility for a TT&E program varies based on the structure
or requirements of the organization. In many organizations, it is led within the Office of the Chief
Information Officer (OCIO). The TT&E program should be managed by a person or team with direct
responsibility for the organization’s IT planning capability. The program should have an IT plan
coordinator who is responsible for all aspects of IT planning, including the TT&E element of maintaining
the IT plans. The IT plan coordinator has overall responsibility for the IT plans, including development,
implementation, and maintenance. One of the IT plan coordinator’s responsibilities is to identify a TT&E
program coordinator, who is responsible for developing a TT&E plan and coordinating events. To plan
and conduct TT&E events, the TT&E program coordinator works with event design teams. Organizations
might elect to purchase specialized software or obtain external support to assist in forming or staffing
these teams. Sections 4 through 6 contain information on the individual design teams and the roles within
each team.

2.3     Establish Overall TT&E Schedule

The TT&E plan should document the projected schedule of activities to be performed within the TT&E
program. Although events should be conducted as needed, organizations should evaluate the required
frequency of its events and document the frequency of each event in a TT&E schedule. For example,
NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53 requires Federal agencies to conduct exercises or tests for their
systems’ contingency plans and incident response capabilities at least annually. Sections 4 through 6
provide additional detail on how to evaluate an organization’s specific TT&E needs.

2.4     Document TT&E Event Methodology

As part of creating a TT&E program, an organization should select and document a high-level
methodology for planning and performing TT&E events. Figure 2-1 shows one commonly used
methodology, which has four phases:

       Design the event. The TT&E program coordinator works with the plan coordinator to determine
        the TT&E event topic and scope based on the current needs of the organization. Examples of
        topics include training personnel on their specific roles and responsibilities within an IT plan,
        exercising response procedures, and testing a specific system. Next, the TT&E program
        coordinator identifies the objectives based on the topic and scope, and the personnel that should
        participate in the event. The TT&E program coordinator also identifies an event design team,
        which may consist of one person or a group of people, depending on the requirements of the
        event. The TT&E program coordinator oversees the event logistics, which could include
        document printing, room setup, meals, and audiovisual equipment.
       Develop the event documentation. Upon completion of the design phase, the TT&E program
        coordinator works with the design team on the development of the documentation to be used
        before, during, and after the event. The types of documentation vary for each type of event, but



                                                      2-4
                                     GUIDE TO TEST, TRAINING, AND EXERCISE PROGRAMS FOR IT PLANS AND CAPABILITIES



         examples include briefing materials, participant manuals, instructor and facilitator guides, test
         plans and scripts, and evaluation criteria.
       Conduct the event. In this phase, the event—the training, exercise, or test—is actually
        conducted. The details of this vary greatly by event type and scope.
       Evaluate lessons learned from the event. The evaluation phase is used to analyze the event and
        identify lessons learned, both to improve the IT plans and their execution, and to improve the
        TT&E process. Evaluation is performed somewhat differently by event type, as follows:

         –    Training: Participants typically complete an evaluation/critique form on the success of the
              event and areas where enhancements can be made in terms of the personnel’s knowledge of
              the trained subject matter. Feedback is analyzed and documented in a training analysis
              report, and future sessions are modified as needed.

         –    Exercise or test: Participants typically engage in a facilitated debrief, also called a hotwash,
              to discuss areas that went particularly well and areas where enhancements can be made in
              terms of the plan’s contents and/or the tested systems. Findings discussed during the debrief,
              observations made during the course of the event, and considerations for enhancement are
              documented in an after action report.
Although the details of each phase typically vary based on the type of event conducted, the same phases
should be used for each event. Details pertaining to each type of event can be found within Sections 4
through 6.

                                     Figure 2-1. TT&E Event Methodology

2.5     Recommendations

Organizations should consider having a TT&E program that validates the effectiveness of IT plans such
as contingency plans and computer security incident response plans, and manages their maintenance. The
TT&E program should include a TT&E plan, policy, and event methodology. Using these elements
should cause TT&E events to be performed more consistently and effectively. The TT&E plan should

GUIDE TO TEST, TRAINING, AND EXERCISE PROGRAMS FOR IT PLANS AND CAPABILITIES



outline all elements of the program and ensure that information surrounding the program is documented.
In addition to creating the TT&E plan, other major steps in creating a TT&E program are as follows:

     Develop comprehensive TT&E policy. The policy should outline the organization’s internal
      and external requirements associated with training personnel, exercising plans, and testing
      components and systems.
     Identify TT&E roles and responsibilities. The TT&E program should be managed by a person
      or team with direct responsibility for the organization’s IT planning capability. The program
      should have a plan coordinator who is responsible for all aspects of IT planning, including the
      TT&E element of maintaining the IT plans. The plan coordinator has overall responsibility for
      the TT&E plan, including development, implementation, and maintenance. The plan coordinator
      should identify a TT&E program coordinator, who is responsible for developing a TT&E plan
      and coordinating events. Depending on the type of event conducted, the TT&E program
      coordinator works with one or more design teams.
     Establish overall TT&E schedule. The TT&E plan should document the projected schedule of
      activities to be performed within the TT&E program. Although events should be conducted as
      needed, organizations should evaluate the required frequency of its events and document the
      frequency of each event in a TT&E schedule.
     Document the TT&E event methodology. As part of creating a TT&E program, an
      organization should select and document a high-level methodology for planning and performing
      TT&E events. Although the details of each phase typically vary based on the type of event
      conducted, the same phases should be used for each event. One commonly used methodology
      has the following phases:

        –   Design. The TT&E program coordinator works with the plan coordinator to determine the
            TT&E event topic and scope based on the current needs of the organization. Next, the TT&E
            program coordinator identifies the objectives based on the topic and scope, and the personnel
            that should participate in the event. The TT&E program coordinator identifies an event
            design team, which may consist of one person or a group of people, depending on the
            requirements of the event. The TT&E program coordinator also oversees the event logistics.

        –   Development. The TT&E program coordinator works with the design team on the
            development of the documentation to be used before, during, and after the event. Examples
            include briefing materials, participant manuals, and evaluation criteria.

        –   Conduct. In this phase, the event is conducted—the personnel are trained, the IT plans
            exercised, or the systems or system components tested. The details of the conduct phase vary
            greatly by event type.

        –   Evaluation. This phase involves analyzing the event and identifying lessons learned, both to
            improve the IT plans and their execution, and to improve the TT&E process.

3.     Training Sessions

Training is a continuum of learning activities that enables staff to maintain and enhance their skills and
technical proficiencies and to remain current with technological advances. For the purpose of this
publication, training refers only to informing participants of their roles and responsibilities within a
particular IT plan and teaching them skills related to those roles and responsibilities, thereby preparing
them for participation in exercises, tests, and actual emergency situations related to that plan. 10 Training
events can be instructor-led (e.g., classroom setting, interactive online) or self-study (e.g., paper, online).
The scheduling of training events that support IT plans should be coordinated closely with the schedules
of other events in a TT&E program. For example, training sessions typically precede exercises and tests.
This ensures that personnel are familiar with their roles and responsibilities within a given IT plan before
exercising the plan itself. Another outcome of performing training is identifying areas where additional
training might be necessary.

Other NIST publications have already described training programs and events in detail. Refer to NIST SP
800-50, Building an Information Technology Security Awareness and Training Program, and NIST SP
800-16, Information Technology Security Training Requirements: A Role- and Performance-Based
Model, for more information on training. 11

4.      Tabletop Exercises

Tabletop exercises are discussion-based events where personnel with roles and responsibilities in a
particular IT plan meet in a classroom setting or in breakout groups to discuss their roles during an
emergency and their responses to a particular emergency situation. Tabletop exercises are conducted in
an informal environment, with a facilitator guiding participants through a discussion designed to meet
pre-defined objectives. One or more scenarios may be discussed during a single tabletop exercise. The
duration of a tabletop exercise (typically two to eight hours) varies depending on the audience, the topic
being exercised, and the exercise objectives. Tabletop exercises are cost-effective tools to validate the
content of IT plans, such as contingency plans and incident response plans, to ensure the plan content is
viable and implementable in an emergency situation.

This section provides guidance on evaluating the need for a tabletop exercise, and designing, developing,
conducting, and evaluating a tabletop exercise. The section then summarizes the key elements to consider
before, during, and after the conduct of a tabletop exercise. Appendix A provides a sample tabletop
exercise facilitator guide, sample participant guide, and sample after action report.
4.1     Evaluate the Need for a Tabletop Exercise and Create a Schedule

As part of the TT&E program, the program coordinator should routinely determine the need for a tabletop
exercise for a particular IT plan by considering the organization’s overall objectives for conducting a
tabletop exercise and answering questions such as the following:

       Have the personnel who would participate in the tabletop exercise been trained on their roles and
        responsibilities within the plan? If the personnel have not yet been trained, the TT&E program
        coordinator should consider conducting a training event before the tabletop exercise so that the
        personnel can participate more effectively in the tabletop exercise, increasing its benefits. 12
       When was the last time the organization conducted a tabletop exercise for the plan?
       Have recent organizational changes been made that could impact the content of the plan?
       Has new TT&E guidance been issued that could impact the content of the plan?

Organizations should conduct tabletop exercises periodically; following organizational changes, updates
to an IT plan, or the issuance of new TT&E guidance; or as otherwise needed. For each tabletop exercise,
the program coordinator should choose a form of tabletop exercise that is well-suited to meeting the
identified needs and objectives. The tabletop exercise schedule should be coordinated closely with the
schedules of the other events of the TT&E program. The TT&E program coordinator usually ensures that
tabletop exercises are scheduled within a reasonable timeframe after a training event so that the personnel
participating in the tabletop exercise are recently trained in their roles and responsibilities. It is important
that when an exercise is being scheduled, managers are notified and their approval obtained. Ensuring
that management has agreed to an exercise is an essential step in the development of the exercise.

4.2     Design the Tabletop Exercise Event

Once the need to conduct a tabletop exercise has been established, the TT&E program coordinator should
work with the tabletop exercise design team to design the event. The design phase is often the most time-
consuming phase of planning a tabletop exercise. Planning is typically started at least three months

12
      Some organizations find it more cost-effective to combine a tabletop exercise with a training session that immediately
      precedes the tabletop exercise.


                                                               4-1
GUIDE TO TEST, TRAINING, AND EXERCISE PROGRAMS FOR IT PLANS AND CAPABILITIES



before the conduct date for large, complex exercises and at least one month in advance for less complex
exercises. Sections 4.2.1 through 4.2.6 describe the major steps in the event design process.

4.2.1     Determine the Topics

The design team should determine the exercise topic based on the focus of the plan being exercised.
General topics can include contingency planning and incident response; specific topics range from
sustaining essential functions to managing and reporting IT security incidents. For example, disaster
recovery plan exercise discussion topics would likely include the roles and responsibilities of personnel
with regard to the processes and procedures associated with restoring an organization’s information
systems. Incident response plan exercise discussion topics would likely include processes and procedures
for managing and reporting IT security incidents.

4.2.2     Determine the Scope

The scope of the tabletop exercise should be determined based on the target audience. All personnel with
responsibilities under the IT plan should participate in exercises; however, senior-level teams and
operational-level teams should participate in separate tabletop exercises initially because of their different
levels of responsibility. Once these two groups have been exercised individually, both groups should
participate in a combined exercise to validate coordination between the groups.

The exercise should apply to the roles and responsibilities of personnel within the IT plan being exercised
and focus on validating that the documented roles, responsibilities, and interdependencies are accurate
and current. The types of questions asked of the participants during the course of the exercise should be
tailored to the level of personnel exercised. Senior-level tabletop exercises typically range from two to
four hours, while operational-level tabletop exercises range from two to eight hours. To ensure that the
knowledge of the roles and responsibilities identified in the plan being exercised is current, it is often
effective to conduct a training session in conjunction with any tabletop exercise lasting more than four
hours.

4.2.3     Identify the Objectives

The objectives of any tabletop exercise should be validating the content of the IT plan and related policies
and procedures, validating participants’ roles and responsibilities as documented in the plan, and
validating the interdependencies documented in the plan. An additional objective for some exercises is
meeting regulatory and other such requirements associated with exercising plans, such as the requirement
in NIST SP 800-53 for Federal agencies to conduct exercises or tests for their systems’ contingency plans
at least annually.

4.2.4     Identify the Participants

Based on the topic, scope, and objectives of the exercise, the design team determines who should
participate in the event. 13 The participants should be comprised of the personnel with roles and
responsibilities identified in the plan to help ensure the exercise meets its stated objectives. For example,
senior-level personnel should be invited to participate if the primary exercise objective is to validate the
decision-making and oversight processes within the plan. If the primary objective is to validate
operational procedures, operational-level personnel should be invited to the exercise. If both groups have
participated in previous tabletop exercises separately, it is appropriate to conduct a combined session,
where senior-level and operational-level personnel discuss individual and team roles and responsibilities
13
     Depending on the requirements that the exercise is intended to fulfill, it may be necessary to make participation mandatory
     for designated personnel.


                                                               4-2
                                         GUIDE TO TEST, TRAINING, AND EXERCISE PROGRAMS FOR IT PLANS AND CAPABILITIES



and coordination requirements. Once the appropriate participants have been identified, they should
receive a written invitation or announcement of the exercise as soon as possible. This is typically
accomplished in the form of an e-mail or memorandum by a member of the tabletop exercise design team,
but, if more appropriate, may instead be distributed by a member of management.

4.2.5     Identify the Tabletop Exercise Staff

The design team usually designates an exercise facilitator, who leads the discussion among the exercise
participants, and a data collector, who records information about the actions that occur during the
exercise. The facilitator and the data collector should be thoroughly familiar with the content of the IT
plan being exercised and with the exercise objectives. The facilitator and data collector should meet
before the event to discuss the details surrounding the exercise, including its scope and objectives. At this
time, the facilitator and the data collector review the results from previous tabletop exercises, if
applicable, to heighten their awareness of potential issues before the event.

4.2.6     Coordinate the Logistics

One person on the design team should typically be responsible for coordinating the exercise event’s
logistics. The logistics coordinator usually begins to do this at least one month before the conduct of the
tabletop exercise. The checklist in Table 4-1 can be used as a starting point by the logistics coordinator to
ensure the necessary tasks are completed.

                        Table 4-1. Sample Logistics Checklist for Tabletop Exercise Events

                                    Logistics                                     Target Date         Completed

Arrange for the printing of name tents
Ensure conference room is available in sufficient time before the exercise to
perform setup
Arrange for refreshments, if appropriate
Copy all files as a backup onto a CD-ROM, USB flash drive, or other
removable media



4.3     Develop the Tabletop Exercise Material

Once the event is designed, the design team should assign roles and responsibilities to its members to
develop the tabletop exercise material. Tabletop exercises typically include the following documentation:

       Briefing. A briefing is created for the participants; it includes an agenda and logistics
        information.



                                                           4-3
GUIDE TO TEST, TRAINING, AND EXERCISE PROGRAMS FOR IT PLANS AND CAPABILITIES



       Facilitator Guide. The facilitator guide includes the following:

          –    The purpose for conducting the exercise

          –    The exercise’s scope and objectives

          –    The exercise’s scenario, which is a sequential, narrative account of a hypothetical incident
               that provides the catalyst for the exercise and is intended to introduce situations that will
               inspire responses and thus allow demonstration of the exercise objectives

          –    A list of questions regarding the scenario that address the exercise objectives 14

          –    A copy of the IT plan being exercised.
          The types of questions documented in the facilitator guide should be tailored to the participants.
          For example, if senior-level personnel are the participants, the questions should be of a more
          general, high-level nature and focus on decision-making and oversight, which are consistent with
          their roles and responsibilities within the plan. If operational personnel are the participants, the
          questions should typically be focused on specific procedures and processes that are followed to
          carry out roles and responsibilities.
       Participant Guide. The participant guide includes the same information as the facilitator guide
        without the list of questions. Participant guides contain a modified, shorter list of questions to
        orient participants to the types of issues that may be discussed during the exercise.
       After Action Report. An after action report is developed after the exercise event; it contains
        information based on pre-identified evaluation criteria. The criteria should be developed before
        the exercise to ensure data collectors know what type of information to capture during the
        exercise and, ultimately, document in the after action report. Evaluation criteria are based on the
        exercise objectives and provide a means to evaluate how well exercise objectives were met and
        identify areas where additional exercises might be necessary. After action reports are discussed
        in more detail in Section 4.5.

Sample tabletop exercise documentation is located in Appendix A.

A common misconception is that scenarios must be very detailed to be effective. Actually, it is often
more effective to develop a short, concise scenario. During tabletop exercises with long, detailed
scenarios, participants often spend more time dissecting the scenario and discussing its content than they
spend on meeting the objectives of the exercise. If a detailed scenario is desired, a trusted agent with
detailed knowledge of the plan and all the procedures documented within the plan should aid in the
development of the scenario to ensure accuracy. In addition, the facilitator should have the ability to
redirect the participants’ focus from the scenario to the objectives, should they begin focusing too much
on the content of the scenario.

4.4     Conduct the Tabletop Exercise

Tabletop exercises are usually conducted in a classroom-type setting. This permits a facilitator to address
each individual or the participants as a group while facilitating the exercise. This also fosters
communication among the participants, as does placing a name tent on the table for each participant

14
      Samples of exercise scenarios and related lists of questions are available from NIST SP 800-61, Computer Security Incident
      Handling Guide, and NIST SP 800-83, Guide to Malware Incident Prevention and Handling. Both publications are
      available from http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/.


                                                               4-4
                                           GUIDE TO TEST, TRAINING, AND EXERCISE PROGRAMS FOR IT PLANS AND CAPABILITIES



before the start of the exercise. This is particularly important if participants and teams work within
different operational areas of the organization. Participants are usually not seated with their teammates to
encourage independent thought processes and provide exposure to other operational areas. A copy of the
participant guide should be placed with each name tent. 15

At the start of the exercise, the facilitator welcomes the participants to the event and request that the
participants introduce themselves by name and give a general description of their roles within the
organization. The facilitator then projects the briefing and discusses the scope of the exercise and
logistics information. The facilitator then walks participants through the scenario and kicks off the
discussion with one of the discussion questions documented in the facilitator guide, designed to prompt
decision-making or coordination among participants. 16 Following the kickoff, the discussion occurs
naturally among participants based on the scenario and the objectives. The facilitator may inject periodic
questions from the facilitator guide. If the discussion does not occur naturally, the facilitator should
prompt discussion by asking additional questions from the facilitator guide until all objectives are met.
During the course of the exercise, the data collector should record observations to be included in the after
action report.

Immediately following the facilitated discussion, the facilitator and data collector should conduct an
exercise debrief, often referred to as a hotwash. During the debrief, the facilitator asks participants in
which areas they felt they excelled, in which areas they could use additional training, and which areas of
the plan should be updated.

4.5      Evaluate the Tabletop Exercise

The comments that surface during the debrief, along with lessons learned documented by the data
collector during the exercise, should be captured in the after action report. The introduction to the after
action report should describe background information about the exercise such as purpose, objectives,
participants, and the scenario. The after action report should also contain documented observations made
by the facilitator and data collector during the exercise and recommendations for enhancing the IT plan
that was exercised.

Following the development of the after action report, the plan coordinator might assign action items to
select personnel to update the IT plan being exercised. The plan coordinator should then update the plan,
if appropriate, by implementing recommendations made in the after action report. It may also be
necessary to brief certain managers on the results of the exercise, update other security-related documents,
and perform other actions based on the exercise.

4.6      Summary

Tabletop exercises are discussion-based events where personnel with roles and responsibilities in a
particular IT plan meet in a classroom setting or in breakout groups to discuss their roles during an
emergency and their responses to a particular emergency situation. Tabletop exercises are conducted in
an informal environment, with a facilitator guiding participants through a discussion designed to meet

15
      Although participants typically receive the participant guides the day of the exercise, the exercise design team may elect to
      deliver copies of the guide to participants in advance to provide them the opportunity to familiarize themselves with the
      exercise topic. If the guides are sent in advance, it is often most effective to do so approximately one week before the
      exercise. If they are sent too far in advance, the content may be forgotten. If the guides are sent too close to the event,
      participants might not have an opportunity to read them.
16
      If the tabletop exercise is combined with a training event, the trainer begins the session by providing participants with an
      overview of the plan and their individual and team roles and responsibilities within the plan. The facilitator then administers
      hands-on activities before the scenario discussion that prompt participants to work though problems and identify solutions in
      a discussion-based, team environment.


                                                                4-5

pre-defined objectives. One commonly used methodology for planning and performing tabletop exercise
events has the following phases:

     Design. The TT&E program coordinator works with a tabletop exercise design team to design
      the event. The design phase is often the most time-consuming, and planning for exercises
      typically starts at least one month in advance (three months for large, complex exercises). The
      major steps in the event design process are as follows:

        –   Determine the exercise topic based on the focus of the plan being exercised

        –   Determine the exercise scope based on the target audience

        –   Identify the objectives of the exercise

        –   Identify the individuals that should participate in the exercise and invite them to the event

        –   Identify the staff for the exercise, including a facilitator and a data collector

        –   Coordinate the logistics for the exercise event.
     Development. The design team creates the documentation to be used before, during, and after
      the exercise event. Typical documentation includes a briefing, a facilitator guide, a participant
      guide, and an after action report.
     Conduct. In this phase, the IT plan is actually exercised. Tabletop exercises are usually
      conducted in a classroom-type setting. The facilitator provides a briefing to the participants, then
      walks them through the scenario and initiates a group discussion using a question from the
      facilitator guide. As the discussion continues, the facilitator may inject additional questions
      periodically. The data collector documents issues to be included in the after action report.
      Immediately following the facilitated discussion, the facilitator and data collector conduct an
      exercise debrief, in which they ask the participants in which areas they excel, in which areas they
      could use additional training, and which areas of the IT plan should be updated.
     Evaluation. The comments from the debrief, along with lessons learned during the exercise,
      should be captured in an after action report. The report should include background information
      about the exercise, documented observations made by the facilitator and data collector, and
      recommendations for enhancing the IT plan that was exercised. Outcomes of the evaluation
      could include updating the IT plan or other security-related documents, briefing managers on the
      results, and performing other actions.

5.      Functional Exercises

Functional exercises allow personnel with operational responsibilities to validate their IT plans and their
operational readiness for emergencies by performing their duties in a simulated operational environment.
Activities for a functional exercise are scenario-driven, such as a particular building’s IT systems
becoming unavailable in the simulated environment and the participants then learning that the building is
on fire. Additional situations are often simulated during the course of the exercise. Functional exercises
are designed to exercise specific team members, procedures, and assets involved in one or more
functional aspects of an IT plan (e.g., communications, emergency notifications, IT equipment set-up).
Functional exercises vary in complexity and scope, from validating specific aspects of a plan to full-scale
exercises that address all plan elements. The duration of functional exercises typically lasts from between
several hours to several days, depending on the event’s objectives and the complexity of the plan being
exercised.

This section provides guidance on evaluating the need for a functional exercise, and designing,
developing, conducting, and evaluating a functional exercise. The section then summarizes the key
elements to consider before, during, and after the conduct of a functional exercise. Appendix B provides
functional exercises samples, including a scenario, a tracking form, and an after action report.
5.1     Evaluate the Need for a Functional Exercise and Create a Schedule

As part of the TT&E program, the program coordinator should routinely determine the need for a
functional exercise for a particular IT plan by considering the organization’s overall objectives for
conducting a functional exercise and answering questions such as the following:

       Have the personnel who would participate in the functional exercise been trained on their roles
        and responsibilities within the plan? Have tabletop exercises for the plan been held on which
        potential functional exercises could build? If the personnel have not yet been trained, or initial
        tabletop exercises have not been held, the TT&E program coordinator should consider first
        conducting a training event and a tabletop exercise before the functional exercise so that the
        personnel can participate more effectively in the functional exercise, increasing its benefits.
       When was the last time the organization conducted a functional exercise for the plan?
       Have recent organizational changes impacted the contents of the plan?
       Has new TT&E guidance been issued that could impact the contents of the plan?
Organizations should conduct functional exercises periodically; following organizational changes,
updates to an IT plan, or the issuance of new TT&E guidance; or as otherwise needed. It is usually best
to ensure adequate staff training and tabletop exercises have taken place before engaging in a functional
exercise. The functional exercise schedule should be coordinated closely with the schedules of the other
events of the TT&E program. The TT&E program coordinator usually ensures that functional exercises
are scheduled within a reasonable timeframe after a tabletop exercise event. It is important that when an
exercise is being scheduled, that managers are notified and their approval obtained. Ensuring that
management has agreed to an exercise is an essential step in the development of the exercise.

5.2     Design the Functional Exercise Event

Once the need to conduct a functional exercise has been established, the TT&E program coordinator
should work with the functional exercise design team to design the functional exercise event. The team is
comprised of personnel who are familiar with the plan’s content and can facilitate the exercise design



                                                      5-1
GUIDE TO TEST, TRAINING, AND EXERCISE PROGRAMS FOR IT PLANS AND CAPABILITIES



process. The design phase of a functional exercise is usually started at least a few months before the
desired conduct date, depending on the complexity of the exercise. Sections 5.2.1 through 5.2.6 describe
the major steps in the event design process.

5.2.1     Determine the Topic

The design team should determine the overarching objectives for exercising the IT plan (e.g., as part of a
strategic long-term plan, in response to ad hoc requirements). These broad objectives represent the topic
areas that will be addressed in the exercise. The topic areas chosen will depend on whether the exercise
will address the full plan or specific aspects of the plan. Topic areas addressing the full plan could
include (but are not limited to) validating the plan’s procedures, evaluating an organization’s ability to
implement the plan, and assessing interdependencies of organizations and personnel responsible for
carrying out the plan. Examples of topic areas that are more narrowly focused on specific aspects of the
plan are assessing the plan’s alert and notification process, validating personnel responsibilities associated
with the operational phase of the plan, and evaluating the processes involved in resuming normal
operations.

5.2.2     Determine the Scope

The scope of the functional exercise should be determined based on which portions of the IT plan (or all
of it) should be exercised. 17 If only portions of the plan are to be exercised, the design team should
consider examining a specific phase of plan implementation, such as activation, operation, or
reconstitution, or specific functions.

When determining the scope of a functional exercise, the design team should clearly identify the specific
element or elements of the IT plan that will be assessed and consider the types of participants necessary to
carry out the exercise. Ultimately, a robust TT&E program ensures that all elements of a plan are
exercised; however, the emphasis of initial functional exercises is often placed on operational-level team
roles and responsibilities. As an organization’s TT&E program matures, senior-level participants can also
engage in functional exercises to fully validate decision-making aspects of the plan.

5.2.3     Identify the Objectives

The objectives of any functional exercise should be validating the content of the IT plan, validating
participants’ roles and responsibilities as documented in the plan, validating the interdependencies
documented in the plan, and providing an opportunity for participants to get hands-on practice in
executing their functions. An additional objective for some exercises is meeting regulatory and other
such requirements associated with exercising plans, such as the requirement in NIST SP 800-53 for
Federal agencies to conduct exercises or tests for their systems’ contingency plans at least annually.
Specific objectives should be documented and clearly articulated to exercise participants.

5.2.4     Identify the Participants

Based on the topic, scope, and objectives of the exercise, the design team determines who should
participate in the event. 18 The participants should be comprised of the personnel with roles and
responsibilities under the plan that will be needed to help ensure the exercise meets its stated objectives.
For example, senior-level personnel should be invited to participate if the primary exercise objective is to
validate the decision-making and oversight processes within the plan. If the primary objective is to

17
     A comprehensive exercise of an entire IT plan is sometimes known as a full-scale exercise.
18
     Depending on the requirements that the exercise is intended to fulfill, it may be necessary to make participation mandatory
     for designated personnel.


                                                               5-2
                                        GUIDE TO TEST, TRAINING, AND EXERCISE PROGRAMS FOR IT PLANS AND CAPABILITIES



validate operational procedures, operational-level personnel should be invited to the exercise. Finally, if
the primary objective is to validate the full-scale readiness of a plan, both senior-level personnel and
operational-level personnel should participate. Once the appropriate participants have been identified,
they should receive a written invitation or announcement of the exercise as soon as possible. This is
typically accomplished in the form of an e-mail or memorandum by a member of the functional exercise
design team, but, if more appropriate, may instead be distributed by a member of management.

5.2.5    Identify the Functional Exercise Staff

The design team usually designates an exercise director, who is responsible for all aspects of the exercise,
including staffing, development, conduct, and logistics. The exercise director designates one or more
controllers, who monitor, manage, and control exercise activity; data collectors, who record information
about the actions that occur during the exercise; and simulators, who simulate or otherwise represent non-
participating individuals and organizations whose input is necessary to the flow of the exercise. The
controllers, data collectors, and simulators should be thoroughly familiar with the content of the IT plan
being exercised and with the exercise objectives.

The exercise director, controllers, data collectors, and simulators should meet before the event to discuss
the details surrounding the exercise, including its scope and objectives. At this time, the exercise director,
controllers, data collectors, and simulators review the results from previous tabletop and functional
exercises, if applicable, to heighten their awareness of potential issues before the event.

5.2.6    Coordinate the Logistics

One or more members of the design team should typically be responsible for coordinating the exercise
event’s logistics. The logistics coordinator(s) typically begin to do this approximately three months
before the conduct of the functional exercise. The checklist in Table 5-1 can be used as a starting point
by the logistics coordinator(s) to ensure the necessary tasks are completed.

                        Table 5-1. Sample Logistics Checklist for Functional Exercise Events

                                   Logistics                                     Target Date         Completed

GUIDE TO TEST, TRAINING, AND EXERCISE PROGRAMS FOR IT PLANS AND CAPABILITIES



5.3     Develop the Functional Exercise Material

Once the event is designed, the exercise director should assign roles and responsibilities to the team to
develop the functional exercise material. Functional exercises typically include the following
documentation:

       Briefings. Briefings and/or briefing books are usually created for participants and the exercise
        staff; briefings may be conducted in person or through read-ahead packages. Depending on the
        nature of the exercise, a single briefing might be presented approximately one week before the
        exercise, or multiple briefings might be presented in the weeks and months before the exercise,
        with the final briefing typically occurring a week or more before the exercise. The briefings
        document any information pertaining to the scope and objectives of the exercise, rules of
        engagement, and administrative aspects of the event. In addition, briefings are conducted to
        provide the exercise staff with information pertaining to management aspects of the event, the
        level of activities that are simulated, and the level of activities that are directed by player action.
       Scenario. The scenario is designed to add realism to the exercise by providing participants with
        situations that will inspire responses that help participants achieve exercise objectives. The
        scenario chosen should be crafted to adequately address the broad topic areas and specific
        objectives selected in the design phase. In addition, exercise developers should ensure the
        scenario does not stray outside the scope of the exercise. Exercise scenarios may be crafted to
        explore worst-case situations; however, it is often useful to develop scenarios that cause
        participants to respond to topical issues they are apt to encounter in the real world. For example,
        an exercise of an IT contingency plan for an organization that is prone to disruptions from natural
        disasters may consider a scenario involving a significant power outage caused by a hurricane. A
        narrative scenario is documented and typically distributed to participants via handouts or an oral
        presentation on the day of the exercise.
       Master Scenario Events List (MSEL). The MSEL is a chronologically sequenced outline of the
        simulated events and key event descriptions that participants will be asked to respond to during
        the course of exercise play. It also contains a list of expected actions resulting from the events
        and objectives that should be met based on the events. The MSEL regulates simulated events by
        coordinating the actions of participants and defining the schedule of events. The MSEL should
        be planned carefully to ensure that key events lead to the achievement of exercise objectives and
        that all participants remain active throughout the duration of the event. The MSEL is for exercise
        development and management purposes only.
       Message Injects. A message inject, also known as an implementer or an event inject, is a pre-
        scripted message that will be provided to participants during the course of an exercise. An
        example of a message inject is “The vehicle transporting the backup tapes to the restoration site is
        in a traffic jam, and is expected to arrive 3 hours later than originally scheduled.” Message
        injects can be provided in many forms, including e-mails, letters, memoranda, telephone calls,
        and radio call scripts. Each message inject contains information designed to supplement the
        scenario and prompt additional actions. They expand on the outline of key events portrayed in
        the MSEL; therefore, each MSEL entry may have multiple injects associated with it. The intent
        of each inject is in concert with the storyline of the overall scenario and MSEL, and prompts a
        player to take an action that will ultimately lead to achievement of an exercise objective(s). Each
        inject includes the time at which the message will be injected, to whom it will go, from whom the
        message will come, the means by which it will be delivered (e.g., fax, phone, e-mail), and the
        actual text of the message. The number of injects selected should be designed to keep
        participants adequately occupied but should not be so many that participants will become



                                                       5-4
                                        GUIDE TO TEST, TRAINING, AND EXERCISE PROGRAMS FOR IT PLANS AND CAPABILITIES



          overwhelmed. Therefore, the number of injects selected will vary based on the duration of the
          exercise.
       Message Inject Tracking Form. Message inject tracking forms contain the inject numbers,
        scheduled times for the messages to be injected into the exercise, actual times that the messages
        were injected, summaries of the message, and any comments for the individuals injecting the
        messages. 19
       Controller, Data Collector, and Simulator Books. These books contain all information
        relevant to the exercise staff. Each controller, data collector, and simulator typically receives a
        book the day of the exercise (or the day of the briefing, if deemed appropriate) containing
        information pertinent to their roles during the exercise. The books contain the exercise scenario,
        MSEL, and injects.
       After Action Report. An after action report is developed after the exercise event; it contains
        information based on pre-identified evaluation criteria. Another important aspect of the
        development phase is determining and documenting exercise evaluation criteria that will be used
        by data collectors during the conduct of the event. Evaluation criteria are closely tied to the
        exercise objectives to help data collectors know what type of information to capture during the
        exercise and ultimately document in an after action report. Once evaluation criteria have been
        developed, it is often helpful to create forms or other tools that will aid in the data collection
        process. Such forms instruct data collectors of specific player actions to look for and serve as a
        roadmap that is used in determining whether specific exercise objectives were met, how they
        were met, what improvements may need to be made to the plan that is being exercised, and where
        additional exercises might be necessary. After action reports are discussed in more detail in
        Section 5.5.
Sample functional exercise documentation is located in Appendix B.

In addition to the members of the design team discussed previously, functional exercise material
development might require assistance from other individuals. For example, a trusted agent who has
detailed knowledge of the IT plan and the associated procedures could aid in the development of the
scenario, MSEL, and message injects to ensure accuracy. As described in Section 4.3, it is often most
effective to have a short, concise scenario so that participants do not focus on critiquing the scenario
itself.

5.4     Conduct the Functional Exercise

Functional exercises are typically conducted in real or near-real time and prompt participants to carry out
their roles and responsibilities as realistically as possible. A functional exercise is often initiated by a
telephone call or other appropriate means, alerting selected personnel of the implementation or activation
of a specific IT plan. This alert prompts further notification of all personnel who would be notified via
the means identified in the plan. Once the notification process is completed, participants are expected to
carry out operational or decision-making activities documented in the plan. Depending on the scope of
the exercise, activities could range from implementing notification procedures to deploying to an alternate
site to mobilizing resources, including staff and equipment. The exercise scope dictates whether
deployments or mobilizations are simulated or if they actually occur. Regardless of location, the
participants should carry out the activities as they would according to the plan being exercised.
Participants should be informed of any exercise artificialities during the participant briefing.


19
      Message injects and message inject tracking forms are sometimes included within the MSEL documentation.

GUIDE TO TEST, TRAINING, AND EXERCISE PROGRAMS FOR IT PLANS AND CAPABILITIES



Controllers, data collectors, and simulators should be pre-positioned at the location where the exercise
takes place. Controllers form a control cell—a central location for exercise coordination, typically in a
separate area from the exercise participants—from which the controllers introduce the scenario and
message injects to participants. Controllers administer the exercise by referring to the message inject
tracking form and MSEL to ensure the exercise remains on schedule and within scope.

Data collectors directly observe player actions during the exercise. They refer to the evaluation criteria
and any other evaluation forms that the data collection team may create to aid their efforts. Simulators
assume the roles of various internal and external entities that are not participating in the event, such as
other government organizations, private citizens, or law enforcement. Information provided by
simulators should be delivered in accordance with how it would be provided by the organization(s) being
simulated. They coordinate closely with the controllers and exercise director to ensure their responses are
consistent with the MSEL. Simulators may be collocated with controllers or assemble a response cell in a
separate room. During the course of exercise, the exercise director, controllers, data collectors, and
simulators should remain in constant contact with each other to ensure that the exercise remains
coordinated and on schedule.

The exercise director announces when the exercise concludes. Typically, this occurs when the time
allocated for the exercise has ended, or earlier if all objectives have been met or the MSEL and injects
have been fully played out. In cases where a real-world emergency occurs, it is the exercise director’s
responsibility to call an immediate end to the event. Following the conclusion of exercise play, the
exercise director, controllers, and data collectors should conduct an exercise debrief with participants,
often referred to as a hotwash. The exercise director leads the hotwash and requests feedback from
participants, controllers, simulators, and data collectors. Immediately following the exercise, the
controllers, data collectors, simulators, and participants should be asked to provide the exercise director
with their notes or any forms completed during the course of the exercise and the hotwash session.

5.5   Evaluate the Functional Exercise

During the evaluation phase, the exercise director relies on the design team or other specified staff to
develop the after action report that documents findings and recommendations from the functional
exercise. Exercise notes, forms, and other material created during the course of exercise play and during
the hotwash are the basis of the after action report. The introduction to the after action report should
document background information about the exercise such as the scope, objectives, and scenario. The
after action report should also document observations made by the exercise staff and participants during
the exercise and recommendations for enhancing the IT plan that was exercised. The after action report
should also include a list of exercise participants and may provide information from any participant
surveys that were distributed during the hotwash to solicit feedback.

Following the development of the after action report, the plan coordinator might assign action items to
select personnel in an effort to update the IT plan being exercised. The plan coordinator should then
update the plan, if appropriate, by implementing recommendations made in the after action report. It may
also be necessary to brief certain managers on the results of the exercise, update other security-related
documents, and perform other actions based on the exercise.

5.6   Summary

Functional exercises allow personnel with operational responsibilities to validate their IT plans and their
operational readiness for emergencies in a simulated operational environment. Activities for a functional
exercise are scenario-driven, such as a particular building’s IT systems becoming unavailable in the
simulated environment and the participants then learning that the building is on fire. Additional situations

                                  GUIDE TO TEST, TRAINING, AND EXERCISE PROGRAMS FOR IT PLANS AND CAPABILITIES



are often simulated during the course of the exercise. Functional exercises are designed to exercise
specific team members, procedures, and assets involved in one or more functional aspects of an IT plan.
Functional exercises vary in complexity and scope, from validating specific aspects of a plan to full-scale
exercises that address all plan elements.

One commonly used methodology for planning and performing functional exercises has the following
phases:

     Design. The TT&E program coordinator works with a functional exercise design team to design
      the event. The design phase is usually started three to six months in advance of the event. The
      major steps in the event design process are as follows:

        –   Determine the exercise topic based on the overarching objectives for exercising the IT plan

        –   Determine the exercise scope based on which portions of the IT plan should be exercised

        –   Identify the objectives of the exercise

        –   Identify the individuals that should participate in the exercise and invite them to the event

        –   Identify the staff for the exercise, including an exercise director and one or more controllers,
            data collectors, and simulators

        –   Coordinate the logistics for the exercise event.
     Development. The design team creates the documentation to be used before, during, and after
      the exercise event. Typical documentation includes briefings for participants and exercise staff; a
      scenario; a master scenario events list (MSEL); message injects and a message inject tracking
      form; an after action report; and controller, data collector, and simulator books.
     Conduct. Functional exercises are typically conducted in real or near-real time and prompt
      participants to carry out their roles and responsibilities as realistically as possible. A functional
      exercise is often initiated by a telephone call or other appropriate means, alerting selected
      personnel of the implementation or activation of a specific IT plan. Participants are expected to
      carry out operational or decision-making activities documented in the plan. The exercise
      controllers administer the exercise, including introducing the scenario and message injects to
      participants. Data collectors directly observe player actions during the exercise. Simulators
      assume the roles of entities that are not participating in the event, such as external organizations
      or private citizens. The exercise director announces the conclusion of the exercise. Immediately
      following the exercise play, the exercise director, controllers, and data collectors conduct an
      exercise debrief with the participants, requesting feedback from everyone present.
     Evaluation. The comments from the debrief, along with lessons learned during the exercise,
      should be captured in an after action report. The report should include background information
      about the exercise, documented observations made by the exercise staff, and recommendations
      for enhancing the IT plan that was exercised. Outcomes of the evaluation could include updating
      the IT plan or other security-related documents, briefing managers on the results, and performing
      other actions.

6.      Tests

Tests are evaluation tools that use quantifiable metrics or expected outcomes to validate the operability of
one or more IT systems or system components (e.g., operating system, application, pager, Blackberry)
that are identified as critical in an IT plan. 20 Tests can take several forms, including the following:

       Component testing is testing individual hardware or software components, or groups of related
        components. A component test also might test processes and procedures that are part of any of
        the organization’s IT plans. The testing of hardware or software components at the conclusion of
        their development should also be conducted, but this is not within the scope of this document.
        Component testing in this document is concerned with individual components already operational
        that are critical to the effective operation of the organization that they should be regularly tested.
       System testing is testing complete systems to evaluate each system’s compliance with specified
        requirements. A system test should also include an examination of any processes or procedures
        related to the system being tested.
       Comprehensive testing is testing all systems and components that support an IT plan. These
        tests generally involve multiple components and systems and may become quite extensive in their
        scope. An example of a comprehensive test is confirming that IT operations can be restored at a
        backup site in the event of an extended power failure at the primary site.
A test is conducted in as close to an operational environment as possible, which means that the test should
be conducted in a manner that resembles the everyday work environment in which the system or
component is found. If feasible, an actual test of the components or systems used to conduct daily
operations for the organization should be used. Tests can potentially be disruptive to an organization’s
operations, so tests are sometimes performed on systems that mimic the actual operational systems,
especially if there is not strong confidence that the tests will be completely successful.

This section provides guidance on evaluating the need for testing; creating a test plan; and designing,
developing, conducting, and evaluating a test. The section then summarizes the key elements to consider
during a test and after conducting a test. Appendix C provides test documentation examples, including a
test plan, a test briefing, test validation and evaluation worksheets, and an after action report.

6.1     Evaluate the Need for a Test and Create a Schedule

As part of the TT&E program, the program coordinator should routinely determine the need for a test by
considering the organization’s overall objectives for conducting a test and answering questions such as
the following:

       Is the system or component to be tested installed and ready for operational use?
       Are the processes and procedures for the system or component established?
       Have the personnel been trained on the use of the system or component? Was the training
        effective?

20
      The testing described in this publication should not be confused with testing performed in support of system certification
      and accreditation (C&A) efforts. Testing for C&A focuses on the security of systems under normal conditions, whereas
      TT&E test events focus on the functionality of systems under adverse conditions as defined in IT plans, such as contingency
      plans and incident response plans. Although the requirements of C&A and TT&E test events are usually quite different, in
      some cases it might reduce duplication of efforts to have a single testing event that encompasses both the C&A and the
      TT&E sets of requirements.


                                                               6-1
GUIDE TO TEST, TRAINING, AND EXERCISE PROGRAMS FOR IT PLANS AND CAPABILITIES



       Are there requirements (e.g., compliance efforts, regulations) that mandate certain tests be
        performed on a specific schedule or frequency, such as compliance with NIST SP 800-53?

       When was the last time that this component, system, or group of components and systems was
        tested? Have there been any significant changes or updates since the completion of the last test?

Tests are usually conducted after personnel have been trained on the use of the systems or components
being tested and before the systems or components become operational, to ensure they do not adversely
affect the security posture or other operational aspects of the organization. If personnel have not yet been
trained, system testing should be delayed until the training has been completed. After operational use has
begun, periodic testing should be conducted to ensure the continued proper and secure use of the systems
or components. Comprehensive tests should also be scheduled periodically to ensure that the IT plans are
reasonable, effective, and complete, and that personnel know what their roles and responsibilities are in
the conduct of the plans. High personnel turnover might necessitate more frequent testing to maintain the
level of preparedness the organization requires.

The scheduling of tests should also consider factors such as available resources and the potential impact
on the organization. It is important that when a test is being scheduled, that senior managers are notified
and the potential impact on operations assessed to determine the best time to conduct the test. For
example, conducting a test that might affect the operations of the organization might not be wise during
known peak operational periods. Although scheduling comprehensive tests when many employees are on
vacation or on holiday breaks might have a minimal impact on operations, it also could limit the number
of available personnel. Ensuring that senior leadership in the organization has agreed to the test,
especially for comprehensive tests, is an essential step in the development of the test.

Testing schedules might also be affected by factors external to the organization itself. For example,
compliance and regulatory issues might dictate that certain tests be performed on a periodic basis.
Another example is environmental and safety issues; a test requiring that staff relocate operations from
one facility to another might be better accomplished when the weather is not unpredictable so that
employees do not have to travel under extreme conditions, such as a blizzard.

6.2      Design the Test Event

Once the need to conduct a test has been established, the TT&E program coordinator should create a test
design team 21 to design each specific test. Several factors can have a significant bearing on the design of
the test, including the level of the test (component, system, or comprehensive), the organizational entities
involved, and the scope of the test. These factors can affect the lead time required to develop the test, the
level of complexity for the test, and the length of time the test will take. At an early stage in the design
process, the personnel who will participate in the test should be identified and the senior managers for
these affected areas should be contacted. Sections 6.2.1 through 6.2.6 describe the major steps in the
event design process.

6.2.1      Determine the Scope

The scope of the test should be determined based on current system or security requirements and any
potential compliance or regulatory requirements. The scope of the test is directly shaped by the type of
test. Component tests are more focused and generally involve fewer individuals and organizational
entities. System tests are broader in scope and include more personnel and multiple components.

21
      The test design team should include a team leader and subject matter experts for each of the areas to be tested; they should
      develop the content of the test cooperatively.


                                                                6-2
                                   GUIDE TO TEST, TRAINING, AND EXERCISE PROGRAMS FOR IT PLANS AND CAPABILITIES



Comprehensive tests involve much larger portions of the organization, potentially all personnel, and
require more extensive coordination and planning.

6.2.2   Identify the Objectives

The design team should define the tests that will be conducted and specify the expected results or
outcomes. The test plan could consist of a series of smaller individual tests each designed to examine a
part of the component, system, or group of components and systems being tested. The objectives for each
test should be to measure, check, or verify whether the component, system, or group of components and
systems satisfies its intended purpose and functions adequately. Where possible, the expected results or
outcomes should be expressed in an objective and measurable manner, with subjective measurements
being minimized. The results should be quantifiable and repeatable to the extent reasonably possible.

Tests are often performed as part of standard operational activities, such as restoring a backup, moving a
server from one room to another, upgrading or patching operating systems or applications, or changing
hardware components (e.g., swapping hard drives, replacing a failed power supply). Combining tests
with operational activities is generally more efficient than performing them separately and is also less
likely to negatively impact operations.

Other examples of common tests are activating call tree cascades and determining if they can be executed
within prescribed time limits, and removing power from a system or system component.

6.2.3   Determine the Testing Tools

The design team should specify the assessment tools and procedures needed to accomplish the test. The
specific tools needed may vary greatly depending upon the scope of the test. Tools might range from
specialized software or hardware tools (e.g., network sniffers, vulnerability scanners) to measurement and
recording devices (e.g., stopwatches, cameras, video recorders) to checklists used to measure adherence to
defined processes and procedures. Tools might also include items needed by the test team for logistical
support (e.g., radios, cell phones, badges).

6.2.4   Identify the Participants

The participants in a test vary based on the scope of the test to be performed. Participation in testing
events can be thought of in two levels:

     The first level of participant consists of the individuals who are operating the components or
      systems being tested.
     The second level of participant consists of those individuals who are not directly involved in the
      test, but who might be impacted by the test or related activities. For example, if the test included
      an evacuation drill, the involved participants would be all personnel who were forced to evacuate,
      while affected individuals would include those individuals who might be trying to contact the
      evacuated people but could not reach them because they were not in their offices.
The design team should attempt to identify both levels of participants, although for larger tests the
affected individuals might have to be identified in groups instead of individually. Individuals in the first
level of participants should be notified well in advance of the test through an e-mail or memorandum.
Individuals and groups in the second level of participants should be notified before the test occurs;
examples of this include an announcement to the participants of possible disruptions to the systems being
tested and a message on a help desk phone number stating that disruptions may occur to the systems
being tested between certain hours.

GUIDE TO TEST, TRAINING, AND EXERCISE PROGRAMS FOR IT PLANS AND CAPABILITIES



6.2.5    Identify the Test Staff

The design team usually designates a test director, who is responsible for all aspects of the test, including
staffing, development, conduct, logistics, and oversight of the design team. The test director designates
one or more data collectors, who monitor and record the results of the test. The test director and data
collectors should meet before the event to discuss the details surrounding the test, including its scope and
objectives. At this time, the test director and data collectors review the results from previous exercises
and tests, if applicable, to heighten their awareness of potential issues before the event.

The design team also often includes one or more individuals that are subject matter experts in the areas
being tested. These individuals can help develop the test plan and identify the necessary testing tools.
Because they are aware of the details of the test, these individuals should not be participants in the test;
instead, they can be test observers, facilitators, data collectors, or controllers.

6.2.6    Coordinate the Logistics

The design team should begin to coordinate the logistical support far enough in advance to ensure the
successful completion of the test. The time required for coordination also depends on the scope, and
typically varies from a month in advance for component testing to several months for a comprehensive
test of components and systems for a large IT plan such as a disaster recovery plan or incident response
plan. The checklist in Table 6-1 contains examples of possible logistics actions that might need to be
performed. Although specific logistical elements are identified during the test design phase, it is
imperative that the required list of logistical components be updated frequently, especially after the test is
fully developed.

                               Table 6-1. Sample Logistics Checklist for Test Events

                                    Logistics                                       Target Date    Completed

6.3     Develop the Test Material

Once the event is designed, the design team needs to create test documentation. The magnitude of this
work depends on the scope of the test. This documentation could include the following:

       Briefings. For larger system or comprehensive tests, an initial meeting may be used to signal the
        start of the event. Specific briefings to senior management and to the managers of others that
        might be affected by the test need to be developed to provide an understanding of what the test
        will comprise and why it is important.
       Test Guide. This document outlines the basic steps involved in conducting a test and includes a
        list of the participants. It should also include a list of all individuals and groups who might be
        affected by the test, and discuss procedures for early termination of the test should events
        necessitate this action. This guide provides an overall examination of what will occur during the
        test.
       Test Plans. For each specific test to be performed, a test plan needs to be developed that outlines
        the specific steps that will be performed. Each step should include a list of required logistical
        items and delineate the expected outcome or response from this step. The procedures for early
        test termination should be repeated in this documentation, because the evaluators or the people
        conducting the test should be using the documentation during the test. A list of emergency
        contact numbers (including cell phone and pager numbers) should also be included.
       After Action Report. An after action report is developed after the test is completed. It should
        contain the results of each individual test as well as an overall synopsis of the test activities.
        Corrective actions and recommendations are one element of this report. For larger tests, an
        executive summary for senior management should also be created that provides a synopsis of the
        test, the results of the test, and the recommendations for improvement.
When developing a comprehensive test for an IT plan, there might be significant overlap with what would
occur when developing a functional exercise for the same plan. In fact, many comprehensive tests have
test plans that include materials similar to those used for functional exercises, including a scenario, an
MSEL, and message injects. For example, during a test, participants may be told that a particular backup
tape has failed, a certain server is unusable, or a road to the backup facility is closed. The key difference
between a functional exercise and a test is that a test is conducted in an operational environment
whenever possible, and it is designed to validate the actual effectiveness of both the processes and
procedures for system recovery and restoration outlined in the plan, as well as the training that has been
conducted, to ensure personnel understand their responsibilities and know how to react in a given
situation.

6.4     Conduct the Test

The locations for tests vary based on the type of test being conducted and the test’s scope. For example, a
small component test could be conducted in a single office, while a comprehensive test of components
and systems for an IT plan could involve many different parts of an organization in various locations.

Safety and security are two elements that should be maintained during any test. The organization’s
operational systems and networks need to be protected so that they do not sustain damage. The core
function or mission of the organization should not be disrupted to the extent that the organization can no
longer function and provide the services that it was created to provide. For these reasons, the test director
should monitor all tests closely. At any sign of a possible catastrophic disruption, or in the event that the




                                                     6-5
GUIDE TO TEST, TRAINING, AND EXERCISE PROGRAMS FOR IT PLANS AND CAPABILITIES



safety of an individual is at stake or the security of the organization or its data is in question, the test
director and any member of the test team should have the ability to terminate the test immediately.

Following the conclusion of the test, the test director and data collectors should conduct an informal test
debrief with participants, often referred to as a hotwash. The test director leads the hotwash and requests
feedback from the participants and data collectors. Immediately following the test, the data collectors and
participants should be asked to provide the test director with their notes or any forms completed during
the course of the test and the hotwash session.

6.5    Evaluate the Test

During the evaluation phase, a member of the design team or another selected staff member should
develop an after action report that determines how well the tested systems or components functioned.
The introduction to the after action report should document background information about the test such as
the scope, objectives, and tests. The after action report should also document observations made by the
test team during the test and recommendations for enhancing the IT plan that had its components or
systems tested, along with associated procedures and components. The after action report should also
include a list of test participants and may provide information from any participant surveys that were
distributed during the hotwash to solicit feedback.

The after action report typically takes a few days to prepare. In the event that critical lapses in security or
safety are noted, the test director should not wait until the final report is created to notify management.
An informal report should be generated immediately with any critical changes that should be made, with
the full report following in a reasonable amount of time. A formal debrief is sometimes conducted after a
test so that the test director, plan coordinator, and other management staff can discuss the results of the
test. Stakeholders typically review the report and may provide suggestions for minor wording changes,
such as strengthening a recommendation to ensure that its importance is clear.

Following the development of the after action report, the plan coordinator might assign action items to
select personnel to update the IT plan that had its components or systems tested. The plan coordinator
should then update the plan, if appropriate, by implementing recommendations made in the after action
report. It may also be necessary to brief additional managers on the results of the test, update other
security-related documents, and perform other actions based on the test.

6.6    Summary

Tests are evaluation tools that use quantifiable metrics or expected outcomes to validate the operability of
one or more IT systems or system components that are identified as critical in an IT plan. Tests can take
several forms, including component testing (testing individual hardware or software components, or
groups of related components), system testing (testing complete systems), and comprehensive testing
(testing all systems and components that support an IT plan). A test is conducted in as close to an
operational environment as possible, which means that the test should be conducted in a manner that
resembles the everyday work environment in which the system or component is found. If possible, an
actual test of the components or systems used to conduct daily operations for the organization should be
used. Tests can potentially be disruptive to an organization’s operations, so tests are sometimes
performed on systems that mimic the actual operational systems, especially if there is not strong
confidence that the tests will be completely successful.

One commonly used methodology for planning and performing test events has the following phases:




                                                       6-6
                               GUIDE TO TEST, TRAINING, AND EXERCISE PROGRAMS FOR IT PLANS AND CAPABILITIES



 Design. The TT&E program coordinator works with a test design team to design the event.
  Several factors can affect the design of the test, including the form (component, system, or
  comprehensive), the organizational entities involved, and the scope of the test. The major steps in
  the event design process are as follows:

    –   Determine the test scope based on current system or security requirements and any potential
        compliance or regulatory requirements

    –   Identify the objectives of the test

    –   Determine which assessment tools and procedures are needed to accomplish the test

    –   Identify the individuals that should participate in the test and notify them of when it will
        occur

    –   Identify the staff for the test, including a test director and one or more data collectors

    –   Coordinate the logistics for the test event.
 Development. The design team creates the documentation to be used before, during, and after
  the test event. Typical documentation includes briefings, a test guide, test plans, and an after
  action report. For some tests, especially comprehensive tests, materials similar to those used for
  functional exercises, such as a scenario, MSEL, and message injects may also be needed.
 Conduct. The locations for tests vary based on the type of test being conducted and the test’s
  scope. For example, a small component test could be conducted in a single office, while a
  comprehensive test of components and systems for an IT plan could involve many different parts
  of an organization in various locations. During a test, the mission of the organization should not
  be disrupted to the extent that the organization can no longer function and provide the services
  that it was created to provide. The test director should monitor all tests closely, and if there is any
  sign of a possible catastrophic disruption, or the safety of an individual is at stake or the security
  of the organization or its data is in question, the test director and any other member of the test
  staff should have the ability to terminate the test immediately. After the test concludes, the test
  director and data collectors should conduct an informal test debrief, requesting feedback from
  everyone present.
 Evaluation. The comments from the debrief, along with lessons learned during the test, should
  be captured in an after action report. The report should include background information about the
  test, documented observations made by the test staff, and recommendations for enhancing the IT
  plan that had its components or systems tested. Outcomes of the evaluation could include
  updating the IT plan or other security-related documents, briefing managers on the results, and
  performing other actions.

SAMPLE INTRODUCTION

In an effort to validate [insert organization name] [insert name of plan being exercised 22 ], [insert
organization name] will conduct a tabletop exercise to examine processes and procedures associated with
the implementation of the [insert plan name]. This discussion-based exercise will be a [insert number of
hours]-hour event that will begin at [insert start time] and will last until [insert end time].

The exercise is designed to facilitate communication among select personnel regarding the
implementation of recovery operations at [insert organization name] following an event causing the
outage of mission critical systems that are housed in the [insert facility name]. This exercise is designed
to improve the readiness of the [insert organization name] and help validate existing [insert plan name]
procedures.

Participants should come to the exercise prepared to discuss high-level issues related to the recovery of
mission critical systems at the [insert facility name]. To achieve the exercise’s stated objectives,
discussion will focus on the following [insert facility name] contingency planning elements:

      What would be done to recover each class of system (e.g., Messaging, Web) at the [insert facility
       name]?
      How will system recovery be accomplished and what is the priority/optimal chronology of
       restoration?
      What is the time required for restoration and how can this be optimized?
      What are the expected results and action items that will assist system teams and improve
       readiness after the exercise?
Participants may choose to bring back-up reference material that will aid in answering the above
questions.

SAMPLE CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS

A tabletop exercise is a discussion-based event in which participants meet in a “classroom” setting to
address the actions they would take in response to an emergency situation. Tabletops are an effective
initial step for personnel to discuss the full range of issues related to a crisis scenario. These exercises
provide an excellent forum to examine roles and responsibilities, unearth interdependencies, and evaluate
plans.

Participants will be presented with a scenario affecting the [insert facility name]. A facilitator will help
guide discussion by asking questions designed to address the exercise’s objectives. The facilitator may
choose to inject modifications to the scenario to further stimulate discussion. Participants will also be
encouraged to ask one another questions.

and the termination of operations in the data center. The [insert plan name] was fully activated in
response to this incident, and operations will be conducted at the [insert alternate facility name] for the
foreseeable future. [Insert organization name] employees will be displaced from the building until
smoke, water, and other health hazards are removed. Despite the problem at the [insert facility name],
Directors and Administrators show no sign of altering their agendas and expect a seamless transition of IT
operations to the [insert alternate facility name].

SAMPLE FACILITATOR QUESTIONS

The following questions are designed to be used by the facilitator to guide the discussion and ensure the
pre-defined objectives are met; depending on the flow of the exercise, the facilitator may elect to use
these questions or other questions to ensure participants meet the objectives through the discussion:

    1. Who has authority to activate the [insert plan name]?
    2. If the plan were activated, what level of staffing should be available at the [insert facility name]?
    3. How would you be notified of plan activation and by whom?
    4. What are the roles and responsibilities of the team at the [insert facility name]?
    5. How would the transfer of operations have occurred if critical personnel were injured in the fire
       and could not report to the [insert facility name]?
    6. Are IT recovery procedures fully documented? Are they accurate? Should additional procedures
       be documented in the contingency plan?

 Example Observations and Recommendations:

 Observation 1.       Communications

      A plan identifying standardized systems for communicating with contingency plan members does not exist.

 Recommendations

                 The organization should consider developing a communications plan that establishes standardized
                  communications requirements, addresses how and where backup communication systems will be positioned,
                  and describes procedures for personnel to access backup communication systems.

                 The organization should identify redundant communications systems to ensure that essential personnel can be
                  contacted in the event of an emergency. Redundant communications systems may consist of home telephones,
                  cellular telephones, laptop computers, and other communications systems.

 Observation 2.       Flyaway Kits

      Essential personnel have not been issued flyaway kits, containing personal items and/or those items needed to perform
      their operations, to carry to relocation facilities in the event of an emergency.

 Recommendation

                 The agency should examine the possibility of developing flyaway kits and distributing them in advance to
                  personnel who would relocate during an emergency. In addition to personal items that personnel might need if
                  deployed for an extended period of time, flyaway kits should contain flash drives, diskettes or CD-ROMs with
                  information needed for essential personnel to carry out their essential functions.

The scenario is developed by the functional exercise team during the Development Phase. Scenario
documentation may include a brief Scenario Background designed to provide participants a sense of the
world/local situation in the weeks or months before the start of the exercise. This information will be
provided to participants in briefings before the exercise or at the beginning of the exercise event. The
scenario itself portrays the events that will occur during the conduct of the event. These events will also
become a part of the Master Scenario Events List and will be introduced into exercise play in the form of
Injects.

SAMPLE SCENARIO BACKGROUND

D-Day Minus 20

International tensions have dramatically risen overseas involving strategic interests of the United States.
Despite attempts to resolve disputes diplomatically, troops from hostile countries deploy and appear
poised to make a major military incursion against nations allied to the United States. U.S. intelligence
agencies also detect documented attempts by hostile nations to destabilize the governments and
economies of allies, which would have an adverse impact on U.S. military and economic interests in the
region.

D-Day Minus 10

As tensions continued to build, hostile entities undertake small-scale military operations against allied and
U.S. interests overseas. A U.S. reconnaissance plane is shot down and the bodies of the dead crew are
displayed on television. An emergency Cabinet meeting is called and it is decided that the U.S. military
will deploy to the region to protect allied governments and U.S. interests. It is anticipated that an initial
operational capability to defend U.S. interests will not be complete until next month.

D-Day Minus 5

In response to the U.S. declaration to send troops and materiel to the region, hostile nations vow to take
whatever actions are necessary to “strike a vicious blow against the American imperialists.” They state
that any war that the U.S. provokes will also be fought on the American homeland. U.S. intelligence
agencies soon detect an increase of cyber attacks against U.S. and threats to carry out terrorist attacks
against the U.S. government. Intelligence also indicates that hostile foreign interests within the U.S. are
increasingly active and terrorist cells in other countries have been activated to potentially carry out attacks
against the U.S., both overseas and within U.S. borders. U.S. government officials suspect that the hostile
nations hope to weaken U.S. public support and impede the military’s capability to deploy by engaging in
actions that might include the use of weapons of mass destruction and cyberterrorism. Nevertheless, the
U.S. military continues to deploy to the region.

SAMPLE SCENARIO

D-Day
0900: The United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) issues an alert indicating the
presence of what is thought to be an advanced computer worm. US-CERT estimates that the worm has
already infected over 500,000 computers worldwide in only 2 hours, prompting the center to warn that the
worm’s spread has the potential to disrupt business and personal use of the Internet for applications such
as electronic commerce, e-mail, and entertainment. U.S. intelligence agencies link the worm’s release as
a response to U.S. military deployments and fear the attack may have been designed specifically to
disrupt communications between agencies supporting the military deployment.
Intrusions into numerous Federal Web sites have been reported in recent hours. Hackers, who
government officials believe to be associated with hostile nations, have successfully compromised the
security of various U.S. Government information systems. Anti-government vandalism has also been
reported on numerous department and agency Web sites.

[Insert organization/data center name] is currently in the process of responding to the effects of the worm
and defending against further electronic intrusions.

1000: As a result of credible threats of imminent terrorism and the fear that ongoing electronic intrusions
against Federal information systems may be part of a concerted information warfare attack, the
Department of Homeland Security (DHS) raises the Homeland Security Advisory System threat condition
from an Orange “High” to a Red “Severe” risk of terrorist attack.

1200: A freight train pulling numerous tanker cars passes slowly through the center of the city. Some of
the tankers are carrying methyl isocyanate (MIC), a highly explosive chemical used in the production of
pesticides. As the train passes the [insert name of organization’s facility], one of the tanker cars erupts in
a violent explosion. The blast collapses a portion of the building and results in power outages in the
immediate vicinity. Many personnel in the [insert name of organization’s facility] are killed or injured.

The [insert data center name] survived the blast and emergency power was engaged for critical IT
systems. Several data center personnel had recently left the center for lunch and their well-being is
unknown at this time. Management has directed that the data center implement contingency plans and
relocate to their alternate computing facility. In addition to restoring essential data center operations at
the alternate facility, management indicates that defending [insert organization name] from further
electronic intrusions remains a priority.

D-Day Plus 1
1000: Intelligence and law enforcement agencies continue to track numerous threats against the United
States. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) notifies Government agencies of documented threats of
further attacks against Federal departments and agencies throughout the United States. One such notice to
[insert organization name] includes a report of possible terrorist surveillance activities outside the
organization’s alternate computing facility. As a result, management directs that data center personnel
explore options to move operations to a backup alternate facility in the event that the threat is found to be
credible.

The Master Scenario Events List (MSEL) is created by the functional exercise team during the Development Phase. The MSEL lists key scenario events,
expected Injects that will build on the key events, and the objectives of the each MSEL item. Controllers, simulators, and data collectors will refer to the
MSEL throughout the Conduct Phase of the exercise to ensure the exercise remains on track.

Injects are created by the functional exercise team during the Development Phase. These messages are
introduced by Controllers during the Conduct Phase and are provided to exercise participants via the
means shown on the Inject form. In the case of the Sample Inject provide below, a Controller would play
the role of the Chief Information Officer and would call the Team Chief to provide information and
request follow-on action. Expected actions by the Team Chief or other exercise participants are
documented in the “Notes to Control/Response Cell” at the bottom of this form to aid controllers,
simulators, or data collectors in anticipating what actions will result from the Inject.

Now that we know the magnitude of the damage to the Building and our data center there, it is apparent
that we will be operating out of the alternate facility (AF) for the foreseeable future. Given the continued
threat of terrorist attacks, we need to develop contingency plans in the event of a major outage affecting
the AF. What is our strategy to ensure continuity of mission critical systems at the AF? Which systems
and applications are prioritized for recovery? How long will it take to develop a viable backup for those
systems?

Portions of the Inject Tracking Form are developed by the functional exercise team during the Development Phase, and additional information is
filled in by Controllers during the Conduct Phase. In the sample below, BOLDED text would have been created during the Development Phase
and ITALICIZED text would have added to the form by Controllers during the Conduct Phase. The purpose of the form is to provide Controllers
with a “play book” that states which injects are provided to participants at each given time. The form is then used by Controllers to document the
time at which an Inject is introduced and a summary of activities taken by participants in response to the Inject.

  Example Observations and Recommendations:

  Observation 1.       Communications

      A plan identifying standardized systems for communicating with contingency plan members does not exist.

  Recommendations

                  The [insert organization name] should consider developing a communications plan that establishes
                   standardized communications requirements, addresses how and where backup communication systems will be
                   positioned, and describes procedures for personnel to access backup communication systems.

                  The [insert organization name] should identify redundant communications systems to ensure that essential
                   personnel can be contacted in the event of an emergency. Redundant communications systems may consist of
                   home telephones, cellular telephones, laptop computers, and other communications systems.

  Observation 2.       Flyaway Kits

      Essential personnel have not been issued flyaway kits, containing personal items and/or those items needed to perform
      their operations, to carry to relocation facilities in the event of an emergency.

  Recommendation

                  The [insert organization name] should examine the possibility of developing flyaway kits and distributing
                   them in advance to personnel who would relocate during an emergency. In addition to personal items that
                   personnel might need if deployed for an extended period of time, flyaway kits should contain flash drives,
                   diskettes or CD-ROMs with information needed for essential personnel to carry out their essential functions.

C.1       Sample Component Test Documentation

An example of a component test is the occasional test of the nation’s Emergency Alert System, formerly
known as the Emergency Broadcast Network. 24 During such a test, the equipment is tested, and a tone
and announcement associated with an emergency are broadcasted on the radio or television. Although the
test does not involve a simulated emergency with responders, the message tests a specific component of
the system.

SAMPLE COMPONENT TEST INJECT OR ACTION

Initiate the Emergency Alert System, which will perform the following functions:

     Discontinue normal programming.
     Broadcast the following message: "This is a test. This station [optional—insert station call sign]
      is conducting a test of the Emergency Broadcast System. This is only a test."
     Transmit the two-tone attention signal from the EBS encoder.
     Broadcast the following message: "This is a test of the Emergency Alert System. The
      broadcasters of your area in voluntary cooperation with the Federal, state and local authorities
      have developed this system to keep you informed in the event of an emergency. If this had been
      an actual emergency, [optional—stations may mention the types of emergencies likely to occur in
      their area] the Attention Signal you just heard would have been followed by official information,
      news or instructions. This station [optional—insert station call sign] serves the [insert
      operational area name] area. This concludes this test of the Emergency Alert System."



SAMPLE COMPONENT TEST VALIDATION

A test of a component requires validation criteria to determine whether the component or system
functioned as intended. Test validation should include the metrics by which the success of the component
or system will be measured. It should also detail the expected outcome; in this case, the two-tone
attention signal and message should be heard clearly.

SAMPLE SYSTEM TEST VALIDATION

A test of any system requires methods and criteria to evaluate whether the system test and associated
component tests or processes worked as intended. Test validation should include the metrics by which
the success of the component or process will be measured and detail the expected outcome. System test
validation can be determined by the validation of each individual component test objectives and
validation.

In this example, validation for this system test should verify the backup procedures’ accuracy and
equipment functionality for backing up data for its associated type of systems; verify data integrity
checking; validate local and offsite data storage and retrieval procedures; and verify system restoration
function as expected for each associated type of system.

C.3      Sample Comprehensive Test Documentation

An example of a comprehensive test is the testing of all the systems and components comprising an
organization’s business continuity plan. During such a test, all the equipment, processes, and procedures
for each system and associated components are tested as a comprehensive unit.

SAMPLE COMPREHENSIVE TEST PLAN OVERVIEW

Because a comprehensive test plan is specifically designed around an organization’s security, business
continuity, or other plans, it is not practical to provide a full sample of the test documents. However, this
section provides a plan overview that outlines the systems and component tests as part of the
comprehensive plan. The forms in Appendices C.1 and C.2 for component and system testing can be
used to form individual parts of the comprehensive test.

SAMPLE COMPREHENSIVE TEST VALIDATION

A comprehensive test of many systems and system components requires a method and criteria to evaluate
whether the component or process worked as intended. Because a comprehensive test is a compilation of
many system and component tests, the validation can be determined from the validation of the system and
component, and evaluated as a whole.

Comprehensive test validation should include the metrics by which the success of the component or
process will be measured. It should detail the expected outcome.

SAMPLE COMPREHENSIVE TEST EVALUATION

Based on the objectives and validation metrics, the test should be evaluated to determine whether the
comprehensive test and its associated system and component tests performed adequately. Because a
comprehensive test is a compilation of system and component tests, the comprehensive test will be
determined from the evaluations of the individual system and, and then evaluated as a whole. Possible
improvements and recommendations are an important part of the evaluation process.

COMPREHENSIVE TEST AFTER ACTION REPORT

A comprehensive test after action report should consist of the following components:

     General findings, often in the form of an executive summary
