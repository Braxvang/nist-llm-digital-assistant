57   Abstract
58   This publication provides guidance for federal agencies and organizations to develop and
59   manage a lifecycle approach to building a cybersecurity and privacy learning program (hereafter
60   referred to as CPLP). The approach is intended to address the needs of large and small
61   organizations as well as those building an entirely new program. The information leverages
62   broadly accepted standards, regulations, legislation, and best practices. The recommendations are
63   customizable and may be implemented as part of an organization-wide process that manages
64   awareness, training, and education programs for a diverse set of employee audiences. The
65   guidance also includes suggested metrics and evaluation methods in order that the program be
66   regularly improved and updated as needs will evolve.

67   Keywords
68   awareness; cybersecurity; education; learning program; privacy; role-based; training.

69   Reports on Computer Systems Technology
70   The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and
71   Technology (NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical
72   leadership for the Nation’s measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops tests, test
73   methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance
74   the development and productive use of information technology. ITL’s responsibilities include the
75   development of management, administrative, technical, and physical standards and guidelines for
76   the cost-effective cybersecurity and privacy of other than national security-related information in
77   federal information systems. The Special Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research,
78   guidelines, and outreach efforts in information system security, and its collaborative activities
79   with industry, government, and academic organizations.

 80   Call for Patent Claims
 81   This public review includes a call for information on essential patent claims (claims whose use
 82   would be required for compliance with the guidance or requirements in this Information
 83   Technology Laboratory (ITL) draft publication). Such guidance or requirements may be directly
 84   stated in this ITL Publication or by reference to another publication. This call also includes
 85   disclosure, where known, of the existence of pending U.S. or foreign patent applications relating
 86   to this ITL draft publication and of any relevant unexpired U.S. or foreign patents.
 87   ITL may require from the patent holder, or a party authorized to make assurances on its behalf,
 88   in written or electronic form, either:
 89      a) assurance in the form of a general disclaimer to the effect that such party does not hold
 90         and does not currently intend holding any essential patent claim(s); or
 91      b) assurance that a license to such essential patent claim(s) will be made available to
 92         applicants desiring to utilize the license for the purpose of complying with the guidance
 93         or requirements in this ITL draft publication either:
 94             i.   under reasonable terms and conditions that are demonstrably free of any unfair
 95                  discrimination; or
 96            ii.   without compensation and under reasonable terms and conditions that are
 97                  demonstrably free of any unfair discrimination.
 98   Such assurance shall indicate that the patent holder (or third party authorized to make assurances
 99   on its behalf) will include in any documents transferring ownership of patents subject to the
100   assurance, provisions sufficient to ensure that the commitments in the assurance are binding on
101   the transferee, and that the transferee will similarly include appropriate provisions in the event of
102   future transfers with the goal of binding each successor-in-interest.
103   The assurance shall also indicate that it is intended to be binding on successors-in-interest
104   regardless of whether such provisions are included in the relevant transfer documents.
105   Such statements should be addressed to: sp800-50-comments@nist.gov

197   Executive Summary
198   Ensuring that an organization’s workforce is aware of and prepared to respond appropriately and
199   effectively to cybersecurity and privacy risk is an important effort that requires a strategic
200   approach based on thoughtful planning, resource considerations, and leadership-driven decision
201   making. This long-awaited update to the 2003 NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-50, Building
202   an Information Technology Security Awareness and Training Program, provides guidance that
203   includes awareness, role-based training, and education programs. These programs combine to
204   create an overall Cybersecurity and Privacy Learning Program (CPLP) that supports federal
205   requirements and incorporates industry-recognized best practices for risk management.
206   Legislative authority for the creation and maintenance of this Special Publication is derived from
207   the National Defense Authorization Act of 2021 (NDAA) [2].
208   In addition to the statutory responsibilities under FISMA, this Special Publication supports the
209   National Defense Authorization Act of 2021 (NDAA) [2], Development of Standards and
210   Guidelines for Improving Cybersecurity Workforce of Federal Agencies to “publish standards
211   and guidelines for improving cybersecurity awareness of employees and contractors of Federal
212   agencies” 1 Including privacy as a foundational element in this Program reflects the guidance
213   found in the 2016 update to OMB’s Circular A-130:
214                     …it also emphasizes the role of both privacy and security in the federal
215                     information life cycle. Importantly, the inclusion of privacy represents a
216                     shift from viewing security and privacy requirements as merely
217                     compliance exercises to understanding security and privacy as crucial
218                     and related elements of a comprehensive, strategic, and continuous risk-
219                     based program at federal agencies. [1]
220   Additionally, this update includes elements previously found in NIST SP 800-16, Information
221   Technology Security Training Requirements: A Role- and Performance-Based Model [6].
222   Previously, NIST SP 800-16 [6] identified the federal agency and organizational work roles that
223   required specialized training for cybersecurity tasks and skills. The relevant content from NIST
224   SP 800-16 has been incorporated into this publication or has been included in NIST SP 800-
225   181r1 [3]. As a result, NIST SP 800-16 will be withdrawn upon the release of this publication
226   Everyone in an organization has a role to play in the success of an effective cybersecurity and
227   privacy program. For those whose information technology, cybersecurity, or cybersecurity-
228   related job responsibilities require additional or specific training, the NICE Workforce
229   Framework for Cybersecurity (NICE Framework) 2 [3] identifies the specific knowledge and
230   skills necessary to perform tasks associated with work roles in these areas. 3

245          Introduction
246   Ongoing cybersecurity and privacy risks require continuous attention. An organization must
247   enlist participation from everyone to reduce and manage its risk. A key component of an
248   organization’s cybersecurity and privacy plans are the Learning Program(s), which helps to build
249   an understanding of risks and explain everyone’s role in identifying, responding to, and
250   managing those risks. While Learning Programs vary in each organization, there are fundamental
251   shared elements that can be utilized to create the Cybersecurity and Privacy Learning Program
252   (CPLP) strategy and establish support for implementation, evaluation, and reporting activities.
253   For ease of use, the remainder of this document will use the term “CPLP” to refer to all elements
254   of cybersecurity and privacy awareness activities and campaigns, including awareness training,
255   practical exercises (e.g. table-top exercises, cyber ranges, or phishing campaigns), topic-based
256   training, role-based training, and education programs.
257   The previous version of this Special Publication defined awareness, training, and education as
258   separate elements in a learning continuum. Research efforts [10] conducted with Federal
259   Government training managers have shown that these terms have different meanings and can
260   lead to confusion when describing the broader purpose of building a CPLP. While managers may
261   refer to programs as “awareness and training” or “awareness training,” the terms are applied
262   inconsistently across organizations. Regardless of what the organization calls its program, the
263   overarching goal is to provide opportunities for learning at all levels or stages of one’s career. It
264   is about creating programs where learning can take place.
265   NIST SP 800-181r1, NICE Workforce Framework for Cybersecurity (NICE Framework) [3],
266   refers to an individual who is acquiring specialized knowledge or developing skill as a “learner.”
267   This terminology is useful here as well, so this document will refer to the program as a CPLP or
268   CPLPs, as some organizations may require multiple Programs. Additionally, some organizations
269   may have separate CPLPs.

270          Purpose
271   This document provides guidelines for building and maintaining comprehensive cybersecurity
272   and privacy learning programs (CPLPs) that include awareness activities and campaigns,
273   awareness training, practical exercises, topic-based training, role-based training, and education
274   programs. The document includes guidance on how an organization can create a strategic
275   program plan and ensure that there are appropriate resources to meet the organization’s learning
276   goals.
277   This publication is intended to serve a diverse audience, including:
278      •   Workforce and learning professionals: This group includes human resource planners,
279          training coordinators, curriculum developers, course developers, and those responsible

          Key Considerations for Cybersecurity and Privacy Learning Programs 4
             • Develop, maintain, and implement mandatory organization-wide cybersecurity and privacy
                learning programs for all members of the workforce that support enterprise cybersecurity
                and privacy goals and objectives.
             • Ensure that the CPLP aligns with established rules of behavior and is consistent with
                applicable policies, standards, and guidelines.
             • Apprise the workforce of available cybersecurity and privacy resources, such as products,
                techniques, or expertise.
             • Provide foundational as well as more advanced levels of cybersecurity and privacy training
                to the workforce and ensure that measures are in place to assess the knowledge and skill of
                participants.
             • Identify who needs specialized cybersecurity and privacy training based on assigned
                cybersecurity and privacy roles and responsibilities.

312          Scope
313   The scope of this guide covers the steps that an organization should take to create a strategy and
314   program plan, including the design, development, implementation, and maintenance of a CPLP
315   as part of an enterprise cybersecurity and privacy program. The scope includes identifying the
316   learning needs for the personnel of an organization, from federal and contract employees to
317   supervisors, functional managers, and executive-level managers. As noted previously, CPLPs are
318   inclusive of various other programs, including awareness programs, social engineering
319   campaigns, new hire training, annual training, technical training and requirements for role-based
320   training, and other relevant learning activities. These learning activities may be conducted within
321   the organization or necessitate access to external resources, such as courses, certificates, and
322   advanced programs.

323          The CPLP Life Cycle
324   The CPLP must have an actively managed plan, which requires attention and adjustment over
325   time, throughout the Life Cycle. Learning Program Managers should carefully and thoughtfully
326   outline, discuss, review, and document the CPLP’s goals and available options. When the owners
327   of the organization’s CPLP adopt an effective strategy and develop a proper planning approach
328   with measurement and feedback through the year, the entire organization remains connected to
329   the CPLP objectives. Fig. 1 shows the various phases of building and managing a Learning
330   Program: Plan and Strategy, Analysis and Design, Development and Implementation,
331   Assessment and Improvement.

332
333                      Fig. 1. The Cybersecurity and Privacy Learning Program life cycle

334   These phases can occur in sequence or simultaneously. At any time during the life cycle, the
335   Learning Program Manager and team can develop curriculum, evaluate instructor feedback, send
336   out practical exercise email quizzes, design posters for awareness, or develop a presentation for
337   senior leadership. Consider this diagram a reminder of the breadth of work.
338   In a broad sense, the CPLP is a valued element of the organization’s learning culture. To be
339   effective, the CPLP must be linked to organizational goals and viewed as adaptive, continuous,
340   and evolving. In a learning organization, personnel can expand and enhance their current
341   capabilities to understand and meet new mission requirements. Personnel are respected for their
342   ability to create and inspire others and are active in creating life-long learning achievements. If
343   an organization offers other learning programs (e.g., career development, leadership, and
344   executive development), the CPLP needs to be similarly integrated into the enterprise-wide
345   learning structure.

346          Developing a Cybersecurity and Privacy Culture
347   Establishing a cybersecurity and privacy culture is an important component of establishing a
348   successful CPLP. The culture of the organization should emphasize, reinforce, and drive its
349   desired behaviors toward cybersecurity and privacy. When a CPLP is valued in the
350   organization’s culture, the ability to address risks is increased. The organization’s leaders are
351   strategically valuable in establishing the CPLP as a significant component of managing risk.
352   Leaders create a learning culture by supporting and championing learning activities, from
353   awareness campaigns to role-based training. They help to set the tone for the entire organization.

354   The Government Accountability Office (GAO) 5 noted that in FY 2021 federal civilian agencies
355   reported 32,511 information security incidents. The largest identified percentage (31 %) of
356   reported incidents were from improper usage and 9 % were from email phishing (46 % are
357   shown as “unknown”). Improper usage is defined as “any incident resulting from violation of an
358   organization’s acceptable usage policies by an authorized user.” While these statistics may
359   change from year to year, the high level of incidents from improper usage demonstrates the need
360   for CPLPs. To reduce improper use, it is crucial that every user receives training on the rules of
361   behavior and their role in reducing the risks associated with the organization’s data and systems.
362   To support an inclusive culture, the approach in any CPLP should focus on helping the learner
363   understand their role in the organization with respect to their cybersecurity and privacy
364   responsibilities. The content should indicate to the learner that they are a valued participant in
365   helping the organization manage risk. The workforce appreciates that they will contribute to the
366   organization’s positive cybersecurity and privacy culture with the knowledge and skills they
367   acquire by participating in the CPLP. The stereotypes of “hackers in hoodies” and myth of
368   “technologies solving the problem” are dated. People are an organization’s greatest asset. Any
369   effective learning activity can be incorporated into the CPLP when it is respectful and inclusive.
370   A cybersecurity and privacy culture supports an environment where – from executives to every
371   user – the workforce is well-versed in the cybersecurity and privacy risk management needs,
372   expectations, and values of their organization and understands their roles and responsibilities for
373   meeting them. An organization supports an effective cybersecurity and privacy culture when it
374   understands the needs of the workforce and provides education and training to help employees
375   and contractors learn expected cybersecurity and privacy behaviors.
376   Organizations and system owners must develop a CPLP approach that champions every user’s
377   responsibility to protect information and assets. It is important to recognize how new
378   technologies and new risks will continue to necessitate an organization-wide approach to
379   managing cybersecurity and privacy risks. The NIST Cybersecurity Framework [4], Privacy
380   Framework [5], and the Risk Management Framework (RMF) [7] highlight the importance of
381   awareness and training for personnel.

382              Relationship Between Cybersecurity and Privacy
383   While cybersecurity and privacy are independent and separate disciplines, some of their
384   objectives are overlapping and complementary. Cybersecurity programs are responsible for
385   protecting information and information systems as well as operational technologies from
386   unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction (i.e., unauthorized
387   system activity or behavior) in order to provide confidentiality, integrity, availability and safety.
388   Privacy programs are responsible for managing the risks to individuals associated with data
389   processing throughout the information life cycle 6 in order to provide predictability,
390   manageability, and disassociability, as well as ensuring compliance with applicable privacy
391   requirements. Managing cybersecurity risk contributes to managing privacy risk. However,
392   managing cybersecurity risk alone is not sufficient, as privacy risks can also arise by means
393   unrelated to cybersecurity incidents, as illustrated by Fig. 2.

396   For example, the Privacy Act requires federal agencies to disclose much of the information about
397   individuals in their records when the individual requests it. However, if the organization’s cybersecurity
398   posture does not allow for the efficient sharing of information, individuals risk privacy violations because
399   they may experience problems or harms resulting from their inability to know what information is held
400   about them.
401   Providing the workforce with a general understanding of the different origins of cybersecurity and privacy
402   risks is important for enabling them to effectively address the risks they encounter in their daily activities.
403   For example, all members of the workforce will need training that helps them understand when a privacy
404   event has occurred, and incident response professionals will need training that helps them determine when
405   a cybersecurity incident may also be a privacy event, which often requires additional procedures when
406   responding (e.g., determining if an unsecured site resulted in an actual data breach of PII). Organizations
407   can benefit from taking a coordinated approach to developing CPLPs and have the flexibility to determine
408   how to effectively do so to meet the organization’s needs. 7
409   Once an organization understands the relationship between cybersecurity and privacy in its context, it can
410   determine its approach to developing both integrated and cybersecurity- or privacy-specific learning
411   activities based on the relevant topics and workforce roles in the environment. For example, the
412   organization can determine how to effectively:
413        •     Associate learning tracks with work roles and job performance
414        •     Describe its approach to managing cybersecurity and privacy risk in a way that aligns with
415              enterprise risk management capabilities
416        •     Incorporate lessons learned from cybersecurity and privacy risk, audit findings, incidents, or
417              events, or changes to governance documents (e.g., laws, regulations, policies, and standards) into
418              general and role-based training



      7 Role-based privacy training should address the full scope of privacy risks, as depicted in Fig. 1. For federal agencies, role-based privacy

      training addresses the types of information that may constitute personally identifiable information and the risks, considerations, and obligations
      associated with its processing. Such training also considers the authority to process personally identifiable information documented in privacy
      policies and notices, system of records notices, computer matching agreements and notices, privacy impact assessments, Privacy Act statements,
      contracts, information sharing agreements, memoranda of understanding, or other documentation.

419        •    Institute learning activities that are appropriate for both internal and external members of the
420             workforce, including contractors and third parties
421        •    Identify learning obligations in contracts and agreements
422        •    Identify and track metrics to assess the effectiveness of learning efforts (e.g., determining whether
423             the number of a certain type of incident or event decreases after a targeted awareness campaign)


424             Privacy Risk Management Concepts to Emphasize
425   Members of the workforce who are in roles that can impact privacy must also have a clear
426   understanding of how to identify and address privacy risk that may arise.
427   The NIST Privacy Framework [5] provides a common language for understanding, managing,
428   and communicating privacy risk. Just as the workforce considers the risk associated with security
429   incidents, they must also consider privacy events – the potential problems that could arise from
430   system, product, or service operations with data, whether in digital or non-digital form, through a
431   complete life cycle from data collection through disposal. Privacy problems can arise from an
432   individual’s direct use of a product. Some problems can also arise simply from individuals’
433   interactions with systems, products, and services, even when the data being processed is not
434   directly linked to identifiable individuals. The problems that individuals can experience as a
435   result of data processing can be expressed in various ways. The NIST Privacy Framework
436   describes them as ranging from dignity-type effects (e.g., embarrassment or stigmas) to more
437   tangible harms (e.g., discrimination, economic loss, or physical harm). 8
438   As a result of the problems that individuals experience, an organization may in turn experience
439   impacts such as noncompliance costs, revenue loss arising from customer abandonment of
440   products and services, or harm to its external brand reputation or internal culture. Organizations
441   commonly manage these types of impacts at the enterprise risk management level. By connecting
442   problems that individuals experience to these well-understood organizational impacts,
443   organizations can bring privacy risk into parity with other risks that they manage in their broader
444   portfolio and drive more informed decision-making about resource allocation to strengthen
445   privacy programs. Fig. 3 illustrates the relationship between privacy risk and organizational risk.




      8 The NIST Catalog of Problematic Data Actions and Problems provides examples of privacy problems that individuals may face and is available

447
448                     Fig. 3. Relationship between privacy risk and organizational risk [5]

449   Privacy Learning Programs are most effective when they help the workforce understand both the
450   direct impacts that organizational activities can have on individuals and the resulting impacts that
451   privacy risks can have on the organization. For example, the program can address the types of
452   impacts that an individual may experience from the loss of personal information (e.g., identity
453   theft) and the resulting consequences to the organization (e.g., costs associated with a data
454   breach, such as providing credit monitoring to customers, loss of trust in the organization, or
455   decline in value of stock share price).

456          Coordinating Cybersecurity and Privacy Learning Efforts
457   An organization’s CPLP should coordinate with the cybersecurity and privacy program(s). As
458   discussed in Section 1.4, cybersecurity and privacy risk management practices may overlap with
459   learning needs. With limited resources, duplicating efforts will negatively affect one or both
460   programs. In cases with an integrated cybersecurity and privacy program, this is less likely to be
461   an issue.
462

463          Roles and Responsibility
464   While it is important to understand the policies that require agencies to develop and implement
465   CPLPs, it is also crucial that organizations understand who has responsibility for cybersecurity
466   and privacy learning. This section identifies and describes those within an organization who are
467   responsible for ensuring that the workforce has access to and completes their cybersecurity and
468   privacy learning.
469   It may be useful to refer to related NIST Special Publications for consistent references to the
470   crucial roles in an organization that have a vested interest in the implementation of a robust
471   CPLP. NIST SP 800-37 [7] identifies the typical roles associated with these programs. Since
472   terminology may vary by organization, it can be useful to refer to the NICE Framework as a
473   complementary tool for identifying those with responsibilities for managing the CPLP as well as
474   those who require additional training.

475   The size, maturity, and resources of CPLPs can also vary widely, even within components of the
476   same organization. The roles and responsibilities for key positions in a CPLP should be
477   documented to help ensure the most effective use of resources and enable the program to mature
478   to its desired state.

479   1.8.1. Organization Head
480   Organization heads must prioritize the development of an effective CPLP. This includes
481   implementing a viable cybersecurity and privacy program with a strong learning component.
482   Organization heads should:
483      •    Designate leadership roles to manage the organization’s cybersecurity and privacy
484           learning programs. Empower these roles to develop the strategic direction for the learning
485           program; performance goals and objectives are written; and performance metrics are
486           reviewed and managed. Learning Program Managers, who are responsible for the
487           analysis, design, development and delivery of the CPLP, are identified and given
488           resources adequate to meet the performance goals and objectives
489      •    Ensure that an agency- or organization-wide cybersecurity and privacy program is
490           implemented, well-supported by resources, including personnel and funding, and
491           effective at reducing and managing risk
492      •    Ensure that the agency or organization has enough sufficiently knowledgable and skilled
493           personnel to support its programs and resources and individuals’s privacy

494   1.8.2. Senior Leadership
495   FISMA [9], OMB A-130 [1], and various other regulations designate the responsibility for
496   ensuring cybersecurity and privacy learning programs to certain senior official positions, such as
497   the Chief Information Officer, Chief Privacy Officer, Chief Information Security Officer, and
498   Chief Data Officer. These roles are tasked with setting strategic direction, ensuring resources are
499   available, and overseeing personnel with significant responsibilities for cybersecurity and
500   privacy, including the roles found in the NICE Framework [3]. Senior officials should work with
501   their Learning Program Managers to:
502      •    Establish an overall strategy for the CPLPs
503      •    Provide resource support for the implementation of the CPLPs’ life cycle phases
504      •    Recognize any deficiencies in the organizational culture, risks, or requirements and
505           address them with appropriate program funding and management
506   In addition, senior leaders must champion workforce requirements, such as:
507      •    Leading by example and participating in their own CPLP training, as required.
508       •   Identifying who has cybersecurity and privacy responsibilities and documenting it in
509           position descriptions or other relevant work and performance requirement statements
510       •   Identifying relevant learning requirements and documenting it in individual development
511           plans or other career pathway documentation

512       •   Establishing policies and procedures for learning programs and documenting it in the
513           organizational records
514   A recommended approach for an agency or organization would be to form a Senior Leadership
515   Committee that meets regularly with Learning Program Managers to discuss strategy and provide
516   resource support. The Learning Program Manager will provide the Senior Leadership Committee
517   with regular reports on the Learning Program’s performance throughout the year.

518   1.8.3. Learning Program Manager
519   Learning Program Managers have tactical-level responsibilities for the CPLP. In this role, the
520   Program Manager should, in consultation with the curriculum development professionals and
521   curriculum instruction team:
522      •    Facilitate the development of learning material that is appropriate and timely for the
523           intended audiences
524      •    Provide effective mechanisms for deploying the learning material so that it reaches the
525           intended audience
526      •    Offer users and managers an effective way of providing feedback on the learning material
527           and its presentation
528      •    Oversee periodic reviews and update the learning material when necessary
529      •    Assist in establishing a tracking and reporting strategy
530      •    Assist in identifying who has significant cybersecurity and privacy responsibilities
531      •    Provide senior leadership with regular status reports on the CPLP’s goals, objectives, and
532           performance metrics

533   1.8.4. Managers
534   The term “Managers” includes supervisors and those who have organizational responsibilities for
535   ensuring compliance with cybersecurity and privacy learning requirements for personnel who
536   report to them. Managers should:
537      •    Work with the CIO and Learning Program Managers to fulfill shared responsibilities
538      •    If serving in the role of system owner or data owner, designate staff who have significant
539           cybersecurity or privacy responsibilities on their system (e.g., general support systems
540           and major applications) and ensure that users of their system are appropriately trained in
541           how to fulfill their responsibilities before being granted access to system resources.
542      •    Develop individual development plans (IDPs) for personnel in roles with significant
543           cybersecurity and privacy responsibilities (these IDPs will provide guidance for assessing
544           the knowledge gaps of those with significant cybersecurity and privacy responsibilities)
545      •    Promote the professional development of personnel with cybersecurity and privacy
546           responsibilities and encourage them to acquire industry-recognized certifications

553          The CPLP Plan and Strategy
554   A CPLP strategic plan benefits the organization by providing an organization-wide view of the
555   current state of its cybersecurity and privacy learning, where the organization wants to or needs
556   to be, and how to address the gap between the two states (e.g., resources, staffing.) The strategic
557   plan helps the Learning Program Manager balance their daily responsibilities in ensuring that the
558   organization’s personnel are ready to meet the challenges of the cybersecurity and privacy risks
559   associated with their work.
560   The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130 [1] establishes general policy for
561   the planning, budgeting, governance, acquisition, and management of federal information,
562   personnel, equipment, funds, IT resources, and supporting infrastructure and services. Each
563   federal agency is required to develop, maintain, and implement a comprehensive CPLP to meet
564   its mission needs. To develop a robust program that includes a variety of materials, including
565   offering learners engaging opportunities to stay current on relevant cybersecurity and privacy
566   risks to their organization, the CPLP must have an effective strategy for development,
567   implementation, and continual improvement.
568   This section discusses the steps involved in building a Strategic Plan that takes the organization’s
569   objectives, unique requirements, audience types, and program scope into consideration. The
570   planning stages will also help the organization evaluate priorities, budget, resources, and
571   communication plans.

572          Building the Strategic Plan
573   The CPLP must intersect with the organization’s strategic plan for continual development of the
574   workforce. The owner of the CPLP should understand the structure and mission of the
575   organization to determine where the strategy originates. Some agencies are organized with a top-
576   down approach, where a headquarters function owns the mission and provides guidance on the
577   program strategy. Other organizations develop CPLPs in various business functions or combine
578   both approaches. Documenting the program and how it supports the goals of the risk
579   management strategy shows executive leadership why the program is needed. A well-developed
580   strategic plan describes how an organization’s risk management and workplace learning culture
581   enable all personnel to assess risk with their every action and decision. With agencies of varying
582   sizes, a program that works for one will not necessarily work for another. Each agency must
583   identify the best program that will work for them since one size does not fit all.
584   The CPLP Strategy should always be clearly stated and will most likely be reviewed by the
585   Senior Leadership Committee and agreed upon before any funding is approved. The strategic
586   plan describes how the CPLP supports and aligns with the overall organizational risk
587   management and workforce learning strategy.
588   Key items to address in the CPLP Strategy include:
589      •   Vision and mission
590      •   Strategic goals and objectives
591      •   Training Approaches and Action plans
592      •   Tactics

593      •   Metrics and reporting
594   The CPLP Strategy should also:
595      •   Describe how it supports a culture of risk-based decision making and emphasize the
596          importance of transformational workforce learning, including the development of
597          knowledge, skills, and the capabilities to help workers succeed now and in the future
598      •   Explain how the program will meet knowledge and skill gaps, enhance overall
599          capabilities, and support a culture of personnel engagement in their cybersecurity and
600          privacy roles
601      •   Intersect with the overall mission of the organization (e.g., mission and vision statements,
602          risk tolerance, learning goals and methods, and organizational structure)
603      •   Include information about organizational policies and policy owners, such as how
604          existing rules of behavior, policies, procedures, and guidance will be communicated to
605          personnel
606      •   Include metrics and measures that help determine whether the program is meeting its
607          goals
608      •   Include operational tactics, such as the tools, mechanisms, or methods that the program
609          owners will leverage to achieve program objectives
610      •   Identify key stakeholders, leaders, and roles, many of whom will be within the offices of
611          the Chief Information Officer (CIO), Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), Senior
612          Agency Information Security Officer (SAISO), Senior Agency Official for Privacy
613          (SAOP), or Chief Privacy Officer (CPO)
614      •   Use risk assessment results and existing strategies to inform the alignment between
615          program development, learning materials, and risk management
616              o Gap analysis: Note that existing CPLPs may benefit from a gap analysis or
617                current program assessment to clearly distinguish between the current and target
618                states and enable the program leadership to shape their approach accordingly.
619      •   Identify how the program will meet regulatory and compliance requirements to minimize
620          risks by educating personnel on their roles in the cybersecurity and privacy culture of the
621          organization
622      •   Plan for and support the needs of a diverse workforce, including those with accessibility
623          requirements and those who work remotely or travel frequently
624      •   Include learning methods that are experiential and atomize content (i.e., take existing
625          content and look at how it can be separated into smaller items or repurposed)

626          Develop CPLP Policies and Procedures
627   The CPLP policies and procedures work together to express what the organization wants to do
628   and how to do it. Policies are clear and simple statements, rules, or assertions that specify the
629   correct or expected behavior of an entity. Policies provide the guiding principles for meeting the
630   mission and conducting operations and they can help with risk-based decision-making. Policies

636   acceptable practices and expectations, as well as guidance for how to train personnel on those
637   requirements and expectations. It is important for the organization to have CPLP policies and
638   procedures that align with the broader policies and clearly describe the expectations for the
639   learning programs.
640   The benefits of establishing policies and procedures include:
641      •   Defining clear expectations for the workplace
642      •   Providing executive buy-in of the program
643      •   Providing a documented management and oversight capability that can be audited
644      •   Supporting cybersecurity and privacy assurance strategic goals and objectives
645      •   Clearly identifying information and resources
646      •   Enabling the training of personnel on their information security and privacy
647          responsibilities

649   Examples of Learning Program Policy Statements:
650   The following policy statements are not a prescriptive list of what should be included in
651   Learning Program policies. These are examples to provide context on what is important when
652   establishing, reviewing, or updating cybersecurity and privacy learning program policies. Thus,
653   the statements can include, but are not limited to:
654      •   The CIO and CISO establish a cybersecurity training program for users of [organization]
655          information systems.
656      •   The CPO establishes a privacy training program for users of [organization] information
657          systems that process personally identifiable information (PII).
658      •   All personnel, contractors, or others who work on behalf of [organization] accessing
659          [organization] systems receive initial training and annual refresher training in
660          cybersecurity and privacy awareness and accepted cybersecurity and privacy practices.
661      •   Personnel complete cybersecurity and privacy awareness training within 24 hours of
662          being granted a user account. If a user fails to meet this training requirement, user access
663          is not granted or will be suspended.
664      •   All personnel, contractors, or others who work on behalf of [organization] with
665          significant security responsibilities receive specialized training prior to obtaining access
666          to the systems that process sensitive information and will be required to complete
667          refresher training each fiscal year.

684          Aligning Strategies, Goals, Objectives, and Tactics
685   Organizations can utilize a variety of techniques for identifying and describing the steps needed
686   to implement a program. One method is to begin by identifying the organization’s goals, the
687   objectives to meet those goals, and the operational tactics to meet those objectives. Each goal
688   should have objectives that will often include measurable targets, such as identifying who needs
689   role-based training or training a percentage of the organization by a specified date. Each program
690   objective will have tactics associated with them. Tactics are tools, methods, or mechanisms that
691   enable the program to pursue the objective identified in the plan’s strategy. Ultimately, every
692   individual item in the plan – down to the most detailed tactical level – can be traced back to
693   where it originates in the overall strategy. It is important that every activity support the overall
694   CPLP strategy. Managing the steps to implement CPLPs and ensure that the program meets
695   organizational learning needs requires discipline on the part of the team.
696   Table 1 outlines a model for the strategy that includes goals, objectives, and tactics.
697                                   Table 1. Elements of a CPLP strategy

       Strategy         Learning Program Managers meet to set or reset priorities and develop the
       Plan             CPLP Strategic Plan.

       Strategic        Define distinct elements of the Strategic Plan around which to organize the
       Goals            program. Examples of these include goals such as decreasing susceptibility to
                        social engineering attacks, identifying when to apply privacy risk management
                        measures, increasing the adoption of multi-factor authentication, or including
                        scenario-based training activities.

       Step             Description
       Objectives       Based on the strategic goals, develop objectives that include distinct
                        measurable outcomes and the types of metrics associated with the program
                        element.
       Tactic           Based on the objectives, develop tactics (i.e., the mechanism that the CPLPs
                        will use to achieve a program objective in part or in full). Examples include a
                        phishing exercise to promote awareness of social engineering attacks,
                        enterprise-wide newsletters or other announcement mediums, webinars on
                        multi-factor authentication basics and procedures, or brainstorming sessions
                        with subject matter experts on scenario development.
698
699   The following two example scenarios demonstrate each of the implementation steps.
700   Scenario 1: Protecting Sensitive Printed PII
701   A physical security review of an area in the organization where sensitive personally identifiable
702   information (PII) is routinely handled by many employees finds that basic steps are not being
703   taken to maintain a “clean desk.” Privacy policy requires files that contain sensitive PII to be
704   kept in folders in locked cabinets. During the review, printed files containing sensitive PII were
705   located in paper stacks and in folders loosely placed on the top of the desks.
706   The organizational strategy is to improve the handling of printed sensitive PII and ensure that
707   personnel follow the protection requirements. The Learning Program Manager determines that a
708   fresh, eye-catching awareness product may encourage better employee adherence to policy and
709   reduce this risk.
710   An executive offers available funding dedicated to producing printed materials. The Learning
711   Program Manager may be able to utilize that funding to print “Keep It Clean” stickers to attach
712   to work folders and provide a case of such folders to each member of the workforce in the area
713   that handles sensitive PII materials.
714   In this example, the privacy Learning Program Manager participated in the continual monitoring
715   of the workplace and risks, coordinated the budget, planned the printing of the stickers, and
716   worked with management to deliver the materials. Because this is a one-time issue, the planning
717   steps were streamlined under the existing program.
718          Strategy – Meet privacy compliance requirements
719          Strategic Goal – Support the organization’s Privacy Program
720          Objective – Ensure that all employees who handle sensitive PII are trained and aware of
721          privacy responsibilities
722          Tactic – Provide “Keep It Clean” stickers on folders to each employee in areas of the
723          organization where sensitive PII is processed
724
725   Scenario 2: Developing new regulatory-required training program
726   A new regulation requires all cybersecurity professionals to implement a specific procedure in
727   their daily routines.



                                                       18

728   The cybersecurity Learning Program Manager works with the cybersecurity policy owners to
729   understand and interpret the guidance. Once completed, they define a strategy with goals and
730   objectives and identify a set of program tactics that would deliver new training to all members of
731   the workforce and meet the new requirements with specific new procedures. The cybersecurity
732   Learning Program Manager decides to work with organizational training staff to create an online
733   experience, which would also enable remote workers to participate fully.
734   As the course is being completed, the cybersecurity Learning Program Manager works with
735   organizational leaders and management to identify expected measures of completion and success
736   and to ensure that all necessary members of the workforce are identified and trained. As an
737   element of continuous monitoring, the cybersecurity Learning Program Manager works with the
738   learning office and leadership to test the completion and success of the training.
739          Strategy – Meet new regulatory requirements
740          Strategic Goal – Train cybersecurity professionals
741          Strategic Goal – Build and deliver online training program
742          Objective – Launch new online training program that will enable all employees to meet
743          the new procedure training objectives, even from remote work locations
744          Tactic – Work with management to schedule the training and ensure 100 % compliance
745          in training
746          Tactic – Enable a continuous monitoring program to test completion rates and provide
747          daily tracking to managers

748          Determining CPLP Measurements and Metrics
749   Program measurements and metrics are essential to show the effectiveness and impact of the
750   program, understand where changes are required for success, and meet continued budgetary and
751   resource requirements. There may be regulations that apply.
752   Metrics should determine what should be measured and why. While laws, regulations, and
753   policies often set specific measurable requirements, CPLP metrics should go beyond simply
754   achieving compliance and serve to help measure the CPLP’s impact on workforce attitude and
755   behavioral changes. The metrics should be tied directly to the goals of the program. The
756   Learning Program Managers should identify how the metrics will be collected, how frequently,
757   who should have access to them or receive reports that include information about them, and how
758   they will be shared.
759   Policies and regulations need to be considered, since they often set specific guidelines on what
760   information to gather. CPLPs should be prepared to answer some common questions, such as:
761      •   What policies apply to our organization?
762      •   How often is reporting required?
763      •   What data is required in the report?
764      •   What data are we required to maintain for potential audits?

      August 2023                                                                                                 Privacy Learning Program

765   Learning Program Managers should build programs with efficient data gathering techniques to
766   provide effective reporting information. This will likely include collecting PII on employees that
767   may carry a heightened sensitivity due to context (e.g., training records are often part of
768   employment or contract records and can be tied to performance evaluations or result in
769   consequences for failing to take required training). Learning Program Managers must identify
770   and manage the cybersecurity and privacy risks associated with processing learning data,
771   including risks associated with learning management systems and reporting practices.
772   Developing a CPLP metrics plan can be one of the most important yet most challenging parts of
773   the CPLP effort. An effective set of measurements can help the program get support from the
774   organization, increase funding, reveal impact on the cybersecurity risk management program,
775   and demonstrate returns on investment. In recent research efforts by NIST, participants reported
776   [10] that despite best intentions, their organizations often used a limited number of metrics that
777   did not provide a complete view of program effectiveness. NIST SP 800-55 Performance
778   Measurement Guide for Information Security provides guidance on the selection, development,
779   and aggregation of information security measures and developing an information security
780   measurement program. 9
781   Examples of Quantitative Learning Program Data:
782                •    Cybersecurity incident data, limited to employee-generated incidents or topics that
783                     can be mitigated or addressed in the learning programs
784                •    Metrics on incident reporting, demonstrating employee ability to recognize and report
785                     potential cybersecurity events
786                •    Phishing or other simulated attack responses
787                •    Longitudinal data that depicts program impact over time
788                •    Employee testing data before the learning program, immediately after the learning
789                     program, and three months after attending the course to assess knowledge retention
790                •    Performance data by department, including technical performance measures
791                •    Training attendance, performance assessments, and completion rates
792                •    Closed-ended (quantitative) employee survey feedback
793                •    Cost of development and delivery invested per participant
794                •    Frequency of updating the training material may be used to evaluate relevancy
795                •    Extent of cybersecurity or privacy events, such as reduced downtime or outages due
796                     to events (these may be indicators for role-based training)
797                •    Ability to recognize and report privacy information disclosures or misuse
798                •    Changes following technical training may also provide measurements, such as
799                     reduction of accounts with privileged access, identification of high value assets, new
800                     network segmentation, or additional controls written in acquisition and budget

813   2.5.1. All Users
814   In a typical scenario, all of the organization’s personnel (i.e., the general workforce, including
815   contractors) will participate in the CPLP, agree to abide by the Acceptable Use Policy or
816   Standards of Behavior, complete the annual Learning Program training, and attend, complete,
817   view, and receive the other various ongoing program elements.
818   In NIST SP 800-53 [8], All User training is referred to in the Awareness and Training control
819   (AT-2) as cybersecurity and privacy “literacy” training. As part of or after completing the annual
820   training, users will sign a Rules of Behavior that defines the behaviors required to gain and keep
821   system access. NIST SP 800-53 additionally indicates that the training will also need to be
822   updated for any system changes or following any organization-defined events:
823   “Subsequent literacy training may be satisfied by one or more short ad hoc sessions and include topical information
824   on recent attack schemes, changes to organizational security and privacy policies, revised security and privacy
825   expectations, or a subset of topics from the initial training. Updating literacy training and awareness content on a
826   regular basis helps to ensure that the content remains relevant. Events that may precipitate an update to literacy
827   training and awareness content include, but are not limited to, assessment or audit findings, security incidents or
828   breaches, or changes in applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and
829   guidelines.”
830   All users in the workforce (previously referred to as “system users” and “general users”) are
831   critical to reducing unintentional errors and vulnerabilities. The organization’s personnel may
832   include employees, contractors, foreign or domestic guest researchers, visitors, guests, other
833   agency personnel, and other collaborators or associates who require access. All users must:
834       •    Understand and comply with the organization’s cybersecurity, physical security, and
835            privacy policies and procedures
836       •    Understand and accept the rules of behavior for the systems and applications to which
837            they have access
838       •    Work with management to meet training needs
839       •    Be aware of actions they can take to better protect their organization’s information and
840            environment
841   Examples of topics that the CPLP may address include understanding how cybersecurity and
842   privacy activities support the organization’s mission and business objectives; using proper
843   passwords; backing up data; using proper antivirus protection; reporting any suspected incidents
844   or violations of cybersecurity and privacy policies; following the rules established to avoid social
845   engineering attacks (e.g., ransomware and phishing) and to deter the spread of spam, viruses, and
846   worms; identifying and addressing privacy risks during information processing; and knowing
847   where to find the organization’s cybersecurity and privacy resources and points of contact.

848   2.5.2. Privileged Users
849   Privileged users are trusted with additional access or responsibilities to perform cybersecurity-
850   and privacy-related functions that ordinary users are not authorized to perform. Due to the
851   specialized functions that privileged users typically perform and their ability to access critical
852   resources of the organization, privileged users require additional training to ensure that they
853   understand their account privileges and do not accidently cause or exploit vulnerabilities.


                                                               22

854   Examples of such responsibilities include configuring network management and granting system
855   access (e.g., system administration privileges). For each type of privileged user, the Learning
856   Program Manager must coordinate training with their manager or supervisor, human capital
857   officer, and the training managers to ensure that training is delivered and kept current.

858   2.5.3. Staff with Significant Cybersecurity or Privacy Responsibilities
859   Personnel with significant cybersecurity or privacy responsibilities and some of the privileged
860   users will be required to have training due to the nature of their role within the organization.
861   There are circumstances in which personnel have rights or access to sensitive or critical systems
862   and, therefore, will require additional training. The permitted personnel will have additional
863   access that can be rescinded when their work role changes. Examples of such environments
864   include acquisitions, financial management, healthcare, human resources, and web publishing.
865   NIST SP 800-53, the Role-Based Training control (AT-3) provides a definition for the training
866   required:
867               Comprehensive role-based training addresses management, operational,
868               and technical roles and responsibilities covering physical, personnel, and
869               technical controls. Role-based training also includes policies, procedures,
870               tools, methods, and artifacts for the security and privacy roles defined.
871               Organizations provide the training necessary for individuals to fulfill
872               their responsibilities related to operations and supply chain risk
873               management within the context of organizational security and privacy
874               programs. Role-based training also applies to contractors who provide
875               services to federal agencies.
876   This training is typically associated with job duties determined by organizational leaders, such as
877   the agency’s CIO, CPO, or CISO and the employee’s manager or supervisor, and is typically
878   documented in the employee’s performance plan. Personnel in these work roles may require
879   professional development to maintain their professional status or memberships, such as annual or
880   regular professional certifications or courses. Examples of typical role-based training recipients
881   include the CISO, privacy officers, cybersecurity managers, cybersecurity and privacy analysts,
882   and incident responders. References for cybersecurity work roles or competency areas are
883   explored in NIST SP 800-181r1 [3], which describes the knowledge, skills, and tasks associated
884   with cybersecurity-related work.

885   2.5.4. Determining Who Has Significant Cybersecurity and Privacy
886          Responsibilities
887   FISMA [9] requires personnel with significant cybersecurity and privacy responsibilities to
888   receive role-based training. Additional guidance can be found in NIST SP 800-37 [7], NIST SP
889   800-53 [8], and NIST SP 800-181r1 [3]. In combination, these documents assist with the
890   identification of roles and functions in the cybersecurity workforce that require role-based
891   training. As this document covers the concepts of managing a Learning Program for privacy as
892   well, consider how to extend the same concepts to help privacy professionals meet their own
893   role-based or significant privacy training needs.

894   Determining who in the organization will participate in role-based training is a multi-step
895   process that begins with defining the significant cybersecurity and privacy work roles in the
896   organization and identifying the staff who are aligned with the designated work role. Often, the
897   determination begins with senior leadership with direction from the office of the CIO, CISO, or
898   CPO and in partnership with the Human Resources department. The Learning Program Manager
899   should participate closely in this effort to identify those on their team who have significant
900   cybersecurity and privacy responsibilities and need additional training.
901   The work roles should also be included in position descriptions, hierarchy charts, and
902   responsibilities to show how the work required to achieve a particular objective has been
903   identified. Individuals may assume additional work roles based on their particular skills,
904   organization policies regarding cross-training, and organizational staffing levels. NIST SP 800-
905   181r1 [3] identifies work roles for cybersecurity and is a detailed lexicon for understanding the
906   related knowledge and skills typical for such roles.

907          Determining Scope and Complexity
908   When building any CPLP, the ultimate goal is to reduce risks to the organization, not simply
909   achieve compliance. The material should be appropriate in scope and complexity for the
910   participant, so it is necessary for the Learning Program Managers to consider the different types
911   of workforce participants who will participate in the program. The program material should also
912   contain the right level of complexity and technical knowledge for the audience’s learning
913   objectives and fulfill their training and awareness needs. This requires coordination with Human
914   Resources and the Chief Learning Officers (CLO), or equivalent, in the organization to recognize
915   the roles and responsibilities of individuals in the organization.
916   Individuals who receive the training will appreciate the effort made to ensure that they
917   understand the material in a manner appropriate to their learning needs and the nature of the
918   work that they do. The complexity of the material must be determined before development
919   begins and commensurate with the role of the person who will undergo the learning effort.
920   Material should be developed based on two important criteria: 1) the target attendee’s role, and
921   2) the cybersecurity and privacy responsibilities required for that role.

922          The CPLP Elements
923   A typical CPLP includes a variety of learning program elements that are delivered to diverse
924   audiences through a variety of platforms and methods. The Learning Program Manager will
925   work to identify the necessary and most effective types of program elements for each audience
926   type, per learning goal, and adjust their selections to match their available budget and schedule
927   considerations.
928   The typical CPLP elements are:
929      •   Awareness Activities
930      •   Practical Exercises
931      •   Training




                                                      24

932   When the average person thinks of a CPLP, they likely think of the annual training event
933   delivered to All Users. These might be informal department programs, an all-hands presentation
934   delivered in an auditorium, or an online course. Other learning program elements are targeted for
935   those with significant cybersecurity responsibilities, including privileged account holders. A
936   CPLP program will consist of the mandatory elements (required by policy and learning
937   objectives for all CPLP learning participants) and the many other activities implemented
938   throughout the life cycle to reinforce these messages.
939
940   The learning goals for these events are to ensure that personnel are aware of their roles and
941   responsibilities for protecting assets and are able to take appropriate action against a variety of
942   cybersecurity and privacy risks.

943   2.7.1. Awareness Activities
944   Cybersecurity and privacy awareness learning activities are implemented throughout the year to
945   remind users about a wide variety of risks. Awareness activities should be conducted on an
946   ongoing basis to ensure that employees are aware of their roles within the organization and the
947   appropriate steps they must take for the protection of information, assets and individuals’
948   privacy. Activities can be campaign-oriented or ad hoc based on the subject matter, threats, or
949   vulnerabilities or during seasonal events.
950   Examples of awareness activities that are appropriate for All Users include:
951      •   Learning program messages on logon screens, organization screen savers, and email
952          signature blocks
953      •   Employee newsletters with cybersecurity and privacy articles
954      •   Posters (physical or digital) with cybersecurity and privacy tips
955      •   A Cybersecurity Awareness Month or Privacy Week activity fair
956      •   Cybersecurity and privacy reminders and tips on employee materials (e.g., pens,
957          notepads, etc.)
958      •   Periodic or as-needed email messages that provide timely tips, or that are sent in response
959          to a cybersecurity or privacy event or issue.
960   Consider that each October is designated as “Cybersecurity Awareness Month” and is, therefore,
961   a popular month for scheduling various learning activities. Each January, there is a “Data Privacy
962   Awareness Week,” and it is also a popular time to schedule privacy protection learning events.
963   Leveraging annual themes and available resources can enhance these special events.

964   2.7.2. Practical Exercises
965   Practical exercises or experiential learning activities are specific learning scenarios that simulate
966   events and incidents. The practical exercises can include phishing exercises and other social
967   engineering campaigns, learning games, quizzes on identifying and processing PII, tabletop
968   exercises, hands-on virtual lab exercises, contingency plan and disaster recovery scenarios, and
969   attack or defend scenarios conducted in cyber ranges.

       August 2023                                                                                                   Privacy Learning Program

 970   An organization-wide All-User phishing exercise is a typical type of practical exercise. In a
 971   phishing exercise, a “tricky” email is sent to users to see whether the user can spot a phishing
 972   attempt or if they can be tricked into clicking on a link to a malicious website or opening an
 973   infected attachment. Since phishing emails can target specific roles in the organization, such as
 974   leadership or known administrators, the phishing exercises can also target specific roles.
 975   Phishing exercises offer opportunities to collect metrics and measurements, which are usually
 976   referred to as click-through or reported measurements. These types of measurements indicate
 977   whether the user reported the email as a phishing attempt or whether they clicked on a link or
 978   opened an attachment. Some organizations include “report phishing” capabilities on their email
 979   platform (e.g., a button on the platform’s menu) to encourage best practices. It can be important
 980   to consider the context of the employee’s work when creating or deploying a phishing test. 10
 981   Be sure to include the organization’s legal team in the design review of planned phishing
 982   exercises to avoid negative impacts, such as using legitimate brands or naming federal
 983   organizations in the phishing “bait,” which could result in emails or calls to those entities. In
 984   addition, since employees may not like being tricked, it is important to tell employees that the
 985   organization is conducting phishing exercises on a random basis and that the results will be used
 986   to guide future learning activities. These activities should not be punitive, nor should any
 987   employee be called out for their response. When viewed as learning opportunities, the phishing
 988   exercises can provide important data on vulnerabilities and which employees may need
 989   additional learning support.
 990   Other practical exercises may be better suited for those with significant cybersecurity or privacy
 991   responsibilities (e.g., role-based training) or, if well-designed, could apply to any user group.
 992   These exercises might include table-top exercises and contingency plan scenarios. Additional
 993   examples may be found in the 2006 NIST SP 800-84, “Guide to Test, Training, and Exercise
 994   Programs for IT Plans and Capabilities”[4].

 995   2.7.3. Training
 996   Training is a broad term that includes the Learning Program content designed to increase or
 997   improve job-related knowledge and skills. Some of the techniques that an organization can
 998   employ include:
 999        •     Synchronous training: Instructors and students participate together, whether in a virtual
1000              or a physical classroom-based learning environment.
1001        •     Asynchronous training: The learner is able to access material individually and on-
1002              demand. This is sometimes called “self-paced” because the learner accesses content
1003              based on their schedule.
1004        •     Virtual led: Instruction occurs in a virtual or simulated environment and is presented or
1005              facilitated by an instructor in real time.
1006        •     Cyber range: Instruction takes place in a safe web-based practice environment (i.e.,
1007              sandbox) and delivers hands-on realistic training, scenarios, challenges, and exercises.

1008      •   Podcasts: Learning is asynchronous, self-paced, and typically audio based.
1009      •   Animations: Animations can visually represent a process, system, or complex
1010          cybersecurity or privacy concept.
1011      •   Demonstration: The instructor provides the learner with the step-by-step actions of a
1012          process or activity. This can be delivered in-person, recorded, or via other methods.
1013      •   Scenario-based exercise: The facilitator leads discussions on topical, situation-driven
1014          scenarios that may be customized to the organization or to a specific department. These
1015          are also referred to as “table-top” exercises.
1016      •   Self-paced online training: This asynchronous technique is currently popular for
1017          distributed environments. Attendees of a web-based session can study independently and
1018          learn at their own pace. Testing and accountability features can gauge performance. Web-
1019          based training can include video, audio, and interactive techniques, such as drag-and-drop
1020          or fill-in-the-blank exam responses.
1021      •   Onsite instructor-led training: This is one of the oldest and most popular techniques for
1022          delivering training material to an audience. The biggest advantage of the technique is the
1023          interactive nature of the instruction. It can also include peer presentations and mentoring.
1024   Blending various training delivery techniques can be an effective way to present material and
1025   hold an audience’s attention. For example, showing videos during an instructor-led session
1026   allows the audience to focus on a different source of information. The video can also reinforce
1027   what the instructor has been presenting.

1028          Establishing the CPLP Plan Priorities
1029   There are many elements to consider when entering into the planning phase of the CPLP life
1030   cycle. A leading consideration is to evaluate the organization’s critical risk factors to determine
1031   the learning priorities. If a phased approach is necessary, such as due to budget constraints or
1032   resource availability, some factors to consider are:
1033      •   Role and organizational impact – It is very common to address priority in terms of
1034          organizational role and risk. Broad-based awareness initiatives that address the
1035          enterprise-wide mandate may receive high priority because the rules of good
1036          cybersecurity and privacy practices can be delivered to the workforce quickly. It is also
1037          common to look at high trust/high impact positions (see earlier discussions about
1038          cybersecurity and privacy specialist roles) and ensure that they receive high priority in
1039          the rollout strategy. These types of positions are typically commensurate with the type of
1040          access (and to what systems) these users possess or specialized requirements assigned to
1041          their roles and job duties.. In addition, the protection of high value or critical assets or the
1042          deployment of privacy-sensitive products or services can also drive priorities.
1043      •   State of current compliance – This involves looking at major gaps in the CPLP (e.g.,
1044          gap analysis) and targeting deficient areas for attention.
1045      •   Availability of materials and resources – Determine whether appropriate learning
1046          material and necessary resources are readily available for the program element.
1047          Repurpose and utilize existing materials in new ways, when possible.

1048          Developing the CPLP Plan
1049   The Learning Program plan refers to the working documents that contain elements that support
1050   the strategy for each activity or campaign. A Learning Program plan, such as what might be
1051   created to build an awareness campaign or privileged account holder training, is similar to a
1052   project plan. The purpose of creating Learning Program plans is to guide the delivery of the
1053   program elements. This document defines the program element with sufficient detail to inform
1054   key stakeholders and contributors to perform their roles successfully. Many organizations utilize
1055   standard program plan templates that provide baselines for organizational expectations.
1056   The exact level of detail within the plan will vary, depending on organizational and program
1057   requirements and resources. As the program matures, the Learning Program Manager should
1058   conduct recurring reviews (i.e., at least annually) of the plan, along with the stakeholders and
1059   individuals who will support and manage the program.

1060          CPLP Resources
1061   An important element of developing the CPLP Strategy is to determine what currently exists
1062   within the organization and what resources are dedicated to the existing programs. If the
1063   Learning Program does not exist or requires significant redesign or updates, refer to the Program
1064   Strategy process outlined in Section 2.1 to review the most important program elements for
1065   inclusion. Resources are typically defined as any asset that is required to meet the goals and
1066   objectives, such as people, materials, equipment, and technology. An important consideration in
1067   obtaining resources is establishing a CPLP budget.

1068   2.10.1.        Establishing a CPLP Budget
1069   Once the CPLP strategy has been approved by the senior leadership (identified in Section 1.10.2)
1070   and the priorities have been established, funding requirements must be added to the plan. A
1071   determination must be made regarding the extent of funding support to be allocated based on the
1072   strategic goals. Senior leadership should help the Learning Program Manager understand or
1073   establish their budget. While each program will have different funding needs, some typical costs
1074   include:
1075      •   Training personnel, such as program managers, instructional designers, instructors,
1076          graphic artists, web developers, and programmers
1077      •   Classroom space and materials, such as whiteboards, markers, erasers, flip charts, note
1078          pads, pens, pencils, and name cards
1079      •   Printed program materials, handouts, and certificates or electronic distribution that may
1080          require web-based platforms
1081      •   Online (virtual) space to distribute materials, including synchronous activities such as
1082          webinars and asynchronous activities such as job aids, recorded sessions, and web-based
1083          content
1084      •   Learning Management Systems for content delivery, participant registration, and course
1085          completion records

1086      •   Licenses (per-seat) for learning platform or content
1087      •   Awareness materials, such as posters, notepads, and themed items for awareness
1088          activities
1089      •   Professional services for curriculum design and development and the presentation of
1090          content, as well as any additional associated costs
1091   There are strategic and cost-benefit decisions that the organization must make to ensure that the
1092   CPLP is adequately funded. Some materials may be available from other federal agencies,
1093   partner organizations, or online vendor resources. Some materials may already exist in-house and
1094   should be inventoried and evaluated to determine whether they are current and meet the existing
1095   training goals. The implementation timeline will help indicate when additional funding may be
1096   required to support tools, major curriculum and content deliverables, new staffing requirements,
1097   and other learning program elements and activities.
1098
        The following are example questions that can help guide development of budget requirements:
           • What mission and business needs will be influenced or impacted?
           • Are there regulations, legislative requirements, or other internal or external
               requirements that would influence the decision?
           • What shared federal or other external resources can be leveraged?
           • What internal resources can be leveraged? This can include existing content and
               delivery mediums.
           • Is it more cost-effective to develop the material in-house versus outsourcing?
           • Is the learning requirement specific to the organization or the system? This would
               include information such as specific policies, procedures, or rules of behavior.
           • When must the learning material be ready? Are there critical schedules that need to be
               met? Would outsourcing allow for delivery schedules to be met?
           • How many people need to be trained?
           • How often will the material need to be updated?
           • What delivery mediums will be required, and what are the associated costs?
           • Are there in-house resources to do the job?
           • Does the organization have the subject-matter expertise to provide content for the
               training?
           • Are resources available to effectively manage and monitor contractor activity during
               acquisitions?
           • Does the course sensitivity preclude the use of a contractor?
1099
1100   The Learning Program Manager must work with senior leadership to advocate for the Program
1101   against competing priorities and develop a strategy to address any shortfall in funding that may
1102   impact the organization’s ability to meet its learning goals. This may mean adjusting the learning
1103   strategy to be more in line with the available budget, advocating for additional funding, or
1104   reallocating current resources. It may also mean that the program plan needs to be phased in over
1105   some predefined time period as funding becomes available.

1106   2.10.2.        CPLP Staff and Locations
1107   Those who have managed federal CPLPs report that training the workforce requires a
1108   combination of technical knowledge and professional attributes, such as communication,
1109   creativity, and interpersonal skills [11]. If the organization does not have the budget for CPLP
1110   course developers, determine what other agencies or organizations of similar size have done for
1111   their own needs. Some organizations may have in-house instructional designers, curriculum
1112   developers, instructors, web developers, communication experts, and graphic designers. Other
1113   organizations may need to include these professional costs in the budget for a new project.
1114   Identify qualified contractors to use or external courses that the organization can purchase.
1115   Different information requires different methods of delivery. Some program elements will be
1116   appropriate to deliver via online learning, while others will necessitate both instructors and
1117   physical classroom locations. Determining these requirements up front will allow for appropriate
1118   resource allocation (e.g., rooms to be reserved, computers and projectors secured, etc.). Even
1119   posters and flyers require space considerations, as they will need to be displayed in a sufficiently
1120   prominent area to have a learning impact on the personnel.

1121          Communicating the Strategic Plan and Program Performance
1122   One of the most important aspects of executing the CPLP Strategic Plan is collaborating with the
1123   learning team, key stakeholders, senior leadership, and personnel. Involving stakeholders and
1124   employees during the planning process can lead to greater success as the program begins and as
1125   each program element is implemented. Determining what to communicate should focus on:
1126      •   How the CPLP helps meet organizational and learning goals
1127      •   How the CPLP elements will impact personnel
1128      •   Engaging with stakeholders to determine concerns or conflicts in advance
1129      •   Soliciting feedback to identify gaps or missing elements in the plan
1130   Getting early and continual buy-in for the strategic plan is important to keep the momentum for
1131   the CPLP strong and to inspire engagement and satisfaction with the plan. A solid
1132   communication strategy will address those needs. Consider whether the organization has a
1133   centralized communications department or whether communications decisions will be made at
1134   the business unit level. Then develop a communications plan (or incorporate these elements into
1135   an existing communications plan) to share information about the new or updated CPLP. Keep it
1136   simple and tailored to internal stakeholders. The Learning Program Manager may choose to
1137   create a custom version of the strategic plan that includes different information for different
1138   audiences.
1139   Some important elements to share include information about what the CPLP is and who manages
1140   it. Funding issues and gaps may also need to be identified and addressed. For example, agency
1141   leaders and managers need to know whether the cost to implement the CPLP activities will be
1142   funded by the CIO, CISO, CLO, or another program budget or whether their budgets will be
1143   impacted to cover a portion of the expense. In addition, schedules and completion requirements
1144   must be communicated.

1145   Elements of the CPLP communications should include:
1146      •   An overview of the CPLP strategy and ownership
1147      •   Goals, objectives, and assessment processes
1148      •   A list of key roles and their respective responsibilities, including:
1149              o Senior leadership and executives
1150              o Managers and supervisors
1151              o Human Resources (HR), Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer (OCHCO),
1152                and labor relations
1153              o Office of the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) or budget analyst
1154              o Chief Learning Officer (CLO) (agency or organization level)
1155              o Learning Program Managers and team members
1156              o Subject-matter experts
1157      •   Budget overview
1158      •   Key deliverables and high-level schedule
1159      •   Measurements and metrics
1160      •   Reporting methods and frequency
1161   It is essential for everyone involved in the implementation of the program to understand their
1162   roles and responsibilities. Most organizations may find it helpful to tailor their messaging based
1163   on the audience. A few examples of audiences and their roles include:
1164      •   Senior leadership and executives (e.g., CIO, CISO, SAISO, SAOP, and CPO) –
1165          Communications may include a high-level summary of the CPLP strategic plan,
1166          including the goals for and phases of the yearlong program. The senior leadership needs a
1167          good sense of the overall program so that they can support the allocation of budget and
1168          personnel. Ensure that senior leaders are provided with appropriate messaging so that
1169          they can avoid harmful language, such as “users are the weakest link.”
1170      •   Managers and supervisors – Communications should emphasize the benefit of building
1171          a positive cybersecurity and privacy culture and help the manager or supervisor recognize
1172          their crucial role in supporting that culture. An objective for their buy-in is to encourage
1173          positive associations with allocating time for employee learning.
1174      •   Human Resources, human capital officers, and labor relations officers – Those
1175          involved in Human Resources or human capital are responsible for any required
1176          communications regarding the implementation of CPLP requirements into the onboarding
1177          and training of union members throughout the year. If appropriate, the labor relations
1178          officers will also be key stakeholders in assisting with any updates to the plan and
1179          receiving reports on learning outcomes and other metrics for their union-represented
1180          personnel. Human capital is also a crucial stakeholder to provide input about personnel
1181          disciplinary actions and to initiate labor relations and union negotiations with regard to
1182          the mandatory training or learning activities outlined in the agency process.

1183      •   Chief Financial Officer – The Office of the Chief Financial Officer (or the organization
1184          or agency equivalent senior financial officer) is responsible for approving the CPLP and
1185          dispensing funding to the Learning Program Managers and must, therefore, be kept
1186          informed about program implementation and measurements.
1187      •   Chief Learning Officer – The Chief Learning Officer is responsible for learning in the
1188          organization and is an important ally for the CPLP. The CLO may provide the learning
1189          infrastructure, such as the Learning Management System (LMS) or other distribution
1190          platforms.
1191      •   Personnel – Create a communications strategy that allows for direct email messages to
1192          personnel, as well as a distributed system to their managers and supervisors. When
1193          creating communications materials about the CPLP for individual contributors, such as
1194          email blasts or the materials in the new hire orientation packages, focus efforts on
1195          enabling the individual contributor to see their part in the overall CPLP. It should include
1196          a schedule to ensure that users are notified in sufficient time before they are required to
1197          complete the learning activity.

1200          Analysis and Design of the CPLP
1201   To create a highly effective CPLP, the Learning Program Manager will dedicate time and
1202   resources to analyzing and designing the program. During the analysis phase, they identify their
1203   organizational and learning needs or gaps. The gaps are reviewed to determine which audiences
1204   will need training and and their existing levels of knowledge and skill(s). It may be necessary to
1205   evaluate various workroles for learning gaps so that relevant learning programs can be
1206   customized and created based on the specific learning needs for the workrole. During the design
1207   phase, the gaps are translated into learning objectives, which are the focus of the learning
1208   material. Tying the learning objectives to identified knowledge and skill gaps ensures that the
1209   end result is relevant and will succeed in closing the identified learning needs.

1210          Analysis Phase
1211   The analysis phase is the process during which the Learning Program Manager determines the
1212   organization’s learning and performance needs. In this context, the needs, which are also called
1213   gaps, are the difference between the current learning goals (or activities) and the desired state. To
1214   determine their learning needs, organizations may conduct a formal or informal needs
1215   assessment (also referred to as a needs analysis). The primary benefit of the analysis phase is to
1216   identify both learning needs for the organization and the learning audience. Additional benefits
1217   include having information that clearly defines the learning needs, support for resources and the
1218   prioritization of resources, and the alignment of learning goals to organizational mission goals.
1219   In the beginning of the analysis phase, it may be helpful to identify the primary members of the
1220   analysis team, including several additional constituent groups. This may include the following:
1221      •   Executive management – These organizational leaders understand the relevant
1222          regulations, directives, laws, operational changes, or other requirements that form the
1223          basis for the CPLP. It is important for the leadership to provide input to the
1224          organizational learning needs since they set the expectations for the program and the
1225          personnel. A key role for the Learning Manager in driving learning programs is to
1226          continually advocate for the program. The Learning Manager will make the case for why
1227          analysis is important and how an effective CPLP is part of effective risk management.
1228          Additionally, an effective and well-designed CPLP supports the development of an
1229          organizational culture focused on cybersecurity and privacy protections.
1230      •   Cybersecurity and privacy personnel– These individuals act as subject-matter experts
1231          and consultants for the organization. They identify and help document the knowledge and
1232          skills needed to perform work roles.
1233      •   System owners and Program Managers – These individuals will have information and
1234          responsibilities for the particular system in use by the organization. For example, the
1235          owner of the financial system will recognize the impact of a goal on the personnel tasked
1236          with operating that system.
1237      •   Learning Program participants - Representatives from the employee base and from
1238          different cybersecurity and privacy work roles can lend their voice and input into the
1239          requirements gathering and analysis process.

1240   3.1.1. The Importance of the Analysis Phase
1241   There are many reasons why the analysis phase is rushed or skipped entirely. For example,
1242   organizations may think it will take too much time, personnel may be unavailable, or the
1243   necessary funding may be lacking. Most often, organizations believe they already know what
1244   they need. However, critical problems can arise by skipping the analysis phase, such as:
1245      •   Wasted spending when learning materials are developed that do not meet the required
1246          knowledge or skill gaps
1247      •   Misunderstanding the knowledge and skills gaps of the employee participants, which may
1248          require personnel, technology, or other resources to remedy
1249      •   Using training to solve an issue that is not a knowledge or skill gap. For example, an
1250          employee is unable to perform “additional as assigned” duties. Conducting an analysis
1251          will help to determine if it is a systematic or structural gap instead of a learning gap.
1252      •   Providing the right personnel with the wrong information, such as giving privileged users
1253          only basic training rather than information specific to their additional rights
1254      •   Providing the wrong personnel with the right information, such as giving privileged user
1255          training to general users
1256      •   Providing the right information through an ineffective medium or providing the wrong
1257          information through a flashy medium
1258      •   Repeating the same learning material even if previous efforts have failed
1259   It may be tempting or even overwhelming to think about setting aside time to analyze the
1260   organization’s needs. Even if the only option is to conduct an informal discussion and review
1261   with a few individuals, it is still important to have the conversation and document what is
1262   needed. The analysis phase establishes a clear vision for the next steps of the Learning Program’s
1263   development.

1264   3.1.2. The Steps of the Analysis Phase
1265   While there are many ways that a Learning Program Manager can evaluate the learning needs of
1266   the organization, the process for identifying Learning Program needs from a strategic point of
1267   view tends to be a repeatable process, regardless of the specific learning goal or audience. The
1268   steps are:
1269      1. Identify the learning needs
1270      2. Determine the learning audience
1271      3. Identify the knowledge or skills relevant to the goals per audience
1272      4. Assess the audience’s current knowledge or skill level
1273      5. Identify knowledge or skill gaps
1274   Using a specific example, such as implementing multi-factor authentication, the Learning
1275   Program Manager can develop an awareness program for all users in the organization so that
1276   they understand their roles in the program. All users will be expected to adopt multi-factor

1277   authentication on their devices when accessing the organization’s systems, and they will be
1278   informed of the cybersecurity or privacy benefits and purpose of the methodology. Those with
1279   significant cybersecurity and privacy responsibilities will be trained to add this capability to
1280   authentication systems and assist personnel at the organization’s helpdesk. Senior leadership will
1281   participate because they are crucial to ensuring that the goal is well-communicated and supported
1282   throughout the organization.

1283   3.1.2.1.       Identify Learning Needs
1284   The most important step in initiating a new phase in the CPLP is to establish the learning needs.
1285   For example, the organization may be about to introduce new technology, legislation may have
1286   been passed that requires personnel to acquire new knowledge or skills, or a new privacy or
1287   cybersecurity risk may have emerged that requires the organization to introduce a new learning
1288   module. Identifying and prioritizing learning needs will allow the Learning Program Manager to
1289   focus their attention on the issues of greatest importance to the organization.
1290   The following techniques can help define the learning needs:
1291      •   Identify what knowledge or skills are needed in the organization through a learning needs
1292          assessment
1293      •   Review existing work or job analysis reports
1294      •   Identify any regulatory or other requirements for learning programs
1295      •   Review cybersecurity or privacy risks. All organizations face operational risks. While the
1296          majority of risk considerations focus on responding to incidents that result in a failure to
1297          maintain cybersecurity, it is important to include an effective learning plan as a
1298          mitigation factor for risks
1299      •   Review lessons learned or after-action reports. After an incident, the Learning Program
1300          Manager may be engaged in an effort to educate personnel on corrective best practices.
1301          This is an important opportunity to truly learn from mistakes. New material should be
1302          developed that not only speaks to the specifics of the incident but may be able to shore up
1303          weak areas around it, such as identifying and reporting vulnerabilities

1304   3.1.2.2.       Determining the CPLP Audiences
1305   During the analysis phase, the Learning Program Manager will identify and define the audiences
1306   to be trained on the identified learning goals. By coordinating with the organization’s
1307   cybersecurity and privacy learning function, supervisors may be helpful in determining whether
1308   personnel need additional training.
1309   Potential audiences for the CPLP include:
1310      •   New employees: This audience includes contractors, and the focus is usually on the
1311          important policies and rules of behavior for the systems that they will access. This
1312          training includes what is typically called “new employee orientation” or “on-boarding”
1313          and can be joint cybersecurity and privacy training. Some organizations may need to

1314          include a visitor or guest with acceptable use policies if they allow any type of system
1315          access, including wireless network connections.
1316      •   All users: This is also known as “general workforce training” and includes annual
1317          cybersecurity and privacy training for all organization system users. An analysis of this
1318          audience’s training requirements should include a review of the performance of previous
1319          program elements and any new organizational requirements.
1320      •   Privileged users: These are personnel with additional responsibilities who are trusted to
1321          perform cybersecurity- or privacy-relevant functions that ordinary users are not
1322          authorized to perform. They will require additional training in order to be provided with
1323          privileged access. Some information to consider when identifying privileged users
1324          include:
1325              o Determine whether any new systems have been implemented or are planned, and
1326                identify the rights and privileges associated with privileged account users.
1327              o Review the list of participants with system owners to ensure that the list is
1328                complete and whether new rights and privileges are required.
1329              o Determine whether any of these systems have been moved to the cloud and
1330                require new training.
1331      •   Staff with significant cybersecurity and privacy responsibilities training: Some
1332          positions with significant responsibilities require highly technical implementation by staff
1333          with significantly specialized responsibilities. This provides additional training that is
1334          designed for a specific job role, task, or responsibility (also known as “role-based”
1335          training). This type of training includes:
1336              o Specialized or customized training on specific products, networks, systems,
1337                applications, or information
1338              o Work role tasks and activities, such as incident response procedures, oversight
1339                responsibilities, or identity management
1340              o Reskilling and upskilling programs
1341              o Learning that helps the employee perform their work tasks
1342          The following are examples of how personnel can be assigned to multiple learning
1343          programs:
1344              o Wilson is currently a system administrator, and as an employee of a federal
1345                agency she attends the annual CPLP training. She is also in the Information
1346                Technology department, so she and her team receive additional training on
1347                cybersecurity and privacy. In her role as a system administrator, she has
1348                significant cybersecurity and privacy responsibilities and is therefore required to
1349                attend additional training.
1350              o Ng is now part of the organization’s web publishing team and has access rights to
1351                publish the public-facing webpages of the organization. This carries significant
1352                agency branding and communications responsibilities. Ng must take annual
1353                training and sign an additional Acceptable Use Policy regarding appropriate
1354                publishing activities.

1355   3.1.2.3.             Identify the Knowledge and Skills Needed per Participant Type
1356   The primary knowledge and skillset for All Users is the ability to recognize cybersecurity and
1357   privacy risks, take appropriate actions to reduce harm to the organization, and report any
1358   incidents or events, when appropriate. All Users must be empowered and skilled in adhering to
1359   the organization’s Rules of Behavior and Acceptable Use Policies, which include guidance on
1360   how to use organization-provided devices and access network resources.
1361   Privileged users must possess the knowledge and skills to appropriately use systems that they
1362   have been given access to without introducing additional risks or harm to the organization. The
1363   training they receive must provide them with the ability to judge risks appropriately.
1364   It is critical to identify the necessary role-based knowledge and skills for those with significant
1365   cybersecurity or privacy responsibilities. The NICE Framework can be a useful resource for
1366   identifying the knowledge and skills related to specific cybersecurity learning objectives if the
1367   learning goal is clear. The NICE Framework includes detailed knowledge and skills statements at
1368   a high level related to the work that personnel perform in a variety of cybersecurity work roles.
1369   In addition, an organizational job analysis will be useful in determining what the learning
1370   objectives are for the program participants. For those with significant privacy responsibilities, the
1371   Learning Program Manager should consult with the privacy senior leadership of the organization
1372   (i.e., CPO or SAOP) for additional guidance on knowledge and skills required per individual.
1373   The Learning Program Manager may also need to consult with managers and subject-matter
1374   experts related to the learning goal for additional input on needed knowledge or skills 11.
1375   There are existing models for evaluating the tasks necessary for a particular person’s role, such
1376   as considering the complexity or difficulty of the task, its importance, and how frequently the
1377   task is performed. This is sometimes referred to as the “DIF model” for considering the relative
1378   difficulty, importance, and frequency of the task. It can be helpful for identifying the knowledge
1379   and skills that the CPLP should focus on when training those with significant cybersecurity or
1380   privacy responsibilities.

1381   3.1.2.4.             Assess Each Audience’s Current Knowledge and Skill Level
1382   After determining the knowledge and skills needed, the next step in the analysis phase is to
1383   determine what the audience segment already knows about the topic and skills they possess
1384   while keeping the learning goal in mind. The CPLP should focus on providing the learner with
1385   the requisite amount of new knowledge and skills while reinforcing existing knowledge and
1386   skills.
1387   There are several methods for determining the existing knowledge and skill set:
1388        •    Hold guided conversations and interviews with subject-matter experts, managers, system
1389             owners, and other organization personnel with relevant mission or business functions.
1390        •    Review recent job task analyses.
1391        •    Analyze events and related responses that may indicate skill levels.

       11
          One such resource is the NIST Privacy Workforce Public Working Group which is working to identify and document Tasks, Knowledge, and
       Skills aligned with the NIST Privacy Framework. https://www.nist.gov/privacy-framework/workforce-advancement/privacy-workforce-public-

1392      •   Conduct performance-based assessments to evaluate and validate capabilities
1393   These methods can also identify whether new training is needed for a role or roles or whether
1394   existing training needs to be updated or modified.

1395   3.1.2.5.       Identify Knowledge and Skill Gaps
1396   The result of the analysis thus far is a measure of the personnel’s existing knowledge and skills
1397   with an overview of each audience segment. The difference between that and the ideal state of
1398   knowledge for the learning goal is referred to as “the learning gap.” During the design phase, the
1399   Learning Manager will use information about each learning gap (per learning goal, learning
1400   audience, etc.) to design a program specific enough to address each need.

1401          Designing the CPLP
1402   At the beginning of the design phase, consider what knowledge and skills the audience needs to
1403   learn or develop and what gaps the learning material will close. This will drive the creation of the
1404   learning objectives and the process for achieving them. The design process should end with a
1405   systematic blueprint of the approach needed for the CPLP to address the identified knowledge
1406   and skills gaps of the personnel.

1407   3.2.1. The Steps of the Design Phase
1408   The Learning Program Manager begins a formal design phase for the CPLP or a new element in
1409   the ongoing CPLP by creating a Design Document that outlines the requirements. They will then
1410   determine whether they need to build or buy learning materials to satisfy those requirements. The
1411   Learning Program Manager moves into a highly detailed design phase that will lead to the
1412   development of revised or new program assets. The steps in design phase are:
1413      1. Create a Design Document.
1414      2. Conduct an environmental scan of available training, both internal and external.
1415      3. Identify learning objectives.
1416      4. Summarize learning requirements.

1417   3.2.2. Design Document
1418   The Design Document provides a blueprint for the development and implementation of the
1419   learning program elements. The Design Document is usually created by the Learning Program
1420   Manager and reviewed by key stakeholders (when necessary for funding and other approvals)
1421   before moving to the development phase.
1422   Typical elements of a Design Document include:
1423      •   Purpose, goals, and background
1424      •   Intended audience
1425      •   Learning objectives

1426      •   Content and environmental scan (e.g., build or buy)
1427      •   A course outline, including high-level topics (e.g., number of lessons or modules and
1428          their length)
1429      •   An instructional strategy that includes media (e.g., audio, video, demonstrations,
1430          emulations, simulations), activities, and exercises
1431      •   Delivery medium (i.e., the learning environment – online, classroom, etc.)
1432      •   Types of assessments (e.g., participation, quiz with passing grade, performance-based
1433          skill assessment, etc.)
1434      •   Required measurements and metrics
1435      •   Signature page to document acceptance from the key stakeholders
1436   Based on its resources, the organization will determine whether it can build, have built, or utilize
1437   existing government or commercial off-the-shelf learning content, which is discussed further in
1438   Section 4.

1439          Conduct an Environmental Scan of Available Training
1440   The Learning Program Manager will need to determine what training materials have previously
1441   been used in their organization and are still available and appropriate for use. Additionally, there
1442   may be materials and programs available from elsewhere in the organization, agency, or partner
1443   agencies. Federal resources may have materials, presentations, and even speakers available to
1444   satisfy a variety of learning goals. An important result of the environmental scan effort will be
1445   insight into what is currently being done to meet learning requirements in the organization and
1446   the gap in needed program material.

1447   3.3.1. External Sources of CPLP Material
1448   There are a variety of external sources of cybersecurity and privacy learning program material
1449   that can be incorporated into a CPLP. Some possible sources include:
1450      •   Vendors: If the organization decides to outsource some or all of its CPLP course
1451          development, a number of vendors in the private sector offer “off-the-shelf” courses that
1452          are suitable for particular audiences or that can be developed for specific audiences. Prior
1453          to selecting a particular vendor, agencies should have a thorough understanding of their
1454          CPLP needs and be able to determine whether a prospective vendor’s material meets
1455          them. Also, consider who “owns” the material for the purposes of future updates and
1456          adaptations. Be sure to check with the agency contracting officer to ensure that
1457          organizational guidelines are met.
1458      •   Non-profit organizations and grant-based agreements: Federal organizations may
1459          have agreements with non-profit organizations, grants to universities, or other similar
1460          arrangements for the creation of educational materials on cybersecurity or privacy topics.
1461          Learning Program Managers should be aware of any such opportunities to leverage these
1462          materials.



                                                        39

1463      •   Other organizations: Organizations can explore the use of CPLP material that has been
1464          developed by other organizations and edited to fit their needs rather than developing a
1465          completely new course. Care should be taken that the available material is applicable to
1466          the intended audience and that the material addresses the learning goals of the
1467          organization.
1468      •   Shared events and material: Several federal agencies offer cybersecurity and privacy
1469          learning events that are open to personnel across the government. Learning Program
1470          Managers should join federal working groups to remain informed about events,
1471          workshops, and conferences intended for professional development.
1472   Sources of timely material may include:
1473      •   Email advisories issued by industry-hosted news groups, academic institutions, or the
1474          organization’s cybersecurity or privacy office
1475      •   Cybersecurity or privacy websites
1476      •   Themed events, such as Data Privacy Week, Cybersecurity Awareness Month, or
1477          Cybersecurity Career Week
1478      •   Conferences, seminars, webinars, forums, and courses

1479   3.3.2. Internal Sources of CPLP Material
1480   Within an agency or organization, cybersecurity and privacy Learning Program Managers can
1481   build new partnerships or reinforce existing ones with the organization’s functional managers
1482   who coordinate or conduct their own CPLPs. Functional training developed in-house (e.g.,
1483   financial applications or personnel management) often lacks adequate discussion of related
1484   cybersecurity and privacy issues. Through these cross-departmental partnerships, Learning
1485   Program Managers can review existing references to their topic areas in the material and check
1486   for completeness and accuracy. The Learning Program Manager can also assist the functional
1487   manager by developing a learning module for any material that previously had no cybersecurity
1488   or privacy component.

1489          Identify Learning Objectives: From Analysis to Design
1490   The Learning Program Manager consolidates what they have identified from the review of
1491   available materials in order to identify learning objectives for the CPLP. Whether the Learning
1492   Program Manager is working on the entire Plan, designing a few new elements, or updating
1493   existing elements, this stage can be very useful in ensuring that the effort is closely aligned with
1494   identified organizational needs.

1495   3.4.1. Examples of Identifying Learning Objectives
1496   Consider these examples of identified training gaps and their associated learning objectives:
1497   Scenario 1: A recent analysis indicated that on-site, remote, and teleworking employees –
1498   including employees with privileged accounts – are using single-factor authentication (i.e., a
1499   password). The Chief Information Officer has approved the implementation of a multi-factor


                                                        40
       NIST SP 800-50r1 ipd                                                       Building a Cybersecurity and
       August 2023                                                                  Privacy Learning Program

1500   authentication token system starting with privileged accounts in the first quarter and all other
1501   accounts in the second quarter. The CPLP Learning Program Manager has been tasked with
1502   helping employees understand their roles in utilizing this new multi-factor authentication system.
1503          Analysis Phase: Identify Knowledge and Skill Gaps
1504          Since this is a new authentication method, both All Users and Privileged Users need
1505          information and training on the new policies, processes, and procedures for accessing the
1506          system. In addition, they need to know why this is important or how it protects the
1507          information and assets on enterprise systems. Privileged Users will also need additional
1508          information focused on the additional privileges they will have once authenticated to the
1509          system.
1510          Design Phase: Create Learning Objectives Based on Knowledge and Skill Gaps
1511          Once the knowledge and skill gaps are identified, the next step is to establish the learning
1512          goals and objectives for the program. In this example, the goals and objectives for the
1513          learning program involve enabling employees to:
1514              •   Understand the vulnerabilities associated with using single-factor authentication
1515                  (e.g., user ID and password)
1516              •   Understand why the organization is using a multi-factor authentication token
1517                  method
1518              •   Identify their role in using multi-factor authentication
1519              •   Install the authentication application and verify that the token is received
1520              •   Utilize the token 100 % of the time for authentication to the system
1521   Scenario 2: A recent external audit of the organization’s system privacy policies and practices
1522   highlighted several concerns. The top issues were that (1) the public privacy notice indicated that
1523   PII was only being shared with certain entities, when in fact it was being shared with other
1524   entities as well; (2) Information System Privacy Officers and Managers (ISPO/ISPMs) had too
1525   many systems to oversee, monthly data processing reports were not reviewed in a timely manner,
1526   and management was not receiving reports of critical problematic data actions; and (3) the
1527   financial office employees were not adequately protecting the privacy of employee bank
1528   information when processing the employees’ travel costs.
1529          Analysis Phase: Identify Knowledge and Skill Gaps
1530          During the analysis phase, the CP Learning Manager determined the following:
1531              •   Systems owners of systems processing PII are designated as employees with
1532                  significant privacy responsibilities and participate in an annual three-hour
1533                  customized seminar that includes new policies, privacy risk briefings, and
1534                  network opportunities. During the next version of the existing training, additional
1535                  content on verifying how PII is being process comports with the public privacy
1536                  notice will be added.
1537              •   While the ability to review monthly data processing reports may be a resource
1538                  issue, no training gap is determined at this time. Further analysis would be needed
1539                  to determine whether ISPO/ISPMs were able to identify critical problematic data


                                                        41
       NIST SP 800-50r1 ipd                                                      Building a Cybersecurity and
       August 2023                                                                 Privacy Learning Program

1540                  actions, whether they possessed the skill, or whether additional ISPO/ISPMs were
1541                  needed. This issue may require discussion and review with senior leadership to be
1542                  fully resolved.
1543              •   Financial office employees are designated as employees with significant
1544                  cybersecurity and privacy responsibilities and receive an annual one-hour self-
1545                  paced training course. Based on the analysis, it was determined that the financial
1546                  office employees lacked a basic understanding of the policies and procedures for
1547                  protecting sensitive and privacy-related information. Since this could have
1548                  immediate and damaging consequences, this lack of knowledge will be addressed
1549                  with a customized training solution and by including the topic in updates to the
1550                  annual one-hour self-paced training course.
1551          Design Phase: Create Learning Objectives Based on Knowledge and Skill Gaps
1552          The learning goals and objectives for this example are:
1553              •   The briefing material for the system owners contained two learning objectives:
1554                      o To be able to identify the elements of the privacy notice that relates to the
1555                        PII being processed in their systems
1556                      o To be able to verify with systems engineers that the PII processing
1557                        comports with the appropriate elements of the privacy notice
1558              •   No training gap was determined at this time.
1559              •   A webinar was scheduled with the financial office employees with the following
1560                  learning objectives:
1561                      o To be able to describe what is considered sensitive or personally
1562                        identifiable information
1563                      o To be able to describe the policies and procedures for protecting sensitive
1564                        and personally identifiable information
1565                      o To be able to adequately protect information while in use and while it is
1566                        stored on the system when given an online form containing privacy-related
1567                        information
1568   As in the examples, the learning content should be designed based on the user segments, such as
1569   All Users, Privileged Users, and Users with Significant Cybersecurity or Privacy
1570   Responsibilities.

1571          Summarize CPLP or Element Requirements
1572   Before moving to the development phase, the Learning Program Manager must consolidate their
1573   requirements for development using the results of the analysis and design phases. They should be
1574   able to fully articulate the Learning Gaps being targeted (per audience) and the related Learning
1575   Objectives.
1576   Additional CPLP requirements that are important to consider are:
1577      •   Material must accommodate all learning styles.

1578      •   Program elements should meet accessibility standards.
1579      •   Require the ability to update and maintain content to stay current.
1580      •   Ensure that the material works for different audience types and sizes.
1581      •   Recognize and support the diversity of the workforce.
1582      •   Provide an overview of what class participants can expect to learn after progressing
1583          through the learning materials.
1584      •   Establish learning objectives in accordance with the organizational mission.
1585      •   Dedicate a separate section to each learning objective and create individual lessons for
1586          each of the learning objectives.
1587      •   Integrate visual elements, such as graphics, videos, tables, and other visual tools to
1588          reinforce important concepts.
1589      •   Use interactions to engage the audience and promote their ability to transfer content from
1590          the training environment to the workplace.
1591      •   Enable managers and supervisors to check progress, run reports, and access the LMS.
1592      •   Support required reporting needs for the executive leadership.
1593      •   Ensure that the IT and help desk staff receiving training to support the CPLP.
1594      •   If using outsourced courses, ensure that vendors are supported and can update the
1595          reporting and LMS platforms.

1598          Development and Implementation of the CPLP
1599   Once the CPLP requirements have been established and documented in the design phase, the
1600   Learning Program Managers can proceed to develop the Program. This phase is where each
1601   audience’s requirements are evaluated, budgeted, and provided for separately. Typically, the
1602   requirement to develop an All User CPLP will be well-understood and may already exist.
1603   Determine whether that is true, whether the program requires significant investment to be
1604   updated, and whether the talent and expertise are available to support the needed work.
1605   The development process will involve various personnel, including:
1606      •   Management: All levels of management will be responsible for their staff learning
1607          needs, the prioritization of training resources, the identification of training gaps, and
1608          evaluation of the training’s effectiveness.
1609      •   Cybersecurity and privacy specialists and subject-matter experts: Specialists and
1610          subject-matter experts help determine the task, knowledge, and skill requirements of the
1611          roles or job functions, identify training gaps and needs within the organization, and guide
1612          the development and review of learning materials.
1613      •   Training professionals: Training professionals acquire, customize, develop, present, and
1614          evaluate the training content and training programs. Whether the training team and
1615          cybersecurity and privacy teams are in the same department or not, the groups will work
1616          closely together, along with other subject-matter experts to ensure the relevance and
1617          accuracy of the material and programs.
1618      •   Acquisitions and budget: These departments will be engaged when circumstances and
1619          needs require the development or acquisition of externally sourced services or content.
1620   Once the baseline requirements of the program have been solidified, a feedback strategy can be
1621   designed and implemented to ensure that materials continue to support the CPLP strategy and
1622   address identified training needs.

1623          Developing CPLP Material
1624   After the Learning Program Manager has completed their analysis and design reviews, they will
1625   have a comprehensive set of Design Documents to guide the development of new materials.
1626   These documents are useful when allocating budgets and personnel for the creation of new
1627   materials or program elements. However, additional information will be needed to guide the
1628   content creators in their work.

1629   4.1.1. Create a Requirements Document for Sourcing New Material
1630   If the Learning Program Manager determines that it is necessary to create or source new CPLP
1631   content, curricula, or other program elements, they will need to create a Requirements
1632   Document. The Requirements Document incorporates the information from the Design
1633   Document as well as any additional and necessary information to provide to the training and
1634   curricula developers, editors, and designers, whether they are in-house or vendors. The
1635   Requirements Document will also be useful for the organization’s acquisition and budget
1636   functions.

1637   The Requirements Document provides detailed and specific criteria related to the content needed
1638   to meet the learning objectives. Typical prompts or questions to review when creating the
1639   Requirements Document include:
1640      •   What specific cybersecurity or privacy risks does the organization seek to address or
1641          reduce?
1642      •   What knowledge or skills should the learner acquire or improve as a result of the CPLP
1643          element?
1644      •   What behaviors need to be addressed or reinforced?
1645      •   Does the material contribute to a positive cybersecurity and privacy culture that
1646          reinforces the role of all users in reducing organizational risk?
1647      •   Will the material engage personnel?
1648      •   What are the budget requirements and timing?
1649      •   Who in the organization will be included in reviews of content development and
1650          approvals?
1651      •   What sort of user testing will be conducted to ensure content is appropriate for the
1652          Learning Program participant; meets their needs and is appropriate to their skill level.

1653   4.1.2. Developing the All User Learning Program
1654   The All User Learning Program elements, as described in Section 2.5.1, are delivered throughout
1655   the year. However, there may be necessary updates to and iterations of the content based on
1656   events and organizational requirements. Ensure that the budget is allocated to update the content
1657   or amend the materials with other delivery methods (e.g., to video training) if making actual
1658   content changes would be cost prohibitive.
1659   The challenge of developing a dynamic and effective All User Learning Program – and
1660   particularly, the cybersecurity and privacy presentation – is that the audience is aware of the
1661   compulsory nature of the program so the materials and presenters must be engaging and hold
1662   their attention. There is much at stake given the ever-changing nature of cybersecurity and
1663   privacy risks to the organization, especially when learners arrive with an expectation that they
1664   only need to do the bare minimum to fulfill their training requirement. However, there will
1665   almost always be new and crucial content for them to understand and master in order minimize
1666   the organization’s risk.
1667   Consider how key messages will be reinforced throughout the All User Learning Program.
1668   Whether it is part of an annual event or shared on awareness materials, repeated messages
1669   become retained messages. Use the awareness program materials to keep the All User Learning
1670   Program topical without becoming repetitive or intrusive. This is a tricky balance to achieve and
1671   requires a variety of delivery formats and messages. Consider varying the awareness program
1672   techniques, such as sending out cybersecurity or privacy topic emails on a monthly basis, adding
1673   a campaign message to everyone’s official organization signature block for Cybersecurity
1674   Awareness Month in October, or Data Privacy Week in January, or place posters in the agency’s
1675   lunchroom all year round.



                                                       45
       NIST SP 800-50r1 ipd                                                           Building a Cybersecurity and

1676   There are many techniques for disseminating cybersecurity and privacy awareness messages
1677   throughout an organization. Choosing those techniques depends on available resources and the
1678   complexity of the messages. Some techniques that are appropriate for a single message include
1679   posters, screensavers, warning banners, organization-wide emails, brown bag seminars, and
1680   awards programs. Techniques that can more easily include several messages or themes include
1681   “do and don’t” lists, email newsletters, web-based sessions, teleconferencing sessions, in-person
1682   instructor-led sessions, and email signature messaging. Examples of awareness material can be
1683   viewed on the Federal Information Security Educators (FISSEA) website 12 under Contests for
1684   Awareness and Training.
1685   Additional considerations when developing the All User Learning Program:
1686           •     What does the organization want all personnel to be aware of regarding cybersecurity and
1687                 privacy? Starting points may include a review of the latest top risks to the organization,
1688                 as reported by the information security or privacy office; common risks reported by
1689                 cybersecurity and privacy organizations; and new mission goals with cybersecurity or
1690                 privacy implications. Evaluating organizational policies, program reviews, internal
1691                 audits, internal controls program reviews, self-assessments, and spot-checks can also help
1692                 Learning Program Managers identify additional topics to address.
1693           •     Were constraints found in the Analysis? For example, does the organization have
1694                 particular issues with delivering a Learning Program to personnel? Will personnel be able
1695                 to access or attend training by a particular required date to achieve completion? Are some
1696                 personnel working remotely, traveling, located overseas, or require reasonable
1697                 accommodations? Consider what additional steps will be needed to ensure that all
1698                 personnel can participate in the All User Learning Program and fulfill their Learning
1699                 Program obligations.

1700   4.1.3. Developing a Privileged Users Learning Program
1701   The steps for this phase are similar to developing the All Users Learning Program. Create a
1702   Requirements Document that aligns learning goals for this audience with available funding as
1703   well as organizational requirements.
1704   Additional considerations for Developing the Privileged User Learning Program:
1705           •     What do we want privileged users to be aware of regarding cybersecurity and privacy?
1706           •     What procedures do personnel need to follow to adequately protect their privileged
1707                 accounts?
1708   Some starting points include understanding the rights and privileges allotted to this group,
1709   reviewing the risks related to privileged accounts or the systems or applications associated with
1710   privileged access, reviewing these issues with the CIO or CISO’s office, and aligning learning
1711   goals for these risks to the available budget for impacted personnel and departments. Evaluating
1712   organizational policies, program reviews, internal audits, internal controls program reviews, self-
1713   assessments, and spot-checks can also help Learning Program Managers identify additional
1714   topics to address.

1715   4.1.4. Developing a Learning Program for Those With Significant Cybersecurity
1716          and Privacy Responsibilities
1717   The more customized and individualized nature of ongoing skills development and training for
1718   personnel with significant cybersecurity and privacy responsibilities will require a more detailed
1719   and nuanced Learning Program approach. For example, it may require multiple Requirements
1720   Documents for developing new Learning Program elements and identifying training that will
1721   satisfy learning objectives. The Learning Program Manager will partner and coordinate these
1722   efforts with the organization’s human capital office, Chief Learning Officer, training and
1723   curriculum developers, and the individual managers and supervisors for the personnel in this
1724   group.
1725   Various methods for developing or identifying role-based training for these users are available to
1726   the Learning Program Manager. They should ensure that the complexity of the training is
1727   commensurate with the role and needs of the people who will undergo the learning effort.
1728   Cybersecurity and privacy role-based training material can be developed at a beginning level for
1729   a person who is just learning a discipline. Material can be developed at an intermediate level for
1730   someone who has more experience and, therefore, more responsibility in their workplace.
1731   Advanced material can be developed for agency subject-matter experts whose jobs incorporate
1732   the highest level of trust and an accompanying high level of cybersecurity or privacy
1733   responsibilities.
1734      4.1.5 Conducting User Testing on new CPLP Elements
1735   Include a user testing phase for all new CPLP elements prior to implementation. Content should
1736   be assessed for each learning program participant group to ensure it meets their needs and is
1737   appropriate to their skill level. Additional user testing might include evaluating the intended
1738   element’s delivery method, the appropriateness of the language, the value to the learner, overall
1739   acceptance of the new element. Feedback from user testing should be iterative and incorporated
1740   at every step of the design effort, not just in the form of evaluations after implementation.

1741          Implementing New CPLP Elements
1742   Implementation refers to the actual distribution and delivery of the CPLP material. This phase
1743   focuses on the connection between the learner and the content. Once the plan for implementing
1744   the CPLP has been communicated to and accepted by management (see Section 2.11), the
1745   implementation phase can begin. Use a life cycle process when implementing the program to
1746   avoid a “one and done” scenario and periodically review the program for updates and
1747   corrections.

1748   4.2.1. Steps for Implementing a new CPLP Element
1749   The Learning Program Manager should implement a new Learning Program or a single element
1750   with the same repeatable steps. It is of the utmost importance that all of those involved in the
1751   implementation phase be included in a well-designed communications effort. This ensures that
1752   personnel and their managers or supervisors are well-informed about any upcoming CPLP
1753   opportunities that are relevant to their required learning plan. The implementation phase is also

1754   the time to confirm that the required reporting and metrics can be satisfied in later program
1755   phases. Steps to consider before initiating the implementation phase include:
1756      1. Communicate the CPLP implementation
1757      2. Plan to measure success by establishing measurement, metric, and reporting requirements
1758      3. Build a CPLP schedule
1759      4. Plan to evaluate program success by reviewing post-implementation
1760         feedback, measurements, and metrics

1761          Communicating the CPLP Implementation
1762   Communication is a large part of developing an organization’s shared culture of supporting the
1763   Learning Program efforts. The Learning Program Manager should develop a Communications
1764   Plan for each phase of the program element implementation and include the organization’s
1765   communication team. The Learning Program Manager should determine the appropriate timing
1766   to inform managers, supervisors, and possibly the personnel involved about upcoming and
1767   required Learning Program elements, as well as the frequency with which to send out reminders
1768   and other forms of communication that encourage cooperation from the organization.
1769   Communication is a large part of developing an organization’s shared culture of supporting the
1770   Learning Program efforts.
1771   Each individual CPLP element (e.g., presentation, course, or tabletop exercise) requires a
1772   separate and more detailed form of communication to inform the learners and their managers of
1773   the following:
1774      •   Purpose of the training or learning activity
1775      •   Participating employee groups (if not all users)
1776      •   Consequences of not completing the training (by deadline or at all)
1777      •   Course title
1778      •   Delivery method (e.g., in person, virtual delivery, self-directed online learning, etc.)
1779      •   Required or recommended accommodations
1780      •   Tracking method (and completion tracking)
1781      •   Availability date
1782      •   Due date
1783      •   Verification of users with significant cybersecurity responsibilities
1784      •   How to request accommodations
1785   The Communications Plan should include a clear explanation of why the training is being
1786   mandated or encouraged. Applicable federal legislation, regulations, and internal (agency or
1787   organizational) policies should be referenced.
1788   Each category of user must be specified for the training assigned. For example, if the
1789   organization’s policy states that all IT users must complete a particular training to gain or


                                                        48

1790   maintain access to IT systems, the communications plan must include this notice. For those with
1791   significant cybersecurity or privacy responsibilities, identify which training is assigned to a
1792   specific work role, individual, or department.
1793   Employees must know the consequences of failing to complete the learning activity according to
1794   the organization’s policy. This should be explained in the Learning Program Communications
1795   Plan and noted in the course description in the Learning Plan within the Learning Management
1796   System.
1797   Other considerations for CPLP communications include:
1798      •   Course titles and numbers should be unique, differentiated, and include information on
1799          the access method (e.g., online or in-person), availability, course dates, and deadlines.
1800      •   All learners, their managers or supervisors, and human capital departments should be
1801          made aware of any required training and associated due dates. Communication should
1802          include reminder messages, references and links to the organization’s official policy
1803          statements for employee information systems, and the consequences for failing to
1804          complete the learning activity.

1805          Establishing Reporting and Metrics Requirements for CPLP Elements
1806   The Learning Program Manager should strive to ensure that the implementation of all new CPLP
1807   elements (e.g., courses, training, posters, practical exercises, etc.) will allow for performance
1808   metrics and measurements to be established and collected. Establish these requirements during
1809   the developmental phases of both the overall program and each component for which measures
1810   are expected to meet regulatory and annual reporting requirements and to continually assess and
1811   improve the performance of the program. As previously mentioned in Section 3.2.2, these must
1812   be included in the Design Plan requirements that go to curriculum and content developers.
1813   In addition to any applicable measures that support the program, as described in Section 2.4, the
1814   Learning Program Manager should utilize element level measures, such as the target percentage
1815   of the applicable audience who receives the training or awareness material and feedback from the
1816   audience on effectiveness of the material.
1817   Some considerations for reporting:
1818      •   Learning Management System (LMS) integration: Training is usually tracked and
1819          recorded using the LMS. Will the course or training element include quizzes with scores
1820          or other metrics and measurements?
1821      •   Non-LMS integrated elements: Consider how the participation and performance of each
1822          learner will be tracked and recorded if the training is face-to-face, virtual, or hybrid. Will
1823          manual or paper tracking be required?

1824          Building a CPLP Schedule
1825   Establish a primary calendar for CPLP activities. The process may be automated using an LMS.
1826   Enable organization-wide access so that personnel can find elements applicable to each audience
1827   segment (e.g., by date, learning objective, etc.). It is a good idea to align this calendar with the

1828   Communications Plan to be able to send out reminder communications and ensure that
1829   instructors and materials are identified and allocated well in advance.

1830          Determining Post-Implementation Activities
1831   Once any CPLP element has been delivered or implemented, the post-implementation activities
1832   that fuel assessment and improvements should be managed. These will include:
1833      •   Sending post-training feedback surveys
1834      •   Conducting instructor feedback surveys
1835      •   Determining attendance and completion rates
1836      •   Other mandated or organizational reporting
1837      •   Budget reconciliation (i.e., did the CPLP element implementation meet budget
1838          requirements or go over or under?)
1839   For some awareness elements, measuring audience engagement is less straightforward,
1840   especially for passive items like posters or email signatures. Nevertheless, it is possible to
1841   measure impact. One method could include surveying a sample of users to discuss their
1842   familiarity with the messaging or whether they have practiced any of the tips.

1845          Assessment and Improvement of the CPLP
1846   An effective CPLP meets the needs of the learners and the organization by measuring and
1847   evaluating the performance of the Program on a continual basis. This requires up-to-date
1848   knowledge, awareness, and understanding of the legal and regulatory compliance requirements
1849   for the organization and the cybersecurity and privacy risks that may impact the organization.
1850   The Learning Program Manager works with organizational leaders, training staff, and learners to
1851   share performance reporting and decision-making throughout all phases of the CPLP. Both the
1852   analysis of organizational risks (e.g., employee responses to practical exercises) and review of
1853   the efficacy of material (e.g., learner feedback responses to courses) are important in the
1854   continual improvement of a CPLP in an evolving threat landscape.

1855          Steps for Assessing and Improving the CPLP
1856   The process for assessing and improving the CPLP may vary by organization and available
1857   resources. Consider the following steps before evaluating the CPLP’s performance, whether for
1858   the entire CPLP, per audience segment, or for a single CPLP element, such as a new training
1859   course:
1860      1. Create a CPLP Assessment Report
1861      2. Agree on the changes needed to the CPLP
1862      3. Evaluate budget requirements for program improvement
1863      4. Review and update the strategic plan
1864      5. Implement changes into the next revisions of the program elements and schedule

1865          Create a CPLP Assessment Report
1866   At the end of a campaign, each quarter, or annually, the Learning Program Manager should
1867   create a summary document that is suitable for review with senior leadership. This report will
1868   provide an analysis of attendance, feedback, measurements, and other metrics and help to
1869   identify action items, areas of improvement, and next steps. It should be tailored for the senior
1870   leadership reader, using language and framing that is appropriate. Avoid using technical jargon
1871   without explanation.
1872   Key elements of an Assessment Report include:

1877   The Learning Program Manager will have established their Program Metrics Plan during the
1878   planning stage (see Section 2.4) and should strive to include a number of different quantitative
1879   and qualitative tools. Metrics are an important and effective tool for determining an
1880   organization’s cybersecurity and privacy learning needs. Metrics monitor the accomplishment of
1881   the program goals and objectives by quantifying the level of implementation, effectiveness, and

1882   efficiency of the program while identifying possible improvements. Include results from both
1883   quantitative and qualitative measurement instruments.

1884   5.2.1. Compliance Reporting
1885   One element of the report is to indicate whether the CPLP has met the regulatory compliance
1886   requirements for the organization. The Learning Program Manager should be aware of all
1887   regulations that require reports to be created for their organization. As a subject-matter expert on
1888   the topic of providing training programs for the agency or organization’s employees, the
1889   Learning Program Manager should typically engage in self-development processes that maintain
1890   an awareness of these needs. In some organizations, this may all be handled by a single
1891   individual or group that is assigned to manage legal and regulatory compliance. For those
1892   organizations where the duties are separated, it is critical to maintain collaborative
1893   communication to ensure that the program meets compliance.
1894   A fully developed and integrated CPLP may become a useful tool for supporting enterprise risk
1895   management, although many are initially developed to address compliance requirements in laws,
1896   regulations, policies, or standards. Meeting these compliance measures is often the primary focus
1897   of higher level leadership, but should be only the starting point for a robust CPLP program.
1898   Examples of common quantifiable metrics to demonstrate CPLP compliance include training a
1899   certain percentage of the workforce and the results of practical exercises. Organizations should
1900   determine which compliance measures they must achieve and consider those inputs when
1901   developing the CPLP.
1902   Learning Program Managers should work with policy owners to ensure that the results of the
1903   learning efforts satisfy compliance requirements. The CPLP needs to build in methods that allow
1904   for this type of reporting. That conversation could include questions such as:
1905      •   Which personnel received (or participated in) the learning element?
1906      •   How well does the participation level match the goal of user coverage?
1907      •   How far should the CPLP go in pursuit of expected coverage?
1908      •   Have individuals in compliance-identified roles met their learning requirements?

1909          Evaluating CPLP Effectiveness
1910   Because the focus of this program is on learning and mastering content, it is important to analyze
1911   issues that are typically assigned to the learning and educational branch of the organization. The
1912   cybersecurity and privacy Learning Program Manager needs to be involved in the creation of
1913   course material to ensure that it is accurate, relevant, and timely. This requires analyzing the
1914   accuracy, quality, and appropriateness of delivery of the material in the context of the desired
1915   outcomes. The Learning Program Manager should expect to take an active role in course
1916   development and to follow up after teaching to determine whether the material was delivered as
1917   intended.
1918   Another primary goal of a CPLP is to empower users to demonstrate better decision-making
1919   behaviors. While these types of behavioral improvements tend to be more difficult to measure,



                                                        52

1920   working with functional managers and other staff may help in the development of measurable
1921   objectives to assess behavioral changes.

1922   5.3.1. Instructor Evaluation
1923   Each CPLP will determine whether they can support a dedicated in-house team of instructors.
1924   Others may need to use contractors to implement courses and training. In some organizations, the
1925   cybersecurity Learning Program Manager is also the privacy Learning Program Manager and
1926   lead instructor for all of the above. Regardless of the size of the organization, it is important to
1927   consider the required skills of the instructor. Learning Program Managers should work with
1928   leadership to find the right instructors for their personnel and their CPLP’s learning objectives. It
1929   is also important to monitor the performance of instructors via observation and other forms of
1930   feedback.
1931   Instructors can also give feedback on the learning material. Learning Program Managers should
1932   work with the instructors to review the material for effectiveness. Instructors frequently provide
1933   feedback on:
1934      •   Perceived accuracy
1935      •   Ease of instruction and ease of learner understanding
1936      •   Adequacy of materials to support content
1937      •   Relevance and timeliness of materials

1938   5.3.2. Learner Performance and Feedback
1939   An effective CPLP will include evaluations of learner performance and ask personnel for
1940   feedback.
1941   There are many techniques for addressing how well the learner has absorbed the content and will
1942   be able to apply it. The most common technique for measuring learner performance is the use of
1943   in-course or post-course evaluations. Questions or assessments should be developed at a level
1944   commensurate with both the complexity of the material and the level of understanding expected
1945   of the learner. Note: these evaluations won’t show whether there was long-term learning or
1946   application of that learning. Refer back to other ways of measuring employee behaviors as a
1947   long-term way to measure learner performance. Additionally, these measures should be
1948   aggregated across the workforce or a group, not necessarily attributed to a unique learner.
1949   As needed, the Learning Program Manager should work with other functional managers to
1950   identify weaknesses in the knowledge and skills of personnel, whether individually or by role, to
1951   determine where results do not match the goals and learning objectives for each training element.
1952   Helping personnel to provide CPLP feedback is recommended for encouraging a sense of shared
1953   responsibility in the cybersecurity and privacy culture of the organization. Learning Program
1954   Managers should consider how they can provide easy feedback mechanisms throughout their
1955   program.

1956   5.3.3. Review of the CPLP Assessment Report With Senior Leadership
1957   As a final step, the Learning Program Manager will meet with the Senior Leadership Committee
1958   to review the performance of the program, address new organizational risks or concerns to
1959   include in the training program content, and identify any areas for significant improvement. This
1960   phase helps to ensure that the cyclical approach depicted in Fig. 1 is an ongoing and continual
1961   effort.

1962          Continuous Monitoring and Improvement
1963   NIST SP 800-53, section 1.3, includes the organizational responsibility of “[c]ontinuous
1964   monitoring of information systems and organizations to determine the ongoing effectiveness of
1965   controls, changes in information systems and environments of operation, and the state of security
1966   and privacy organization-wide.” In this context, the continuous monitoring and improvement
1967   refers to the iterative nature of reviewing, updating, and maintaining the program in alignment
1968   with requirements and best practices. Based on the CPLP Assessment Report and any new
1969   requirements (e.g., legislative, organizational, system changes, risk-related, etc.), the Learning
1970   Program Manager will be able to identify opportunities for improvement. As part of the iterative
1971   nature of a CPLP, the assessment and continual improvement process can happen during any
1972   phase of the CPLP. Continual improvement is simply the concept of periodically revisiting each
1973   step of planning, design, development, and implementation to ensure that the CPLP meets the
1974   identified goals and requirements in the strategic plan. The continual improvement process does
1975   not imply inherent shortfalls in the program. Rather, it acknowledges the constantly shifting
1976   needs of an organization to manage resources and risks.
1977   Ultimately, the goal of the CPLP is to enable the organization to withstand cybersecurity and
1978   privacy-related risks to information and assets. The personnel of the organization are a crucial
1979   part of creating the positive cultural norms that will both support the aims of the CPLP and
1980   contribute to greater success in changing behaviors. Avoid efforts to penalize those who do not
1981   adapt to the culture as well as others. Rather, shine a light on teams and departments that
1982   improve performance or establish best practices. Find ways to celebrate personnel who are
1983   building the organization’s CPLP culture, and share information about the CPLP’s performance
1984   when appropriate. If feedback indicates that a change is required to the training because
1985   something is not working, ensure that the program is nimble enough for that adjustment to be
1986   implemented. Do not wait for the end of the year or another arbitrary time period.
1987   The goals of continual improvement do not need to be built on the ashes of past failures but
1988   should be seen as an opportunity to grow and strengthen a critical program. A positive
1989   cybersecurity and privacy culture celebrates successes while acknowledging the ever-present
1990   risks to the organization.

2048   The following example is adapted from the FY21 Inspector General FISMA Metrics for Security Training [12] and provides one
2049   method for assessing the maturity of a Learning Program. Similar to other business or quality maturity models, this example can help

2188   significant cybersecurity or privacy responsibilities
2189   The preferred terminology herein for identifying those whose roles in the organization necessitate ongoing role-
2190   based training. These individuals have work-related responsibilities beyond those of All Users and will need to
2191   participate in general as well as specialized Learning Program activities.
2192            NOTE: From FISMA FY2014 CIO Metrics [12]: Those with significant cybersecurity responsibilities
2193            include all users who have one or more privileged network user account and all other users who have
2194            managerial or operational responsibilities that allow them to increase or decrease cybersecurity.

2195   synchronous training
2196   Training in which instructors and students are scheduled to participate together, whether it is in a virtual or a
2197   physical classroom-based learning environment.

2198   tabletop materials
2199   Materials designed for a discussion-based exercise where personnel with roles and responsibilities in a particular IT
2200   plan meet in a classroom setting or in breakout groups to discuss their roles during an emergency and their responses
2201   to a particular emergency situation. A facilitator initiates the discussion by presenting a scenario and asking
2202   questions based on the scenario.
2203            NOTE: From NIST SP 800-84, Tabletop exercises typically include the following documentation:
2204            o    Briefing. A briefing is created for the participants; it includes an agenda and logistics information.
2205            o    Facilitator Guide. The facilitator guide includes the following:
2206                 –   The purpose for conducting the exercise
2207                 –   The exercise’s scope and objectives
2208                 –   The exercise’s scenario, which is a sequential, narrative account of a hypothetical incident that
2209                     provides the catalyst for the exercise and is intended to introduce situations that will inspire
2210                     responses and thus allow demonstration of the exercise objectives
2211                 –   A list of questions regarding the scenario that address the exercise objectives14
2212                 –   A copy of the IT plan being exercised.
2213            The types of questions documented in the facilitator guide should be tailored to the participants. For
2214            example, if senior-level personnel are the participants, the questions should be of a more general, high-level
2215            nature and focus on decision-making and oversight, which are consistent with their roles and
2216            responsibilities within the plan. If operational personnel are the participants, the questions should typically
2217            be focused on specific procedures and processes that are followed to carry out roles and responsibilities.
2218            o    Participant Guide. The participant guide includes the same information as the facilitator guide without
2219                 the list of questions. Participant guides contain a modified, shorter list of questions to orient
2220                 participants to the types of issues that may be discussed during the exercise.
2221            o    After Action Report.

2222   training
2223   Instruction to enhance the employee’s capacity to perform specific job functions and tasks. It is a learning activity
2224   that focuses on skills, concepts, knowledge, and attitudes related to performing a job. It is designed to change what
2225   employees know and how they work.
2226            NOTE: References to training in US law: See U.S. Code § 4101 – Definitions [14]: (4) “training” means
2227            the process of providing for and making available to an employee, and placing or enrolling the employee
2228            in, a planned, prepared, and coordinated program, course, curriculum, subject, system, or routine of
2229            instruction or education, in scientific, professional, technical, mechanical, trade, clerical, fiscal,
2230            administrative, or other fields which will improve individual and organizational performance and assist in
2231            achieving the agency’s mission and performance goals.

2232   virtual-led
2233   When instruction occurs in a virtual or simulated environment and is presented or facilitated by an instructor in real
2234   time.

2235   warning banner
2236   The opening screen that informs users of the implications of accessing a computer resource (e.g., consent to
2237   monitor); a security banner; system use notification.

2238   web-based training
2239    “Attendees” of an internet-based session can study independently and learn at their own pace. Testing and
2240   accountability features can be built-in to gauge performance. Web-based training can include video, audio, and
2241   interactive techniques, such as drag-and-drop or fill in the blank.

2242   work role
2243   A way of describing a grouping of work for which someone is responsible or accountable. Work Role names are not
2244   synonymous with job titles. Some work roles may coincide with a job title depending on an organization’s use of job
2245   titles. Additionally, work roles are not synonymous with occupations. A single work role (e.g., Software Developer)
2246   may apply to those with many varying job titles (e.g., software engineer, coder, application developer). Conversely,
2247   multiple roles could be combined to create a particular job. This additive approach supports improved modularity
2248   and illustrates the fact that all learners in the workforce perform numerous tasks in various roles, regardless of their
2249   job titles. [3]
