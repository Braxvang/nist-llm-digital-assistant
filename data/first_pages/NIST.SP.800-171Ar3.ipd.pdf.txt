     NIST SP 800-171Ar3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                    Assessing CUI Security Requirements
     November 2023

 1   Abstract
 2   The protection of Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) resident in nonfederal systems and
 3   organizations is of paramount importance to federal agencies and can directly impact the ability
 4   of the Federal Government to successfully conduct its essential missions and functions. This
 5   publication provides federal and nonfederal organizations with assessment procedures and a
 6   methodology that can be employed to conduct assessments of the security requirements in NIST
 7   Special Publication 800-171, Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information in Nonfederal
 8   Systems and Organizations. The assessment procedures are flexible and can be customized to the
 9   needs of organizations and assessors. Security assessments can be conducted as independent,
10   third-party assessments or as government-sponsored assessments. The assessments can also be
11   applied with various degrees of rigor based on customer-defined depth and coverage attributes.
12   The findings and evidence produced during the assessments can facilitate risk-based decisions by
13   organizations related to the security requirements.

30   Audience
31   This publication serves a diverse group of individuals and organizations in the public and private
32   sectors, including individuals with:
33       •   System development life cycle responsibilities (e.g., program managers, mission/business
34           owners, information owners/stewards, system designers and developers, system/security
35           engineers, systems integrators)
36       •   Acquisition or procurement responsibilities (e.g., contracting officers)
37       •   System, security, or risk management and oversight responsibilities (e.g., authorizing
38           officials, chief information officers, chief information security officers, system owners,
39           information security managers)
40       •   Security assessment and monitoring responsibilities (e.g., auditors, system evaluators,
41           assessors, independent verifiers/validators, analysts)

42   The above roles and responsibilities can be viewed from two perspectives:
43       •   Federal perspective: The entity establishing and conveying security assessment
44           requirements in contractual vehicles or other types of agreements
45       •   Nonfederal perspective: The entity responding to and complying with security assessment
46           requirements set forth in contracts or agreements

     NIST SP 800-171Ar3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                    Assessing CUI Security Requirements
     November 2023

47   Note to Reviewers
48   This update to NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-171A represents over one year of data
49   collection, technical analysis, customer interaction, redesign, and development of the procedures
50   for assessing the security requirements for Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). Many
51   trade-offs have been made to ensure that the assessment procedures have been stated clearly and
52   concisely while also recognizing the specific needs of both federal and nonfederal organizations.
53   The following significant changes have been made in the initial public draft (ipd) of NIST SP
54   800-171A, Revision 3:
55       •   The restructuring of the assessment procedure syntax to align with NIST SP 800-53A [5].
56       •   The addition of a references section to provide source assessment procedures from NIST
57           SP 800-53A [5].

58   There has also been a one-time change to the publication version number to align with NIST SP
59   800-171, Revision 3 [3].

60   NIST is specifically interested in comments, feedback, and recommendations for the following
61   topics:
62       •   The alignment of the assessment procedures to NIST SP 800-53A [5].
63       •   The use of organization-defined parameters (ODPs) in the assessment procedures.
64       •   The ease-of-use of the assessment procedures in conducting assessments of the CUI
65           security requirements.

66   Reviewers are encouraged to comment on all or parts of NIST SP 800-171A, Revision 3 ipd.
67   NIST requests that all comments be submitted to 800-171comments@list.nist.gov by 11:59 p.m.
68   Eastern Standard Time (EST) on January 12, 2024. Commenters are encouraged to use the
69   comment template provided with the document announcement.

70   Comments received in response to this request will be posted on the Protecting CUI project site
71   after the due date. Submitters’ names and affiliations (when provided) will be included, while
72   contact information will be removed.

73   Call for Patent Claims
74   This public review includes a call for information on essential patent claims (claims whose use
75   would be required for compliance with the guidance or requirements in this Information
76   Technology Laboratory (ITL) draft publication). Such guidance and/or requirements may be
77   directly stated in this ITL Publication or by reference to another publication. This call also
78   includes disclosure, where known, of the existence of pending U.S. or foreign patent applications
79   relating to this ITL draft publication and of any relevant unexpired U.S. or foreign patents.

80   ITL may require from the patent holder, or a party authorized to make assurances on its behalf,
81   in written or electronic form, either:
82       a) assurance in the form of a general disclaimer to the effect that such party does not hold
83          and does not currently intend holding any essential patent claim(s); or
84       b) assurance that a license to such essential patent claim(s) will be made available to
85          applicants desiring to utilize the license for the purpose of complying with the guidance
86          or requirements in this ITL draft publication either:
87              i.    under reasonable terms and conditions that are demonstrably free of any unfair
88                    discrimination; or
89             ii.    without compensation and under reasonable terms and conditions that are
90                    demonstrably free of any unfair discrimination.

91   Such assurance shall indicate that the patent holder (or third party authorized to make assurances
92   on its behalf) will include in any documents transferring ownership of patents subject to the
93   assurance, provisions sufficient to ensure that the commitments in the assurance are binding on
94   the transferee, and that the transferee will similarly include appropriate provisions in the event of
95   future transfers with the goal of binding each successor-in-interest.

96   The assurance shall also indicate that it is intended to be binding on successors-in-interest
97   regardless of whether such provisions are included in the relevant transfer documents.

98   Such statements should be addressed to: 800-171comments@list.nist.gov

273       Introduction
274   The security assessment process gathers information and produces evidence to determine the
275   effectiveness of security requirements by:
276        •     Identifying potential problems or shortfalls in security and risk management programs;
277        •     Identifying security weaknesses and deficiencies in systems and the environments in
278              which those systems operate;
279        •     Prioritizing risk mitigation decisions and activities;
280        •     Confirming that identified security weaknesses and deficiencies in the system and
281              environment of operation have been addressed; and
282        •     Supporting continuous monitoring activities and providing information security
283              situational awareness.

284            Purpose and Applicability
285   The purpose of this publication is to provide procedures for assessing the security requirements
286   in NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-171, Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information
287   (CUI) in Nonfederal Systems and Organizations [3]. Organizations can use the assessment
288   procedures to generate evidence to support the assertion that the security requirements have been
289   satisfied. The scope of the security assessments conducted using the procedures described in this
290   publication are guided and informed by the system security plans for systems that process, store,
291   or transmit CUI. The assessment procedures offer the flexibility to customize assessments based
292   on organizational policies and requirements, known threat and vulnerability information, system
293   and platform dependencies, operational considerations, and tolerance for risk. 1

294         Organization of This Publication
295   The remainder of this special publication is organized as follows:
296        •     Section 2 describes the fundamental concepts associated with assessments of security
297              requirements, including assessment procedures, methods, objects, and assurance cases
298              that can be created using evidence produced during assessments.
299        •     Section 3 provides assessment procedures for the security requirements in NIST SP 800-
300              171, including assessment objectives and potential assessment methods and objects for
301              each procedure.

302   The following sections provide additional information to support the protection of CUI in
303   nonfederal systems and organizations:

       The term risk refers to risks to organizational operations (i.e., mission, functions, image, and reputation), organizational assets, individuals,
      other organizations, and the Nation. See NIST SP 800-39 [4] for additional information on organizational risk management and risk tolerance.



                                                                                1

              The contents of this publication can be used for many different assessment-related purposes
              to determine organizational compliance with the security requirements. The broad range of
              potential assessment methods and objects listed in this publication does not necessarily
              reflect and should not be directly associated with actual compliance or noncompliance.
              Rather, the selection of specific assessment methods and objects from the list provided can
              help generate a picture of overall compliance with the security requirements. There is no
              expectation about the number of methods or objects needed to determine compliance with
              the security requirements. Moreover, the entire list of potential assessment objects should
              not be viewed as required artifacts needed to determine compliance. Organizations have
              the flexibility to determine the specific methods and objects sufficient to obtain the needed
              evidence to support any claims of compliance.

310       The Fundamentals
311   The process used by organizations and assessors to assess the security requirements in NIST SP
312   800-171 includes (1) preparing for the assessment, (2) developing a security assessment plan, (3)
313   conducting the assessment, and (4) documenting, analyzing, and reporting the assessment
314   results. 2 The remainder of this section describes the structure and content of the procedures used
315   to assess the security requirements and the importance of assurance cases in providing the
316   evidence necessary to determine compliance with the requirements.

317          Assessment Procedures
318   The security requirements in NIST SP 800-171 are organized into 17 families, as illustrated in
319   Table 1. The assessment procedures in Section 3 are grouped by similar family designations to
320   ensure the completeness and consistency of assessments. The procedures have been derived from
321   the assessment procedures in NIST SP 800-53A [5].

323
324   An assessment procedure consists of an assessment objective and a set of potential assessment
325   methods and objects that can be used to conduct the assessment. Each potential assessment
326   objective includes a determination statement related to the security requirement. If there is an
327   organization-defined parameter (ODP) in the security requirement, then the assessment objective
328   begins with a determination statement related to the definition of the ODP. The determination
329   statements are linked to the content of the security requirements to help ensure traceability of the
330   assessment results to the requirements.

331   Assessment objects identify the specific items being assessed and can include specifications,
332   mechanisms, activities, and individuals. Specifications are the documented artifacts 3 (e.g., plans,
333   policies, procedures, requirements, functional and assurance specifications, architectures, and
334   design documentation) associated with a system. Mechanisms are the hardware, software, and
335   firmware safeguards implemented within a system. Activities are the protection-related actions
336   supporting a system that involve people (e.g., conducting system backup operations, exercising
337   an incident response plan, and monitoring network traffic). Individuals are the people applying
338   the specifications, mechanisms, or activities described above.

339   Assessment methods define the nature and extent of the assessor’s actions and are used to
340   facilitate understanding, achieve clarification, or obtain evidence. The potential assessment
341   methods include examine, interview, and test. The examine method is the process of reviewing,
342   studying, inspecting, observing, or analyzing assessment objects. The interview method is the
343   process of holding discussions with individuals or groups about assessment objects. The test
344   method is the process of exercising assessment objects (i.e., activities, mechanisms) under
345   specified conditions to compare actual with expected behavior. Assessment methods include
346   attributes of depth and coverage, which define the rigor, scope, and level of effort for the
347   assessment as well as the degree of assurance that the security requirements have been satisfied.

348   The structure and content of a typical assessment procedure are provided in the example below:

354         attempts by a user allowed during a time period is defined.             for Security Requirement and ODPs

355         A.03.01.08.ODP[02]: the time period to which the number of
356         consecutive invalid logon attempts by a user is limited is defined.
357         A.03.01.08: the number of consecutive invalid logon attempts by a user during
358         <03.01.08.ODP[02]: time period> is limited to <A.03.01.08.ODP[01]: number>.

371   Determination statements have alphanumeric identifiers. Each determination statement begins
372   with the letter “A” to indicate that it is part of an assessment procedure. The next sequence of
373   numbers and/or letters (e.g., 03.01.01.e or 03.01.01.f.02) indicates the security requirement
374   identifier from SP 800-171 (and the specific control item if it is a multi-part requirement) that is
375   the target of the assessment. Organization-defined parameters are indicated by the letters “ODP.”
376   If there are multiple ODPs in the determination statement, the ODP number is indicated in a
377   square bracket (e.g., A.03.01.08.ODP[01]). Square brackets are also used to denote when an
378   assessment procedure further decomposes a requirement into more granular determination
379   statements (e.g., A.03.01.12.a[01], A.03.01.12.a[02], A.03.01.12.a[03]).

      November 2023

380   The application of an assessment procedure to a security requirement produces assessment
381   results or findings. The findings are compiled and used as evidence to determine whether the
382   security requirement has been satisfied or other than satisfied. A finding of satisfied indicates
383   that the assessment objective has been met, producing a fully acceptable result. A finding of
384   other than satisfied indicates that there are potential anomalies that may need to be addressed by
385   the organization. A finding of other than satisfied may also indicate that the assessor was unable
386   to obtain sufficient information to make the determination called for in the determination
387   statement.

388   For assessment findings that are other than satisfied, organizations may define subcategories of
389   findings to indicate the severity or criticality of the weaknesses or deficiencies discovered and
390   the potential adverse effects of those weaknesses or deficiencies on the missions and/or business
391   functions of the organization. Defining such subcategories can help to establish priorities for
392   needed risk mitigation actions.

393           Assurance Cases
394   Building an effective assurance case to determine compliance with security requirements is a
395   process that involves compiling evidence from a variety of sources and conducting different
396   types of activities during an assessment. An assurance case is a body of evidence organized into
397   an argument demonstrating that some claim about a system is true. For assessments conducted
398   using the procedures in this publication, that claim is compliance with the security requirements
399   in NIST SP 800-171. Assessors obtain evidence during security assessments to allow designated
400   officials 4 to make objective determinations about compliance with the security requirements. The
401   evidence needed to make such determinations can be obtained from various sources, including
402   independent, third-party assessments or other types of assessments, depending on the needs of
403   the organization establishing the requirements and the organization conducting the assessments.

404   For example, many technical security requirements are satisfied by security capabilities that are
405   built into commercial information technology products and systems. Product assessments are
406   typically conducted by independent, third-party testing organizations. 5 These assessments
407   examine the security functions of products and established configuration settings. Assessments
408   can also be conducted to demonstrate compliance with industry, national, or international
409   security standards as well as developer and vendor claims. Since many information technology
410   products are assessed by commercial testing organizations and then subsequently deployed in
411   hundreds of thousands of systems, these types of assessments can be carried out at a greater level
412   of depth and provide deeper insights into the security capabilities of the products.

413   The evidence needed to determine compliance comes from assessing the implementation of the
414   safeguards and countermeasure selected to satisfy the security requirements. Assessors can build
415   on previously developed materials that started with the specification of the information security

        A designated official is an official, either internal or external to a nonfederal organization, with the responsibility to determine organizational
      compliance with the security requirements.
      5
        Examples of third-party testing organizations include Common Criteria Testing Laboratories that evaluate IT products in accordance with
      ISO/IEC 15408 [6] and Cryptographic Module Validation Program Testing Laboratories that evaluate cryptographic modules in accordance with
      Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140 [7].

417   implementation of the system. These materials provide the initial evidence for an assurance case.
418   Assessments can be conducted by system developers, system integrators, auditors, system
419   owners, or the security staffs of organizations. The assessors or assessment teams bring together
420   available information about the system, such as the results of component product assessments.
421   The assessors can conduct additional system-level assessments using the assessment methods
422   and procedures contained in this publication and based on the implementation information
423   provided by the nonfederal organization in its system security plan. Assessments can be used to
424   compile and evaluate the evidence needed by organizations to help determine the effectiveness
425   of the safeguards implemented to protect CUI, the actions needed to mitigate security risks to the
426   organization, and compliance with the security requirements.

427      The Procedures
428   This section provides assessment procedures for the security requirements defined in NIST SP
429   800-171. Organizations that conduct security requirement assessments can develop their security
430   assessment plans by using the information provided in the assessment procedures and selecting
431   the specific assessment methods and objects that meet the organization’s needs. Organizations
432   also have flexibility in defining the level of rigor and detail associated with the assessment based
433   on the assurance requirements of the organization.
