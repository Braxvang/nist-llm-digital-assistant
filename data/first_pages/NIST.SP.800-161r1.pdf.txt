This publication has been developed by NIST in accordance with its statutory responsibilities under the
Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) of 2014, 44 U.S.C. § 3551 et seq., Public Law
(P.L.) 113-283. NIST is responsible for developing information security standards and guidelines, including
minimum requirements for federal information systems, but such standards and guidelines shall not apply
to national security systems without the express approval of appropriate federal officials exercising policy
authority over such systems. This guideline is consistent with the requirements of the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130.

Nothing in this publication should be taken to contradict the standards and guidelines made mandatory and
binding on federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory authority. Nor should these
guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the Secretary of Commerce,
Director of the OMB, or any other federal official. This publication may be used by nongovernmental
organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright in the United States. Attribution would,
however, be appreciated by NIST.

Certain commercial entities, equipment, or materials may be identified in this document in order to describe an
experimental procedure or concept adequately. Such identification is not intended to imply recommendation or
endorsement by NIST, nor is it intended to imply that the entities, materials, or equipment are necessarily the best
available for the purpose.
There may be references in this publication to other publications currently under development by NIST in accordance
with its assigned statutory responsibilities. The information in this publication, including concepts and methodologies,
may be used by federal agencies even before the completion of such companion publications. Thus, until each
publication is completed, current requirements, guidelines, and procedures, where they exist, remain operative. For
planning and transition purposes, federal agencies may wish to closely follow the development of these new
publications by NIST.

                                                                                               to 18 months. This would have necessitated additional work on ABC Company’s part, including
                                                                                               testing samples of the supplier PCBs, finalizing logistical details, and monitoring supplier-side

                                                                                               The second issue was that the current contracts with all five suppliers in Southeast Asia involved
                                                                                               meeting minimum demand requirements, meaning that ABC Company was committed to
                                                                                               purchasing a minimum of 100,000 PCBs per month for the duration of the contracts, which

                                                                                               The first approach is known as FARM and consists of four steps: Frame, Assess, Respond, and

                                                                                               synthesized as part of the RMF Prepare step and then iteratively applied, tailored, and updated
