108                                              Abstract

109   All enterprises should ensure that information and communications technology (ICT) risk
110   receives appropriate attention within their enterprise risk management (ERM) programs. This
111   document is intended to help individual organizations within an enterprise improve their ICT risk
112   management (ICTRM). This can enable enterprises and their component organizations to better
113   identify, assess, and manage their ICT risks in the context of their broader mission and business
114   objectives. This document explains the value of rolling up and integrating risks that may be
115   addressed at lower system and organizational levels to the broader enterprise level by focusing
116   on the use of ICT risk registers as input to the enterprise risk profile.
117                                             Keywords

118   enterprise risk management (ERM); enterprise risk profile (ERP); enterprise risk register (ERR);
119   information and communications technology (ICT); ICT risk; ICT risk management (ICTRM);
120   ICT risk measurement; risk appetite; risk register; risk tolerance.
121                                              Audience

122   The primary audience for this publication is both Federal Government and non-Federal
123   Government professionals at all levels who understand ICT risk management (ICTRM) for one
124   or more ICT domains, but may be unfamiliar with ERM. The secondary audience includes both
125   federal and non-Federal Government corporate officers, high-level executives, ERM officers and
126   staff members, and others who understand ERM but may be unfamiliar with the unique
127   characteristics of ICTRM. All readers are expected to gain an improved understanding of how
128   ICTRM and ERM relate to each other, as well as the benefits of integrating their use.

132   For the purposes of this document, “assets” are defined as technologies that may compose an
133   information or communications system. The term “asset” or “assets” is used in multiple

134   frameworks and documents. Examples include laptop computers, desktop computers, servers,
135   sensors, data, mobile phones, tablets, routers, and switches. In instances where the authors mean
136   “assets” as they might be discussed at the enterprise level, the word “asset” will be preceded by
137   words such as “enterprise,” “high-level,” “balance sheet,” or “Level 1” to differentiate context.

138   This document uses the phrase “information and communications technology” for ICT. As of
139   this writing, both this phrase and the same phrase with “communication” instead of
140   “communications” are widely used. The phrases essentially mean the same thing.

141   This document references two types of controls, each of which is essential and should not be
142   confused with the other:
143      •   Internal controls are the overarching mechanisms used to achieve and monitor
144          enterprise objectives. The COSO Internal Control – Integrated Framework defines
145          internal control as “a process effected by an entity’s board of directors, management and
146          other personnel designed to provide reasonable assurance of the achievement of
147          objectives.” [COSOERM] These internal controls are an important factor at the enterprise
148          level. In fact, the title of OMB Circular A-123 is “Management’s Responsibility for
149          Enterprise Risk Management and Internal Control.”
150      •   Risk management controls represent the safeguards or countermeasures prescribed for
151          an information system or an organization to protect ICT in line with mission and business
152          objectives. These controls provide the management, administrative, and technical
153          methods for responding to ICT risks by deterring, detecting, preventing, or correcting
154          threats and vulnerabilities.
155                                          Note to Reviewers

156   The authors are grateful for the feedback and support provided by the community in response to
157   draft publications. In support of the final edition of this report, NIST asks that readers review the
158   following questions and consider these in your feedback and recommendations.
159      1. Is the treatment of discipline-specific risks (cybersecurity, privacy, supply chain,
160         communications, etc.) clearly expressed in context and relationship to categorization of
161         ICT, operational, and enterprise risk?
162      2. Has the consideration/treatment of risk associated with the intricacies and complexities of
163         interconnectivity, as part of the broader enterprise risk portfolio, been appropriately
164         addressed? Would examples/use-cases depicting this notion further, in the form of
165         supplemental material, be useful?
166      3. Are risk appetite and risk tolerance clearly explained and example use demonstrated?
167      4. Should BIA (business impact analysis) be addressed in this document or as a separate
168         Special Publication?
169      5. Does this publication effectively relate to both private and public sector enterprises
170         through its structure, terminologies, and examples?
171      6. Has this publication provided a clear definition and understanding of positive risk?

172      7. Does the information outlined in this publication provide sufficient information to inform
173         any mandatory/required disclosures (e.g., U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
174         [SEC], Internal Revenue Service [IRS])?
175      8. Does this publication provide sufficient information to enable the allocation tradeoffs of
176         an organization’s operating expenses (OpEx) and capital expenditures (CapEx) for ICT
177         risk and issues?
178      9. Does this publication provide actionable guidance to identify, measure, and manage the
179         new dimension of risk inherent in ICT “systems-of-systems”?
180      10. Are there additional ICTRM/ERM-related topics that would be helpful to include in
181          future iterations of this publication?

182                                        Call for Patent Claims

183   This public review includes a call for information on essential patent claims (claims whose use
184   would be required for compliance with the guidance or requirements in this Information
185   Technology Laboratory (ITL) draft publication). Such guidance and/or requirements may be
186   directly stated in this ITL Publication or by reference to another publication. This call also
187   includes disclosure, where known, of the existence of pending U.S. or foreign patent applications
188   relating to this ITL draft publication and of any relevant unexpired U.S. or foreign patents.

189   ITL may require from the patent holder, or a party authorized to make assurances on its behalf,
190   in written or electronic form, either:
191      a) assurance in the form of a general disclaimer to the effect that such party does not hold
192         and does not currently intend holding any essential patent claim(s); or
193      b) assurance that a license to such essential patent claim(s) will be made available to
194         applicants desiring to utilize the license for the purpose of complying with the guidance
195         or requirements in this ITL draft publication either:
196            i. under reasonable terms and conditions that are demonstrably free of any unfair
197                discrimination; or
198           ii. without compensation and under reasonable terms and conditions that are
199                demonstrably free of any unfair discrimination.

200   Such assurance shall indicate that the patent holder (or third-party authorized to make assurances
201   on its behalf) will include in any documents transferring ownership of patents subject to the
202   assurance, provisions sufficient to ensure that the commitments in the assurance are binding on
203   the transferee, and that the transferee will similarly include appropriate provisions in the event of
204   future transfers with the goal of binding each successor-in-interest.

205   The assurance shall also indicate that it is intended to be binding on successors-in-interest
206   regardless of whether such provisions are included in the relevant transfer documents.

207   Such statements should be addressed to: ictrm@nist.gov

208   Executive Summary

209   All types of organizations, from corporations to federal agencies, face a broad array of risks. For
210   federal agencies, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-11 defines risk as
211   “the effect of uncertainty on objectives” [OMB-A11]. The effect of uncertainty on enterprise
212   mission and business objectives may then be considered as an “enterprise risk” that must be
213   similarly managed. An enterprise is an organization that exists at the top level of a hierarchy
214   with unique risk management responsibilities. Managing risks at that level—enterprise risk
215   management (ERM)—calls for understanding the core risks that an enterprise faces, determining
216   how best to address those risks, and ensuring that the necessary actions are taken. In the Federal
217   Government, ERM is considered “an effective agency-wide approach to addressing the full
218   spectrum of the organization’s significant risks by understanding the combined impact of risks as
219   an interrelated portfolio rather than addressing risks only within silos” [OMB-A11]. OMB
220   Circular A-123 “establishes an expectation for federal agencies to proactively consider and
221   address risks through an integrated…view of events, conditions, or scenarios that impact mission
222   achievement” [OMB-A123].

223   The information and communications technology (ICT) on which an enterprise relies is managed
224   through a broad set of risk disciplines. For more than 50 years, NIST publications have provided
225   important guidance for individual programs such as manufacturing excellence, privacy, supply
226   chain, and cybersecurity. But, as the OMB quotes above point out, enterprise risk considerations
227   and decisions must take a portfolio perspective. Individual risk programs have an important role
228   and must integrate activities as part of that enterprise portfolio. Doing so ensures a focus on
229   achieving enterprise objectives and helps identify those risks that will have the most significant
230   impact on the entity’s mission. This publication extends that NIST risk program guidance,
231   recognizing that risk extends beyond the boundaries of individual programs. ICT risk
232   considerations and disciplines (e.g., Internet of Things, supply chain, privacy, cybersecurity) as
233   well as risk management frameworks (e.g., those for artificial intelligence and for information
234   systems and organizations) support the management of a mosaic of interrelated risks. Effectively
235   addressing these ICT risks at the enterprise level requires coordination, communication, and
236   collaboration. This publication examines the relationships among ICT risk disciplines and
237   enterprise risk practices.

238   The broad set of ICT disciplines forms an adaptive system-of-systems composed of many
239   interdependent components and channels. The resulting data represents information, control
240   signals, and sensor readings. As with other complex systems-of-systems, the interconnectedness
241   of these technologies produces system behaviors that cannot be determined by the behavior of
242   individual components. That interconnectedness causes risks which exist between risk programs
243   and across multiple risk programs. As our systems become more complex, they present
244   exploitable vulnerabilities, emergent risks, and system instabilities that, once triggered, can have
245   a runaway effect with multiple severe, often irreversible consequences. In the contemporary
246   enterprise, emergency and real-time circumstances can turn a relatively minor ICT-based risk
247   into true operational risks that disrupt an organization’s ability to perform mission or business
248   functions.

249   This publication supports an interconnected approach to risk frameworks and programs that
250   addresses ICT risk as a special subset of enterprise risk. This publication encourages the practice

251   of aggregating and normalizing ICT risk information, helping to identify, quantify, and
252   communicate risk scenarios and their consequences. Doing so supports effective decision-
253   making. That integrated approach ensures that shareholder and stakeholder value is quantified in
254   financial, mission, and reputation metrics similar to those attributed to other (non-technical)
255   enterprise risks, enabling executives and officials to prudently reallocate resources among all the
256   varied competing risk types.

257   While NIST is widely recognized as a source of cybersecurity guidance, cyber is only one
258   portion of a large and complex set of uncertainties including financial, legal, legislative, safety,
259   and strategic risks. As part of an ERM program, senior leaders (e.g., corporate officers,
260   government senior executive staff) often have fiduciary and reporting responsibilities that other
261   organizational stakeholders do not, so
262   they have a unique responsibility to
263   holistically manage the combined set of
264   risks. ERM provides the umbrella under
265   which risks are aggregated and
266   prioritized so that all risks can be
267   evaluated and “stovepiped” risk
268   reporting can be avoided. ERM also
269   provides an opportunity for
270   identification of operational risk, a
271   subset of the enterprise risks so
272   significant that potential losses could
273   jeopardize one or more aspects of
274   operations. Risk managers will
275   determine whether a failed internal
276   process (related to enterprise people,
277   processes, technology, or governance)
278   will directly cause a significant
279   operational impact. Some risk response
280   activities are there to directly protect
281   mission operations. Enterprise leaders
282   should define these operational risk
283   parameters as part of enterprise risk
284   strategy.

296   risk, estimate risk importance, determine and execute the risk response, and identify and respond
297   to changes over time. The process recognizes that no risk response should occur without
298   understanding stakeholder expectations for managing risk to an acceptable level, as informed by
299   leadership’s risk appetite and risk tolerance statements.

300   To ensure that leaders can be provided a composite understanding of the various threats and
301   consequences facing each organization and enterprise, risk information is recorded and shared
302   through risk registers. 1 At higher levels in the enterprise structure, various risk registers
303   (including those related to ICTRM) are aggregated, normalized, and prioritized into risk profiles.
304   While it is critical that enterprises address potential negative impacts on mission and business
305   objectives, it is equally critical (and required for federal agencies) that enterprises plan for
306   success. OMB states that “the [Enterprise Risk] profile must identify sources of uncertainty, both
307   positive (opportunities) and negative (threats).” [OMB-A123] Enterprise-level decision makers
308   use the risk profile to choose which enterprise risks to address, allocate resources, and delegate
309   responsibilities to appropriate risk owners. ERM strategy includes defining terminology, formats,
310   criteria, and other guidance for risk inputs from lower levels of the enterprise.

311   Integrated risk management information from throughout the enterprise helps create a composite
312   enterprise risk register (ERR) and a prioritized enterprise risk profile (ERP) to inform company
313   executives and agency officials’ ERM deliberations, decisions, and actions. It describes the
314   inclusion of ICT risks (including various operational technology, supply chain, privacy, and
315   cybersecurity risks) as part of financial, valuation, mission, and reputation exposure. A
316   comprehensive ERR and ERP support communication and disclosure requirements. The
317   integration of technology-specific risk management activities supports an understanding of
318   exposures related to corporate reporting (e.g., income statements, balance sheets, cash flow) and
319   similar requirements (e.g., reporting for appropriation and oversight authorities) for public-sector
320   entities. The iterative ICTRM process enables adjustments to risk direction. As leaders receive
321   feedback regarding enterprise progress, strategy can be adjusted to take advantage of an
322   opportunity or to better address negative risk as information is collected and shared.

323   Application of a consistent approach to identify, assess, respond to, and communicate risk
324   throughout the enterprise about the entire portfolio of ICT risk disciplines will help ensure that
325   leaders and executives are always informed and able to support effective strategic and tactical
326   decisions. While the methods for managing risk among different disciplines will vary widely, an
327   ICT-wide approach to directing that risk management, reporting and monitoring the results, and
328   adjusting to optimize achievement of enterprise objectives will provide valuable benefits.

421   1         Introduction

422   The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) defines risk as “the effect of uncertainty on
423   objectives” [OMB-A11]. The effect of uncertainty on enterprise mission and business objectives
424   may then be considered an enterprise risk that must be similarly managed. The process of
425   managing risks at the enterprise level is known as enterprise risk management (ERM), and it
426   calls for:
427         •    identifying and understanding the core risks facing an enterprise,
428         •    determining how best to address those risks, and
429         •    ensuring that the necessary actions are taken.

430   Playbook: Enterprise Risk Management for the U.S. Federal Government [ERMPLAYBOOK]
431   defines numerous types of risk, including compliance, financial, information and
432   communications technology (ICT), legal, legislative, operational, reputational, and strategic. 2
433   Enterprises use ERM to holistically manage the combined set of risks. OMB Circular A-123
434   “establishes an expectation for federal agencies to proactively consider and address risks through
435   an integrated…view of events, conditions, or scenarios that impact mission achievement”
436   [OMB-A123]. OMB considers ERM to be “an effective agency-wide approach to addressing the
437   full spectrum of the organization’s significant risks by understanding the combined impact of
438   risks as an interrelated portfolio, rather than addressing risks only within silos.” [OMB-A123] In
439   the private sector, the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) publication, Enterprise
440   Risk Management – Integrating with Strategy and Performance, defines ERM as the “culture,
441   capabilities, and practices that organizations integrate with strategy-setting and apply when they
442   carry out that strategy, with a purpose of managing risk in creating, preserving, and realizing
443   value.” [COSOERM]

444   Many ICT risk management (ICTRM) disciplines, including cybersecurity, supply chain, and
445   privacy, have evolved into full-fledged risk programs because of organizations’ reliance on ICT.
446   The rapid evolution of ICTRM disciplines sometimes has led to miscommunication and
447   inefficiencies between those risk programs and the overarching ERM portfolio of risks. In recent
448   years, NIST has published guidance to codify risk management practices for several individual
449   ICT risk programs, such as general cybersecurity (Cybersecurity Framework), general privacy
450   (Privacy Framework), information system and organization cybersecurity and privacy (Risk
451   Management Framework), artificial intelligence (AI Risk Management Framework), Internet of
452   Things (IoT) cybersecurity, and cyber supply chain risk management.

453   1.1       Purpose and Scope

454   This publication broadens NIST’s existing ICT risk guidance by recognizing and incorporating
455   ICTRM within the overall sphere of ERM. All ICT risk programs can work together to support
456   ERM and can be integrated into risk portfolios for ERM. Comparing the outputs of ICTRM

            (SP) 800-221 draws from the original (2016) edition of that guide but remains consistent with the updated edition.

457   activities with effective inputs to ERM activities, and the outputs of ERM with effective inputs
458   for ICTRM, enables stakeholders to identify opportunities to close gaps.

459   This document is intended to help improve communication (including risk information sharing)
460   between and among ICT professionals and system owners, high-level executives, and corporate
461   officers at multiple levels. The goal is to assist personnel in better identifying, assessing, and
462   managing ICT risks in the context of their broader mission and business objectives. This

499   2       Introduction to ICTRM and Challenges with ERM Integration

500   This section provides a brief introduction to ICTRM and explores common challenges involved
501   in integrating ICTRM with ERM processes.

502   2.1     Comparing ICTRM and ERM

503   Distinguishing ICTRM from ERM and understanding how they relate requires first
504   differentiating the terms organization and enterprise. Although they are often used
505   interchangeably, 5 for the purposes of this document an organization is an entity of any size,
506   complexity, or position within a larger organizational structure (e.g., a federal agency or
507   company), and an enterprise is an organization at the top level of the hierarchy. Figure 2 shows a
508   notional enterprise with subordinate organizations, illustrating that one of those subordinates is
509   itself an enterprise. Both government and industry are represented in this depiction.

510   Consider the example of
511   the Department of
512   Commerce as a higher-
513   level enterprise with
514   bureaus (e.g., Census
515   Bureau, National Oceanic
516   and Atmospheric
517   Administration [NOAA],
518   NIST) as lower-level
519   enterprises and their
520   subordinates (e.g.,
521   NOAA’s National
522   Weather Service, NIST
523   laboratories) representing
524   organizations. In                                  Figure 2: Enterprise Hierarchy
525   industry, consider mergers and
526   acquisitions where an enterprise acquires another company, which itself was an enterprise, and
527   then subordinates it within the higher-level enterprise’s conglomeration of organizations and
528   systems. Each enterprise is supported by various systems, each a discrete set of information
529   resources organized expressly for the collection, processing, maintenance, use, sharing,
530   dissemination, or disposition of information.

531   Most ICTRM responsibilities tend to be carried out by the individual organizations within an
532   enterprise. In contrast, the ERM responsibility for tracking key enterprise risks and their impacts
533   on objectives is at the highest-level enterprise, held by top-level corporate officers and board
534   members who have fiduciary and reporting duties not performed elsewhere in the enterprise.

535   ERM requires identifying and understanding the various types of risk, including ICT risks, that
536   an enterprise faces; determining the probability that these risks will occur; and estimating their

      5     For example, NIST IR 8170 uses enterprise risk management and organization-wide risk management interchangeably. The
            scope of NIST IR 8170 includes smaller enterprises than this publication does, so an enterprise as defined there may be
            comprised of a single organization. The enterprises discussed in this publication have more complex compositions. [IR8170]

                                                                     4

537   potential impact. ERM processes provide senior enterprise executives with a portfolio view of
538   key risks across the enterprise, and this portfolio considers the outputs of all ICTRM disciplines. 6

539   Public and private enterprises have a common primary purpose for ERM: to safeguard the
540   enterprise’s mission, finances (e.g., net revenue, capital, free cash flow), and reputation (e.g.,
541   stakeholder trust) in the face of natural, accidental, and adversarial threats.

542   2.2      ICTRM Life Cycle

543   There are many models for risk management processes. Table 1 illustrates similarities among
544   several common risk management models, including establishing context, identifying risks,
545   analyzing risks, estimating risk importance, determining and executing risk response, and
546   monitoring and responding to changes over time. The entries in Table 1 indicate (in parentheses)
547   their identifier or section number from the source material whenever available. Table 1 provides
548   a high-level comparison and is not intended as a crosswalk for relationships among the models,
549   but instead to show that risk management disciplines that aggregate into the ERM process follow
550   similar steps to manage risk.

551   The resources in Table 1 are from the ERM Playbook [ERMPLAYBOOK], the COSO ERM
552   Framework [COSOERM], International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 31000
553   [ISO31000], OMB Circular A-123 [OMB-A123], and the U.S. Government Accountability
554   Office (GAO) Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government [GREENBOOK].

556   This document uses the processes of the ERM Playbook (column 1 in Table 1) as a basis for
557   describing the ICTRM life cycle and explaining, at a high level, how ICTRM integrates with
558   ERM. This is not meant to imply that all enterprises should use these particular steps; enterprises
559   should determine and apply the appropriate approach to achieve ICTRM/ERM integration,
560   communication, and monitoring. The six steps in the notional ICTRM life cycle are:
561      •     Step 1. Identify the context. Context is the external and internal environment in which
562            the enterprise operates and is influenced by the risks involved. This step includes
563            determining and documenting the enterprise mission, including goals and objectives, and
564            the enterprise risk management strategy. This step also includes enterprise leaders
565            communicating risk management expectations to their component organizations.
566      •     Step 2. Identify the risks. This means identifying the comprehensive set of positive and
567            negative risks and determining which events could enhance or impede objectives,
568            including the risk of failing to pursue an opportunity.
569      •     Step 3. Analyze the risks. This involves estimating the likelihood that each identified
570            risk event will occur and the potential impact of the consequences described.
571      •     Step 4. Prioritize the risks. The exposure is calculated for each risk based on likelihood
572            and potential impact, and the risks are then prioritized based on their exposure.
573      •     Step 5. Plan and execute risk response strategies. The appropriate response is
574            determined for each risk and informed by risk guidance from leadership.
575      •     Step 6. Monitor, evaluate, and adjust risk management. Continual monitoring ensures
576            that enterprise risk conditions remain within the defined risk appetite levels as risks
577            change.

578   Steps 2 through 6 usually utilize risk registers. OMB Circular A-11 describes a risk register as “a
579   repository of risk information, including the data understood about risks over time.” It also
580   states, “Typically, a risk register contains a description of the risk, the impact if the risk should
581   occur, the probability of its occurrence, mitigation strategies, risk owners, and a ranking to
582   identify higher priority risks.” [OMB-A11] Each register evolves and matures as other risk
583   activities take place.

584   Not all risk management methodologies generate an artifact called a risk register or risk log.
585   However, the output of each methodology contains the underpinnings of (or can serve as an input
586   to) a risk register. Because they can be useful information-gathering constructs, organizations not
587   yet familiar with or using risk registers are strongly urged to adopt and integrate them into
588   whatever risk management methodology they are currently using. Risk registers represent an
589   organizing principle for communicating ICT risks to the OMB Circular A-123 ERM process for

596   makers.

599   each step occurs. Section 3 provides

601   elements within Figure 3.

602   2.3     ICTRM and ERM Integration

603   ERM and ICTRM have several points of
604   integration. First, enterprise governance
605   activities for ERM direct the strategy
606   and methods for ICTRM and other risk
607   management disciplines to use. Based
608   on this guidance, each discipline within
609   each organization uses risk registers to
610   document its risks – in the case of
611   ICTRM, risks derived from system-level
612   assessments. Next, these risk registers
613   are aggregated and normalized, then
614   used to create enterprise-level risk
615   registers for each discipline. These, in
616   turn, become part of a broader                               Figure 3: Notional Life Cycle for Integrated ICTRM/ERM
617   enterprise risk register (ERR) that
618   encompasses all disciplines.

619   Figure 4 demonstrates that ERM and ICTRM are not separate processes; ICTRM represents an
620   important subset of the broader portfolio of ERM. Documenting and tracking ICT risks in lower-
621   level risk registers supports better management of ICT risks at the enterprise level.

622   The ERR is prioritized by those with fiduciary and oversight responsibilities, creating an
623   enterprise risk profile (ERP), also known as an ERM risk profile. 7 An ERP is created by
624   considering enterprise risks in relation to achieving objectives as typically outlined in an
625   organizational strategic plan. OMB Circular A-123 [OMB-A123] requires ERPs to include four
626   kinds of objectives: strategic, operations (operational effectiveness and efficiency), reporting
627   (reporting reliability), and compliance (compliance with applicable laws and regulations). While
628   there may be some overlap among the categories of objectives, understanding uncertainty as it

629   affects these objectives will help inform effective and timely decision-making. Effective ERM
630   balances achieving objectives with optimizing resources.

631   Section 3 discusses ICTRM
632   and ERM integration in
633   much greater detail.

634   2.4     Shortcomings of
635           Typical Approaches
636           to ICTRM

637   Historically, in many
638   enterprises, ICTRM
639   disciplines have not been
640   well integrated with ERM
641   processes. While ICTRM
642   follows many of the same
643   high-level principles as the
644   ERM framework, ICTRM
645   is typically executed quite
646   differently, and its outputs
647   are not always properly
648   conditioned as ERM inputs.
649   Some common contributors
650   to those shortcomings are
651   described below.

652   2.4.1    Increasing System
653            and Ecosystem
654            Complexity

655   Many systems today are
656   complex, adaptive “system-
657   of-systems” composed of
658   thousands of
659   interdependent components
660   and myriad channels. The
661   systems operate in a rapidly
662   changing socio-political-                            Figure 4: ICTRM As Part of ERM
663   technological environment
664   that presents threats from individuals and groups with shifting alliances, attitudes, and agendas.
665   The constant introduction of new technologies has changed and complicated cyberspace.
666   Wireless connections, big data, cloud computing, and the IoT present new complexities and
667   concomitant vulnerabilities. Information and technology are no longer like simple, automated
668   filing systems. Rather, they are like the central nervous system – a delicately balanced and
669   intricate part of an organization or enterprise that coordinates and controls the most fundamental
670   assets of most organizations. This ecosystem’s increasing complexity gives rise to systemic risks


                                                      8
      NIST SP 800-221 ipd                                                                ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION
      INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT                                                           AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK


671   and exploitable vulnerabilities that, once triggered, can have a runaway effect with multiple
672   severe consequences for enterprises.

673   Managing ICT risk for these ecosystems is incredibly challenging because of their dynamic
674   complexity. This complexity increases risk to specific systems, and that risk can cascade to
675   create additional risks at the system, organization, and enterprise levels. Emerging risk
676   conditions created by the interdependence of systems and counterparty risk must also be
677   identified, tracked, and managed.

678   2.4.2   Lack of Standardized Measures

679   ICT risk measurement has been extensively researched for decades. As measurement techniques
680   have evolved, the complexity of digital assets has also greatly increased, making the
681   measurement problem more difficult to solve. Some low-level measures 8 have been
682   standardized, like the estimated likelihood and impact of a particular vulnerability being
683   exploited. However, for many aspects of ICT risk, there are no standard measures. Without
684   consistent measures, there is little basis for analyzing risk or expressing risk in comparable ways
685   across digital assets and the systems composed of those assets.

686   2.4.3   Informal Analysis Methods

687   Risk analysis for ICT tends to be inconsistent compared to many other forms of risk. Even where
688   guidance is provided, such as in NIST publications, the resulting risk assessment reports from
689   agencies differ significantly. Moreover, foundational inputs for likelihood and impact
690   calculations generally lack a standardized methodology or are at the discretion of vendors who
691   provide a scoring system. Decisions are often made based on an individual’s instinct, experience,
692   and knowledge of conventional wisdom and typical practices. In addition, there is usually little
693   analysis performed after controls are deployed to determine whether risks have been reduced to a
694   level deemed acceptable (i.e., within the established risk tolerance parameters).

695   2.4.4   Overly Focused on the System Level

696   The management of ICT risk is conducted in different ways at various levels, including at the
697   system, organization, and enterprise levels. A common practice is for individual system-level
698   teams to be responsible for tracking relevant risks. While system reporting to the organizational
699   level may occur, there is typically no mechanism in place to consolidate the risk data for systems
700   to the organization level, much less to the enterprise level. When organization or enterprise
701   managers receive system risk data, it is often a vague risk map or at such a volume as to be
702   impractical. Therefore, it is not surprising that higher levels of an organization or enterprise tend
703   to struggle with understanding ICT risk. This struggle may be less pronounced in organizations
704   with an enterprise architecture that maps systems onto the business processes they support.

705   Many enterprise risks are interdependent. A common industry example is that while
706   cybersecurity, privacy, and credit risks are different elements of the ERM portfolio, it is quite

      8
          NIST typically uses the term “measures” instead of “metrics.” For more information on the distinction, see
          https://www.nist.gov/itl/ssd/software-quality-group/metrics-and-measures.

                                                                    9

      INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT                                          AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK


707   possible that a cybersecurity breach of personally identifiable information might result in a credit
708   downgrade or a loss of public confidence. These interdependencies make it important that
709   enterprise managers collaborate, communicate, and recognize that information, technology, and
710   business risks are not isolated issues.

711   2.4.5   The Gap Between ICTRM Output and ERM Input

712   An enterprise that seeks to avoid all ICT risk might stifle innovation or efficiencies to the point
713   where little value would be produced. At the other end of the spectrum, an enterprise that applies
714   technology without regard to actual risk increases the chances that it might fall victim to
715   undesirable consequences. Effectively balancing the benefits of technology with the potential
716   risks and consequences of a threat event is more likely to result in effective ICTRM that supports
717   a comprehensive ERM approach. Enterprises, organizations, and practitioners should consider
718   the influence of risks on achieving enterprise strategic, operations, reporting, and compliance
719   objectives. Enterprise risk officers should clearly communicate these enterprise objectives so that
720   practitioners can take actions and provide relevant risk inputs to ERM programs. They also need
721   to consider relevant policy decisions and regulatory impacts.

722   For ERM purposes, there should be a process for integrating the risk registers of various ICTRM
723   disciplines. This allows for the easy exchange of risk knowledge between ICTRM and ERM
724   participants. Many organizations do not conduct these activities in consistent, repeatable ways.
725   Quantifying and aggregating ICT risks are often done in an ad hoc fashion and are not performed
726   with the rigor used for other types of risk. This lowers the quality of ICT risk information
727   provided to ERM.

728   2.4.6   Losing the Context of the Positive Risk

729   As aggravated by the multi-level nature of risk management, sometimes risks identified and
730   managed at the system and organizational levels lose the context of associated positive risks.
731   The basic rationalization for addressing negative risks with resources, time, and funding is that
732   positive risks warrant those investments. Only by evaluating the value of positive risks alongside
733   the expense of negative risks can we understand whether continued pursuit of positive risks and
734   investment in negative risks is “worth it.” Losing track of positive risks can result in over-
735   investing in the corresponding negative risks.

736   3         ICT Risk Considerations

737   This section discusses ICT risk considerations, with the content structured according to the six
738   steps in the notional ICTRM life cycle described in Figure 3:
739         1. Identify the context.
740         2. Identify the risks.
741         3. Analyze (quantify) the risks.
742         4. Prioritize the risks.
743         5. Plan and execute risk response strategies.
744         6. Monitor, evaluate, and adjust risk management.

745   Following those, Section 3.7 briefly discusses considerations for positive risks.

746   3.1       Identify the Context

747   In the risk management life cycle, the first step in managing ICT risks is understanding context –
748   the environment in which the organization operates and is influenced by the risks involved. The
749   context provides important input into the other risk management life cycle steps by documenting
750   the expectations and drivers to be considered. The risk context includes two factors:
751         •    External context involves the expectations of outside stakeholders who affect and are
752              affected by the organization, such as customers, regulators, legislators, and business
753              partners. These stakeholders have objectives, perceptions, and expectations about how
754              risk will be communicated, managed, and monitored.
755         •    Internal context relates to many of the factors within the organization and relevant
756              considerations across the enterprise. This includes any internal factors that influence risk
757              management, such as the organization and enterprise’s objectives, governance, culture,
758              risk appetite, risk tolerance, policies, and practices.

759   Several NIST frameworks begin with determining these context factors. NIST Cybersecurity
760   Framework Step 1: Prioritize and Scope states that organizations make strategic decisions
761   regarding ICT implementations and determine the scope of the systems and assets that support
762   the selected business line or process. These context exercises identify the organization mission
763   drivers and priorities used for subsequent assessment and planning.

764   3.1.1      Risk Governance

765   As an important component of ERM, ICTRM helps assure that ICT risks do not hinder
766   accomplishment of established enterprise mission objectives. ICTRM also helps ensure that
767   exposure from ICT risk remains within the limits assigned by enterprise leadership. The method
768   for connecting enterprise operations and communications to strategy is governance. Governance
769   represents the methods for evaluating strategic options and directing activities to achieve that
770   strategy. Through a governance model, enterprise objectives are determined, providing direction
771   for prioritization and decision-making. Governance is often described as distinct from
772   management in the same way that a directive from a ship’s captain is distinct from the many

                                                          11
      NIST SP 800-221 ipd                                                                  ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION
      INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT                                                             AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK


773   activities performed to fulfill the directive. Similarly, risk governance is the process by which
774   risk management evaluation, decisions, and actions are connected to enterprise strategy and
775   objectives.

776   Risk governance provides the transparency, responsibility, and accountability that enables
777   managers to acceptably manage risk. In this regard, there can be multiple participants in the
778   governance process, depending on context and enterprise type. Larger entities might implement
779   risk governance mechanisms across the enterprise with more specific governance mechanisms at
780   the organization (e.g., division, portfolio, or bureau) and apply that strategy to systems or
781   programs.

784   As shown in the table, certain enterprise and organization risk governance functions may be
785   delegated to other senior leaders. Individual risk programs – including cybersecurity, privacy,
786   and cyber supply chain risk management (C-SCRM) – might then further translate enterprise risk
787   direction (e.g., risk appetite statements) into program-specific risk direction, enabling holistic
788   risk processes while supporting system owners’ decision authority. The division of responsibility
789   is typical in larger organizations where an officer is specifically assigned to be responsible for
790   program governance (e.g., chief information security officer, chief privacy officer).

791   3.1.2     Risk Appetite and Risk Tolerance

792   This document draws on ERM principles regarding integration with culture, strategy, and
793   performance. One such principle is that an “organization must manage risk to strategy and
794   business objectives in relation to its risk appetite – that is, the types and amount of risk, on a
795   broad level, it is willing to accept in its pursuit of value.” [COSOERM] OMB adapted this
796   language for government use in Circular A-123 by similarly stating that risk appetite “is the
797   broad-based amount of risk an organization is willing to accept in pursuit of its mission/vision”
798   [OMB-A123]. Risk appetite is defined by the enterprise’s senior-level leadership as part of risk
799   governance. Risk appetite serves as the guidepost for the types and amount of risk, on a broad
800   level, that senior leaders are willing to accept in pursuit of mission objectives and enterprise
801   value. 10 Risk appetite may be qualitative or quantitative.

802   Another important ERM concept is risk tolerance – the organization’s or stakeholders’ readiness
803   to bear the remaining risk after responding to or considering the risk in order to achieve its
804   objectives (while recognizing that such tolerance can be influenced by legal or regulatory

      10   OMB Circular A-123 defines risk appetite as “the broad-based amount of risk an organization is willing to accept in pursuit
           of its mission/vision. It is established by the organization’s most senior level leadership and serves as the guidepost to set
           strategy and select objectives.”

                                                                      13

      INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT                                                               AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK


805   requirements). In Circular A-123, OMB again adapted the COSO language [COSOERM] by
806   stating that risk tolerance “is the acceptable level of variance in performance relative to the
807   achievement of objectives.” Risk tolerance can be defined at the enterprise level, but OMB
808   Circular A-123 offers a bit of discretion to organizations, stating that risk tolerance is “generally
809   established at the program, objective, or component level,” which this publication references as
810   the “organization level.”

811   While risk appetite is defined at the enterprise level and risk tolerance at the enterprise or
812   organization level, risk appetite is interpreted at the organizational and system levels to develop
813   specific ICT risk tolerance. Risk tolerance represents the specific level of performance risk
814   deemed acceptable within the risk appetite set by senior leadership (while recognizing that such
815   tolerance can be influenced by legal or regulatory requirements). 11 Risk tolerance is interpreted
816   and applied by the receiving custodians of the risk management discipline (e.g., cybersecurity,
817   financial, legal, privacy) at the organization or system level.

818   Risk appetite and risk tolerance are related but distinct in a similar manner to the relationship
819   between governance and management activities. Risk appetite statements define the overarching
820   risk guidance, and risk tolerance statements define the specific application of that direction. This
821   means that risk tolerance statements are always more specific than the corresponding risk
822   appetite statements. Together, risk appetite and risk tolerance statements represent risk limits,
823   help communicate risk expectations, and improve the focus of risk management efforts. They
824   also help to address other factors, such as findings from internal audits or external reports. The
825   definition of these risk parameters places the enterprise in a better position to identify, prioritize,
826   treat, and monitor risks that may lead to unacceptable loss. Risk tolerance should always stay
827   within the boundaries established by senior leadership, within the parameters of and informed by
828   legal and regulatory requirements.

829   An example of a statement of risk appetite is: “Email service shall be available during the large
830   majority of a 24-hour period.” An associated risk tolerance statement for this appetite would be
831   narrower: “Email services shall not be interrupted more than five minutes during core hours.”
832   Table 3 provides additional examples of actionable, measurable risk tolerance, illustrating the
833   application of risk appetite to specific contexts within the organization-level structure. Several
834   NIST documents, including the NIST IR 8286 series and Cyber Supply Chain Risk Management
835   Practices for Systems and Organizations, NIST SP 800-161, Revision 1, also provide detailed
836   examples of risk appetite and risk tolerance statements and how they are interpreted and applied
837   with the associated risk defined, managed, and communicated back to executive management via
838   the risk register [SP800161].




      11   OMB Circular A-123 states, “Risk must be analyzed in relation to achievement of the strategic objectives established in the
           Agency strategic plan (see OMB Circular No. A-11, Section 230), as well as risk in relation to appropriate operational
           objectives. Specific objectives must be identified and documented to facilitate identification of risks to strategic, operations,
           reporting, and compliance” [OMB-A123].

840   3.1.3    Risk Management Strategy

841   As part of their governance responsibilities, senior enterprise executives should establish clear
842   and actionable risk management guidance based on enterprise mission and business objectives to
843   the organizations within their purview. This should include an enterprise strategy regarding
844   mission priority, risk appetite and tolerance (typically in the form of risk appetite and risk
845   tolerance statements), and capital and operating budgets to manage risks to an acceptable level.
846   Organizations then manage and monitor processes that properly balance risks and resource
847   allocation with the value created by ICT. Measurements (e.g., from key risk indicators, or KRIs)
848   demonstrate where risk tolerances have been exceeded or validate that the enterprise is operating
849   within the defined appetite.

850   As the risk landscape evolves (e.g., due to technological or environmental changes), enterprise
851   leaders should continually review and adjust the risk strategy. For example, an enterprise subject
852   to outside regulation is likely to receive specific guidance regarding updated federal statutes and
853   directives that must be considered when evaluating acceptable risk.

854   Differing assumptions may occur at all levels of the organization, so it is important to determine
855   internal and external stakeholders’ expectations regarding risk communications and to use
856   readily understandable and agreed-upon terms and categories, such as strategic objectives,
857   organizational priorities, decision-making processes, and risk reporting or tracking
858   methodologies (e.g., regular risk management committee discussions and meetings). It is also
859   critical that enterprise leaders provide guidance regarding risk calculations. Establishing a

                                                                15

      INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT                                            AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK


860   common scale for assessing levels of risk will support consistent risk estimation, measurement,
861   and reporting. The strategy may also include guidance regarding the mechanisms and frequency
862   of risk reporting.

863   As risks are recorded, tracked, and reassessed throughout the cycle, this foundation ensures that
864   all agree about how various types of risk will be communicated and managed to ensure
865   adherence to risk guidance and expectations.

866   Risk management strategy is similar for both public- and private-sector enterprises. For example,
867   public officials and corporate boards typically measure and weigh the impact and likelihood of
868   each type of significant risk (e.g., market, operational, labor, geopolitical, technology, data) to
869   determine their individual and total impacts on the enterprise’s mission, finances, and reputation.
870   The public officials or board members then determine their risk appetite and resource allocations
871   for each type of risk commensurate with likelihood and impact and balanced among all
872   calculated enterprise risk exposures (the product of likelihood and impact). Public officials and
873   board members also provide guidance to their corporate officers at the enterprise level and to
874   high-level executives at the organization level. This includes guidance on ceilings for capital
875   expenditures (CapEx) and operating expenses (OpEx) and objectives for free cash flow. For the
876   Federal Government, similar requirements are expressed through OMB guidance and strategic
877   direction from senior agency officials, chief executives, and other designees (e.g., an ERM
878   Council).

879   For both private- and public-sector entities, leaders issue guidance to continue, accelerate,
880   reduce, delay, or cancel significant enterprise initiatives. They do this while making decisions
881   about what constitutes prudent risk disclosures, balancing the competing objectives of a)
882   properly informing stakeholders and overseers (including regulators) through required filings and
883   statements at hearings, versus b) protecting sensitive information from competitors and
884   adversaries.

885   3.2     Identify the Risks

886   The second step in the risk management life cycle involves identifying a comprehensive set of
887   risks and recording them in the risk register. This involves identifying those events that could
888   enhance or impede objectives, including the risks involved in failing to pursue opportunities. ICT
889   risk identification is composed of four inputs:
890         1. identification of the organization’s mission-supporting assets and their valuation,
891         2. determination of potential threats that might jeopardize the security or performance of
892            those assets and potential ICT opportunities that might benefit the organization,
893         3. consideration of the vulnerabilities of those assets, and
894         4. evaluation of the potential consequences of risk scenarios.

895   Sections 3.2.1 through 3.2.4 discuss each of these four inputs in more detail.

896   Risk practitioners often perform risk identification as both top-down and bottom-up exercises.
897   For example, after the organization has considered critical or mission-essential functions, it may
898   consider various types of issues that could jeopardize those functions as an input to risk scenario

                                                        16
      NIST SP 800-221 ipd                                                                ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION
      INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT                                                           AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK


899   development. Subsequently, as a detailed threat and vulnerability assessment occurs, assessors
900   consider how those threats might affect various assets by conducting a bottom-up assessment.
901   This bidirectional approach helps support holistic and comprehensive risk identification.

902   3.2.1    Inventory and Valuation of Assets

903   Since ICT risk reflects, at least in part, the effect of uncertainty on digital components that
904   support enterprise objectives, practitioners identify the assets that are necessary to achieve those
905   objectives. The value of an asset extends beyond its replacement cost. For example, an
906   organization could calculate the direct cost of research and development for a new product
907   offering, but the long-term losses associated with the theft of that intellectual property could
908   impact future revenue, share prices, enterprise reputation, and competitive advantage. A core
909   concept in ERM is prioritizing attention and resources on those assets that have the greatest
910   impact on an enterprise’s ability to achieve its mission (and, in the case of federal agencies,
911   impact that affects the public.)

912   Risk managers should leverage a business impact analysis (BIA) template that can be used to
913   consistently evaluate, record, and monitor the criticality and sensitivity of enterprise assets. 12 It is
914   vitally important to gain senior stakeholders’ guidance regarding the determination of which
915   assets are critical or sensitive. Federal agencies are required to identify and record high value
916   assets, or HVAs. The relative importance of each enterprise asset is a necessary input for
917   considering the impact portion of risk analysis.

918   Note that many of the assets on which an organization depends are not within its direct control.
919   External technical assets may include cloud-based software or platform services,
920   telecommunications circuits, and video monitoring. Personnel may include the internal
921   workforce, external service providers, and third-party partners.

922   3.2.2    Determination of Potential Threats

923   ICT risk is not inherently good or bad. Rather, it represents the effects of uncertain
924   circumstances, so risk managers should consider a broad array of potential positive and negative
925   risks. The following sections primarily deal with negative risks. A threat represents any
926   circumstance or event with the potential to adversely impact organizational operations (a
927   negative risk) 13. The threat could arise from a malicious person with harmful intent or from an
928   unintended or unavoidable situation (e.g., a natural disaster, technical failure, or human errors)
929   that may trigger a vulnerability. Numerous threat modeling techniques are available for
930   analyzing specific threats. It may be helpful to consider both a top-down approach (i.e.,
931   reviewing critical or sensitive assets for what could potentially go wrong, regardless of threat
932   source) and a bottom-up approach (i.e., considering the potential impact of a given set of threat
933   or vulnerability scenarios).




      12   For more information on BIA, see NIST IR 8286D [IR8286D].
      13   The term threat is used throughout this publication to describe the source of any problem, circumstance, or event with the
           potential to adversely impact organizational operations. The word threat may have specific meaning, and possibly greater or
           lesser importance, within a given risk program.

                                                                    17

934   One source of threat information is a high-level assessment based on various frameworks (e.g.,
935   NIST Cybersecurity Framework, Privacy Framework, Secure Software Development
936   Framework). These frameworks often provide a way to determine the enterprise’s currently
937   implemented practices (i.e., current state) and ways to review the risk implications of that state to
938   identify potential risk scenarios.

939   One commonly used method that may help organizations identify potential risk outcomes is a
940   SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analysis. Applying SWOT analysis helps
941   users identify opportunities that arise from organizational strengths (e.g., a well-respected
942   software development team) and threats (e.g., supply chain issues) that reflect an organizational
943   weakness. The use of SWOT analysis helps describe and consider the context described in
944   Section 3.1, including internal factors (strengths and weaknesses internal to the organization),
945   external factors (the opportunities and threats presented by the external environment), and ways
946   in which these factors relate to each other.

947   While it is critical that enterprises address potential negative impacts on mission and business
948   objectives, it is equally critical (and required for federal agencies) that enterprises plan for
949   success. OMB states in Circular A-123 that “the profile must identify sources of uncertainty,
950   both positive (opportunities) and negative (threats).” However, the notion of “planning for
951   success” by identifying and realizing positive risks (opportunities) is a relatively new concept in
952   ICTRM that is influencing other risk management disciplines. For the moment, it should be
953   noted that both positive and negative risks follow the same processes, from identification to
954   analysis to inclusion in the ERP.

955   Whatever means are used to determine potential threats, it is important to consider them in terms
956   of both the threat actors (i.e., the sources of risks with the capability to result in harmful impact)
957   and the threat events caused by their actions.

958   Combinations of multiple risks should also be considered. For example, if one risk in the register
959   refers to a website outage and another risk refers to an outage of the customer help desk, there
960   may need to be a third risk in the register that considers the likelihood and impact of an outage
961   affecting both services at once. It is also important to identify cascading risks where one primary
962   risk event may trigger a secondary and even a tertiary event. Analysis of the likelihood and
963   impact of these first-, second-, and third-order risks is described in Section 3.3.

964   During the threat modeling process, it is important for the practitioner to look out for and
965   mitigate instances of cognitive bias. Some common issues of bias include:
966      •   Overconfidence – The tendency for stakeholders to be overly optimistic about risk
967          scenarios (e.g., unreasonably low likelihood of a threat event, overstated benefits of an
968          opportunity, exaggerated estimation of the ability to handle a threat)
969      •   Group think – Rendering decisions as a group about potential threat sources and threat
970          events in a way that discourages creativity or individual responsibility
971      •   Following trends – Blindly following the latest hype or craze without a detailed analysis
972          of the specific threats facing the organization

 973       •   Availability bias – The tendency to focus on issues (such as threats) that come readily to
 974           mind because one has heard or read about them, perhaps in ways that are not
 975           representative of the actual likelihood of a threat event occurring and resulting in adverse
 976           impact

 977   3.2.3   Determination of Exploitable and Susceptible Conditions

978    The next key input to risk identification is understanding the potential conditions that enable a
979    threat event to occur. It is important to consider all types of vulnerabilities in all assets, including
980    people, facilities, and information. For the purposes of this document, vulnerability is simply a
981    condition that enables a threat event to occur. It could be an unpatched software flaw, a raw
982    material limitation, a process that leads to human error, or a physical environmental condition
983    (like a wooden structure being flammable). The presence of a vulnerability does not cause harm
984    in and of itself, as there needs to be a threat present to exploit it. Moreover, a threat that does not
985    have a corresponding vulnerability may not result in a negative risk. Identifying negative risks
986    includes understanding the potential threats and vulnerabilities to organizational assets, which
987    can then be used to develop scenarios that describe potential risks.

988    Some weaknesses, such as software flaws or misconfigurations, can be identified using
989    automated scanners. These automated techniques may help to quickly identify some common
990    vulnerabilities, but ICT weaknesses are not limited to enterprise hardware and software. For the
991    ICT risk disciplines of privacy, supply chain, and cybersecurity, reviewing the controls described
992    in NIST SP 800-53, Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations,
993    may help highlight many potential weaknesses. [SP80053]

 994   3.2.4   Evaluation of Potential Consequences

 995   The final component of risk identification is documenting the potential consequences of each
 996   risk listed in the register. Many organizations incorrectly express risks outside of their context.
 997   For example, a stakeholder might say, “I’m worried about floods,” or “I’m concerned about a
 998   denial-of-service attack.” These examples cannot be analyzed or considered without knowing the
 999   full picture. Considering the above factors, an effective example of an identified risk might be
1000   (as expressed in cause-and-effect terminology), “If a hurricane causes a storm surge, it could
1001   flood the data center and damage multiple critical file servers.”

1002   Notably, ICT risks that cause unexpected or unreliable behavior in a system do not always result
1003   in the complete failure of that system to fulfill its duty in support of business objectives. Many
1004   elements of a risk management plan are implemented to support redundancy and resilience so
1005   that a highly likely threat event might result in manageable consequences. Resilient enterprise
1006   systems may be able to continue operating in the face of adverse circumstances.

1007   3.2.5   Risk Register Use

1008   Risk registers are used within organizations to communicate and track ICT risks over time. By
1009   combining the results of Sections 3.2.1 through 3.2.4, the practitioner can create a set of risk
1010   scenarios in the Risk Description column of the risk register. Risk scenarios provide a means to
1011   present detailed risk information in context. A complete risk scenario describes the source of
1012   uncertainty, predisposing conditions, resources affected, and anticipated result. For ICT risks, a

       INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT                                                          AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK


1013   scenario might include a threat source, a threat event, a vulnerability that threat source might
1014   exploit, enterprise assets impacted by the threat, and the resulting harmful impact. For example,
1015   “Construction activity severs a critical fiber optic cable that was not protected in conduit,
1016   interrupting communications to the data center and resulting in the loss of availability of
1017   enterprise financial systems.” Scenarios may also help to describe positive risk (i.e.,
1018   opportunity). An example of this might be, “Construction of a new alternate data center improves
1019   the resilience of financial infrastructure and reduces the likelihood of an interruption.”

1020   Figure 5 shows a notional risk register template. The notional template includes many of the
1021   elements suggested by OMB Circular A-11. It illustrates only the current risk assessment (i.e.,
1022   likelihood, impact, and resulting exposure value). Organizations will need to determine which
1023   assessments should be reflected in the risk register. Because this document describes the risk
1024   register as an input into ERM processes, only the current risk assessment results are depicted.
1025   Some organizations may wish to include both the current risk assessment (before risk response is
1026   applied) and the anticipated changes to risk that are expected to result based on the risk response.

1029   Table 4 describes each of the elements in the notional risk register template. The actual
1030   composition of the register will vary among enterprises and may contain more or fewer data
1031   points than those described in Table 4. For example:
1032       •       If the register is to be updated after the risk response, the results of a post-response
1033               assessment could be reflected in the register as the residual risk.
1034       •       Organizations might document a desired risk state based on risk appetite/tolerance, the
1035               target residual risk.

          Register Element                                              Description
        Risk Category          An organizing construct that enables multiple risk register entries to be consolidated.
                               Consistent risk categorization is helpful for comparing risk registers during the risk
                               aggregation step of ERM.
        Current Assessment –   An estimation of the probability that this scenario will occur before any risk response. On
        Likelihood             the first iteration of the risk cycle, this may also be considered the initial assessment.
        Current Assessment –   Analysis of the potential benefits or consequences that might result from this scenario if
        Impact                 no additional response is provided. On the first iteration of the risk cycle, this may also
                               be considered the initial assessment.
        Current Assessment –   A calculation of the probability of risk exposure based on the likelihood estimate and the
        Exposure Rating        determined benefits or consequences of the risk. Throughout this report, the
                               combination of impact and likelihood is referred to as exposure. Other common
                               frameworks use different terms for this combination, such as level of risk (e.g., ISO
                               31000). On the first iteration of the risk cycle, this may also be considered the initial
                               assessment.
        Risk Response Type     The risk response (sometimes referred to as the risk treatment) for handling the
                               identified risk. Values for risk response types are listed in Table 5 of this document.
        Risk Response Cost     The estimated cost of applying the risk response.
        Risk Response          A brief description of the risk response. For example, “Implement software management
        Description            application XYZ to ensure that software platforms and applications are inventoried,” or
                               “Develop and implement a process to ensure the timely receipt of threat intelligence from
                               [name of specific information sharing forums and sources].”
        Risk Owner             The designated party responsible and accountable for ensuring that the risk is
                               maintained in accordance with enterprise requirements. The risk owner may work with a
                               designated risk manager who is responsible for managing and monitoring the selected
                               risk response.
        Status                 A field for tracking the current condition of the risk and any next activities.


1037   Regardless of which model is selected for use as a risk register, it is important for the enterprise
1038   to ensure that the model is used in a consistent and iterative way. As the risk professional
1039   progresses through the steps in Section 3, the risk register will be populated with relevant
1040   information. Once decisions have been made as part of a subsequent review of the risks, the
1041   agreed-upon risk response becomes the current state after mitigations are put in place, and the
1042   cycle begins anew.

1043   Using risk registers for ICT uncertainty provides consistency in capturing, organizing, and
1044   communicating risk-related information throughout the ICTRM and ERM processes. The risk
1045   registers used at each level convey information about risk assessments, evaluation decisions,
1046   responses, and monitoring activities. The remainder of this section provides guidance and useful
1047   information for completing and using registers and integrating them with ERM.

1048   While the risk register itself can be used to document and communicate information about
1049   current risks and responses, it may be necessary to supplement the register with a risk detail
1050   record (RDR). A notional example of an RDR is provided in Appendix B. The use of RDRs
1051   enables the documentation of details regarding the considerations, assumptions, and results of
1052   risk management activity. It also enables the enterprise to record personnel involved in those
1053   considerations, any actions to be taken, and schedules. Contents of an RDR may include:
1054      ● Information regarding the risk itself, such as a detailed risk scenario description and
1055        underlying threats, vulnerabilities, assets threatened, risk category, and risk assessment
1056        results

                                                               21

       INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT                                             AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK


1057         ● Roles involved in risk decisions and management (e.g., risk owner, risk manager, action
1058           owner for specific activities, stakeholders involved in risk response decisions, contractual
1059           agreements for supply chain/external partners)
1060         ● Schedule considerations, such as the date the risk was first documented, the date of the
1061           last risk assessment, completion dates for mitigations, and the date of the next expected
1062           assessment
1063         ● Risk response decisions and follow-up, including detailed plans, status, and risk
1064           indicators

1065   An RDR may be stored and maintained in a written record, as part of an organizational
1066   knowledge management system, or as a database entry in risk-specific software, such as a
1067   Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) application.

1068   3.3       Analyze (Quantify) the Risks

1069   In Step 3 of the risk management life cycle, each ICT risk is analyzed to estimate the likelihood
1070   that the risk event will occur, and the potential impact of the consequences is described.

1071   3.3.1      Risk Analysis Types

1072   Relying solely on an informal risk analysis may impair effective ICTRM decision support. A
1073   broad array of risk analysis methodologies is available to aid in making a more accurate
1074   estimation, such as International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 31010:2019 [IEC31010]
1075   and the Open Group’s Open Factor Analysis of Information Risk (FAIR) standards
1076   [OPENFAIR]. Risk analysis methods include:
1077         •    Qualitative analysis, based on the assignment of a descriptor, such as low, medium, or
1078              high. The scale can be formed or adjusted to suit the circumstances, and different
1079              descriptions may be used for different risks. Qualitative analysis is helpful as an initial
1080              assessment or when intangible aspects of risk are to be considered. To improve the
1081              accuracy of qualitative analysis, values and data can be leveraged from external sources,
1082              such as industry benchmarks or standards, metrics from similar previous risk scenarios,
1083              or findings from inspections and assessments.
1084         •    Quantitative analysis involves numerical values, which are assigned to both impact and
1085              likelihood. These values are based on statistical probabilities and a monetized valuation
1086              of loss or gain. The quality of the analysis depends on the accuracy of the assigned values
1087              and the validity of the statistical models used. Consequences may be expressed in terms
1088              of financial, technical, or human impacts.

1089   Some practitioners apply a semi-quantitative assessment that uses a numerical scale that
1090   represents some range of values or meanings in the enterprise context. The application of this
1091   model helps translate risk analysis into qualitative terms that support risk communications for
1092   decision makers while also supporting relative comparisons (such as within a particular scale or
1093   range).

1094   Each of these analysis types has advantages and disadvantages, so the type performed should be
1095   consistent with the context associated with the risk. The methods to be selected and under what

                                                           22
       NIST SP 800-221 ipd                                                ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION
       INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT                                           AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK


1096   circumstances depend on many organizational factors and might be included in the risk
1097   management discussions described in Section 3.1. While qualitative methods are commonplace,
1098   the practitioner may benefit from considering a quantitative methodology with a more scientific
1099   approach to estimating the likelihood and the impact of consequences where the data is available
1100   for this type of analysis. This may help to better prioritize risks or prepare more accurate risk
1101   exposure forecasts. The benefits of such an approach may be offset by the fact that changing the
1102   risk assessment methodology may require time and resources for development and training.

1103   Common ERM practices include both qualitative and quantitative types of risk analysis. When
1104   selecting the most appropriate type of risk analysis at the system or organization level,
1105   practitioners should consider both consistency with ERM at the enterprise level and the accuracy
1106   of measuring ICT risks.

1107   3.3.2   Techniques for Estimating Likelihood and Impact

1108   Since one of the primary goals of ICTRM is to identify potential risks that are most likely to
1109   have a significant impact, an accurate reflection of risk details is critical. Fortunately, risk
1110   management has been practiced for many years, and there are many effective techniques for
1111   analyzing risk in comparison with enterprise risk appetite and system or organizational risk
1112   tolerance. IEC 31010 [IEC31010] is an international standard that describes and provides
1113   guidance on 17 risk assessment techniques that can be used for analyzing controls, dependencies,
1114   and interactions; understanding consequence and likelihood; and measuring overall risk. In
1115   addition to analysis techniques like those described below, understanding the likelihood of threat
1116   events and their potential impacts will also draw on experimentation, investigations into previous
1117   risk events, and research into the risk experiences of similar organizations.

1118   The likelihood and impact elements of a risk can be broken into sub-factors. For example,
1119   consider a risk scenario in which a critical business server becomes unavailable to an
1120   organization’s financial department. The age of the server, the network on which it resides, and
1121   the reliability of its software all influence the likelihood of a failure. The impact of this scenario
1122   can also be considered through various factors. If another server is highly available through a
1123   fault-tolerant connection, the loss of the initial server may have little consequence. Other factors
1124   also impact risk analysis, such as timing. If the financial server supports an important payroll
1125   function, the impact of a loss occurring shortly before payday may be significantly higher than if
1126   it were to occur after paychecks are distributed. The impact may vary greatly depending on
1127   whether the server is used for archiving legacy records or performing urgent stock trades. There
1128   are many considerations that go into estimating exposures and the events that can trigger them.
1129   Whichever sub-factors an organization chooses to consider, they should be clearly delineated and
1130   defined to ensure consistency in their use for likelihood and frequency estimation as well as
1131   overall risk register assessment and aggregation.

1132   The calculation of multiple or cascading impacts is an important consideration, and each
1133   permutation should be individually included in the risk register. Secondary loss events should be
1134   captured with primary loss events to represent the total impact and cost of a risk scenario. The
1135   omission of secondary losses in the assessment of a risk scenario would underestimate the total
1136   impact, thereby misinforming risk response selection and prioritization. For example, while the
1137   organization might consider a risk that a telecommunications outage would result in the loss of

                                                        23
       NIST SP 800-221 ipd                                                ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION
       INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT                                           AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK


1138   availability of a critical web server, there may also be secondary loss events, including the loss of
1139   customers from frustration with unavailable services or penalties resulting from the failure to
1140   meet contractual service levels. An analysis of cascading risks should include the consideration
1141   of factors that would lead to a secondary risk, such as the outage described above.

1142   Examples of techniques for estimating the probability that a risk event will occur include:
1143      •   Bayesian analysis – A model that helps inform a statistical understanding of probability
1144          as more evidence or information becomes available
1145      •   Monte-Carlo – A simulation model that draws upon random sample values from a given
1146          set of inputs, performs calculations to determine results, and iteratively repeats the
1147          process to build up a distribution of the results
1148      •   Event tree analysis – A modeling technique that represents a set of potential events that
1149          could arise following an initiating event from which quantifiable probabilities could be
1150          considered graphically

1151   Both tangible (e.g., direct financial losses) and less tangible impacts (e.g., reputational damage
1152   and impairment of mission) should be considered when evaluating the potential consequences of
1153   risk events. These are connected since direct losses will affect reputation, and reputational risk
1154   events will nearly always result in risk response expenses. OMB Circular A-123 states that
1155   “reputational risk damages the reputation of an agency or component of an agency to the point of
1156   having a detrimental effect capable of affecting the agency’s ability to carry out mission
1157   objectives.” There is a broad range of stakeholders to be considered when estimating reputational
1158   risk, including the workforce, partners, suppliers, regulators, legislators, public constituents, and
1159   clients/customers.

1160   Practitioners document and track the potential consequences of each ICT risk that would
1161   significantly impact enterprise objectives, such as causing material reputation damage or
1162   significant financial losses to the enterprise. Documenting and tracking these consequences at the
1163   organization or system level streamlines the step of providing ICT risk inputs to the ERM
1164   program.

1165   The estimation of the likelihood and impact of a risk event should account for existing and
1166   planned controls. The ERM Playbook provides the following guidance:

1167          Identifying existing controls is an important step in the risk analysis process. Internal
1168          controls (such as separation of duties or conducting robust testing before introducing new
1169          software) can reduce the likelihood of a risk materializing and the impact. […] One way
1170          to estimate the effect of a control is to consider how it reduces the threat likelihood and
1171          how effective it is against exploiting vulnerabilities and the impact of threats. Execution
1172          is key – the presence of internal controls does not mean they are necessarily effective.
1173          [ERMPLAYBOOK]

1174   The estimated likelihood and impact of each risk are recorded in the appropriate columns within
1175   the risk register. After risk responses are determined, the analysis should be revised to reflect the
1176   mitigation (of likelihood and impact) from each risk response. The residual risk (i.e., the
1177   remaining risk after applying risk responses) should then be recorded in the risk register’s

1178   Residual Risk column. To simplify the process of normalizing risk registers when developing an
1179   ERR, a consistent time frame should be used for estimating the likelihood of each risk. Likewise,
1180   the level of impact helps to normalize the risk during the aggregation and prioritization process.

1181   3.4       Prioritize Risks

1182   After identifying and analyzing applicable risks and recording them in risk registers, the
1183   priorities of those risks should be determined and indicated. This is accomplished by determining
1184   the exposure presented by each risk (i.e., based on the likelihood that a threat event will occur
1185   and result in an adverse impact).
1186   An ICT risk can have adverse effects on achieving organizational objectives. Based on the
1187   analysis conducted using the processes described in Section 3.3, such effects could range from
1188   negligible to severe, so exposure determination is important. Additionally, since organizations
1189   have limited resources, it is helpful to sort the risks within the register in order of importance to
1190   prioritize risk response. As shown in the template in Figure 5, this result helps complete the
1191   Priority column. 14
1192   When completing the Priority column of the risk register, consider the following:
1193         •    How to combine the calculations of likelihood and impact to determine exposure 15
1194         •    How to determine and measure the potential benefits of pursuing a particular risk
1195              response
1196         •    When to seek additional guidance on how to evaluate risk exposure levels, such as while
1197              evaluating exposures germane to risk tolerance statements

1198   Practitioners use both qualitative and quantitative models for calculating and communicating
1199   about exposure. Figure 6 demonstrates the use of qualitative descriptors for likelihood and
1200   impact as well as how these might be used to determine an overall exposure value. 16 Each risk is
1201   evaluated in light of the risk’s likelihood and impact as determined during risk analysis. The
1202   thresholds for ranges of exposure can be established and published as part of the enterprise
1203   governance model and used by stakeholders to prioritize each risk in the register.




       14    While risks in the register are assigned a priority to help rank their relative importance, this prioritization is distinct from
             (but may help inform) the enterprise-level prioritization performed by senior leaders to create the enterprise risk profile.
       15    The formula for calculating risk exposure is the total loss if the risk occurs multiplied by the probability that the risk will
             happen. Loss is calculated through a traditional BIA used in conjunction with the risk register model to inform the senior-
             level decision-making process.
       16    Individual risk programs may have varying views on how to calculate and record likelihood in program risk registers. Most
             risk programs view likelihood as a factor of threat and vulnerability. Risk programs are encouraged to use the risk
             adjudication and communication process as an opportunity to discuss and standardize any program-specific likelihood
             calculation.

                                                                         25

1206   Figure 7 depicts a quantitative example. In this illustration, the enterprise has provided guidance
1207   that any risk above 0.20 (based on likelihood times impact) represents a high risk, and risks rated
1208   between 0.06 and 0.20 are designated as moderate.

1211   While prioritization will be strongly influenced by the risk exposure determination, other factors
1212   such as enterprise context or stakeholder priorities may also influence those decisions.
1213   Stakeholders might also define a minimum level of exposure to include on the risk register
1214   through the risk management strategy or other directives. While ICT risks should not arbitrarily
1215   be omitted from the register, there are likely to be many that represent such a low exposure that
1216   they need not be included. Guidance for this threshold should be applied consistently throughout
1217   the enterprise.

1218   For those ICT risks that are included and prioritized in the risk register, an evaluation should be
1219   performed to identify an appropriate risk response, as described in the next topic.

1220   3.5   Plan and Execute Risk Response Strategies

1221   The fifth step of the risk management life cycle is to determine the appropriate response to each
1222   risk. The goal of effective risk management, including ICT risks, is to identify ways to keep risk
1223   aligned with the risk appetite or tolerance in as cost-effective a way as possible. In this stage, the
1224   practitioner will determine whether the exposure associated with each risk in the register is



                                                          26

       INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT                                                       AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK


1225   within acceptable levels based on the potential consequences. If not, that practitioner can identify
1226   and select cost-effective risk response options to achieve ICT objectives.

1227   Planning and executing risk responses is an iterative activity and should be based on the risk
1228   strategy guidance described in Section 3.1.3. As the risk oversight authorities monitor the
1229   success of those responses, they will provide operational leaders with financial and mission
1230   guidance to inform future risk management activities. In some cases, risk evaluation may lead to
1231   a decision to undertake further analysis to confirm estimates or more closely monitor results (as
1232   described in Section 4.2). Note that risk responses themselves may introduce new risks. For
1233   example, adding multi-factor authentication to a business system to reduce an access control risk
1234   may introduce a new risk of decreased productivity when users have difficulty authenticating.

1235   While there is some variance among the terms used by risk management frameworks, there are
1236   four types of actions available (as described in Table 5) for responding to negative ICT risks:
1237   accept, transfer, mitigate, and avoid.
1238                                    Table 5: Response Types for Negative ICT Risks

         Type                                                      Description
        Accept      Accept ICT risk within risk tolerance levels. No additional risk response action is needed except for
                    monitoring.
        Transfer    For ICT risks that fall outside of tolerance levels, reduce them to an acceptable level by sharing a
                    portion of the consequences with another party (e.g., ICT insurance). While some of the financial
                    consequences may be transferable, there are often consequences that cannot be transferred, like a
                    loss of customer trust.
        Mitigate    Apply actions (e.g., risk management controls) that reduce a given risk to an acceptable level.
                    Responses could include those that help prevent a loss (i.e., reducing the probability of occurrence or
                    the likelihood that a threat event materializes or succeeds) or that help limit such a loss by decreasing
                    the amount of damage and liability.
        Avoid       Apply responses to ensure that the risk (specifically the threat) does not occur. Avoiding a risk may be
                    the best option if there is not a cost-effective method for reducing the ICT risk to an acceptable level.
                    The cost of the lost opportunity associated with such a decision should be considered as well.

1239   In many cases, mitigation to bring exposure to negative ICT risks within risk tolerance levels is
1240   accomplished using risk management controls. For example, if the risk executive function
1241   declares that the organization must avoid risks with likelihood and impact values of high/high for
1242   all costs over $500,000, the Risk Response Type column of the risk register (see Figure 5) can be
1243   updated with a response type from Table 5. While including a particular informative reference
1244   (e.g., security controls or Cybersecurity Framework and/or Privacy Framework categories and
1245   subcategories) may be helpful in guiding and describing risk response, additional information is
1246   likely to be required.

1247   In general, people, processes, and technology combine to provide risk management controls that
1248   can be applied to achieve an acceptable level of risk. Examples of controls include:
1249       •     Preventative: Reduce or eliminate specific instances of a weakness
1250       •     Deterrent: Reduce the likelihood of a threat event by dissuading a threat actor
1251       •     Detective: Provide warning of a successful or attempted threat event
1252       •     Corrective: Reduce exposure by offsetting the impact of consequences after a risk event

                                                                  27

       INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT                                            AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK


1253         •    Compensating: Apply one or more controls to adjust for a weakness in another control

1254   Consider an organization that identifies several high-exposure negative risks, including that poor
1255   authentication practices (e.g., weak or reused passwords) could enable the disclosure of sensitive
1256   customer financial information and that employees of the software provider might gain
1257   unauthorized access to and tamper with the financial data. The organization can apply several
1258   deterrent controls (documenting the applied control identifiers and any applicable notes in the
1259   Risk Register Comments column), including warning banners and the threat of prosecution for
1260   any threat actors that intentionally attempt to gain unauthorized access. Preventative controls
1261   include applying strong identity management policies and using multi-factor authentication
1262   tokens that help reduce authentication vulnerabilities. The software provider has installed
1263   detective controls that monitor access logs and alert the organization’s security operations center
1264   if internal staff connect to the customer database without a need for access. Furthermore, the
1265   financial database is encrypted so that it protects its data if the file system is exfiltrated.

1266   Risk response will often involve creating a risk reserve to avoid or mitigate an identified
1267   negative risk or to realize or enhance an identified positive risk. A risk reserve is similar to other
1268   types of management reserves in that funding or labor hours are set aside and employed if a risk
1269   is triggered to ensure that the opportunity is realized or the threat is avoided. For example, the
1270   technical skills needed to recover after an ICT attack may not be available with current staffing
1271   resources. A risk reserve can also be used with the accept response type to address this (e.g., by
1272   setting aside funds during project planning to employ a qualified third party to augment the
1273   internal incident response and recovery effort.)

1274   3.6       Monitor, Evaluate, and Adjust Risk Management

1275   Risk management should not be simply managing lists of risks. For the activities to be
1276   meaningful, risk managers throughout the enterprise must be informed about objectives, results,
1277   priorities, and opportunities. A key purpose of
1278   the various risk registers is to enable ongoing
1279   monitoring of enterprise risk activities. Based
1280   on those activities, senior leaders evaluate
1281   available options and adjust guidance and
1282   operations to help realize opportunities and
1283   minimize harmful impacts. This Monitor-
1284   Evaluate-Adjust (MEA) cycle is depicted in
1285   Figure 8. This iterative approach begins with
1286   an understanding of what risk limits are
1287   acceptable, given enterprise context and
1288   strategic objectives. The purpose of ICTRM
1289   integration is to enable senior leaders to remain
1290   aware of ongoing risk management activities
1291   and apply corrective measures in order to
1292   achieve strategic objectives.

1293   As risk response activities occur, they are recorded       Figure 8: Monitor-Evaluate-Adjust Cycle
1294   in ICT risk registers. The results are monitored,

1295   and performance measurements are collected through KPIs and KRIs and compared with risk
1296   strategy and risk direction (based on risk appetite and risk tolerance statements). Leaders provide
1297   direction regarding an overall appetite for risk, which is then interpreted at a more granular level
1298   as risk tolerance statements. Those risk directives are achieved through the application of various
1299   controls that modify the risk conditions. The metrics are reported to managers and leaders,
1300   enabling oversight and management of the achievement of the risk tolerance.

1301   Previous discussions highlighted risk direction based on risk appetite statements and their
1302   interpretation as risk tolerance statements. There is a third component of risk direction that must
1303   be observed – that of risk capacity, defined as the maximum amount of risk that an organization
1304   is able to endure. While the enterprise should always take steps not to exceed risk appetite, the
1305   consequences of doing so are rarely catastrophic. Exceeding risk capacity, on the other hand,
1306   could have dire consequences and may even jeopardize the continuance of the enterprise.
1307   Catastrophic results are not limited to the private sector. Many government entities have
1308   experienced severe consequences because their risk management processes permitted those
1309   enterprises to approach or exceed risk capacity. Such cases can end the career of senior leaders
1310   whose risk monitoring should have identified the risk conditions.

1311   It is noteworthy that, like risk appetite and tolerance, risk capacity can extend throughout the
1312   hierarchical enterprise layers. For example, if a business unit or government bureau exceeded its
1313   risk capacity, that portion of the enterprise could be severely impeded or closed. ISACA states
1314   that exceeding risk capacity could result in the enterprise’s continued existence being questioned
1315   [ISACA]. ISO 31010:2019 describes a similar example: “For a commercial firm, capacity might
1316   be specified in terms of maximum retention capacity covered by assets, or the largest financial
1317   loss the company could bear without having to declare bankruptcy.” [IEC31010] While
1318   exceeding risk capacity might not immediately result in enterprise extinction, it is clearly a
1319   criterion that must be monitored closely. Because capacity reflects the aggregate risk, it is an
1320   important consideration for those aggregating ICTRM and evaluating the overall risk posture.

1321   3.6.1   When a Risk Event Passes Without Triggering the Event

1322   Risk responses will often be adjusted as opportunities and threats evolve. The concept is similar
1323   to the topic sometimes called the “Cone of Uncertainty” within project management practices;
1324   over time, additional understanding about an identified risk will come to light. For changes in
1325   identified risk, one mitigation technique is the use of risk reserves, as introduced in Section 3.5.
1326   For this risk response, it is important that the risk owners collaborate with the acquisition or
1327   procurement teams and budget owners. With appropriate budget planning, risk reserves can be
1328   released for other predetermined funding requirements after the risk has been reduced to an
1329   acceptable level or the time has passed for the risk to occur.

1330   While many industry-based enterprises can return unused funds to shareholders or pay down
1331   corporate debt, unused reserves are more difficult for government agencies to use without pre-
1332   planning. Most government procurement cycles are rigidly based on the government fiscal year.
1333   Identified opportunities can be “planned for” in government procurement cycles as “optional”
1334   tasking or purchases. For example, unused funds could be used to expand a vendor assessment
1335   program to ensure that all supply chain providers (including both immediate service providers
1336   and their downstream providers) fulfill data processing and privacy risk management

                                                        29

1337   requirements. If the current fiscal year only allows for the purchase of half of the required
1338   materials, an option can be included at the time of the base contract award for the other half of
1339   the materials (but not funded at the time of the base contract award). When the practitioner
1340   liberates the risk reserve after the chance of the negative risk occurring has passed, the funding
1341   can be used to exercise the already awarded option that lacked the initial funding when the base
1342   contract was awarded. Exercising an option in government contracting is trivial (often 30 days or
1343   less) when compared to the long lead time for initial contract procurements.

1344   3.7   Considerations of Positive Risks as an Input to ERM

1345   Planning for success is equally as important as avoiding disasters. As mentioned in Section 3.2.2,
1346   OMB states in Circular A-123 that, regarding the inclusion of opportunities (positive risks) as a
1347   function of the ERM profile, “the profile must identify sources of uncertainty, both positive
1348   (opportunities) and negative (threats).” In ICT disciplines, a significant portion of risk
1349   information is collected and reported with regard to weaknesses and threats that could result in
1350   negative consequences. However, positive risks (opportunities) also inform decisions by senior
1351   leaders for setting the risk appetite and tolerance of the enterprise.

1352   From an opportunity standpoint, risk appetite statements can identify areas where the
1353   organization needs to stretch further to reach goals and are expressed as those targeted areas
1354   where some loss is acceptable without crossing important lines of demarcation (e.g., innovative
1355   solutions should be pursued but not at the cost of life, safety, compliance with laws/regulations,
1356   or reputation). Understanding that private-sector organizations pursue risk as part of their growth
1357   strategies and competitive advantage, this aspect should not be forgotten. Similarly, public-sector
1358   agencies typically have stretch goals to keep up with industry needs, customer expectations,
1359   market demands, or other influences.

1360   An example of identifying positive risks is conducting a SWOT analysis that considers strengths
1361   and weaknesses as well as threats and opportunities. Consider, for example, an organization that
1362   is evaluating moving a major financial system from an in-house data center to a commercial
1363   hosting provider. If the organization maintains vast amounts of land and warehouses, the move
1364   could be considered a strength of the organization, and they might increase revenue by offering
1365   space to a commercial vendor to host both their own and other organizations’ data centers. The
1366   Federal Government has realized many opportunities of this nature, including consolidating
1367   payroll functions under the National Finance Center (NFC) and consolidating reporting
1368   requirements in the Department of Justice Cyber Security Assessment and Management (CSAM)
1369   application.

1370   Section 3.2.2 describes the need to treat threat actors and threat sources as inputs into an
1371   estimation of risk. If the enterprise chooses to include positive risk scenarios in the register, then
1372   the process should similarly consider sources of opportunity that might provide benefits. A
1373   consideration of both threats and opportunities may enable discussions regarding the benefits and
1374   risks of a particular endeavor. Alternatively, the organization could manage an opportunity risk
1375   register separately from the traditional threat-based risk register since positive risks (i.e.,
1376   opportunities) often have to be assessed on a slightly different scale.

1377   In addition to the threat modeling examples above, methods for identifying ICT-related
1378   opportunities are also available and could be as simple as an employee suggestion box. Industry
1379   publications, such as those from commercial industry associations and agencies like NIST,
1380   regularly provide information and ideas regarding potential innovations or advances for areas
1381   such as supply chain, privacy, and cybersecurity improvements.

1382   Numerous formal methods are available for identifying opportunities, including:
1383   ● Brainstorming – A group innovation technique, often led by a facilitator, that elicits views
1384     from participants to identify and describe opportunities
1385   ● Delphi – A procedure to gain consensus from a group of subject matter experts using one or
1386     more individual questionnaires that are collected and collated to identify opportunities to
1387     pursue
1388   ● Ideation – A consistent process of observing an environment, discerning opportunities for
1389     improvement, experimenting with possible resolutions, and developing innovative solutions
1390   The same formal methods can be used for determining other inputs, such as those described in
1391   Sections 3.2.3 and 3.2.4.

1392   With regard to positive risk response, consider the previous example of an organization that has
1393   identified the positive risk of increasing revenue by providing physical space for a commercial
1394   vendor to offer an outsourcing service. Analysis of the risk has determined that the opportunity
1395   would be highly beneficial to the enterprise. The colocation also provides a moderate opportunity
1396   to improve availability as an element of supply chain risk management. The Risk Response Type
1397   column of the risk register should also be updated using a response type from Table 5, the
1398   comment field updated to contain information pertinent to the opportunity, and the residual risk
1399   uncertainty of not realizing the opportunity calculated.

1400   With these controls and methods in place and assessed as effective, the remaining risks can be
1401   analyzed to determine the residual impact, likelihood, and exposure, as described in Section 3.3.
1402   If the residual exposure falls within risk tolerance levels, then stakeholders can proceed in
1403   gaining the benefits of the opportunity. Each of these values is added to the risk register for
1404   enterprise reporting and monitoring.

1405   Where positive risks are to be considered and included in risk registers, there are four generally
1406   used response types, as described in Table 6.

1408   As with negative risks, positive entries in the ICT risk registers should be normalized and
1409   aggregated into the enterprise-level risk register.

1410   As shown in Figure 9, this publication focuses on the integration of ICT risk from various
1411   disciplines in support of an ERM integration cycle. The document acknowledges the need for
1412   ongoing bidirectional communication between ERM and risk programs, recognizing that the risk
1413   disciplines both inform and receive direction from ERM. It shows that the communication of risk
1414   appetite statements from the ERM portfolio is a way for risk programs to better identify and
1415   monitor risks using a variety of related methods such as risk tolerance statements, key
1416   performance indicators, key risk indicators, and controls. Similarly, this publication formalizes
1417   the use of risk registers to communicate risks and risk responses among program and portfolio
1418   levels. It highlights industry practices for coordination through elevation of risks for oversight
1419   and escalating risks for higher-level ownership.

1420    4 Building ERRs and ERPs from ICTRM-Specific Risk Registers

1421   The achievement of defined expectations is
1422   conveyed through risk registers that
1423   document and communicate risk decisions.
1424   Risk assessment results and risk response
1425   actions at the system level are reflected in
1426   the ICT risk registers. The registers from
1427   multiple systems are collated, aggregated,
1428   and normalized, then provided to business
1429   managers at the organization level to
1430   provide a composite risk understanding.
1431   Those managers can evaluate results and
1432   refine risk tolerance criteria to optimize
1433   value delivery, resource utilization, and risk.
1434   The enterprise-level aggregation of all the
1435   various risk registers into an enterprise risk
1436   register (ERR), then a prioritized enterprise
1437   risk profile (ERP), enables senior leaders to
1438   monitor risk responses while considering the
1439   expectations set.

1440   This section takes a closer look at how ICT
1441   risk registers are used as the inputs for
1442   building an ERR and ultimately an ERP, as
1443   depicted in Figure 9.

1444   4.1     Creating and Maintaining
1445           Enterprise-Level ICT Risk Registers

1446   A key outcome of the risk identification and
1447   communications elements is the ability to
1448   create enterprise-level ICT risk registers as
1449   input to the broader ERR (Section 4.2). As                  Figure 9: ICTRM Integration Cycle
1450   described throughout Section 3, the
1451   application of a consistent risk register with agreed-upon criteria and categories enables various
1452   data points to be normalized, aggregated, and sorted into an enterprise view.

1453   Risk registers are composed and maintained at all levels: enterprise (including higher-level and
1454   lower-level enterprises), organization (including suborganizations and business units), and
1455   system. 17 The vertical columns in Figure 4 should not be interpreted as guidance to address such
1456   risks as isolated silos, but rather that information for various types of ICT risks should be shared
1457   with those in higher organizational levels for the benefit of the whole enterprise. Similarly,
1458   ICTRM should not be isolated at only one organizational level nor within a single ICT risk


       17    OMB Circular A-130 defines an information system as “a discrete set of information resources organized for the collection,
             processing, maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of information.” [OMB-A123]

                                                                      33
       NIST SP 800-221 ipd                                                ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION

1459   discipline. Instead, those in an organizational level should collaborate and communicate about
1460   issues, problems, and opportunities identified. As lessons learned about successes and challenges
1461   are shared among peers, that information can be conveyed to other organizations and to
1462   enterprise management, including by using risk registers and RDRs.

1463   For each risk discipline, as the risk registers from each system and organization are completed,
1464   they are provided to the designated risk officers at the relevant level (i.e., system or organization)
1465   and shared with senior management to conduct the following actions: 1) normalize (e.g., ensure
1466   definitions and values as recorded by various enterprise entities are consistent and remove
1467   duplicate risk reporting) and 2) aggregate risks in similar categories into a concise view.

1468   To support the subsequent aggregation of various risk registers, enterprise risk guidance should
1469   identify the enterprise objectives to which various types of ICT risk should be aligned. The ERP
1470   reflects risks that may have impact in each of four discrete enterprise objectives: strategic,
1471   operations, reporting, and compliance. These same four objectives were key factors in the
1472   original COSO ERM framework and are often used as guideposts for enterprise risk reporting.
1473   Clear direction from senior leaders about how to align various types of ICT risk with enterprise
1474   objectives will help enable subsequent aggregation, normalization, and prioritization. Objective
1475   alignments include:
1476         ● Strategic risks related to the implementation of a new service offering; opportunities for
1477           innovation within an ICT area; change management improvements and challenges.
1478         ● Operations issues regarding product or service quality and resilience (e.g., supply chain
1479           interruption that disables a manufacturing process); processes and procedures for privacy
1480           risk posture; operational technology considerations; business continuity/disaster recovery
1481           issues.
1482         ● Reporting regarding ICT risk issues, including insurance considerations and material
1483           risk factors that affect disclosures or statutory reporting.
1484         ● Compliance risks where a negative event might result in a failure to meet a contractual
1485           service agreement or in a regulatory penalty or fine.

1486   Direction may be needed regarding how to account for those risks that cross multiple boundaries
1487   and how each organizational level should perform an aggregation of subordinate risk registers.

1488   4.2     Creating the Enterprise Risk Register (ERR)

1489   Enterprise risk officers collect all risk inputs, including the ICT risk registers, and analyze
1490   potential risk events, consequences, and impacts at the enterprise level to create the ERR. The
1491   ERR is subsequently prioritized to create the enterprise risk profile (ERP) discussed in Section
1492   4.3, which enables key executive stakeholders to stay aware of critical risks, including those that
1493   are ICT-related.

1494   As part of their risk guidance, enterprise leaders designate ERM process participants and the
1495   responsibilities of each role. That guidance should declare which role is responsible for creating
1496   and maintaining the ERR, how frequently it will be updated, and how the risks within it will be
1497   communicated to various stakeholders. This document will assume that role to be assigned to the

1498   enterprise risk officer, although the responsibility could fall upon any designated party, including
1499   other roles as described in Section 3.1.1.

1500   The creation and maintenance of the ERR also supports a periodic review of enterprise risk
1501   guidance, including risk definitions, context, and risk appetite criteria. It provides an opportunity
1502   to review and validate enterprise definitions for risks, risk categories, and risk assessment scales.
1503   If any changes or updates to the risk context or guidance need to occur, the enterprise risk officer
1504   (or equivalent) is likely to have sufficient seniority to ensure appropriate updates to those
1505   enterprise processes. Practitioners should consider any positive risks present in the rolled-up
1506   report and add other opportunities as inputs to the ERR.

1507   Figure 10 provides a notional ERR that combines both federal agency and critical infrastructure
1508   risks, illustrating the integration of various ICT risks alongside other key enterprise risks.

1511   This example illustrates the inclusion of a positive risk (item 2) beside negative risks. Of course,
1512   an actual ERR would include many more entries, both positive and negative. Most of the
1513   columns in the example are the same as their lower-level risk register counterparts. The notable
1514   exception is that the example ERR splits the Current Assessment—Impact into three columns,
1515   which are described in Table 7.

        Financial Impact    (e.g., high, moderate, low) at the enterprise level. Financial considerations may be expressed
                            as 1) capital expenditures that represent a longer-term business expense, such as property,
                            facilities, or equipment, and 2) operating expenses that support day-to-day operations.

1518   As was described for lower-level risk registers, there is value in both a single point of reference
1519   (the ERR) and detailed risk information (the RDR). The ERR provides an easily consumed
1520   summary for understanding the risk landscape, while the RDR provides additional information.
1521   The RDR also enables the documentation of additional information, such as historical
1522   information, detailed risk analysis data, and information about individual and organizational
1523   accountability. Additional information for inclusion in an enterprise RDR might include:
1524       ● Detailed risk information (e.g., full risk statement, detailed scenario description, key risk
1525         indicators, enterprise status for this particular risk)
1526       ● Information regarding various risk roles (e.g., risk owner, risk manager, risk approver)
1527         and affected stakeholders
1528       ● Historical timeline information (e.g., last update date, next expected review)
1529       ● Risk analysis information, including the aggregate understanding of threats,
1530         weaknesses/pre-existing conditions, resources affected, and impact
1531       ● Detailed risk response information (e.g., responses implemented, status and results of
1532         previous responses, additional responses planned)

1533   The ERR provides input for those performing enterprise risk oversight, such as an executive risk
1534   committee. By tracking the status of each risk, including the exposure value of each, enterprise
1535   stakeholders can identify the most relevant risks (e.g., a top ten list that may be used to further
1536   inform enterprise risk decisions). Summary reports about the highest-priority risks may be used
1537   to inform stakeholders (e.g., for federal departments and agencies, those in an oversight role such
1538   as Congress, OMB, or GAO) about existing risks, risk responses, and planned activities.

1539   Since it is difficult to compare dissimilar risk exposures, such as employee retention and disaster
1540   recovery, risks are often translated into financial impact and may be further broken down into the
1541   direct cost (i.e., the impact of a given risk on the capital budget and operating expenses), the

                                                               36

       INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT                                                           AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK


1542   financial cost of reputational damage, and direct financial implications of impact on the
1543   enterprise mission. The relative financial impact of each type of risk can provide further input
1544   into risk management prioritization and monitoring decisions for enterprise risk managers.
1545   Reputation exposure can be similarly determined in the ERR (e.g., by the chief risk officer) by
1546   combining high-impact attacks, enterprise sector, and consequences with a histogram (trend)
1547   analysis of stakeholder sentiment (for each stakeholder type). This last action of prioritization
1548   creates the ERP, as discussed in Section 4.3.

1549   For federal agencies, OMB Circular A-123 requires that the enterprise risk register consider both
1550   inherent and residual risk. 18 The COSO ERM Framework [COSOERM] further describes these
1551   terms and differentiates between actual residual risk and target (desired) risk:
1552         •    “Inherent risk is the risk to an entity in the absence of any direct or focused actions by
1553              management to alter its severity.”
1554         •    “Target residual risk is the amount of risk that an entity prefers to assume in the pursuit
1555              of its strategy and business objectives, knowing that management will implement or has
1556              implemented direct or focused actions to alter the severity of the risk.”
1557         •    “Actual residual risk is what remains after management has taken action to alter its
1558              severity. Actual residual risk should be equal to or less than the target residual risk.”

1559   OMB A-123 examples reference inherent risk that describes “conditions in the absence of risk
1560   management actions.” There are often likely to be at least some elements that help mitigate risks,
1561   so this publication typically refers to current risk rather than inherent risk when representing a
1562   baseline risk posture.

1563   4.3       Developing the Enterprise Risk Profile (ERP)

1564   As risk information is transmitted up from lower levels of the organization, each level’s risk
1565   register should contain the pertinent information for creating a prioritized risk profile for the
1566   level immediately above it. For example, a subject matter expert in a particular ICT risk
1567   discipline might provide their own prioritization of risks within their discipline, for consideration
1568   by the next level of risk experts.

1569   Subordinate organizations’ impacts may be different, similar, conflicting, overlapping, or
1570   unavailable and must be properly combined by financial and mission analysis at the level
1571   immediately above the reporting organization. While the impacts of ICT risk on various assets
1572   may be determined at lower levels, the overall cash flow and capital implications of all of the
1573   risks can only be normalized and aggregated (and recorded in the ERR) by enterprise fiduciaries
1574   (e.g., CFOs). Similarly, enterprise mission impacts must be aggregated and expressed by those
1575   senior executives most directly accountable to stakeholders.

1576   The ERR informs the ERP once the risks are prioritized at the highest level of the risk
1577   management function in the enterprise, as depicted in Figure 11. The ERP is a subset of carefully
1578   selected risks from the larger ERR.


       18    While both Circular A-123 and some COSO documents reference inherent risk, this publication focuses on current risk.

                                                                     37

1581   The ERP reflects assessments of mission, financial, and reputation exposures organized
1582   according to the four enterprise objectives. They may be full-value exposures or modified (and
1583   so noted) by the likelihood assessments of enterprise leaders. At the top enterprise level, ERM
1584   officials have the prerogative to add their own judgment of likelihood and impact as part of the
1585   normalization process, along with other members of the enterprise risk executive function. While
1586   the ERM process helps drive the discussion and calculation of likely risk scenarios, recent
1587   natural disasters have demonstrated that actual consequences can far exceed initial loss
1588   expectations. Enterprise executives should continually observe industry trends and actual
1589   occurrences to readjust likelihood and impact estimations and reserves based on a changing risk
1590   landscape. ERPs should also reflect comparable occurrence incidents and trends for the subject
1591   enterprise and peer organizations.

1592   The ERP supports the governance and management for measuring significant financial,
1593   reputational, and missional impact (consequences). Some enterprises may also use this taxonomy
1594   to support a broader risk breakdown structure (RBS), a topic that may be explored in a future
1595   NIST publication. As shown in Figure 12, considerations include:
1596         ● Financial impact – Various risk scenarios are converted into actual capital and
1597           operational expenses, enabling executive leaders to conduct a fiscally responsible
1598           cost/benefit analysis that considers the recommended strategies for risk response. (These
1599           presentations are equivalent to the financial disclosures in Form 10-Q and Form 10-K
1600           filings to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission [SEC] by commercial public
1601           companies each quarter and for Form 8-K filings as risk incidents occur.)
1602         ● Reputation impact – While subordinate risk registers describe risk scenarios, including
1603           those that may impact reputation, executive leaders record the evaluation of
1604           consequences on the enterprise’s reputation. This also supports consideration of other
1605           downstream impacts, such as financial losses or credit risk, that are likely to result from
1606           damage to reputation.
1607         ● Mission impact – Executive leaders record the evaluation of consequences on the overall
1608           ability for the enterprise to conduct its mission and achieve strategic objectives. (Mission
1609           impact in commercial public enterprises is often expressed in Share Value/Market Cap
1610           and Share Volatility tables, also disclosed in SEC filings and shareholder
1611           communications.)

1612   These three high-level impact considerations are then used in conjunction with other enterprise
1613   risk responses to determine tolerances, allocations, and disclosures commensurate with risk
1614   exposure.

1615   4.4      Translating the ERP to Inform Leadership Decisions

1616   For some organizations, the information from the ERP will need to be provided to senior
1617   managers that have a fiduciary duty to remain aware of and help manage risks. In this way,
1618   enterprise leaders will have the necessary information and opportunity to consider risk exposures
1619   as factors for budgets or corporate balance sheet reporting. Both private-sector and public-sector
1620   enterprises will benefit from the use of this risk register integration process; creation of an ERP
1621   is mandated by OMB Circular A-123 for federal agencies. 19 (Section B1 of OMB A-123 refers to
1622   the Agency Risk Profile.) The “primary purpose of a risk profile is to provide analysis of the

       19    Enterprise-level treatment, communication, and prioritization are discussed in Section 5 of this document.

                                                                       39

1623   risks an [enterprise] faces toward achieving its strategic objectives arising from its activities and
1624   operations, and to identify appropriate options for addressing significant risks. The risk profile
1625   assists in facilitating a determination around the aggregate level and types of risk that the agency
1626   and its management are willing to assume to achieve its strategic objectives.” This prioritization
1627   is supported by one of COSO’s key principles: “The organization prioritizes risks as a basis for
1628   selecting responses to risks.” [COSOERM] Prioritization helps managers to evaluate the costs
1629   and benefits of allocating resources to mitigate one risk compared to another.

1630   Senior leadership must have actionable information for their decision-making (e.g., during
1631   industry boardroom deliberations and their federal counterparts). Table 8 provides a notional
1632   Enterprise Risk Profile Supplement that reflects a portfolio evaluation of various organizational
1633   risk profiles. This information, having been populated and prioritized, directly informs executive
1634   decision-making.

1636   5 Enterprise Strategy for ICT Risk Coordination

1637   As part of their governance responsibilities, executive leaders should establish clear and
1638   actionable risk management guidance based on enterprise mission and business objectives.
1639   Expressing clear expectations regarding ICT risk enables participants at each level of the
1640   enterprise to manage uncertainty to an acceptable level. As the risk landscape evolves, such as
1641   due to technological and environmental changes, enterprise leaders should continually review
1642   and adjust the risk strategy. For example, an enterprise subject to outside regulation is likely to
1643   receive specific guidance regarding updated federal statutes and directives that must be
1644   considered in evaluating acceptable risk.

1645   5.1   Risk Integration and Coordination Activities

1646   Figure 13 provides a simplified illustration of risk integration and coordination activities. Each
1647   enterprise is unique, so enterprise leadership may wish to tailor the approach for their unique
1648   circumstances. For example, while risk appetite statements usually originate from the most
1649   senior leaders, those leaders may choose to delegate the creation of ICT risk appetite statements
1650   to a senior ICT risk official. Readers should note that the processes described are cyclical. Early
1651   iterations may include the definition of terms, strategies, and objectives. Subsequent iterations
1652   may focus on refining those objectives based on previous results, observations of the risk
1653   landscape, and changes within the enterprise.

1660   Figure 14 illustrates a more detailed information flow of inputs and outputs among ICTRM
1661   participants at the three levels. Senior leaders and business managers define risk tolerance
1662   direction that is applied at the system level. System-level practitioners interpret those risk
1663   tolerance statements and apply ICTRM activities to achieve risk management objectives.
1664   Through risk monitoring, results are then reviewed to confirm effectiveness, highlight
1665   opportunities for improvement, and identify important trends that might require organization- or
1666   enterprise-level action. The output of this activity helps improve communication about the
1667   performance, risk trends, and opportunities among all levels. The specific process activities will
1668   be based on the risk management methods applied but will generally include those below.

1671   The activities in Figure 14 are discussed below. Further details are provided later in this section.

1672   Risk Context and Strategy Activities
1673        •   Based on the enterprise mission, executives identify the systems and services that
1674            represent “mission/business-critical functions” that are essential to the successful
1675            operation of the enterprise. Based on that list, the executives and senior leaders identify
1676            the enterprise-level assets that enable those functions. Those assets inherit the
1677            criticality/priority of the functions they support. Enterprise assets supporting those
1678            objectives are identified (e.g., through a BIA). 21
1679        •   As described in the previous section, leaders at Level 1 (enterprise) and Level 2
1680            (organization) define specific and measurable risk appetite and risk tolerance statements
1681            that reinforce enterprise mission objectives and organization goals.
1682        •   At Level 3 (system), practitioners interpret criticality/priority direction from leaders,
1683            expressed through risk appetite and risk tolerance statements, to determine the ICT assets,
1684            processes, and activities that support mission-essential delivery operations. System-level
1685            assets are categorized based on the sensitivity and criticality to enterprise operations, in
1686            line with the enterprise-level BIA results. Those in various roles (e.g., system owners,
1687            security officers) work together to derive system-level requirements and record impact
1688            understanding in the system BIA register.
1689   Risk Identification Activities
1690        •   The value of each asset of a given system (e.g., information type, technical component,
1691            personnel, service provider) is appraised to determine how critical or sensitive it is to the
1692            operation of the system. Subsequent risk decisions depend on an accurate understanding
1693            of the importance of each resource to the system.
1694        •   For each of these components, the practitioner identifies threat sources that might have a
1695            harmful effect and the vulnerabilities or conditions that might enable such an effect. To
1696            complete development of the risk scenario, the practitioner determines the adverse effect
1697            of the threat source exploiting the vulnerable conditions. The scenario is recorded in the
1698            risk register’s Risk Description column. The category for the scenario is recorded in the
1699            Risk Category column based on enterprise criteria to support risk correlation,
1700            aggregation, and reporting.
1701   Risk Analysis Activities
1702        •   The practitioner performs risk analysis to determine the likelihood that the threat events
1703            and vulnerable conditions would result in harmful impacts to the system asset. Similarly,
1704            the practitioner analyzes the impact value and calculates the risk exposure using the
1705            methodology defined in the enterprise risk strategy (e.g., as the product of [risk
1706            likelihood] x [risk impact].) The results of these analyses are recorded in the risk
1707            register’s Current Assessment column as “Likelihood,” “Impact,” and “Exposure.”

1708   Risk Response Activities
1709      •    The determined exposure is compared with the risk tolerance.
1710              o If exposure is within risk tolerance limits, the risk may be accepted.
1711      •    If exposure exceeds tolerable levels of risk, practitioners can consider whether they can
1712           achieve risk tolerance through other forms of risk response.
1713              o In many cases, controls may be applied to mitigate risk by reducing its likelihood
1714                or impact to a tolerable level. Controls should be implemented with a
1715                corresponding performance scale (i.e., KPI), which is used as the basis for KRIs.
1716              o Risk response may also include risk transfer, also known as risk sharing. For
1717                example, an organization might hire an external organization to process sensitive
1718                transactions (e.g., payment card transactions), thus reducing the likelihood that
1719                such sensitive data would be processed by an in-house system. Another common
1720                risk transfer method involves the use of ICT insurance policies that can help
1721                reduce the economic impact if an adverse event occurs.
1722              o In some cases, it might be determined that the exposure exceeds risk tolerance and
1723                cannot be brought within limits through any combination of mitigation or risk
1724                transfer. In this case, practitioners (e.g., the system owner) may need to work with
1725                Level 2 leaders to revisit the risk tolerance itself. This negotiation presents an
1726                opportunity for the Level 2 and Level 3 managers to determine the best course of
1727                action to refine risk direction in light of mission objectives (e.g., through an
1728                exception process, an adjustment to the risk tolerance statement, or increased
1729                security requirements for the relevant system). In any case, stakeholders will have
1730                applied a proactive approach to balancing risk and value.
1731              o If an unacceptable ICT risk cannot be adequately treated in a cost-effective
1732                manner, that risk must be avoided. Such a condition may require a significant
1733                redesign of the system or service. These circumstances should be rare, and they
1734                highlight the value of risk coordination early in the system engineering process.
1735                Notably, risk avoidance is not the same as ignoring a risk.

1736   5.1.2   Risk Monitoring and Communication Activities

1737   As described in Section 3.6, risk managers throughout the enterprise must be informed about
1738   objectives, results, priorities, and opportunities that result from the risk responses above. A key
1739   purpose of the various risk registers is to enable ongoing monitoring of enterprise risk activities.
1740   Much of that monitoring occurs through observations of performance metrics, including those
1741   that indicate changes in risk (KRIs). KRIs inform organizations whether controls are adequately
1742   addressing risk and whether risks are changing over time. When KRIs fall outside of pre-
1743   established thresholds, this indicates that a risk response is beyond acceptable levels. In this case,
1744   organizations should evaluate risks and make any necessary adjustments to controls. Results of
1745   risk activities and decisions are recorded in the risk register.

1750   It is important for enterprise processes to ensure adequate communication of risk that has been
1751   accepted (and risk that is implicitly accepted, such as through an exception process). A key
1752   purpose of the various risk registers and reporting methods is to ensure that adequate governance
1753   information is available to monitor enterprise risk decisions.

1754   Risk activities may also be informed through the integration of relevant internal and external
1755   audit findings. Significant audit findings often have enterprise-level impacts. However, lower-
1756   severity findings may spread through multiple systems to create risk in aggregate if they are not
1757   addressed adequately. The coordination of audit findings may span multiple levels of the
1758   enterprise. For example, as operational teams address shortcomings or system deficiencies at the
1759   system level, key findings might be communicated and tracked by an audit committee
1760   (organization level). As responses to findings occur and are documented (such as through a
1761   corrective action plan), they assist in the planning of subsequent ERM.

1762   The process continues until all ICT assets and processes have been evaluated for risk from
1763   currently understood threats and vulnerabilities. For some enterprises, the composite set of
1764   system risks, responses applied, and other relevant artifacts will be reviewed by a senior official



                                                                 46

1765   to confirm that risk decisions and risk responses align with risk tolerance and risk appetite
1766   directives. 22

1767   Subsequently, risk registers for various risk management disciplines from throughout the
1768   organization level are normalized and aggregated to provide a composite view of the risk posture
1769   and decisions for that organization. As Level 2 managers consider feedback from system-level
1770   risk activities, they may decide to refine risk tolerance levels. It may be that the aggregate risk
1771   across multiple systems represents too great an exposure and needs to be reduced. In other cases,
1772   based on successful risk management results, stakeholders may be able to permit a little more
1773   risk in some areas if such a decision would support mission objectives and potentially save
1774   resources or allow them to be directed to areas that require additional resources to meet expected
1775   risk tolerances.

1776   Similar reviews and refinement occur at Level 1 to support enterprise governance and risk
1777   management decisions. Some types of enterprises may be required to formally disclose risk
1778   factors (e.g., through annual reports), and this aggregate understanding of ICT risks and risk
1779   decisions can support their fiduciary responsibilities. These activities may also help others, such
1780   as Federal Government agencies, to comply with mandatory requirements, such as those
1781   established by OMB.

1782   Interpreting risk tolerance at Level 3, practitioners develop requirements and apply controls to
1783   achieve an acceptable level of risk. This process helps to ensure that risk management occurs in a
1784   cost-effective way. As an example, consider a global retail firm where a system owner of a
1785   customer-facing website will select controls that will ensure adherence to availability service
1786   levels. In deciding which controls to apply, the system owner collaborates with a security team to
1787   consider methods to meet service level objectives. The team can contact the local power utility
1788   supplier to determine electrical availability history and gather other information regarding the
1789   likelihood of a loss of power to the important website. This additional information might help the
1790   system owner decide whether to invest in a backup generator to ensure sufficient power
1791   availability.

1792   Results from previous assessments can be useful for estimating the likelihood of achieving risk
1793   goals in the future. The team would then move to the next risk scenario (e.g., perhaps an internet
1794   service outage) and review the history and reliability of the organization’s telecommunications
1795   provider to ascertain the likelihood and impact of a loss of service. Iterating through each
1796   potential risk, as described in Figure 14, practitioners can develop a risk-based approach to
1797   fulfilling risk management objectives based on risk appetite and risk tolerance. This, in turn,
1798   helps risk practitioners demonstrate how their actions directly support mission objectives and
1799   enterprise success.




       22   For Federal Government agencies, much of their ICT is accounted for under what is considered a FISMA system (Federal
            Information Security Modernization Act) and thus subject to FISMA privacy and security requirements, so the system
            authorization process might represent an example of this cycle.

1800   5.2     Aggregation and Normalization of Risk Registers

1801   The value of using consistent risk registers for ICT uncertainty should now be clear. The precise
1802   contents and format will vary by enterprise but will generally follow the structure that has been
1803   illustrated throughout this publication.

1804   5.2.1    Aggregation of ICT Risk Information

1805   The activities described earlier provide guidance to help complete the risk register for a given
1806   system, using that form to record information about known risk scenarios, analysis of their
1807   impacts, and actual or planned activities to respond to those risks.

1808   Aggregation activities are performed among the hierarchical levels shown previously. System-
1809   level risk registers are combined with others from the same lower-level organization (e.g.,
1810   business department, branch office, division). In a similar way, the now-combined risk registers
1811   at the organization level (e.g., business unit, government bureau) and enterprise level are
1812   aggregated and normalized. The method for managing the risk ID is up to the practitioner, but a
1813   source identifier might be needed to provide traceability to the original register (e.g., “System A”
1814   risk register ID #1 might be tagged as aggregated risk ID A-1).

1815   5.2.2    Normalization of Risk Register Information

1816   While aggregation is occurring, the ICT risk manager will also be normalizing the information
1817   contained in the various risk registers. As data points are brought together, there will likely be
1818   some risks that occur so infrequently (or are of low enough consequence) that they do not merit
1819   inclusion in the next-level register. Decisions about what to integrate and how to do so depend
1820   on the use of a common risk rating scheme that enables risk assessments to be translated and
1821   integrated at higher enterprise levels. At a minimum, the normalization process at the higher
1822   level (for example, for the ERR) should use the same rating criteria to enable comparison and
1823   tracking. This typically includes definitions for how negative (and positive) consequences and
1824   likelihood are to be measured to allow comparability across assessment results. Risk criteria may
1825   also describe how time factors, such as risk velocity, should be considered in determining the
1826   risk severity. As noted in this publication, risk criteria may consider the organization’s objectives
1827   and internal/external context. Criteria for risk escalation or risk elevation may also be considered
1828   as part of the equation for whether specific ICT risks meet the minimum threshold for enterprise-
1829   level discussion. For example, the enterprise may note shared risks that represent a broad threat
1830   that would benefit from centralized risk mitigation or a reputational risk that demands immediate
1831   preventive action.

1832   During normalization, risk managers review the results from the various risk registers to support
1833   consistent risk treatment and communication. Some examples of ICT risk normalization are
1834   described in Table 11. A key element of normalization is the identification and resolution of
1835   cases where a similar risk scenario is treated differently by different enterprise participants.
1836   There may be no issue with such a difference since context and circumstances might be different,
1837   but the underlying cause should be understood, and the disparity should be recognized.

                                      response selected by system owners at lower levels. If two system owners had
                                      mitigated the above exfiltration risk and one had chosen to accept it, then the risk
                                      would appear in the combined risk register twice, with each row indicating the
                                      respective response.
                                    ● The combined ICT risk would be included once in the risk register, with both of the

        Adjudicate key risks        ● Those risks that warrant tracking and further communication in the ERR are
                                      highlighted and reviewed by enterprise-level risk managers.


1839   The categories of each ICT risk in each register are likely to be limited and consistent, so that
1840   column provides a practical key for the initial sorting exercise. After all of the risks at a given
1841   level are combined, aggregation is a straightforward activity but may require some manual
1842   adjustment. Various risk owners will likely use differing risk descriptions for the same scenario.
1843   The risk manager of that business unit would transliterate these ICT risks into a single
1844   representative risk on the business unit’s risk register, perhaps “External malicious party uses
1845   malicious code to exfiltrate sensitive business-related documents.” In this case, the risk must
1846   describe the type of information that is at risk of theft, since the loss of internal business
1847   documents, patient healthcare records, and employee financial information might each represent
1848   differing likelihoods and impacts. The criteria for delineating these factors will be determined by
1849   each enterprise. For example, if sufficiently detailed risk appetite and risk tolerance statements
1850   have been recorded, they might provide input into those risk criteria.

1851   The activities described in this document are solely intended to support public- and private-
1852   sector enterprise information gathering and reporting. Actions for an immediate response,
1853   escalation, or notification for any particular adverse event should be handled through the
1854   enterprise’s incident response processes. Similarly, raw risk information from each risk register
1855   should be fully available for any manager’s review. Aggregated summarization is a valuable
1856   reporting tool but should not impede the ability of managers to review specific risk decisions.

1857   Aggregating the risk analysis from multiple risk registers will vary by enterprise, but, for
1858   example, a three-point estimation could be used to complete the likelihood and impact columns
1859   on the combined register. The business unit risk manager could calculate these values using the
1860   lowest observed value as the best case, the highest value as the worst case, and the mean value of
1861   the others as the most likely. That manager could also apply their knowledge of the personnel
1862   and processes used to generate the risk registers, such that, if they know that a particularly

1864   the understanding of the most likely value.

1865   5.2.3   Integrating Risk Register Details

1866   For some enterprises, aggregation of these risk analysis and risk response values may be more art
1867   than science. Some organizations have skilled practitioners with actuarial experience who can
1868   statistically aggregate multiple data points and draw a scientific conclusion about the likelihood
1869   and impact (and therefore exposure rating) of various risks. Other organizations will simply work
1870   to normalize a list of highs and lows, with risk managers using their best judgment to estimate
1871   the combined exposure. Because the process of analyzing and responding to risk factors is highly
1872   iterative, an enterprise might need to begin with qualitative risk values and identify opportunities
1873   to increasingly apply quantitative approaches as more information and history become available.

1874   Information sharing and communications on risk response is vital as risk response could be
1875   ongoing, iterative, or span different reporting cycles. The information provides valuable data that
1876   will guide enterprise-level risk decisions, but the level of precision needed at higher hierarchical
1877   levels will likely be less than is needed at the system level.

1878   Completion of the remaining columns presents opportunities for enterprise determination as
1879   follows:
1880      •    For an aggregation of the risk response cost column, in some cases, an organization-level
1881           risk manager may wish to record a statistically weighted average of the risk response
1882           costs. In other cases, the manager may wish to provide a total cost allocated across all
1883           subsidiary systems and organizations.
1884      •    The column for risk owner should indicate an organization-level representative who has
1885           the accountability and authority to manage that risk. Risk ownership is a key information
1886           point that must be carefully considered and applied. The party designated as the risk
1887           owner must be continually knowledgeable about relevant risk conditions and must also
1888           have the accountability and authority to manage the risk. Since risk conditions may
1889           change as information is aggregated, responsibility and accountability should be
1890           periodically reviewed to ensure that the risk owner is the appropriate designee.
1891      •    The risk status for each aggregated ICT risk should use a consistent set of indicators.
1892           Status could be a simple indicator (e.g., open, closed, pending) or provide a more detailed
1893           explanation (e.g., “Risk accepted pending review by the Jan. 24 quarterly risk committee
1894           meeting”).
1895   While the methods and algorithms used will vary by enterprise, there should be a consistent risk
1896   aggregation strategy that is expressed as part of a policy within a given enterprise. Given the roll-
1897   up process, ICTRM – working in conjunction with enterprise risk managers – can include
1898   relevant risk policy statements, including requirements for registering risks, providing updates
1899   regularly, and communicating risk activities with enterprise managers and leadership.

1900   Through these procedures and policy statements, the various ICT risks are integrated into a
1901   comprehensive ERR. Note that the processes are described as a bottom-up integration, but real-

1902   world scenarios are likely to be interactive and iterative. Integration is important for gathering
1903   data and provides opportunities for analysis and adjustment.

1904   5.3       Adjusting Risk Responses

1905   Based on the evaluation, risk managers adjust their risk response approach. In some cases, the
1906   evaluation will provide evidence that risk response has been effective and is efficiently achieving
1907   the necessary level of risk treatment. In other cases, adjustments may be necessary to risk
1908   direction, risk treatment, or both.

1909   Aristotle is commonly credited with teaching that the whole is not the same as the sum of its
1910   parts. Such an observation highlights that the composite set of enterprise risk likelihood and
1911   impact is something besides and not necessarily equivalent to the sum of the risk analyses
1912   described in the various risk registers.

1913   As controls are applied throughout the enterprise, and as indicators are produced (and reported
1914   through metrics), various managers and leaders will consider the evaluation produced in the
1915   previous section. Given the resulting observations, several adjustments may be warranted, as
1916   described below.
1917         •    Adjust strategic direction – Based on collective results, senior leaders may update risk
1918              appetite statements to increase or decrease risk limits, including potentially adjusting
1919              specific quantitative direction. In addition to or in place of risk appetite adjustment, risk
1920              tolerance interpretation may similarly be adjusted to take advantage of opportunities or to
1921              reduce the likelihood or impact of harmful risks.
1922         •    Adjust risk responses – To address inconsistent responses to risks or to achieve a
1923              different result, leaders may choose to direct specific response actions to one or more risk
1924              scenarios. For example, if some organizations decided to mitigate a given risk type and
1925              others chose to accept it, risk managers may clarify which treatment is the appropriate
1926              response (or clarify the criteria by which that decision is made). As with previous
1927              discussions, this adjustment may either be to reduce the overall exposure by enacting a
1928              more stringent response, or to loosen restrictions to gain some advantage in exchange for
1929              a measured risk increase. Such changes may occur gradually to ensure sufficient ICTRM
1930              at all hierarchical levels.
1931         •    Adjust KPIs and KRIs – While the enterprise may adjust its specific direction or
1932              treatment of risk, the result of the evaluation will often be increased monitoring of the
1933              various conditions. Especially when conditions indicate broad variance in resulting
1934              metrics, managers may direct changes to the KPIs and KRIs that are monitored to gain
1935              better visibility. If changes to impact and likelihood cannot be adequately observed with
1936              the current indicators, then different (or additional) metrics may be justified. Increased
1937              frequency is indicated when impact and likelihood change more rapidly than the current
1938              monitoring interval.

1939   The adjustments described are intended to provide improvements that are directly based on the
1940   observations resulting from monitoring and evaluating risk results. Additional adjustments may
1941   be based on external direction, such as requirements by a regulator for increased risk

1942   management or new reporting criteria (e.g., prohibiting sharing or disclosing information from a
1943   smart utility meter about a customer’s usage without that customer’s consent).

1944   5.3.1   Factors Influencing Prioritization

1945   Numerous factors (e.g., financial loss, enterprise reputation, shareholder sentiment) influence
1946   priority and should be included in the enterprise risk strategy. An ICT risk that directly impacts
1947   the mission is likely to be a high priority, but many other considerations – such as agency or
1948   corporate reputation – may move a particular type of risk to the top of the list. Another
1949   consideration could occur if a corporate entity was preparing for a merger. The community has
1950   seen recent examples that have demonstrated that the discovery of an ICT risk can affect the
1951   valuation of an enterprise and subsequent negotiations. There may also be factors that are not
1952   directly related to risk but that could support organizational improvement (e.g., quick wins that
1953   build team confidence and gain momentum, risks related to an objective that leaders have
1954   established as a key priority). Priority values such as low, moderate, and high are often used as
1955   risk prioritization categories. This qualitative approach may be more limiting than quantitative
1956   analysis in that it is easier to sort a range of numerical values – even those that are relatively
1957   close – than it is to sort a list of risks marked “Very High.” In most enterprises, risk strategy
1958   should provide direction for both generalization (e.g., low, moderate, high) and more specific
1959   risk prioritization methods.

1960   5.3.2   ICT Risk Optimization

1961   A key goal of ERM/ICTRM coordination is to help enterprise stakeholders collect various risk
1962   data for decision support, monitoring, and communications. Several foundational definitions are
1963   relevant to properly prioritizing risk at each stage of the life cycle, including aggregating and
1964   prioritizing the risk register data discussed in this document:
1965      •    Risk aggregation – The combination of several risks into one risk to develop a more
1966           complete understanding of the overall risk [ISO73].
1967      •    Risk criteria – Terms of reference against which the significance of a risk is evaluated,
1968           such as organizational objectives, internal/external context, and mandatory requirements
1969           (e.g., standards, laws, policies) [ISO73].
1970      •    Risk optimization – A risk-related process to minimize negative and maximize positive
1971           consequences and their respective probabilities; risk optimization depends on risk
1972           criteria, including costs and legal requirements.

1973   The processes to aggregate, prioritize, and optimize risk will be different at each level of the
1974   enterprise, based on the risk criteria relevant to that level. At hierarchically lower levels in an
1975   enterprise, a certain amount of risk prioritization and treatment authority will have been
1976   delegated by the stated risk strategy guidance to streamline operations, but there might need to be
1977   additional collaboration based on observations by those performing oversight at higher levels.

1978   The methods used for optimizing risk are at the discretion of enterprise leaders and are often
1979   carried out by a risk leadership council or other risk governance body. Since capital and
1980   operating expense budgets for risk response are likely to be limited, each method must include a


                                                       52
       NIST SP 800-221 ipd                                                  ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION
       INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT                                             AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK


1981   process for how to respond to those scenarios when funding is not available. Some examples
1982   include:
1983       •   Fiscal optimization – A straightforward ranking of risks in descending order from most
1984           impactful to least. Risk managers tally the total risk response costs until funding is
1985           exhausted.
1986       •   Algorithmic optimization – The application of mathematical formulas to calculate the
1987           aggregate cost-benefit to the enterprise, given the estimated costs, in a purely mechanical
1988           approach.
1989       •   Operational optimization – The selection of those risks from the register that are most
1990           important to operations (based on leadership preferences, mission objectives, and
1991           stakeholder sentiment. Operational coordination depends upon an iterative
1992           communications cycle of risk reporting and analytics.
1993       •   Forced ranking optimization – Prioritizing risks in the way that will best use available
1994           resources to achieve the maximum benefit, given specific negative and positive
1995           consequences. Various business drivers and risk consequences have differing weights for
1996           developing a score, helping to move beyond the simplistic “threat multiplied by
1997           vulnerability” approach to build business objectives into that equation. Because these
1998           factors and their weights are based on business drivers, the factors should be defined by
1999           senior stakeholders but can be applied at all levels of the enterprise, subject to adjustment
2000           and refinement. Notably, while forced ranking is often the default method of
2001           optimization, the methods above are equally valid and beneficial to the enterprise.

2002   Ultimately, the optimization performed will likely be some combination of these methods. For
2003   some enterprises, risk optimization may also have a temporal factor. For example, risk owners
2004   might be willing to accept some risk scenarios to reduce expenses and boost profitability near the
2005   end of a fiscal quarter. Those same scenarios might be fully treated in more favorable financial
2006   circumstances. The goal of this report is not to advocate for any particular optimization process
2007   but rather to determine how optimization and prioritization will occur, since these decisions must
2008   precede risk response itself.

2009   Keep in mind that these management processes are iterative. Generally speaking, as risk
2010   information is aggregated throughout the enterprise, more information becomes available about
2011   risk commonalities. As risk managers observe similar types of positive and negative risk events,
2012   they can note contributing factors, highlight common opportunities, and gain a broader
2013   understanding of risk conditions. Because leaders and executives often have a broader view of
2014   factors that contribute to and result from various risks, including ICT risks, they can provide
2015   additional criteria to hierarchically lower levels to help sort and prioritize.

2016   5.3.3   ICT Risk Priorities at Each Enterprise Level

2017   In support of risk prioritization, as with ICT risks themselves, the ranking factors reflect the
2018   various strata of the enterprise. At the system level, the risk register reflects risk priorities related
2019   to particular systems and technologies. The organization level has priorities based on unique
2020   mission and business unit drivers. The enterprise has overarching ICT priorities that may not be
2021   the same as those at lower technical levels of abstraction, and they can be of varying priority

                                                          53

2022   when considered along with other enterprise risks. This balance is foundational to the concept
2023   of ICTRM as an input to ERM. While risks to institutional information and technology are
2024   critical parts of the enterprise and a primary focus of those charged with leading ICTRM,
2025   corporate officers and fiduciaries have a broad perspective and must balance the dozens of types
2026   of uncertainty in the enterprise risk universe. Bidirectional communication is critical, enabling
2027   senior leaders to convey strategy and direction while also enabling the system- and business-
2028   level managers to keep leadership informed.

2029   This process does not mean that every system-level risk decision should be elevated to top
2030   leadership, but rather that many risk decisions at the system and organization levels should be
2031   considered provisional and that leaders may subsequently recommend a different priority or
2032   approach based on their understanding of the aggregate impact to enterprise factors (e.g.,
2033   revenue, reputation, regulations, political).

2034   5.4     Enterprise Adjustments Based on ICT Risk Results

2035   In many organizations, ICT enables a flexible approach to achieving the enterprise mission and
2036   ensuring stakeholder value. ICT aspects evolve rapidly, as does the ICT risk landscape, so
2037   periodic adjustments to ICTRM are likely to be needed. The Federal Government has observed
2038   that additional technical capabilities are often needed to provide better services to citizens even
2039   as agencies recognize the increased risk presented by the underlying technology. Budgets may
2040   need to be allocated for this emerging technology, and strict guidance on how to manage risk to
2041   that ICT may be provided. Subsequently, results of previous iterations of the ICTRM cycle may
2042   support management decisions to adjust funding and risk parameters to achieve enterprise
2043   objectives.

2044   5.4.1    Adjustments to ICT Program Budget Allocation

2045   In both public- and private-sector enterprises, resource considerations are often described as a
2046   contributing factor for risk. To some extent, the claim that a program “needs more resources” is
2047   justifiable in that there are always more tools, personnel, and services that could be added.
2048   However, effective ICTRM requires a balance among risk optimization, resource optimization,
2049   and the value delivered by the technology being used to support mission objectives. If any of
2050   these three factors results in an imbalance, the solution is untenable. ICTRM informs the
2051   decisions around what areas receive priority within limited budget environments.

2052   The factors that have been discussed thus far can help in evaluating the extent to which the
2053   risk/resource balance is well-tuned. For example, because risk decisions are based on stakeholder
2054   needs (and the resulting enterprise and alignment objectives), ICT activities can be traced back to
2055   mission and business value.

2056   In theory, one can simply build a business case that demonstrates the value proposition of
2057   investment in ICT protection, detection, and response resources. In reality, it can be quite
2058   challenging to directly report the subsequent return on that investment. One way to address this
2059   challenge is by applying detailed risk assessment and reporting activities, such as those described
2060   in this document. Quantitative methods provide specific calculations that enable the risk
2061   practitioner to simulate risk likelihood and financial impact before and after implementation of


                                                        54
       NIST SP 800-221 ipd                                                ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION
       INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT                                           AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK


2062   the ICT improvement. This then drives a straightforward cost-benefit analysis regarding the
2063   resource investment.

2064   Another budgetary consideration results from the aggregation activities described above. As
2065   managers and leaders review the activities performed and the risk results provided, they may
2066   identify opportunities to centrally fund and operate risk management activities that had
2067   previously been the responsibility of individual system owners. It might make fiscal sense to
2068   combine particular activities to gain efficiencies or reduce duplication. As such opportunities
2069   become apparent during the review of risk register reports and results, leaders may make fiscal
2070   adjustments to gain an advantage.

2071   5.4.2   Adjustments to Risk Appetite and Risk Tolerance

2072   In addition to fiscal considerations, observations during the life cycle may also provide feedback
2073   regarding leaders’ risk criteria regarding risk appetite and tolerance. Figure 14 illustrates several
2074   key decision points, including:
2075      •    Risk acceptance at the system level – in selecting the appropriate controls for a given
2076           information system (or shared set of controls), is a risk already acceptable, given the
2077           applicable risk tolerance statements?
2078              o If it is not acceptable, the system owner has the option of applying additional risk
2079                response, either through risk sharing or through mitigation by various controls.
2080              o At times, risk cannot be brought within tolerance through any combination of
2081                controls, or the cost of the controls might be unreasonable for the system. In such
2082                a case, it is possible that there might be limited ability to adjust risk tolerance. In
2083                either case, discussion with decision makers is necessary to determine the
2084                appropriate course of action. That discussion might also support guidance for
2085                other enterprise systems facing similar risk scenarios.
2086      •    Additional decision points occur after the aggregation and integration of risk registers at
2087           various levels. As risk managers review the risk registers and RDRs, risk management
2088           results will be compared with stakeholder expectations. Based on the aggregated results,
2089           ICT risk managers might need to consider the following questions:
2090              o Is risk response consistent across various organizational structures and levels?
2091                Based on risk analysis, response, and monitoring results, risk managers may
2092                determine that additional guidance is needed to better achieve repeatable and
2093                reliable risk management activity. Adjustments in policy, procedure, staff
2094                training, and other governance components may be necessary to improve process
2095                maturity.
2096              o Has the risk environment evolved (perhaps due to changes in internal or external
2097                context, such as new regulations or customer agreements) to such an extent that
2098                risk direction or criteria need to be adjusted? If so, this provides an opportunity to
2099                repeat the cycle.

2100   In addition to these programmatic adjustments, specific risk treatment adjustments might be
2101   identified during continuous monitoring and ongoing assessment activities.

2102   5.4.3   Reviewing Whether Constraints Are Overly Stringent

2103   A challenge for senior managers is ensuring that their organizations are permitting enough risk,
2104   especially those risks that help realize benefits (e.g., opportunities, rewards). These introspective
2105   questions help those in risk governance roles identify whether their risk managers are using the
2106   risk governance tools and processes correctly or if those tools and processes need adjustment.

2107   It is rare that an opportunity can be realized without a negative risk. One might also question
2108   why anyone would embark on a circumstance that results in a negative risk without a
2109   corresponding opportunity that makes such an endeavor worthwhile. A basic objective of risk
2110   management programs is to identify individual negative risks so that they can be matched to their
2111   corresponding positive risks, enabling tradeoff analysis. With individual negative risks
2112   identified, the risk program is prepared to move ahead with a risk response should the tradeoff
2113   analysis render a decision to proceed with the positive risk.

2114   5.4.4   Adjustments to Priority

2115   A final program-level adjustment relates to enterprise priorities. ICT risk decisions flow from the
2116   enterprise mission and priorities. This is illustrated by Activity Point 1 in Figure 13 where senior
2117   leaders establish the mission and priorities, which drive strategic objectives and planning, which
2118   are then used to direct ICTRM activities. Subsequently, identified and assessed risks are
2119   recorded in the risk register in accordance with those priorities. The order in which risks are
2120   addressed, the direction of appropriate response, and even the agreement about which risks will
2121   be addressed all derive from the enterprise priorities. For this reason, a key enterprise activity
2122   will be a periodic review of those priorities and the effects that they have on ICTRM. Based on
2123   the results of such reviews, priorities might be adjusted or clarified to ensure continued

2178                        Notional Example of a Risk Detail Record (RDR)

2179   In support of an ICT risk register, a risk detail record, or RDR, enables communication of
2180   additional information. As shown in the following notional example, an RDR may help provide
2181   information regarding each risk, relevant stakeholders, date and schedule considerations, and
2182   planned activities.
