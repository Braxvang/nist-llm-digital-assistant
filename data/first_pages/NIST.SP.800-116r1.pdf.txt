This publication has been developed by NIST in accordance with its statutory responsibilities under the
Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) of 2014, 44 U.S.C. § 3551 et seq., Public Law
(P.L.) 113-283. NIST is responsible for developing information security standards and guidelines,
including minimum requirements for federal information systems, but such standards and guidelines shall
not apply to national security systems without the express approval of appropriate federal officials
exercising policy authority over such systems. This guideline is consistent with the requirements of the
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130.

Nothing in this publication should be taken to contradict the standards and guidelines made mandatory and
binding on federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory authority. Nor should these
guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the Secretary of Commerce,
Director of the OMB, or any other federal official. This publication may be used by nongovernmental
organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright in the United States. Attribution would,
however, be appreciated by NIST.

Certain commercial entities, equipment, or materials may be identified in this document in order to describe an
experimental procedure or concept adequately. Such identification is not intended to imply recommendation or
endorsement by NIST, nor is it intended to imply that the entities, materials, or equipment are necessarily the best
available for the purpose.
There may be references in this publication to other publications currently under development by NIST in accordance
with its assigned statutory responsibilities. The information in this publication, including concepts and methodologies,
may be used by federal agencies even before the completion of such companion publications. Thus, until each
publication is completed, current requirements, guidelines, and procedures, where they exist, remain operative. For
planning and transition purposes, Federal agencies may wish to closely follow the development of these new
publications by NIST.
Organizations are encouraged to review all draft publications during public comment periods and provide feedback to
NIST. Many NIST cybersecurity publications, other than the ones noted above, are available at

                                                                                                   •   The reader obtains information from the PIV Card that allows it to determine an identifier
                                                                                                       for the card and to determine the card’s Card Authentication certificate.

                                                                                                   •   The reader sends a challenge string to the PIV Card and requests an asymmetric operation
                                                                                                       in response.

                                                                                                   •   The card responds to the previously issued challenge by signing it using the Card
                                                                                                       Authentication private key.

                                                                                                   •   The relying system (reader or controller) uses the public key from the Card
                                                                                                       Authentication certificate to verify the response from the card.

                                                                                                   •   The relying system verifies that the Card Authentication certificate is valid.

                                                                                                   •   The relying system uses the identifier from the card to make an access control decision.

                                                                                               Each of the steps above presents an opportunity for optimization.
